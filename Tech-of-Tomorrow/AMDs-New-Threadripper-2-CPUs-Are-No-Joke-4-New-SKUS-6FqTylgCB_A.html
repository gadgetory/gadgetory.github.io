doesn't matter what company is releasing
new tech new tech is always really
exciting stuff and this time the
exciting news is coming from the AMD
side of things that's right now AMD has
been closing the gap with Intel for a
long time and with these new CPUs
they're really going to put Intel in the
squeeze for who's gonna have the best
performance at these price ranges
now the 2990 this is a killer CPU it's a
WX CPU run with the W stands for this is
their new workstation category CPUs
they're gonna have two of these CPUs
that are W X and then 2 X series CPUs
coming out we have the 2990 WX the 2970
WX the 2950 X and the 2920 X now these
are the four new CPUs that are coming
out all of them feature an amazing
amount of PCI lanes you're never going
to have to worry about running out of
PCI lanes ever again with them in fact I
don't think anyone's gonna be able put
that many video card your stuff and any
type of system ever on planet Earth and
if you're looking for an extreme beast
32 core 64 thread CPU at $17.99 so 1800
bucks for this CPU now that's really
crazy stuff now these aren't the Zen 2
architecture CPUs these are Zen plus I
was really hope we're gonna see some you
know Zen 2 stuff but that seems to be
still a little bit of delay on that but
this is n+ just like the latest CPUs
that we just saw that came out from AMD
earlier now all of these CPUs will also
run on the current x3 99 motherboards
that are out there but they'll feature
better DDR memory support so you're
gonna have lots of support from memory
huge amounts of PCI lanes and what's
really crazy is that in the multi
threaded single socket CPU division of
the Cinebench r15 they actually broke
the world record with a score of seven
thousand six hundred and eighteen which
was much higher than the previous score
which was fifty eight twenty eight so a
huge
difference there now this has taken from
like the current test running there
might maybe some other test data to show
something different but for right now
there the hailing king with the CPU in
this particular score so if you're a
person out there and you're a content
creator you know or you're a person who
develops games or you just want to
change your CPU and move things so one
thing really good I think about these
being able to be supported by the X 399
motherboards is the fact that you can
now use your existing gaming motherboard
if you have it change the CPU out and
all of a sudden you've got yourself a
killer workstation computer you can even
change the memory and do some stuff
there if you wanted to but you could
really change your computer a lot now
the entry-level thread number 29 20 acts
is $649 it features 12 cores 24 threads
the next CPU we see above that that's
going to be the 29 50 this one's $899
this is the particular one that I want
to get myself on it has 16 cores 32
threads the thread River 29 70 WX is
$1,299 it features 24 cores 48 threads
like I said the 2990 WX is 17 hundred
and $99 it has 32 cores 64 threads now
today is August 6th now pre-sales begin
right now on the 2990 WX so if you're
looking to get this CPU you can start
pre-ordering it today also the 2950 will
be available by the end of this month
says August 31st is the launch date and
then for the others we see later on the
year including a really late date of
October so if you want to wait for the
latest you know the really cheapest one
you'll be waiting a little longer but if
you're looking for like what I'm looking
for the 2950 which looks great to me you
know with 16 cores 32 threads that's the
perfect CPU for what I want to do I want
to build a really great workstation CPU
based on AMD stuff and then get the
matching the same type of price and same
type of lease performance things from
Intel and then really have a competition
between which one's better at you know
rendering stuff which means taking huge
files rendering them doing editing
inside of different programs
the speed of Hallett how it does these
things how it adds effects and even
probably just for shits and giggles some
games even though like I said before no
game out there is going to be taking you
no advantage of that I don't believe
there's any game that takes advantage
right now at 32 core CPU with 64 threads
it's just not really existing so if
you've got the cash and you're impatient
and you want a top-of-the-line
AMD workstation CPU and you want it now
whooping aid you can pre-order the
twenty nine ninety WX you can do that or
you can wait like me till the end of the
month and get the twenty nine fifty X I
think that's perfectly right in the
middle for me sixteen threads I mean 16
cores 32 threads that's a perfect CPU
for me I don't really think I'm gonna be
doing anything from that could fully
take advantage of 32 cores and 64
threads and then I don't know if I was
rendering big stuff for making movies
though and doing stuff like that like if
I was doing 3d graphics and doing huge
renderings I'm sure that CPU would be a
great value to me or anybody else out
there but we mainly just you know edit
video and an audio and do stuff like
that it'll be very interesting to see
how the CPU can handle itself especially
you getting something from the Intel
side of the fence at the same comparable
price range so I'm Eric you guys been
watching Tekken tomorrow like usual down
bullet like button will have all the
information for these CPUs so if you
want to preorder one or just check out
more information we'll have it down
there for you to check out so if you
guys aren't subscribed please subscribe
and if you don't see the videos inside
of your sub box it's because you don't
have the notifications button on so hey
make sure you have notifications on your
sub the channel and you'll see me in
your inbox peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
