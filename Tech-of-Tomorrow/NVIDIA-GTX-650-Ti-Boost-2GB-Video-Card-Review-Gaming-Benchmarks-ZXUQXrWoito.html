I'm yeah I'm trying to wake up you guys
can hear it my little voice urk a kind
of a froggy still there but it's 5:00
a.m. welcome to techyv tomorrow I'm mark
your host we're bringing you all the
tech all the time so what's on our tech
plate today well today we're going to be
feasting and taking a look at the brand
new card from the people from Nvidia
that's right Big Green is back with
another launch this launches for the
mid-range market the car we're going to
be talking about today is their new GTX
650 Ti boost edition card now what's
different this than the standard edition
650 TI card one of the biggest changes
is actually the memory interface and the
amount of RAM that sums on the standard
card so with that said let's actually
jump in and let's check out the latest
card from big green now let's actually
take a look at the aesthetics of the
card now take into mind that the card
that we're looking at today is the
reference based model but let's go ahead
and jump in first off let's take a
measuring we can see that the card size
is in at nine and a half inches
nice little lazy please are there see if
the card is one and a half inches in its
thickness and as far as the height of
the card goes the card is three and a
half inches in height so those the
dimension of the card you guys can see
it has a single black shroud single
blower type fan connection now let's go
ahead let's take a look at the side of
the card you guys can see it's a two
slot configuration on the bottom we see
the PCI 3.0 interface you can see that
on this card there is an sli interface
up here on top and this card will
actually do sli this is a difference
between its previous generation card
which we'll get to later we also see a
single six pin power connection here on
the back of the card you can see it has
a black PCB and there's actually a
little bit more room on the card then
actually you see the length of the card
is actually being determined by the
shroud and the fan the actual PCB the
card is much smaller the actual PCB of
the card without that shroud could be
seven inches now let's flip it around
and let's take a look at the rear i/o on
the row we see a single link DVI
connector on top dual link DVI and the
them standard HDMI and standard
DisplayPort connections okay folks so I
know that a lot of people are going to
want to know the comparisons between
this and the previous generation 650 T I
now want you guys to take note and we're
going to show you here in these next
shots I'll be showing you this reference
base card against the original reference
based GTX 650 Ti and I'll also be
showing you the two gigabyte version
from gigabyte which is a lot of ways
similar to this card of the memory
interface so let's jump in let's check
out those the reference card we're
looking at right now is the 650 Ti boots
it's the GK 106 it has 768 cuda cores a
base clock of 900 megahertz and a boost
clock of a thousand 33 megahertz comes
with 2 gigabytes of gddr5 with 192 bit
memory interface the memory clock is 6
gigahertz and it has a hundred and forty
two point two gigabytes of total memory
bandwidth and this card can also do sli
now let's take a look now at the
gigabyte 650 TI 2 gigabyte now this card
also has 768 cuda cores but it has a
base clock of ten hundred and thirty two
megahertz now there's no boost on this
at all but the base clock is pretty much
getting really close to what the boost
clock is of the new card the gigabyte
version also comes with 2 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory and it is a 128-bit memory
interface with a memory clock of 5.4
gigahertz 86.4 gigabytes of total memory
bandwidth no sli now on the reference
card that i originally got from nvidia
was a 1 gigabyte edition that was just
the GTX 650 TI 1 gigabyte it still had
768 cuda cores but it had a base clock
of 925 megahertz and no boost it also
had one gigabyte of gddr5 with 128-bit
memory interface it's memory clock and
total effective memory bandwidth though
are exactly the same as the gigabyte 2
gigabyte card now all these cards
feature adaptive vsync TxAA they all
have PhysX and another really cool thing
that's rolled out is the new geforce
experience if you guys haven't tried
this out you should check it out
basically you download this program and
it keeps all of your drivers and
everything
up-to-date on your computer so that's
pretty cool stuff you install it and so
they have to go search it tells you hey
a new drivers there man come check it
out and so you go grab it install it
easy money and easy to do so what you
guys can see is the biggest difference
here between the new 650 Ti boost and
the 650 Ti are just a few things on the
new car we see 192 bit memory interface
on all the older cards we see 128 bit
memory interface now this makes a big
difference the memory balance is much
higher which means you're going to get a
lot better results also having a 2
gigabyte card is going to be much faster
and much better with all the textures
and everything up then a 1 gigabyte card
so with that said let's jump into
testing like usual folks I'm still using
my red dawn back here if you guys
haven't seen about explains more about
it it's on the SRX buy EVGA it's got 2 5
2660 CPUs running at 2.2 gigahertz no
they don't bottleneck these cards 80
gigabytes around from the people over at
patriot thanks god peace bro
also David Kingston piece brother thank
you very much for the dual phone and 80
gigabyte drives that I have back there
in raid 0 there's their HyperX versions
that are really nice so I know it's kind
of overkill and I use a system for both
workstations stuff for editing and for
gaming and it works pretty good so with
that said let's rock out to the new
benchmark song and check out some scores
okay folks so there you see it the
brand-new card from the Green Team new
GeForce GTX 650 Ti
boost now this card obviously if you're
seeing all the scores everything you can
see that this card in its class is
pretty much the fastest thing out there
right now for this price range you know
it's the winner right now now the last
week's result that we see with the 77 90
they were you know pretty close but I
think the thing that really kills is
seventy seven ninety though is that it
only has one gigabyte remember I just
think that close the card nowadays one
gigabytes kinda like it's like you have
the very bottom of the heat from
mid-level card I think two gigabytes is
now that three gigabytes is for a better
card six gigabytes for the a sticker of
the bunch at this moment in time so you
guys can see this cards going to be
about a hundred and seventy nine dollars
there'll be different models by
different makers once again to squeeze
the reference edition cards from Nvidia
you know you know everybody out there is
going to have their own cooling their
own special stuff you see all the
manufactures put on stuff saying hey
check out mine mine's the best you guys
know it is I just works out better for
us as the Nu now we showed you guys half
of the scores in this we have the other
half of the full written review we kind
of skim things over the video review for
you guys want the full in depth review
please check it out on our website
www.weg.net like button shown that you
appreciate us here and hey stay sub that
drawl I look like five or five of them
were to film this thing for you
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
