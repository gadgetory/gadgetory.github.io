again at Ecco tomorrow once again we're
bringing you a technology video at
another cool location this time we're at
a restaurant called the ranch house
sitting in the corner Shh no one notices
we even asked they turn the country
music down because man as was
rocking what are we doing here today
we're today we're gonna show you guys
something really cool now smartwatches
wearable tech they're all out of the
market everywhere now the product you
have in front of me it's the phosphor
touch time now this thing's not quite a
SmartWatch but it is a smarter watch
than your standard watch for one thing
it's got a completely digital user
interface so the user can sit there
click on the watch do it ever they want
do it all by touch and by a touchscreen
as well unlike your old traditional
stuff so with that said let's take a
close-up of this thing see what it's all
about and see why Foster's trying to
push this on you the capacitive touch
screen as well as contributing to the
name also allows a smart watch like UI
to be employed switching between the top
level screens is accomplished by a swipe
across the screen to either the right or
the left app selection is through a tap
on the screen and switching through
views in each individual application is
accomplished with either an upwards or
downwards swipes there's quite a lot
here more than you might think a lot of
different things stop watches you have
reminders calendar type dates world time
all your settings even a control for
lunar and obviously a calculator for
those people whose life needs to add up
to something this is pretty interesting
stuff now although it doesn't do
anything automatically like it does not
connect to the internet it doesn't go
out to anywhere and automatically update
itself you do everything manual it's
still a lot better than a standard watch
and everything's done through a touch
phase user interface alright folks so
there you have it the phosphor touch
time now is this thing truly a
SmartWatch I don't think it's really a
SmartWatch it's a smarter what's in your
standard watch that's for sure but to me
a SmartWatch would be something that
actually does things automatically
updates connects the internet and stuff
like that now
the market for this is going to be kind
of weird in today's technological market
I mean think about it this came out 10
years ago I'd be like Foss for you guys
are the baddest-ass mofos on the planet
this thing is just like super jumping
off the hoop amazing but the thing is
now a lot of people have phones and most
phones that come out nowadays have a lot
more features they have everything it's
in this watch and a lot more now a lot
more than what I see yeah you know and
the screen on this is pretty cool though
you guys can see I'm now wearing it I
got it all set up to the time and all
that stuff checked it out and I mean
it's kind of distributed me that you can
actually go on here though and you can
like see the lunar moon so I mean that's
kind of weird I don't know how they're
doing that no no maybe it's according to
a calendar date that's been preset
somewhere because if it's not going out
and actually gathering this information
some more how is it telling me what the
moon is doing or is there a man on the
moon sending that information is just
going for what kind of check with the
people on that one but like I said if
this would have come out 10 years ago it
really would have been the shizmik in
technology as is right now I think
there's some people that'll like this
because for one thing if you wanna have
a bunch of scheduling and stuff really
easy it's pretty cool you can go on
their schedule or self reminders you can
schedule an alarm clock to wake yourself
up in the morning you can go to the gym
you can set the thing for like a thing
and time yourself for 10 minutes you
know there's all kinds of different
application you can do you can use a
calculator and obviously tells you the
time world time so you can know what's
going on you know what time it is it
Perry when you're eating your burger in
LA I mean yeah that's pretty cool stuff
but I personally I'm not trying to beat
up on foster on this at whatsoever is I
don't really know anybody who would
actually go out and buy this just for
those features because pretty much
everybody I know here in the United
States has a really good phone phones
right here like that's like the hot
thing you know it's like you know you're
you have a cool phone you're the cool
kid yond and do you say I've bought the
cou fun
have you seen mine you know it's like
the biggest you know wanky waving
contest around it seems like to me and
everybody's got a good phone but it's a
great idea now if phosphor sticks this
idea and they keep implementing more
stuff and do it then I think it will
grow like the things only a hundred and
fifty nine dollars it looks good it's
actually very very comfortable I'm
wearing it here and I have kind of a
small you know watch collection I don't
really wear watches all that much thank
you I'll be honest I probably won't wear
this that much but the thing is it will
go into my collection and I've got some
pretty cool ones here some close-ups
check this one out this one's actually
pretty cool in the front it's got this
in the back it's got a counterweight
it's kind of a really cool watch and
then I got this alone that I got for
Christmas last year
so the Kenneth Cole thing now these are
all traditional which is kind of in a
way why showed me you guys - these are
traditional watches now obviously this
watch is the next evolution past this I
will give phosphor that this is
definitely the next evolution from that
pretty cool stuff though I mean these
are interesting but obviously these are
old-school now the one that I actually
do work quite a bit is the one that it's
uh got for Christmas from my friend from
TLD and this this one right here because
obviously will look it's a Gibson watch
I mean come on Gibson me rock and roll
you know so I wear this one quite a bit
you guys seen it before but I like this
it's very cool thing for what it is now
next couple days I got this though so
this is the gear 2 now I believe this is
actually more of a true SmartWatch but
the price on this compared to this is a
leap and a jump now this thing doesn't
work as a standalone either it actually
works via through your phone so for your
node or through your s whatever series
you have this thing works thought where
this thing's totally standalone so I
want to hear your guys opinions how many
of you guys out there would buy this for
the hundred and thirty dollar price
range I want you to be honest and give
your pins because the people at phosphor
they just built this company up but
actually there are a few very positive
things I'm sorry to ramble on guys I
need you guys hate a lot of talking
these guys had a startup program they
were only supposed to get 50k they
actually got double that they were able
to launch everything get this product to
market and everything so in that way
they are very much a success story as
far as a Kickstarter program goes so I
give these guys a lot of credit I want
to hear what you guys think and if you
guys would like to win one leave
comments down below because I think
these guys would be more than willing to
give one to one even lucky folks so let
it snow thanks for watching techni
tomorrow all the information about this
will be down below they have a lot of
different series starting out at like
$99 going up this is only one of the
series I think we saw three or four they
come in all kinds of different shapes
sizes and colors honestly they do down
below down below like button which I
know you guys are going to go not Bruce
Lee style this time no I want you guys
to Sugar Ray Robinson this one I want
you to Sugar Ray that thing should hang
down take it down you guys don't want
this stuff it's down there in the
description so I'm Elric thanks for
watching hope it didn't bore you too
much just I'm you know I'm trying to
find a lot of good and different things
for by the way you can see a little
phosphorous there on the side now if
only had a laser that could press right
here and just shoot a laser beam out and
get rid of my enemies</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
