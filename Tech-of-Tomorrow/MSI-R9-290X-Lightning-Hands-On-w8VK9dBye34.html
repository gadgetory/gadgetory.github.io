back to tech of tomorrow continuing our
coverage of CES 2014 we've made it over
to ms I've with mark Tran and they've
got something incredibly awesome you
guys all know the Lightning series of
cards it's the most badass high-end
cards that they make over at MSI now
they're gonna have the 290 X version and
this thing's gonna kick some serious ass
so mark tell us about this new bad-boy
and some of the things it's going to do
so what we have here is the r9 290x
lightning it's a new addition to our
Lightning series and we changed we made
up quite a few changes first of all one
of the most notable changes that it
actually reduced thicker than the usual
lightning cards the reason why we did
that we expanded the fan for the
heatsink so better air flows but we also
removed it a couple of heat pipes
because super pipes actually was kind of
too heavy so we move some commonly a
couple of that super pipes so it'll be a
lot more better air flows and more heat
do you think the lady gamers appreciate
them your thickness of the card um I
don't know you know girls like big
things I'm just know all right folks now
as far as power goes this thing is going
to be pretty unlimited actually as
options past normal like most cards only
have the two eight pin power connectors
but with this you have an additional six
pin to get even more power to the card
for extreme overclocking right yes so
the six pin is actually optional you
don't need to but definitely you want
since AMD don't have a cap on this card
so that gives you the ability to do you
know maybe you want to do some L into
cooling in it and do some extreme
overclocking maybe brick some world
record this will be the perfect card for
you to do that there's lots of other
options on here like here on the end you
have all of your V core connections
right here so you can Wayne you to
monitor all your voltage of your card
and everything when you're doing ln2 and
stuff like that you want to make sure
that you're able to do that and this
card is actually designed to be able to
work on a workstation type environment
correct
correct now the only thing I've ever
noticed through these cards they work
awesome
like the 780 was awesome the 780ti is
awesome the only thing about this this
little fan right here can sometimes get
loud but it also keeps your card amazing
when they cool so it's kind of crazy all
the unique thing about this of course is
that each this fan and these two fan has
their own controller that we have an
able in their software that it comes
with the video card so it has on Fat
Controller can you do it through
afterburner afterburner not right now
but we have own software that's included
into the 780 I mean right on about that
are 90 to 90 lightning so but she's also
but you can overclock this still with it
with the with the afterburner software
correct yes but if you want to tinker
with in the other stuff you actually
have your own software GUI to do that
right yeah definitely right on folks so
here you have it new 290x lightning
gonna be coming to your town to kick ass
very soon so look for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
