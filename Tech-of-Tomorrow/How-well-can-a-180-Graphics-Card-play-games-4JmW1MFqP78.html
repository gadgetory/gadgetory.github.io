edition of tech of tomorrow now today we
have something brand-new from people
over at Nvidia this is basically the
Maxwell powered gtx 950 now this is a
very very entry-level car it's geared
totally for mobile gaming you guys might
MOBA game held mobile gaming mobile
gaming is basically multiplayer online
battle arena League of Legends dota 2
all those type of games and we all know
those type of games don't take the most
massive video card in the world to play
and so therefore those people want to
play those type of games aren't going to
want to spend the big bucks involved
getting a 980 I in those type of cards
and so hence this card is born there are
actually 30 million people out there
that play these type of games and NVIDIA
is basically claiming that this is the
new MOBA King now this thing's got 768
cuda cores not too many but 768 still ok
right yeah yeah alright 2 gigabytes of
RAM
128 gigabyte memory controller that's
pretty much the base specs this thing
comes with some really good key features
we'll get into those if you're the
unboxing basically for input lag and all
that stuff if your mouse and keyboard
this card offers better performance than
that because you guys all know lag
between your mouse your keyboard could
cause you to get death especially in
some games a little second it could be
everything and they've also introduced a
new pipeline to make this card more
efficient in those type of games so with
that said though let's first let's just
real quick take a look at the Box like
obviously one at the front of the box we
got the back of the box and by the way
guys this is the amp edition of the card
so there's a boost clock and a base
clock for the reference one this one's
actually a much higher so we'll get that
also but let's just go ahead and let's
take the cap off now if you guys know
about the amp Edition these things have
a lot of cool things they have an
armored exoskeleton which is really
really cool they have their patented
fans they have their firestorm
technology for doing all the
overclocking there's a lot of cool
things about about these guys so it's
real quick let's just pop the cap here's
what comes inside the other box you got
much from there we got new
yeah here we got the driver CD case
badge quick installation guide hope if
you buy this you know what the hell
you're doing just another little thing
give you some advertisement for them
then basically says uh freeze tech
breeze tech technology now freeze tech
is basically just when you know your car
is not being overworked it totally just
stops silent mode other companies do it
everybody has their own name that's
these guys it's name they also get a a
dual molex to 6-pin power connector so
it's a single six pin power connector to
your VGA adapter nobody uses this by the
way the recommended power requirements
of this card are three and fifty watt
power supply very low power requirements
so let's pop it out of the box we have
dvi-i DVID main DisplayPort and HDMI
it's HDMI war was HDMI 2.0 and
DisplayPort 1.2 so would it start with
the rear i/o easy don't do that you
better start with that earliest time
well flip around the top see there are
two fans there technology the card is
actually quite small so it'll fit in a
lot of small systems which is really
good a lot of people these days are
pushing for smaller systems this card
will definitely make the grade so you
guys can see that underneath it these
guys also have a dual six millimeter
heat pipe running through the card so
that's keeping it cool the backsides
really got nothing to it whatsoever but
the backside has what we all love the
exo-armor if you guys going oh my god
you're making me cringe as I smack the
back the card get a pair of
balls seriously like it's not gonna hurt
the car to hit the back of the car you
guys need to get a pair man that's just
ridiculous
you know I had seen the commentary oh my
god you're making me cringe if you hit
the back of the car what do you think
they call it an EXO Armour for what does
exo-armor mean it's like an exoskeleton
for tough stuff ain't gonna hurt it
single SLI finger and that's pretty much
the card itself I'm not gonna go into a
whole lot of great detail earlier today
like I said some of the big features
about this car I'll talk about just real
quick like I said earlier another thing
team green is pushing with this release
is improved input latency and if you
don't know what that is it means at the
time it takes for your PC to recognize
your keyboard and mouse commands and the
lower the latency the faster the
response time may be more accurate
gameplay
according to some leading eSport folks
responsiveness can be the difference
between losing and winning the game
I guess milliseconds do count more than
we think the gtx 950 also offers a new
pipeline for processing your games
graphics isms our pipeline such that
successive frames can also be processed
or rendered in parallel in time sliced
fashion and a buffer is inserted between
each of these frames by cutting down the
pre buffer to just one frame instead of
two on the gtx 950 it substantially
reduces input latency which leads to
higher performance for mobile gamers I'm
sure the engineers have all kinds of
technical details that go behind all
this but you guys the layman in the
gaming this is like hey it's just more
technical words how does this damn card
game well we'll get into that real quick
let's just real quick tell you how big
the card is because I know some people
do care about that so the amp Edition
card side is then like this as far as
inches goes it's 8.9 by four point three
eight by one point three nine and for
the rest of the world that's 208
millimeters 511 by twenty five
millimeters by thirty five point three
millimeters the base clock on a
reference card from Nvidia is a thousand
24 with a boost clock of 1188 but the
app Edition comes clocked with a base of
twelve hundred three and a boost clock
of fourteen hundred and five megahertz
so that's a pretty significant boost for
such a little card now with that said
let's just real quick take a look at our
test station which includes an i7 4770k
bytes of RAM and for our storage we have
a Western Digital black drive and
obviously all the games and the drivers
that were testing list we always use the
very latest drivers that are available
by the companies so have no fears there
and with that said well let's jump in
let's check out those benchmarks and
let's see how this card
alright so there you guys have it now I
know a lot of people out there is always
asking like why are you guys doing some
of these tests on medium and high it's
just the way the ball bounce we have a
lot of testing we've been running for a
long time and some of the video cards
back in the day that we tested wouldn't
actually test these games that they're
full-blown capacity so that's the reason
we have that but now that Windows 10
come out and DirectX 12 s here like I
said before my previous videos I'll be
changing the test station over to a
completely new test station now
obviously we didn't do a whole bunch of
so-called moba testing because we're not
big mobile games over here I'm a big
first-person shooter and I think most of
us are so we want to ask you guys a
question right off the bat because
captain Kevin has said if you guys would
really like to see a dedicated review
based on mobile with this card he'll
come back over here to check on Omar and
he'll do that video for us so if you
guys want to see Kevin come over here
and do a video strictly on mobile on
this gtx 950 ab edition card
hey please leave the comment down below
with the hashtag up hey MOBA testing and
we'll do it for you we love you folks so
also I have some other good news for you
folks check this out one lucky winner
gets to win one of these for himself
that's right and it's very easy to win
just leave a comment down below make
sure your sub to take you tomorrow and
if you guys would like to I'm sure the
people over at ZOTAC would really
appreciate it if you go over and just
leave some time a comment on their
Facebook page it'll also increase your
chance of winning because we're gonna
randomly pick from those people next
Friday so good news on that so what do
you guys think I mean this card's coming
to market and really about 150 to 160
dollars so it's not a very expensive
investment whatsoever and for those
people out there who play that type of
game obviously since you guys can see
it's playing all these other games
playing MOBA games it's kind of kind of
like you know trying to eat soft
spaghetti it'll be really easy for the
card to do it's not gonna strain it a
lot 768 CUDA cores I know seems a little
bit low but hey this thing seems to be
doing pretty good for its price range I
think that this card is nice and if
you're under $200 and you're looking for
a great card hey you might want to
consider the gtx 950 obviously if you're
playing first-person shooter games and
all that kind of stuff this card's
probably not gonna custom mustard it's
gonna be down to bottom of the barrel
but those who play MOBA
I think you're in baby so alright that
wraps up today's video like usual folks
all the information about this will be
down below that like but which will put
you go Jackie Chan style on and leave us
a comment if you're interested in buying
one of these are getting more
information we'll have links down there
all below to this stuff so I'm Miller
you're watching ticker tomorrow rock Don
we'll see you back here on Sunday we've
got another video card coming up this
time the Asus GTX 980 TI Strix Edition
which you've been asking for it see you
on Sunday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
