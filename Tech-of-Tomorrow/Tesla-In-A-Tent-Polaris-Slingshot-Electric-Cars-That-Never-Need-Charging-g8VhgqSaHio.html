tech of tomorrow served up for your
brain lunch here on Sunday that's right
so by now I would think that everybody
out there has heard of Tesla no I'm not
talking about the guy who amend
electricity and then got boned by Edison
and no I'm not talking about the rock
band either I'm talking about the
company that manufactures vehicles cars
right now but Elon Musk is a real
brainchild and he's been making some
really killer stuff here in California
now the story about this is though is
that since last year he's been supposed
to been making 5,000 cars per week and
he was supposed to actually hit this
goal sometime you know at in the end of
2017 we'll still were in the middle of
2018 and he still hasn't met that goal
so his investors was like hey Elon we
love you but where's our damn money son
because obviously that goal is not being
met now they're making money but they're
not making as much money as they should
so whenever things get in a pinch
Elon always comes up with some kind of
crazy solution to fix things and keep
the ball rolling and this time once
again he's pulled a rabbit out of his
hat that's right so what he did is
instead of building a giant building and
brand new facility to make another line
he did something very very creative
he hired a company that he's worked with
before and they built him this giant
tent in the parking lot of the company
yeah so I guess parking spaces are
probably a little limited now over at
the company but they've built this giant
tent now check this thing out it's like
as big as two and a half football fields
that's right so you could put two
football games going on at the same time
in there that'd be kind of interesting
thing to do
two football games going on at the same
time and then a half a game Oh we'll
call that sucker oh just kidding my
English mates but so this guy's really
inventive and this line is something
very interesting now how many more cars
it's actually going to be producing
we're not going to know quite yet
but things that we do know is that this
line is meant for doing a lot of
different customs stuff so inside the
factory you know it's a prebuilt
building everything's got to be where
it's at the robots and everything that
are in there working have to stay where
they're at but with this line they can
do something much more creative they can
do custom work that they can't do inside
of there so not only can they get the
cars out from the paint shop bring them
on in there and finish them up and get
them ready to sell they can also do
custom work and another thing they have
a new twin-engine car coming up yeah
with two engines in it so one engine
will be your standard the other engine
will be four-wheel-drive and this will
actually be being finished inside of
this particular building along with a
lot of different custom stuff that he's
doing there so once again this guy is
pulled a rabbit from his hat thought out
of the box and did something that really
most people probably wouldn't think of
and the thing is is he says it's a lot
more flexible and stuff than the ones
that are actually inside the building so
if this works out it'll be crazy because
he applied for all the rights to do all
this stuff like back in June and we're
barely you know in July and he's already
got this up and going and the company
that he's worked with this is I believe
like the third different project they've
done with him and this thing is just
incredible talk about thinking outside
of the box
Elon Musk got it man I love him hate him
the guy definitely is a thinker who
likes to get stuff done and come on who
wouldn't like to build cars in their
parking lot now next up is something
kind of crazy as well now there's a
company called Polaris and they make all
kinds of off-road vehicles including
this series called the slingshot
now the slingshot is really crazy
because it's kind of a modified
motorcycle that has three wheels you
have two wheels actually in the front
and a single wheel in the back now this
is not for driving around town just
cruising around this is for really sport
enthusiasts because inside it's rumoured
not to be really too comfortable now
some of these are street-legal but
honestly they're not made for the street
there's some crazy things about this
vehicle now for one thing instead of
being like your normal built car that's
built for come
and built for all these other things you
know let her like radios and all this
other stuff you do in your car to be
chill in your car this is completely
stripped out not like that whatsoever
there's a roll cage inside inside is
like kind of kind of cramped and not
really super comfortable but then again
this is meant for sports stuff like this
is for the person who wants to have the
most bitchiness cool thing around now
the only problem with these things they
are pretty pricey as well but to me they
also sound a little bit kind of
dangerous because you're five inches
from the ground when you're riding in a
slingshot no joke five inches from the
ground now to me five inches from the
ground means that if there's anything
sticking up from the ground whatsoever
well it's going to stick into that car
at five inches now although this may
sound really cool you know in theory
driving down the rodeo at five inches
from the ground which is probably as low
as you're ever going to get that alone
to me sounds a little bit iffy and
probably why they're not really geared
to be used you know as a normal street
vehicle however if you're looking for
something that's totally crazy and just
want to check out some of these models
just for the eye candy you've got to
check out their website and check out
these different models of these things
because just visually alone checking
them out and they look like something
from the future honestly when you see
them up close I've saw one the other
date is driving down my street now is
blown I was like whoa holy crap that
thing's incredible looking and they
really are really incredible looking I
wish I could actually have a chance to
go and sit in one and check one out I
don't know if I really want to go
driving around in one on the streets but
that may be interesting but honestly if
you want to just see something that is
definitely like pushing towards tech of
tomorrow and just looks really cool
we'll have a link to a story below and a
link to their website where you guys can
check out more information about this
and see if that's something you'd be
into honestly if I had the cash I'd have
one now this next story is about a dude
named sang-gyu Lonnie who also
definitely thinks outside of the box
this is definitely chuck of tomorrow so
check it out this guy may even have
technology that totally surpasses Tesla
I said don't throw anything at me but
yeah it's very possible now this guy's
claiming that he now can make a car that
never needs to charge ever that once it
gets up and going that's it you're good
to go
end the line now something totally
different now a lot of information about
this is being withheld when I can see
why because this is like this is
something that sounds so incredible that
it's either like completely going to
revolutionize things or turn to be a
story river he's like alright this guy
was completely biessing us all along the
way the stupid me for believing it but
here's what it is so check it out he's
saying that he's taking radio waves
applying them to a chemical and making
that an energy source that's right now
how exactly it's done all that other
stuff that's kind of trippy so I wonder
if like if he puts on a heavy metal
since it's rocking music if it produces
more ways and therefore more energy
therefore heavily heavy heavy metal
music will revolutionize the world rock
on my brother's of rock I'm just kidding
but this is a really crazy story and
this guy's from Zimbabwe and they
obviously don't have a whole lot of
different things going on over there so
if this guy could get this out and do it
it would be very very really cool but
they also have some laws in America yes
in America that claim that the
government under certain circumstances
can shut somebody's patent down when you
apply for a patent and say it's
unhealthy for society now how many times
has this probably happened in the past
god only knows but if they determine
that somehow or another you know what
he's doing is detrimental to the public
they'll try to shut him down so his
product never sees the light of day and
what I think is really interesting is
that he talks about gel packs now if you
guys véra watched Star Trek The Next
Generation almost all of their energy
and their ship came from these gel packs
so I wonder you know if homeboys the
Star Trek fanatic and saw this and was
like whoa I can do that I don't know I'm
just speculating but if he can really
come up with something that's like that
it will really piss off the gas company
you know they will be pissed they will
be coming with armies lawyers well I
guess their frickin army is their
lawyers these days so they'll be coming
with their lawyers you know who are
basically the barbarians of the future
to try to sue this guy and take lawsuits
against him because something like that
could really shift the balance of power
now if this could be made cheaply think
about that pretty much everybody in the
world at that point would never have to
use fossil fuels ever again that means
no more digging in the ground no more
fracking all kinds of things that would
be great to humans right to humans so
isn't it wouldn't be really honestly
ironic really ironic if they said that
oh yeah this guy's gonna do something to
harm humanity right because what he
could do could really change humanity do
we would have to rely on fossil fuels
whatsoever but the whole thing is the
power shift from the oil companies who
rule and have all this money to do
whatever they want would be done with
and one thing I like about this idea and
I'm I'm rooting for you homie honestly
if you ever get a chance to see our
channel know that we are rooting for you
because just because of the Valdez and
all these oil spills where they kill all
these animals and pollute our nature
pollute our ocean making it so that we
can't even really swimming it or fishing
it anymore like they're destroying the
sea and I don't like that whatsoever I'm
totally into planet conservation so I
say yes give us renewable energy then
when you buy a car you never have to
worry about ever bang gas ever again it
just runs it's a great smart idea I
really hope it happens now we'll have
links to all the different articles and
information about all stuff below so if
you want to check out Tesla's tent in
the parking lot you can do that if you
want to check out all the stuff on the
other site that we talked about those
killer little cars we'll check that out
and if you want to check out this guy
and check out what he has to say we'll
have a link to that as well
thanks for watching we'll see you guys
