Oh tomorrow Elric fairest your host now
you guys have asked for it so we're
gonna bring it to you
Max Payne 3 goodness in 76 80 by 1440
with everything set - it's extremely
highest parameters in the background you
guys can see I have DirectX 11 engaged
we have it full screen you guys can see
the resolution in eyefinity mode I
actually think we did a really
bang-up job setting the monitors up
right now you can barely notice the
bezel around them when you're looking at
all three playing the game it's pretty
damn bitchin so this time we took and we
played level 1 of the arcade mode so
let's jump in let's see how badass Max
Payne 3 is on three monitors at 76 80 by
1440 rockin
that was the boss lady only this time
she wasn't calling for more liquor or
cocktail
wait up in stupidity drunkenness risks
trying to say
they'll run real I don't know Thanks
fine
I imagine the elevator doors opening to
a firing squad of muzzles far as I could
see it the one thing my plan had going
was that no one else would be stupid
enough to pawn this
so there you guys have it man I hope you
dig it as much as I do this games really
fun at that resolution I have to mainly
worried about my mouse sensitivity
before I have my mouse so sensitive
every time I clicked it the mouse was
like way over in the corner way over in
the corner in here I really had to roll
back on how much dpi I was using on my
mouse to be able to actually do a head
shots it was kind of a bitch so I hope
you guys enjoyed if you guys liked this
kind of video let us know in the
comments below and we'll keep doing it
if not tell them they suck and
we won't do them but let's hear from you
and rockin hope you guys like the 25k
contest look for the 30k coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
