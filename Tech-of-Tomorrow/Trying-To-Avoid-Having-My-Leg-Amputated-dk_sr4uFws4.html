you guys are gonna know that for a few
days right now are not gonna be able to
produce any videos my health is started
giving me issues again for you people
out there people with diabetes in your
family you might know what a foot ulcer
is well I basically have a basically a
whole my foot it's about this big around
now and it's gotten infected and I'm
trying to fight the infection but the
medicine they're giving me to fight the
infection is really making me sick I've
actually become so familiar with with my
toilet I could probably give it to you
detail by detail blindfold it's just
getting ridiculous I haven't been able
to hold any food down for the last three
days and it just seems to be getting
worse I'm gonna back off of that stuff
this weekend and hopefully next week by
Monday we'll be you know back in
business and doing things again but
tough for this weekend's I've I just
have to take a few days off I mean it's
been really rocky around here right in
the middle of the stupid Nvidia launch
Jesus falls down the fucking stairs and
almost breaks as a leg so he's got to
take days off so our testing time was
like literally like literally like that
much of testing time now for some reason
our system here but go ahead and go if
you know to be here now our testing
system are trying to SL I am not working
whatsoever they tell me it's a bad
bridge I've tried a couple different
bridges I give up on that particular
system I'm gonna have Anthony come out
here and build another test system
although at this point I'm almost like
feeling like Doom is Li tests are almost
a waste of time because other people
have done it but if you guys really want
to see my particular results for my fans
you let me know and I'll spend the time
to make sure I can get that stuff going
for you guys next week I do have a lot
of interesting stuff coming to the table
especially for you people out there who
do music and streaming and stuff like
that I've got some really interesting
products coming out next week um for you
guys out there in the United States who
are musicians and stuff you might have
heard of this place called Sweetwater
Sweetwater's a store they do music and
all kinds of stuff and they saw my
channel and saw was a customer and they
were like hey would you like to like
unbox and check out some of our products
and like my guess would have been so
loud it would have shattered the windows
of the Empire State Building because I
was like Sweetwater music gear but yeah
really was I was so excited to get it
and that's kinda it's been driving
because I know there's a good stuff
coming up but just right now this whole
my foot so bad that I can't hold really
any food down I've been up in my bed all
day long every
minutes I into the bathroom throwing up
and even using the bathroom started to
get painful I don't know what the heck
is going on but I'm gonna cut back on
all of those antibiotics this weekend
and just see if I can get my health back
up I don't if you guys out there know
antibiotics they really mess your
stomach up they do a number on it and I
didn't even put it in a good shirt I'm
and I threw on my old shirt from Swift
Tech which I've literally had for like
10 years we used to work with these guys
like hand and hand back in the day but
as we all grown older and separated
things change but I didn't put on a
decent t-shirt today the dog he's just
moon with his head down all day long
good ok what's going on around here why
won't this do got a bed
why isn't he feeding me why is he doing
a damn thing for me um I just I really
couldn't move I forced myself finally if
I stayed in bed for like a half an hour
I finally stopped throwing I'm like ok
I'll run downstairs and at least make a
video and let people know exactly what's
going on so that's really what's going
on so if you don't see videos on the
channel for the next two days there's no
need for alarm we're not going out of
business we're not going anywhere like
that Elle rumor starts spreading real
fast on YouTube oh my god you seen our
case it released a video in a couple
days we finally killed him I think it's
what they want to do they want to kill
me I mean YouTube I know has tried to
kill me not just me but anybody like me
anybody who's independent free and is
doing their own thing
YouTube has literally tried to kill us
which is honestly just a bunch of
bullshit because people like me and the
people who started this stuff doing it
at home and the people that they built
their backs off of so pretty much what
they did just like any fucked up
corporation did they used us
I have 600,000 subscribers almost and my
videos get only 2000 hits does that make
any sense to you think about it even if
I was only getting a percent of a
percent the numbers would be much higher
so all those years they spent for me you
know going oh hey get sub subs will make
your channel I do this is a waste of my
time Lyons has talked about this other
youtubers have talked about they
completely wasted our time so they
basically used us screwed us in the ass
and when they got what they wanted well
they're like hey you know we don't
really need these channels anymore but
these channels over here that that are
making us a lot of money yeah sure will
help those channels out which is really
unfair so instead of helping the little
guy doll the underdog on YouTube is
being kicked sand in the face and being
shoved down into the dirt and that's
what's really happening here I'm
struggling survivor we barely make it
the money is like almost completely
literally I'm not even joking how would
you like to make twenty videos in a
month and get paid $700 think about it
it sucks even adds to my health to them
just like wow what am I even doing here
I work all this time and all you paid
this much money luckily we get those
roller video ads some of you guys get
all pissed off and go why are you doing
that those guys actually pay and I do
have rent to pay and I have health
issues so what am I supposed to do here
not take any advertisement from anybody
whatsoever fire Jesus and just go out of
business and up in some retirement home
somewhere I mean really is that what
people really expect because I'm not
that kind of person I'll be coming back
here when they have to tape my leg which
is where this is going to be going I'm
gonna end up losing my leg and even when
I lose my leg if I can still figure out
a way to survive on YouTube and keep
this going I'm gonna keep going because
I have a lot of loyal fans and a lot of
loyal friends that I've been doing this
with for a very very long time so like I
said I'm not on the channel for a few
days don't freak out I'm just sick and
you just need to take a deep breath and
recover I ain't a youngster anymore I'm
not exactly old yet but I'm somewhere in
that fine line I'll see you guys back on
the channel there is really cool stuff
including a nice giveaway that's coming
up once again from the people over at
creative I think you guys like this a
really nice DAC product they have out so
stay tuned to the channel because we
will be back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
