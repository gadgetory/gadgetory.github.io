the top 5 tech items this time under 30
dollars and every single one of these
items I think you guys will feel is a
very useful item it's not just something
that you're going to like set up the
side and never use again actually every
one of these items in today's video
there is something in it that you can
use in your life I guarantee it so first
up we have the tile bait now I know
there's lots of different products out
there that are sort of like this one but
this one's really cool and in fact the
timing is really easy to use and what it
does is if you're like me and like many
folks out there you just lose your keys
you lose your phone if you're a lady or
earlier a lady boy you probably lose
your purse you know so basically you
know this thing attaches to those
devices and then you install the app on
your phone and no matter where this
thing is at you can find it which I find
really useful I stuck it on my phone
because for me the phone is the easiest
thing and the thing I just leave
everywhere sometimes we go to
restaurants I leave the damn thing
sitting there or I leave it in my damn
car right leave its freaking giasses
cards even more of a pain in the ass but
at least with the tile made I know
exactly where I excuse me I know exactly
where the item is that I put the tag on
so you put the tile made on anything
that there is and you can locate that so
your keys your wallet I mean it really
doesn't matter anything if you can use
the adhesive to attach to it and
actually it comes with a bunch of
different models you can buy different
types of adhesive - - you know using
different type of situations there's
like one for your phone one for like you
know it's type of leather and stuff like
that so we'll have links to those all
down below at the end of the day I
honestly feel the towel mate is a really
killer product for what it is I mean are
you like me you just lose your
randomly and you really need to know
where it is because if you are the time
mate just might be your friend my friend
how many times have you been out and
about with your Android or your Apple
device and you find yourself unable to
charge it because you forgot that
frickin charging cable back home and
you're like ah you're pulling your hair
you're like me you just lost your hair
from stress but that's a a product from
Urbo is pretty cool man it's magnetic
it's very lightweight easy to use comes
in two different models and what's
really nice is that it's any color you
want and it'll
fit inside of your wallet this little
bad boy right here is really small so if
you found yourself in a situation where
you need the charging cable but you just
forgot that doggone thing hey with the
herb oh you can stick it right in your
wallet or your person no matter where
you go you have a charging cable the
Urbo charging cable comes in two
different flavors one for your microUSB
and one for the Lightning so make sure
you buy the one that fits your need so
the specs device I have is the man my
cable splitter so any of you fans out
there who have a lightning connector
this is pretty cool because one end goes
into your lightning connection and the
other end has the splitter which
contains a charging port and a place
where you can plug in your headphones
and listen to them as well now this is
pretty damn convenient when you find
yourself in a situation where like man I
really want to listen to music and not
be bored but I need to charge my device
at the same time that's when the man
might comes in and it's under 20 bucks
and if you have a need for it I know
it's kind of a niche product but the
thing is it is really cool and it's not
very expensive at all and sometimes you
just want to rock if you're someone who
has an older vehicle and you find that
you need a lot of USB ports inside your
car
the ISEE XX 50 watt 10 amp 5 port
charger is actually something pretty
cool it'll charge anything that you have
out there as long as it uses a USB
connection and if you have a lot of
things in your car charging at the same
time hey you don't have to worry about
it because the battery is not going to
run out on this it plugs directly into
your car that's right right into the
lighter port that's pretty cool just
pull this little thing out right here
which I got to be honestly it kind of
reminds me of a little dildo a mini
dildo and you just plug that little
bad-boy right here and then Kabam its
into your charger now the charging cable
actually comes out of the side it gets a
little longer there so it doesn't matter
you can move it around your car you can
stretch around your car it actually
comes a little bit more I'm not too hard
to pull it out but you guys can see the
charging cable comes out all the
charging ports are right here on top so
you have to worry about like where the
heck do I plug that thing in like
especially in the dark you know if
you're in your car and you only hit that
little dim ass car light on it's hard to
see hope you have to worry about that
this thing's very easy to see very easy
to use it's a low price I know that some
people out there have newer cars going
in the thing
matter to me man I got all I in my
car but there's still a lot of people
out there who don't have the latest and
greatest cars and let's just face it
maybe in your car you only got a single
USB connection but you wish you had more
because you travel around a lot you're
charging your laptop you're charging
your phone you're charging your tab
device I mean excuse me your tab yeah
sure
your tablet device I guess that works
out right there so for those people who
need it it's pretty cool for others
either they like it no big deal Elric so
let's move on to something I think that
you guys will find very useful because I
know that everybody out there especially
students can always use a killer
backpack now the last item on today's
top five is a backpack because like I
said who out there really can't use a
great backpack especially if you're a
student here's somebody who's on the go
a lot needs to stow your items and still
came around without like having a bunch
of cracks all over the place
backpack is the perfect thing now one
thing I want to mention we first started
doing this video this backpack was a
little cheaper than it was as we film
this we notice the price went up so it's
30 99 or you can get it for less by
subscribe and save with it exactly they
mean but subscribe and say I don't know
I don't think anybody's gonna be
subscribing for a monthly backpack or
they're crazy but anyways the tom talk
here is actually really really nice it's
like 30 bucks like I said but it's got
plenty of room inside the store even up
to a 17 inch laptop their pockets on the
side where you could like stow a drink
internally there are all kinds of
different pockets and plenty of room for
different stuff so you can put your
laptop in there you could put your
tablet in there you could put some books
in there pretty much quite a lot of
stuff it's made very well also it's not
just a flimsy piece of crap that's going
to break on you really really quickly
it's also very comfortable if you put it
on your back and you have stuff in it
unless you've got a ton of weight
in it it doesn't feel like it's pulling
you backwards like you're going to fall
backwards when you have it on I think
that's something really really nice
about it now I also know there are a lot
of different backpack companies out
there and there's all kinds of different
things to choose from but this one is
really really nice the straps in the
back like I said are very well made
there's not a whole hell of a lot of
padding but there's just enough padding
to make it comfortable so that when
you're wearing it doesn't feel like it's
cutting into your shoulders or pulling
you backwards so at the end of the day
the Tom tuck I think is a very useful
item especially if you want something
that's not overtly priced but it's going
to last a long time
and is very comfortable so I know it you
guys been watching the top 5 here in
July so we've got other top 5s coming
but this one's $130 like usual there'll
be links to all these products down
below and if you guys want to interact
