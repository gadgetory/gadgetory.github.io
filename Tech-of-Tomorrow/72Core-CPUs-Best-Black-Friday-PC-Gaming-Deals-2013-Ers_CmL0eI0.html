you're not out shopping you're probably
doing your shopping online and you're
going to be glad that you're tuned into
tech tomorrow because today on black
friday we're only bringing you guys some
news we're bringing y'all some deals
that's right some steel deals and all of
them will be online you don't even have
to go and wait in the line so if that
said though we also have to really cool
new stories for you guys now last week
PlayStation came out all kinds of cool
stuff and you guys all know twitch and
how they stream all this stuff while
this one couple decide that they were
going to get drunk show themselves in
front of the camera you know that was
going pretty good for a while but then
as the night progressing they got
drunker this guy started stripping his
wife naked on Twitch for everybody to
see that's right now my big question is
though how many you guys out there and
don't be liars how many you guys were
tossing off when this guy was stripping
his wife nekkid come on don't lie to El
Rick you guys all know some of you were
I know for a fact there's somebody out
there watching right now is watch that
video going but hey I want to think the
bad news about that is because they did
this now that kind of stuff has been bad
so now twitch is not even allowed to be
on the playstation network right now so
these people doing this has actually
screwed the entire world over so now
right now as it is you can't even use
this service now hopefully they'll just
make some kind of change to the end user
agreement so that you will be able to do
this but that's just crazy crazy stuff
this guy strips his wife nekkid when
she's drunk in front of the camera now
she they woke up and she was like oh
honey you big you did well she was like
I'm gonna kill you mother depending on
our personality is so that's it that's
the first story for more information
check out the link down the description
will have the full story in this if you
guys want to get more even more details
about this story now the next story up
Intel getting ready to the view in 2015
night
landing now I first heard Knights
landing I'm thinking to myself this is a
new david hasselhoff show like you know
starring David Hasselhoff Knights
landing you know just kind of revisiting
his Knight Rider theme but as you know
Knights landing it's kind of like a
mixture like one of those soap opera
shows you know everybody's all sad
you're like the landing bang and then
the Knights landing or I got even better
theme nights landing it's a science
fiction program about knights from outer
space who land on Earth and then take
over no that's not what it's about at
all it's actually Intel's latest Xeon
Phi computing and this thing's going to
be incredible now one of the big things
that int'l wants everybody know right
off the bat is that with this new
generation of Zeon's you're no longer
going to have to have an actual CPU and
a cartridge to make it work currently
right now what's going on is you have a
cartridge slot that goes in and that
works with the CPU now the car is
completely gone and this is going to be
its own complete standalone CPU package
and it has all kinds of features now
Knights landing is a CPU that will have
16 gigabytes of deer ab 3d stacked on
package that will provide up to 500
gigabytes a second of memory bandwidth
along with up to 384 gigabytes of ddr4
2400 mainboard memory when intel makes
the move to the 14 nanometer process
then knights landing will make its to be
you and things should happen sometime in
2015 with the promise of such power that
knights landing will bring to the table
and it's 3 teraflops of double precision
/ socket we will most assuredly see 100
+ petaflop x86 computers being produced
very soon I'm sure companies out there
like Aberdeen LLC who brought us a verse
petabyte computer will jump into this
market very soon your guys are going to
see supercomputing take on a whole new
level now right now the only competition
that intel has is from nvidia that's
right they're the only ones right now
that we're giving in competition this is
kind of competing right in the head to
head with those so if you guys want to
see a lot more information about this is
like a pretty gnarly subject and I want
