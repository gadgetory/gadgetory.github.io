the tectum our youtube channel where we
bring you all the tech all the time
those who follow the channel know that
we just took a look at the latest 21
inch iMac that was a pretty decent
machine coming between twelve and
seventeen hundred dollars but the big
news is the new 27-inch iMac and why is
that well because it contains the latest
Ivy Bridge processor inside of it that's
right the model that we're getting the
fully decked out one contains a 3.4
gigahertz i7 which has turbo boost of a
3.9 also you can put the RAM in up to 32
gigabytes we ordered this one with eight
gigabytes SSD technology all built
inside read and write speeds we're gonna
have all those for you as well but the
big news really to me is this giant 27
inch IPS monitor for those people that
are blind or just really like to be able
to have the latest greatest thing to
look at visually when you're working I'm
really impressed with what Mac and Apple
has to offer that has always been one of
the favorite things even when I look at
the 21 inch you guys know I was saying
hey this IPS screen really kicks ass now
in Geekbench
this thing's scoring over 14k that's
unbelievable over 14,000 it's kicking
the out of my Mac Pro out of my
hackintosh out of my MacBook Pro
everything is getting beat by this new
iMac unbelievable now previously I
mentioned that this contained an SSD
well it does it contains 128 gigabyte
SSD and a one terabyte hard drive
combined to make a fusion drive system
for you guys out there want to know more
information about that check out the
link in the description below we gave
you an in-depth video about this
previously now we know that you can get
400 to 500 scores on pure SSD technology
but they're not in this same capacity so
now you get that one terabyte capacity
and that same almost close to speed
which is really good for getting
productivity and also because it's very
quiet across the board just a lot of
great technology now as far as video
goes you guys all know
now AMD is out the window in comes
Nvidia and we see the 680 MX on board
with 2 gigabytes of dedicated memory now
this thing's incredible now the top low
and baseline model has a 675 MX and
that's totally not like this we tried to
get the absolute most that we could get
in this machine and that's why we went
with the 680 MX now obviously we're
gonna be bringing you guys some gaming
footage but for right now let's just
take a look at the Cinebench tour where
to show you some basic scores and you
guys can see from the results that in
the video card Department this is some
pretty impressive stuff so overall a lot
of features here you can upgrade the
memory like I said to 32 gigabytes it's
very very expandable now one thing for
damn sure you don't want to do you do
not do not know what's going off in the
background oh you don't want to buy a
memory from Apple well no you do not
brothers and sisters check out the link
below we get that same memory to you for
a hundred and sixty dollars save
yourself the cash only max out the stuff
when you're ordering it from Apple that
you can only get from Apple anything
else you can get from anywhere else make
sure you check out our links where you
can get it and save yourself some money
now one last point to clarify before I
jump out and go do something else on the
21 inch you could not upgrade the memory
at all but with this one on the new iMac
27 inches you can't there's a little
backplate in the back you just pop this
little bad boy out and then you can self
upgrade your memory saving yourself tons
of cash so there you guys all have it
the new iMac 27-inch all completely
decked out now I know some people out
there are gonna say wow the price is
kind of high one thing that's really
cool though that I think about this
though is that you can dual boot it so
if you want to use as a Windows machine
you can and think about this as well
there is no other all-in-one that you
can get out there that has this type of
video card technology that combined with
this ultra beautiful 2560 by 1440
resolution is just in
credible its sixteen by nine and this
thing is unbelievable the IPS technology
and everything built into it the anti
glare is so much better than previous
models it's also much thinner it does
not get anywhere near as hot as the
previous generation ones my previous
generation iMac when I put my hand
around the side of the 27-inch that damn
thing was hot
this one has mild heat but nowhere near
the amount of heat as the old school
ones do so right now I'm saying this
thing is pretty much thumbs up great
display the ability to game great
graphic options great memory options
portable one plug Wireless everything
else to go for fans of all-in-one and
for fans of the people who like Apple
products you guys are gonna be very very
happy with this product for you PC guys
out there I know I'm gonna see your
negative comments below and you guys are
gonna give us your nays say stuff but
hey we know what's going on for those
people who like it give it a thumbs up I
hope you guys like this video like
