once again on Tech Odom are you guys
might have wondered why we've had so
maid is kind of the same videos well the
reason is is that we have been moving
with no computer access but we are back
and even though we're a little bit late
we know there's still lots of our fans
out there who want to check out the
founders edition gtx 1060 from the folks
over at nvidia now this is basically
their brand new entry-level card
guaranteed you guys know to fight
against that 480 so with that said
though let's check out some basic specs
how big the card is and uh hmm what it
looks like yeah so you guys can see
right off the bat this is a Founders
edition card it has all of their
standard cooling and all that good stuff
featuring a single fan and a single 6
pin power connector not power
requirements in this card are extremely
extremely low all you need is 120 watts
of power to power this car so that's
really amazing very low power
consumption I'm sure we're going to see
an aftermarket models we're going to see
a lot of different stuff now as far as
the back panel goes you guys can see
there is no great shield in the back of
this but there's no sharp parts either
so it's kind of a mixed toss-up you
don't get that great shield but then
again you don't get your hands all
cutting you up either which is a good
thing I hate being cut by the back of a
video card if you've ever got it done to
yourself and know what I'm talking about
as far as CUDA cores go this unit comes
to 1280 CUDA cores and like I said is
geared totally for the entry-level
market now as far as the connections go
we're seeing the same setup that we saw
on a 1080 and the 1070 we have a single
DVID connector a single HDMI connector
and then we have three display boards so
that's what the card looks like and the
limited amount of specs the world.i to
talk to you with right now but as far as
the card sizing in its size it at 10
inches long by 4 inches high by a dual
slot design also later this month for
you people out there I've seen it before
in videos VR funhouse will be available
for everybody download and buy later
this month so if you don't those people
that's totally into VR stick around cuz
funhouse is coming on some of the
higher-end cards like the 1080 and the
1070 we saw there were some cards out
there that had gddr5 ex-member
and them and some had just standard GDR
five this card has six gigabytes of just
standard gddr5 memory now the base clock
speed we're not quite sure because we
haven't stuck in the system yet but the
clock speed that they're saying is the
boots is at 1.7 gigahertz and for card
that's coming to market for the founders
is at $299 that's pretty damn kick-ass
plus we're going to see there's going to
be a bunch of ditions outside of the
founders Edition coming to the market
starting at about two hundred and forty
nine dollars so this is definitely going
to be crushing in on the 480 and coming
for your budget money now $299 I do
admit it is slightly higher than you're
seeing on the AMD side of things but
you're also seeing kind of a difference
in memory as well
they have a four gigabyte and an eight
gigabyte version of cards and right now
there's no six gigabyte version so that
makes the 1060 a very very interesting
animal all in itself another thing to
take note of both of the previous cards
the 1080 and the 1070 were both based on
GP 104 this is actually based on a brand
new Pascal chipset called GP 106 another
really big thing that Nvidia is touting
big-time about the 1060 is the ability
to overclock this card to 2 gigahertz
without a problem at all and we're
hoping that when this card gets released
on July 19th that we'll be able to bring
that to you and that this card will be
able to do that and if so that's going
to be pretty amazing you guys know it
was kind of rolling the dice on the 10 7
10 8 depending on which cards you got if
you could actually do that we only saw
one card out of all the cards that we
actually tested that did that so if all
the 10secs you're going to do this out
of the box that's going to be some
pretty bad ass stuff so pretty much
folks at the end of the day this is what
this card is it's supposed to be 980
level performance but only with a power
draw of 120 watts and with the price tag
being under $300 for the founders
Edition and $249 for companies like MSI
and all the rest that's going to be a
very very interesting thing to see all
these scores and where it fits in I'm
Miller you guys been watching teka
tomorrow this is the brand new NVIDIA
GTX 1060 scores coming
very soon so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
