you're a host here on the tech of
tomorrow youtube channel bringing you
guys a brand new product to introduce
from the folks over at biostar now
biostar has their own series of
motherboards and this is one of their
little mini h61 motherboards put in an
inne win case now the people over at
biostar they actually chose this case
when people over to inland and decide to
use their case in this bill so basically
this board it'll take 16 gigabytes of
ram it'll fit two hard drives it's based
on the 861 gypsum and with a quick bios
flash you can use the latest Ivy Bridge
processors in this little unit now not
only am I going to introduce this
product you folks today we're going to
go ahead and give it to one lucky winner
at our 18 K sub mark so without any
further ado let's jump inside the box
and take a closer look at this new
product from the folks over a biostar
so first off then we'll show you guys
the front of the box you see you get a
free Bund on here this is the bio remote
kit for the htpc going to be pretty cool
stuff you use it the media center now
I'm going to spin around the side over
here there's a couple different parts
inside of this box the meeting at BD 61
consists of the th 61 ITX motherboard
from biostar and the BP 671 case from
the people over it inland so like every
unboxing and every product spotlight we
got to show you guys the old knife going
to use that right there alright like
every unboxing we'll start off with some
incisions one here across the top one
here on the side another one on this
side alright then I'll get the Box open
put my little trusty knife away just
turn it upside down and remove it just
like you do a case unboxing some stuff
will come flying probably all right
let's get everything out we love our
sound effects of camera will take these
I'll make this is toss off Oh actually a
we have Jerry standing over in the back
ground from biostar time trying to hit
him with these now let's see if I can
hit him if I hit it me as to scream
funny talk about a girly scream alright
so say it before you in there here's
what comes inside the box you get to say
two cables made of 24 karat solid gold
diamond and blazedd no I'm just kidding
just two normal standard SATA cables now
also you guys want to take a look at
this folks as the nodes that comes
inside the box talks to you about your
milk control stop get that away we have
the drivers and utilities CD right here
then we have the main board for the t
861 ITX is the quick installation guide
i'll just go ahead and open this all the
way up see folks can see it very clearly
detailed shows the motherboard and
everything in there cool stuff
get that out of the way I'm going to
worry about the filthiness of it for now
what about that later then let's get
inside and look at the system okay so i
guess i'm gonna flip it around to show
you guys the back of it first you can
see all the connections are back here
including your little wireless thing
it's right here you've got all your
connections DVI vga now the only thing
that I see different here by some of the
other boards that are being released on
Ivy Bridge is that the new Ivy Bridge
boards do have a display port in it this
one doesn't have a display board it does
however have hdmi so that's their REO
pretty well laid out I even like this
they have optical audio right there
which i think is very good if using this
thing for an htpc power supply is built
inside as well you guys can see the side
of it nice and thin go around the front
i'm gonna go ahead and remove this
plastic casing on this it'll fit your
normal size optical drive so if you want
to put a CD player you can put it right
in there you have your front controls
right here these are only the USB to
point out but you also do get your
headphones and your mic check there as
well easygoing stuff right here in the
front or you're on your power buttons
are all right here this probably lights
up as well we'll know that we actually
plug it in now let's take a look on the
inside there's actually two screws you
have to remove here in order to do that
but the accessory package and remote
control and everything's inside here and
you guys can also take a look at the
motherboard as well and let's get the
keys there we go folks now on the inside
me go ahead and remove the power thing
here's the remote package let me try to
get this up the camera folks you guys
have it a little better look at it let
me open this up sometimes we don't keep
everything up so let's open everything
up between you two look here between to
devirginize the packaging but what the
heck it's resetting the whole thing on
so if you want to set your system on
this you can use a little bezel also a
little screws are going for that in here
as well here is the remote kit
back brackets like we're talking before
the low profile video card those mounts
come in here as well the batteries come
in here as well so you know do anything
basically let's set up we'll take a
closer look through at the old remote
control here it's a very nice cleaning
remote works in windows media center
this way you can operate all of your
videos all your DVDs I like good stuff
in there set that down I'm going to
bring this up to the Cameron so you get
a really close look at it so you guys
can see the motherboard inside of there
you give to the two slots for the memory
right there there's plenty of room
around the ZIF socket it's LGA 1155 and
we have a single PCI connection in there
running at 16 X you do have one true 16
x pci connector so you can use this
board for many different things you can
see it from the front is where the CD
gets mounted i'll show you guys internal
all the wiring last night leads let's
talk about the availability for doing
storage you can fit 2 3.5 inch or 2 2.5
inch drives right here in these side
bays so essentially folks what you get
with the media BD 61 is an all-in-one
complete barebone system all you have to
do is add your own CPU your memory and
obviously your optical drive if you want
to have that this thing can be used for
all types of different applications you
can also fit a single low profile video
card inside the system so if you want to
build this as a gaming / htpc that could
also be done I just want to re-emphasize
once again if you're planning on going
ivybridge you can flash the BIOS on this
motherboard and make this motherboard an
Ivy Bridge motherboard so we're going to
do this 18k I'd like if you guys would
like this video if you guys are
interested in biostar products it'd be
really cool if you go over to Facebook
and like their page and tell them why
you like biostar we'd really appreciate
that and so would they we really love
interaction so we're going to do is
we're going to pick a random winner it's
worldwide folks at 18k so be looking and
following the technate amaro town we
actually give this new product away from
biostar to you one lucky
her see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
