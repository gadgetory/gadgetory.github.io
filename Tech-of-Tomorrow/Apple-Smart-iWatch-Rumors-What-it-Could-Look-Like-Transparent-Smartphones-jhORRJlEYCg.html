we talking about today well once again
we see Apple trying to make an
innovative move and come up with
something very interesting for their
fans out there now I know many people
out there are fans of the iPhone and all
those products now just imagine though
if you could have an iPhone or an iPad
but right on your wrist now allegedly
hmm Apple has a hundred or so people
actually working on this project right
now now this could be pretty cool it's
supposed to be completely curved glass
and have all the features that you get
on like your iPad or iPhone now I don't
know if any folks out there follow the
x-men they had a whole series of these
comic book movies that they made back in
the 80s and this guy named gage had this
really cool watch where he could like
talk to it get all his information
everything off his wrist so maybe
somebody had Apple saw them they were
like hey that would be just like the
most awesome idea ever now if they could
come out with a product that was totally
like that on your watch voice-activated

now speaking of transparent tech
apparently we're gonna have a
transparent smartphone right around the
corner the smartphone it features a
touchscreen interface in the center
giving at the moment a very basic
functionality as there's no OS despite
this poly Tron is plain to mark the
technology by the end of this year now
the handset as of now its unnamed but
it's supposed to be made completely of
transparent and glass the only thing
you'll be able to see on it is the
memory card the board itself and the
camera so for those people out there who
