hey everybody welcome back to the
channel
you're on ticket Omar we bring you all
the tech all the time so what tech are
we talking about today well once again
we see Apple trying to make an
innovative move and come up with
something very interesting for their
fans out there now I know many people
out there are fans of the iPhone and all
those products now just imagine though
if you could have an iPhone or an iPad
but right on your wrist now allegedly
hmm Apple has a hundred or so people
actually working on this project right
now now this could be pretty cool it's
supposed to be completely curved glass
and have all the features that you get
on like your iPad or iPhone now I don't
know if any folks out there follow the
x-men they had a whole series of these
comic book movies that they made back in
the 80s and this guy named gage had this
really cool watch where he could like
talk to it get all his information
everything off his wrist so maybe
somebody had Apple saw them they were
like hey that would be just like the
most awesome idea ever now if they could
come out with a product that was totally
like that on your watch voice-activated
and everything else I could do right on
my arm I feel like a freakin superspy
anyways if you guys want to check out
more information about this I know some
of you people gonna be interested go
over and check it out over on our
website all the link in the description
below where you guys can go read the
full article on this new eye watch
product and you can go I what
now speaking of transparent tech
apparently we're gonna have a
transparent smartphone right around the
corner the smartphone it features a
touchscreen interface in the center
giving at the moment a very basic
functionality as there's no OS despite
this poly Tron is plain to mark the
technology by the end of this year now
the handset as of now its unnamed but
it's supposed to be made completely of
transparent and glass the only thing
you'll be able to see on it is the
memory card the board itself and the
camera so for those people out there who
really want to know more about this
technology and more about what it's
about go check out my full article over
on our website that'll be listed in the
