back once again to take a tomorrow I'm
Elric your host and today we've got not
one but two cards to show you and hey
two is always better than one right
folks Haley's I think so I mean so check
this out
we have two of the PNY accelerate cars
now these things are pretty awesome
they are overclocked to out of the box
we have the 780 which features a triple
fan design and then we also have the 770
which features four gigabytes of RAM so
they're both kind of special in their
own way but that said though let's jump
in and let's see why you guys are gonna
like these cards pea and white guides
want to say our price quite right these
guys have been around a long time have a
pretty steady warranty and their
products have been generally good all
around so with that said let's jump in
and let's take a closer look at these
cards
all right folks we're gonna start off
with the small or one once you know
smaller box and everything else just go
ahead and go ahead and take the trusty
knife here sometimes people do ask what
knife that I'm using this one here I've
used it before this is the SWOT knife my
kid got this for me one time for
Christmas always a Batman type knife and
it's pretty damn cool so let's get all
this plastic off here so I think doesn't
glare the kamemon you guys so this is a
four gigabyte version from PNY it's the
accelerate enthusiast Edition graphics
card the geforce gtx 770 obviously it
has all the features that come with any
nvidia base product has a lifetime
warranty just spinning around i guess
first off you guys are just getting nice
close-up of the box i don't have a lot
of you guys have even seen this product
around will show you this real quick
flip it around to the back two guys and
just get a good view of the box and
everything like i said all the key
features been video here everything that
comes with any other nvidia card the
same features are going to be rolling
along with this one this is just the PNY
flavor of the car so let's slide it out
of the box set it over there these guys
have a pretty simplistic stuff but the
way they do stuff they don't try to go
all crazy and they try to mic it just
very pricey affordable for you folks and
if you do wondering what I'm doing right
here I'm taking a look at this box and
going hey where does this thing actually
come unbox dad
so there we go a pop a little tab right
there and this one pops off then we'll
have the card yards I try to shake it
out of there
shake that card shake that card oh boy
this is a little bit difficult there so
when I just pull on this alright here we
go folks so now I'm getting somewhere
so let's see alright so that's it beyond
that once again we see the box has
nothing at so we get adapter DVI to VGA
a little instruction manual right there
driver disc and then we're going to get
to the card so you can see it in all its
nice plastic glory there keep going
we'll pop the top on that does it have
that new smell oh yeah it has that name
you mean your product smell you guys
don't talk by the smoke beautiful nice
static bag so check it out here in the
front nice design all yellow and black
kind of bumblebee ish would go great
mods that have to do with Metro and
things like that you guys can see two
fans there's heat fans that underneath
that they have their copper heat pipes
turn around to the side you guys can
just see all the components are used
under here PCI interface flip it around
the back where once again you guys can
see more of the aluminum Pete fins
more of the parts the fan connector flip
it over here we see a single six pin and
the single eight and adapter know
nomenclature anything on top of the card
pretty generic as far as that goes
we'll flip it around take a look at the
back of the card you guys can see a
completely black PCP a lot of builders
and users like that P&amp;amp;Y has seen that
and they've implanted it in to their
cards flip it around show you guys the
rear i/o standard stuff dual DVI signal
HDMI single DisplayPort
so that's card one let's move on to card
2 now card 2 comes in a much bigger box
came from probably zoom out a little bit
for this big old giant box this is the
PNY overclocked
triple fan accelerate induces vision
graphic card GeForce GTX 780 excuse me
oh is that I don't know that's quite fun
so once again I'm going to take the old
trusty knife here take a little incision
here get one across the top as well if I
can try not to cut the box so we can
pull this plastic off of here otherwise
it's just too dang shiny it shines for
you and the camera will be going hey
you're gonna blind me with that glare
now it's kind of like my legs or you see
me a bright light they'll just make you
go hey what the heck I had some people
that Jimmy other did tell me we were in
the thing I said hey there's my white
legs they said I don't know I just
thought it was bright light but no their
time on my legs so here's the front of
the box not a lot once again whoops side
of the box show you guys the back of the
box the same thing as either card only
much bigger you can see all the
performance things all the things
they're talking about all the great
stuff that comes with Nvidia and it's
gonna be pretty awesome as some new
stuff from Nvidia is coming right around
the corner and you guys are gonna really
like what you see I'm quite impressed
with what I saw a yesterday's in video
briefing once again all the key features
all that stuff card clock speeds all
that stuff will have all close-ups of
all that during the video for both cards
you guys can see all that that's it
let's go ahead let's take out of the box
take a closer look at the card this box
I have to say was a little bit easier to
open those in the other one it was a
giant sized box but it's much easier to
open then the card just slides on out
like that boom alrighty then cuz slam
Iike slam Iike Slammy
another little pop of the top and then
this one well we have stuff right here
so you guys all know me here it goes fly
to the cameraman whoo missed him by that
much yeah maybe that much I don't know
he ducked cheater alright so anyways
inside installation disk once again the
adapter and what would be hold that's it
and the card alright so there we go it's
a close-up the card I shall move the box
out of the way and that today I'm just
gonna screw the camera in mood so let's
just throw it at him no I didn't do it I
didn't do it I was just kidding come on
don't be so serious around here come on
alright so here we go all wrapped up in
an anti-static bag attention attention
it's in a static bag alright
think they know that by now though folks
let's go ahead and pop that little tab
there so we can open up the card and
take a look at what's inside all right
there
so this one looks a lot like the other
one you know this one has three fans the
previous one had two fans just model
shown to you both the same time so I got
him here so there's a difference between
those two cards now obviously three fans
instead of two same yellow and black
design cards obviously a lot longer on
the side all the fins and all that
single 6-pin single eight pin power
connector you can also see one of the
power connectors over here for fans will
flip the record around the back you see
more of the heat pipes and stuff the
technology coming here since this card
is long and everything a lot more the
electronics and stuff is back inside of
there so flip it around here PCI
interface you can still see the fan and
all that good stuff
once again completely black PCB four
screws if you want to demount their fan
and put on after one leg even do water
cooling and stuff like that this one is
very easy to remove this want to point
that out and that's pretty much it as in
the rear i/o which is the same thing to
DVI single DisplayPort single HDMI
alright folks so that's it - brand new
cards from PNY my contact over there
said they will have a 780ti out very
very very soon but these are the cards
