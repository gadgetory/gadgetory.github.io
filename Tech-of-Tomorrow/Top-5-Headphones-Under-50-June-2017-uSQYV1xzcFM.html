again to tech of tomorrow and today we
have a cool top 5 video for you guys
top 5 over your headphones from $50 down
to $20 and yes a lot of these products
are made in China I just want to tell
you guys this you guys sometimes say hey
man those are just cheap times products
I went to Best Buy and almost every
product on the Shelf is made in China or
Taiwan or one of those Asian countries
so I think that most the products that
are going to be electronics you're going
to be seeing them come from that area
now none of these in here today are junk
and I'll tell you why each one of these
items has a lot of great reviews and in
fact the cheapest one of the bunch it's
on sale over here to my far right which
will be your left is on sale right now
for 20 bucks but is usually $50 it has
almost 2,000 positive ratings so if 2000
people are saying hey this is a good
product I think you can trust those
views I think the minimum that we have
the Prok that has like 300 positive
reviews so everything that you're going
to see here today has lots of positive
reviews lots of positive comments three
of them are completely wireless
bluetooth and the other two are wired up
so let's jump right in and let's check
out number one in today's video for the
top five headphones over your ear for
under $50 so first up we have the
photovoltaic bills now one thing about
these are going to notice is these
things are extremely extremely light
they have 12 hours of battery life
really good solid base nice trouble did
they seem that they're really tuned just
for like the middle of the angle of the
road so they're going to be good for
like you know listening to music playing
games and stuff like that they're
completely wireless and all the controls
are located on the right hand side you
simply have a toggle up and down for
your volume and your pairing it on
button there in the center very very
simple stuff now the ear pads are very
very soft you can guys can see there may
have a really nice material that doesn't
make you sweat or make your ear stick it
all when you're using them for long
periods of time inside the accessories
box you'll find the charging cable and
3.5 millimeter audio cable honestly you
can wear these headphones for hours on
end without having any type of fatigue
on your ears whatsoever in fact they're
so lightweight I know people say oh my
god you know you have to
in your headphones to jog and stuff I
don't really think that you have to
these ones work pretty well for it
although I don't think they're the
absolute best thing for doing sports
stuff they can still be used to that
type of thing if you want do they're
they're so lightweight and comfortable
so if you're looking for something to
the last for 12 hours charges up really
nice
these ones are 50 bucks they're like the
highest price of the entire batch today
these particular ones also are not on
sale at the moment but they have really
great ratings they're very comfortable
and like I said no fatigue at all for
wearing them long time that all all your
control is a convenient location right
up here so if you want to do some once
you get used to it you'll build easily
you know toggle between your volume or
your songs or whatever you're doing very
simply so let's move on to pair number
two and let's check them out now the
next set of cans we have are made by M
pound you know what after a second
glance these actually have even more
positive reviews than these badboys
1600 total positive reviews now they
come in a cool nice very soft little bag
you can see when you pull them out they
look a lot like beats by dre and they
kind of feel a lot like beats by dre now
they have some really weird things that
they talk about when they talk about
these headphones especially the ear
muffs here because they call these
things soft memory protein ear muffs now
when I hear soft protein memory ear
muffs I'm thinking it's something you
remember to eat but obviously it's not
and these things are very very
SuperDuper soft honestly it feels like
your ears are being caressed with like
this super duper soft materials it's
like and it's really smooth too like
baby skin I mean it's really kind of
cool and these particular headphones
fold up so they can easily fit inside
their bag and so if you're looking for
something you want to travel with take
around with you they're pretty cool now
they also have another mode you can plug
them in as well as being wireless so if
you don't want to listen to anything
wirelessly you can do it for your
computer or your phone or anything else
and take them wherever you go now specs
wise this particular set of mpow
headphones also has a built-in
microphone and like I said it has a
wired mode for PC and cell phones and
your TV if you want to use them that way
the closed back design of these
headphones provides an immense of hi-5
sound environment using the csr chip
they also feature noise isolation no I
don't mean active noise cancellation but
it is
noise isolation because once you put the
cups over your ears you really can't
hear the environment around you very
long and it's also recommended that you
take the headphones off every couple of
hours
just in case you get moisture inside the
cup so you can dry that off to continue
gaming on with your day all the controls
for the mpow headphones are located
behind the cup on the right hand side in
the center you have your on and off
button then you have your volume up and
down and then you have your toggle
forward and back
the mpow is also offer 13 hours of music
listening time or 15 hours of talk time
depending on what you're doing these
particular headphones are made to be
very very user friendly to be
comfortable the 40 millimeter drivers on
these do deliver very very good sound
it's fairly solid I would have to say
that of all the headphones this the
sound coming out of this is probably the
most powerful of the bunch I'm not
saying that the clarity is the absolute
best because the clarity and all these
is pretty good but as far as just it
seems like just overwhelming sound power
the impalas really kick some ass in that
department there are a couple of things
that come inside the bag in the box and
that is you get your charging cable your
3.5 millimeter cable to connect any
audio device you want and you also get
the users guides so number two empowers
red and black looking badass and they're
on sale for under $40 right now next up
we have the mix coder share me seven
headphones I got to say right off the
bat that if you're looking for a set of
wireless headphones that has a ton
of bass then these are the headphones
you're probably going to want to check
out also of the bunch these headphones
are usually $70 but they're actually on
sale in the $30 range right now so this
is actually a great product if you're
looking to get something that's a little
bit more expensive that has a great
price now the technology that goes into
these 40 millimeter drivers is pretty
unique it features a different type of
copper winding than your standard
headphones and that's what helps produce
that deep heavy bass now these things
also last a really long time up to 20
hours of continuous music time that's a
long time that's actually the longest of
any de bunch that we have down here on
the table and the fact they're very
lightweight there are really quite a lot
like the very first headphones that we
showed you other than the fact that
these particular ones actually do cover
your ears completely we're the first
ones that we showed you
we're like open ear that's a you know
somebody's preference if you want
something to cover your ears you might
want to check out these in fact this
particular set and the first set of
headphones we show you are kind of
similar in bit and sound except for
these just have more serious bass all
around now as far as the comfort goes
they're very comfortable they're also
very very as you guys can see freaking
flexible very flexible they fit in your
ears very nicely now I have to say this
about these though off the bat out of
the ones that we've showed you so far
these ones actually don't offer I don't
feel the comfort level of the other two
the comfort level these are okay the
pads they seem like they're even though
they're made well they don't quite fit
on my head you know quite right it seems
like when I put them on they're not
completely covering my ears and
immensely me in the sound that's one
thing I got to say about this particular
pair that I'm not that happy about but
other people out there might say wow the
sound qualities are really badass and
that's we're sacrificing now as far as
controls and connections go on the left
hand side the share me you see the micro
USB connection this is for charging up
the headphones on the bottom of the
right hand cup is where you can see all
the other control buttons you have the
power on the pairing 3.5 millimeter jack
you get your previous two necks that's
also doubles as a volume controls so
everything's really easy to access one
nice feature that I think is a really
positive thing about these headphones is
is that you can actually with the share
me function you and someone else in your
family can actually share the same audio
source so you guys listen the same music
or if you want to watch TV without
disturbing the rest of the family you
could do that all through these
headphones and that's actually a pretty
cool feature I don't see that amongst
any other headphones that we're seeing
here today and there might be some that
are out there but it's not something
I've seen pushed so if you're also you
know looking to like listen to the music
with your family or with your loved one
you can get a second pair and you guys
can always listen the same music at the
same time which is pretty cool now
inside the box you get the cans themself
obviously the charging cable and a 3.5
millimeter gold tip audio cable all
right next up folks we have the Reeboks
in5 wired up folding headphones also
featuring 40 millimeter drivers now it's
really weird the cups on these to me are
kind of a strange design because they
don't quite cover anybody's ears but yet
they call these over ear headphones I
think they're not over here I think
they're more open air type headphones
but you guys tell me what you think now
the comfort level on these is pretty
good I do not feel that like you can
wear these though for like totally long
periods of time probably no more than
like an hour to because the cuffs on
these particular ones and they're
sitting there they do make your ears
kind of feel like they're starting to
sweat I don't know why they just do that
now the 40mm drivers however inside of
them they produce nice clear sound it's
not like the absolute best sound in the
world but these headphones are barely
twenty six dollars so they're not like
they're breaking the bank or anything
like that so if you want a nice set of
headphones that you don't have to like
worry about getting broken or guest
comes over and wants to borrow
headphones these are actually the
perfect set for that now out of the
bunch they're really good price they're
not the absolute cheapest in the bunch
but they're kind of like right in the
middle with everything so right in the
middle with their sound they're right in
the middle with their comfort level
right in the middle with their features
now no controls are on these headphones
whatsoever because they're wired up all
the controls are from this cable that
comes included three point five
millimeter jacks on each side
gold-tipped and this is how you control
everything your volume control
everything out there your previous next
track everything is all done right here
to the stuff right right here on this
little cable right here so you just plug
it in and then after that you're up and
good to go not too much I can really say
about these headphones I think that
they're pretty good for the price level
they do come with a pretty nice little
bag so you can stuff your stuff in the
bag is actually really nice and subtle
it's not like a sub tool I get to sort
of look for it's nice and soft and you
know then the headphones fold up nicely
with a nice little click in fact that's
kind of cool about the clip with the
polar you know they pop out they make a
nice little click so that's pretty much
these little bad boys like I said
they're not the most comfortable the
bunch they're right in the middle of
everything else but they do have a great
price so uh let's check out our last set
that has really good ratings and is a
really killer price alright folks last
but not least the alien c8 over ear
headphones now these headphones are a
great price right now they're on sale
for $19 they have almost 1600 positive
ratings the sound in these headphones is
very right in the middle not too bassy
not too trebly very much
middle-of-the-road so if you like a very
flat sound I think you'll actually
prefer these out of all the ones that
we've just showed you
now obviously they're not wireless they
don't you know have the Bluetooth thing
but there are very nice set of
headphones and for 20 bucks they're just
really cool now let me just pop them out
of the box right here we can do a Cylon
box in here the last ones in unboxing -
here's the box you get all kinds of
bunch of paperwork a serial number to
register and all that kind of good stuff
yadda yadda yadda you guys all know that
stuff then we get the headphones
themselves now unlike any of the other
ones we've seen today these are actually
connected so there's no separate you
know 3.5 millimeter thing for you to
plug in it's built into the headphones
and all the controls and everything are
right here on this little controller
right here so everything you're going to
need to do for answering your phone all
that kind of stuff all right here so
these are all so seriously and I mean
seriously comfortable headphones they
are very nice now they come in a lot of
different colors this particular color
though I kind of kind of grew me first I
thought well it's kind of kind of
getting a little bit girly but you know
then after seeing I was like you know
that aqua color with the grey is
actually pretty cool and the design on
the outside is really nice so when you
put them on your head they're also very
lightweight and they do cover my ears
which I prefer I want to hear you guys
comments you know down below do you guys
prefer the headphones that are open here
or do you prefer the ones that actually
cover your ear because I hear that a lot
of people especially for like gaming
prefer the ones that actually are open
here but I want to hear you guys
opinions I prefer these for some reason
and even though these things aren't you
know geared toward saying oh they're
gaming headphones you can easily just
put a mic in front of your desk and
these can become gaming headphones I
mean they're not 5.1 or 7.1 but Peters
doing your gaming and stuff and don't
care about all that other fancy stuff
these are a solid pair of headphones
that you can wear for a long time with a
nice comfort level now the 40 millimeter
drivers in these like I said produce
sound that's right in the middle of the
road so if you guys like the kind of
sound of like how bows are where they
don't really you know have any
inflections towards the treble or the
bass these are really nice set of cans
the ce8 saw fur noise isolation once
again that's not active noise
cancellation it's just noise isolation
which means a but you know the cans
cover your ears making the sound that's
outside of you not coming forth you know
through your headphones so they also
fold up very nicely now one thing it's
kind of crazy is those they didn't come
with a carrying case but oh well I don't
think you're going to be carrying is
around too much place you probably going
to set to me
your home and use them but if you're
looking for something that's normally 50
bucks this $20 set of headphones is
something totally badass that you'd
actually have to check out and see now
you guys might say oh my god oh my god
these things aren't the most expensive
headphones in the world and no they're
not meant to be all these headphones
I've showed you guys are meant to be
affordable and pretty much I think when
you're talking about twenty thirty
dollars per set of headphones they're
almost disposable they're not like
completely disposable but still if you
break a set of headphones or do
something with a set of headphones it's
not costing you a lot of money you're
not going to be all in pain if you want
to ground by audio technica and all
these other brands those headphones are
going to cost you a lot more money and
if somebody comes over they get damaged
you're going to really be bummed out so
I'm mark you guys been watching teka
tomorrow this has been the top 5 over
your headphones for under $50 here on
TECA tomorrow for July 2017 like usual

blood like button so if you want to
