an awful lot lately about crazy things
going on in the PC industry especially
the fact that trying to buy any video
card worth its salt for gaming is just
an outrageous amount and the only way
really to beat this is to catch them
we're on sale at a directly the company
or to buy a pre-built system now we've
all heard the pros and cons of pre-built
systems a lot of people just like to be
hands-on and do everything now the
system that we're gonna talk to you guys
about is the MEK 1 from the people over
at so Tech now if you guys want to check
out the unboxing and see all the parts
and stuff that came in it we'll have a
link down below where you guys can check
that out but this is a complete total
package and the thing that really sets
it apart in my opinion is the case that
they use in the design of how the system
is is different than anything else on
the market so even if you call a VA
direct or main gear or any of these
companies most of these guys are going
to just have the standard cases that you
can buy on the market which means know
if your course there you can get a
Corsair 900 d if you want something from
NZXT you can do that but it's usually a
limitation to those cases now the MEK 1
uses its own case its own design and
what's really cool about this system is
it comes with everything except for
headphones and a monitor that's right
you get the system pre-loaded with
Windows 10 on it you get the mouse you
get the keyboard you get all the stuff
that you need to get up and going and it
all matches you even get a mechanical
keyboard all for $1,500 but the thing
that I really want to stress the most
that's really different about the system
like I said is the actual design of the
PC one of the things you guys really
asked for before is us to open this bad
boy up and take a look inside so check
it out here is the inside of the mech
one now the standard components that
come with it you get a 1070 TI video
card you get an i7 t700 non cave version
CPU you get 16 gigabytes of memory you
also get and you get yourself a nice
PCIe
m2 this is 240 gigabytes
and a one terabyte hard drive all
installed in the system and what's
better yet is yes you can't upgrade the
system now getting inside there and
stuff is a little bit difficult because
let's just face it everything's really
compacted in there and because this fact
the design is different than your most
open air systems that you see now there
are a lot of fans cooling the system no
liquid cooling was used whatsoever I was
kind of surprised at that but then again
it kind of makes sense because where
would you really put the radiator it
would have to be some kind of external
thing so for the way that the design is
it's actually really nice and you guys
will see when we get into testing and
stuff that the CPU does run a little bit
warm it's running at about 82 Celsius
that it's under its full load we're
gaming that's a little bit hot but it's
not like an ink that's going to break
the bank or make your CPU not run
whatsoever so internally you can easily
change out the hard drive you can change
out the video card you can definitely
change out the SSD so if you guys want
to change different parts and upgrade in
the future you can put in a newer CPU
and one thing that also is kind of
unique is that a lot of people when you
see their pre-built you'll see Moore's
by their people you'll see like an MSI
board you'll see a gigabyte motherboard
will you see a motherboard from Asus or
asrock but inside of this particular
system they actually use their own
motherboard as well so the parts and
everything inside of the system are all
based on ZOTAC products so that's
something really unique just taking a
quick look at the mech one from the
front there's a sliding door you have
your power button on both sides of the
system
you have some ribs the design matches on
each side there's also a cooling grill
on both sides to let out that hot air
there's a light that goes completely
around the system it lights up blue and
it looks really really quite a bit like
the colors they used in Tron and I have
a like some Tron keyboards and mice that
I've been holding on to and I may
actually mix those up with the system
and do a mod and make this system a Tron
mod on the back it's pretty much just
your standard stuff you got your rear
i/o there's a power supply also inside I
forgot to mention that earlier it is a
450 watt power supply 80 plus gold
certified so it should last quite a long
time and there's some pretty cool feet
on the bottom because if you didn't know
those feet on the thing would like just
follow
like humpty-dumpty but overall it is a
really good-looking system one thing
you'll notice is even when this PC is on
and you're gaming on it it still is
rather quiet there are no like super
loud fans blowing where your sight going
okay sounds like a lawnmower coming from
my PC holy mackerel there's nothing like
that going on whatsoever now we tested
at a lot of different resolutions we
tested at 1080 we tested at 1440 and we
tested at 4k so everything here that you
guys want is representative excuse me
represented excuse me a tongue twister
there also we kept going and doing the
things that you guys like so first we
filmed all of our gameplay then we did
the test again the same exact spot we
did the overlay so that way you guys get
the absolute best representation instead
of a bunch of graphs that you guys
claims you didn't like but with that
said let's jump in and let's check out
these scores to the benchmark song time
to rock
so like you guys would expect the 1070
TI at 1080p and at 1440 did absolutely
great perfect frame rates across the
board and like I've said before and I
think you guys agree 4k just isn't truly
here yet I mean yeah there are a few
games that are play at 60 frames per
second but not really all that many
especially with all the bells and
whistles turned up but you guys can see
the system itself ran really well
also the 1070 Ti inside the system got
as hot as 83 Celsius under full load and
the CPU itself was 81 C under full load
I think I got that wrong girl early in
the video when I was talking but you
guys since he does it here at 81 C which
is relatively hot but still the system
ran fine we had no glitches no shuts
downs anything like that whatsoever it
ran like a charm all right sold there
you guys have it the mech one from zou
tech and all of its glory all of this
performance and you guys can see that
it's a very nice system now everything
in here is $1,500 it's completely
upgradable so if you want to change out
the parts in it you can do so you can
obvious change the motherboard or
anything like that but you can change
out the video card you can change the
hard drive the CPU and you can even
change the m2 memory if you want to so
there's a lot of options there plus this
thing just looks great the mechanical
keyboard is very nice the mouse it's
just really a standard Mouse there's
nothing like you know SuperDuper
outrageous about it but it's not one of
those things that you're going oh this
is like the weak link in the chain
either it's not like that the mouse pads
very smooth so everything that you get
inside the box I feel at this point in
time is pretty much worth the money
because I looked online this morning and
a 10-7 ATI these cards are going for
like nine hundred to a thousand dollars
just for the video card so why pay
someone a thousand dollars for a 10-7 TT
I went for five hundred dollars more you
can get a complete system that all you
need to do is have a monitor and you're
up and totally gaming with this system
by the way I was paid no money for this
review they just gave me this system and
asked me to give my honest opinions and
my honest opinion is it's nice I keep
looking at over the side it's it's nice
the design is elegant the case is unique
the build itself is different than most
of the things out there so if you not
only want something that's a
portable looks nice is upgradable than
hey you guys might want to check out the
mech one for yourself like usual I'll
have a link down below like button
hopefully you guys liked this product in
this video and then you guys can check
one out for yourself and hey if you're
not subscribed hey do so we'd love to
see you guys back here on Tycho tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
