game footage of the witcher 3 on the
brand new RX ferretti with the latest
drivers and with all the stuff that you

so without that said though let's check
out 1080 and 1440 footage of the RX 480
in action go you guys can see right here
on the screen the settings that we're
running these games in you guys can
leave your comments down below telling
us how you guys run the game but this is
how we're running up this time around
and we hope you like it

whoa
alright folks so there you have the RX
for 80 in action in Witcher 3 average
frames per second is what we're always
showing you guys some people ask that
and that's what it is you guys can see
in 1440 it's about 30 frames per second
and in 1080 it's getting between 40 and
50 not quite that 60 mark that we know
everybody is looking for but it's still
very close and the cars like i said is
239 dollars for the entry-level car and
they've got a bunch of aftermarket cards
that are coming out that you'll be able
to do much more overclocking and crazy
stuff with so I know you guys been
watching tech tomorrow we'll have more
information with the car down below like
button you know what to do and we'll see
you guys back from the channel we got
more DirectX 12 step coming and we
actually Randa I know you guys always
complain about this so when we ran the
rise of the Tomb Raider we get it in
Direct X 12 and directx 11 for you folks
out there and I know some people say
it's a crappy patch but still it's still
even if it's pseudo DirectX 12 it's
somewhat Direct X 12</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
