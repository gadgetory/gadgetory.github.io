frames per second is what we're always
showing you guys some people ask that
and that's what it is you guys can see
in 1440 it's about 30 frames per second
and in 1080 it's getting between 40 and
50 not quite that 60 mark that we know
everybody is looking for but it's still
very close and the cars like i said is
239 dollars for the entry-level car and
they've got a bunch of aftermarket cards

to do much more overclocking and crazy
stuff with so I know you guys been

information with the car down below like
button you know what to do and we'll see
you guys back from the channel we got
more DirectX 12 step coming and we
actually Randa I know you guys always
complain about this so when we ran the
rise of the Tomb Raider we get it in
Direct X 12 and directx 11 for you folks
out there and I know some people say
it's a crappy patch but still it's still
even if it's pseudo DirectX 12 it's
somewhat Direct X 12</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
