period head over to hulu plus comm /t OT
om nights I just popped in to throw a
shrimp on the barbie and now i'm
bringing you guys a bottle of two of the
latest greatest funds to hit the market
the apple iphone 5s and the HTC one mate
okay so maybe I'm not from Australian
maybe it's not called the mate so check
it out you guys all know this phone the
apple 5 has been out for a while since
late last year in 2013 this phone's just
come out they're pretty relatively
priced but let's see with the two
difference between these two phones and
which one at the end of the day you'd
want to spend your money on let's bounce
the apple iphone 5s size is in at 120
3.8 x 58.6 by seven point six
millimeters the HTC One m8 comes in at
140 6.4 x 70.6 by nine point four
millimeters now as far as weight goes
the iphone 5s comes in at 112 grams the
HTC One m8 comes at 160 grams so there
you guys can see the HTC One is
obviously it's a little bit bigger which
brings a little bit more weight to the
table now maybe this won't matter to
some but to some folks this may be
something that's very important so
obviously the HTC One is a bigger phone
but the Apple is definitely more
portable now let's talk about screen
size the iphone 5s has a 4 inch LCD
display with 11 36 x 640 resolution the
HTC One m8 on the other hand has a
5-inch super lcd3 display with full 1080
resolution now this one right here is
pretty much a no-brainer you can
obviously see that the HTC One m8
clearly has a much larger better display
screen it's got higher pixel density
it's got much more resolution the only
thing is going to make you go back to
the Apple is if you're looking for that
portability option once again one of the
biggest things though that I like about
having a big screen and I have the
samsung note 3 is having a really large
screen makes media just really awesome
when you're looking at movies playing a
game or doing anything having a big
screen is really awesome now the iPhone
5s is a really cool phone but when i
look at my friend's phone for me
personally the screen is so small it's
hard for me to even see stuff even the
icon so if you're a person like me and
you like to be able to clearly see
something you might want to consider
that when you're making your purchase
option next up let's talk about
processor power and this is one area
that gets a little bit confusing for a
lot of people because the iphone 5s it
has a one point three gigahertz 64-bit
a7 dual-core chip that features one
gigabyte of ram the HTC One m8 however
features a two point three gigahertz
Snapdragon 801 quad-core chip with two
gigabytes of RAM now most people right
off their batter going to say okay
obviously quad core dual core it's just
going to win hands down I mean obviously
if you have four arms you can do more
than two but that doesn't actually seem
to be
case there are some tests where the a7
actually kicks ass on everything and
Geekbench 3 for example is one of those
tests the iphone 5s and single core
tests got 14 hundred and eleven
multi-core 2558 the HTC One m8 however
got a single core score of 90 six and a
multi-core score of 2379 so you can see
right hearing geekbench that even though
the a7 is a dual-core processor is also
very efficient in this test it just
kicks ass now let's look at 3dmark ice
storm unlimited now this shows the HTC
One m8 coming ahead at 20,000 675 with
the iphone 5s coming in at 14,000 986 so
you can see for the test scores folks
these things actually jump back and
forth but at the end of the day both
them or just really kick-ass high
efficiency efficient processors they're
actually quite snapping now let's talk
about something that also confuses a lot
of people battery life or milliamp hour
life now the Apple iPhone 5s it has
about 1600 milliamp hours on it or the
other phone the HTC One m8 has about
twenty six hundred milliamps on it now
this is one thing that's going to
confuse him because both these phones
will last about a day you're going to go
well how can that be the 2600 has so
much more well that's not really so much
with the end of the day because like I
said both will last you for a full day
but the Apple phone it has a much
smaller screen and it also is much
smaller tank which we'll get to in just
a second so the HTC One has a much
larger screen lots of more pixels going
on the battery life on it is actually
going to take more power but because the
efficiency of both these phones they're
going to last you about a day now if
charging things really fast though is
your thing obviously the smaller tank
that the apple iphone 5s has is going to
charge faster than the about 2600 at the
HTC One m8 has so that gets people a
little confusing cuz there and think oh
wow 2600 it's so much more but at the
end of the day with the officiants of
the appli phone they're about really
close now for me I have a galaxy note 3
this thing will last literally about
three days so both those things pale in
comparison
phone but they do pretty good for what
they do now let's talk about cameras the
iphone 5s features an 8 megapixel 1080p
video capable camera the HTC One m8
features a 4 ultrapixel 1080p camera as
well but features larger pixels which is
better in low light now the HTC One it
did a pretty solid job of taking
pictures they look pretty good but I got
to say that the apple iphone 5s the
pictures are much sharper in the detail
is actually much better on that camera
so this is the iphone 5s at 1080p me and
Buster the dog here give you the ways
so now we're looking at the HTC One m8
and 1080p puts the dog once again
now one thing at the apple iphone 5s
features it has a 720p 120 frames per
second slow motion mode now this thing's
really cool we're going to show you that
right now
now the HTC one on the other hand has a
1080p slo-mo defect but it's at 60
frames per second so while the
resolution may be higher the actual
slo-mo defect is not going to be as well
on the apple iphone 5s
here however is a perk that the HTC One
m8 has above the apple iphone 5s and
this is their new duo phone technology
and what this is it's actually 24
ultrapixel cameras it takes two separate
shots one of the foreground one of the
background and then mixes them together
for a picture now this has a lot of
different uses and can actually be used
for a lot of different things now we
found cleared it could be a little bit
iffy but it actually is a really cool
feature because think about it you can
either have the background image be very
clear and the thing in the front it can
be blurry or you can reverse that so it
has a lot of different things you can do
with it now we've took in a few pictures
with that we just touched upon a little
bit but you guys can check that out here
and see what you guys think now let's
talk a second about security you guys
all know that Apple phones they come
with their fingerprint reader technology
means you can unlock your phone with
your finger right now some others have
them out there you guys know this but
the HTC One m8 fails to have this
feature so that is something that
actually differentiates them in the
security area although if that doesn't
matter to you whatsoever and sound is
your thing here's something that
separates the man from the Beast big
time now the apple iphone 5s it has a
single speaker on it now with the new
HTC One m8 you get this new boom sound
which features two stereo speakers one
at the top one of the bottom so you get
that full stereo sound right out of the
HTC One m8 so you get much better sound
clarity in stereo on the HTC One m8 so
sound is your thing you don't want to
wear headphones obviously this is
something
ah
they not so long
is the back
is nothing
Oh
so before I wrap this video up folks I
want to give a big shout out and thanks
to hulu plus for making this video

alright folks so there you guys see it a
lot of difference between the HTC One m8
in the apple iphone 5s now me personally
i think i'd go with the ma because i
like the bigger screen i like to a lot
of stuff on my phone that involves
looking at it and so if you want some
that's going to have a much clearer
screen you want to go for that one like
i said before if portability is your
thing you might want to look at the
apple iphone 5s now me personally i am
not an iOS fan it's not my thing I'm
really more used to using samsung the
Android software so that's going to be
more up my alley I know opinions out
there very so if you're a person who's
obviously who's in love with the iOS
software you're probably going to go you
know the HTC One a means jack crap to me
but if you're somebody who's just
looking for features you can see that
these things both have compelling
reasons to buy either one of them at the
end of the day though what I see is I
see the HTC One having a much bigger
much better screen obviously the battery
life is about the same so that's going
to be a shake-up into the day you guys
heard the Apple iPhone is will the apple
iphone 5s excuse me will
charge faster but I don't think it's
going to really matter too many people
unless you're constantly on the go and
nowadays they've always battery charges
and all that stuff so I don't think
that's really going to matter let me
know what you guys think also of a
Florida call us by our magazine so you
