again with more top tech deals this time
the top five for under fifteen dollars
let's check it out first up we have the
anchor wall mount dual USB charger now
this thing's pretty perfect for people
that are always on the go and need
something to charge their USB device you
simply pop out the plug plug it in the
wall stick in your two USB devices and
you're up and charging and best of all
it's really low price for the holiday
season now this next item on the list is
something I think all of you out there
when you see the prices are going to go
man I want that for myself you're gonna
be like I don't want to buy that for a
gift at work I want that for a little
old me and now what am I talking about
now this thing is the locust 7 button
5500 DPI mouse now this thing's you know
geared is a gaming mouse you can change
the DPI on the fly from little button on
here like I said it's got seven buttons
around the mouse to on top couple on the
side another one up here on the top and
that's pretty much it and not only is
this thing fully functionable it also
has cool colors and come to the market
right now at about nine bucks usually
this things about $26 but it's on sale
right now that's right for nine bucks
you spend more than that at Taco Bell
man do you know somebody who's always on
the go where has a very very limited
desk space but still wants a nice set of
speakers so they can listen their music
or listen to whatever they're doing on
the internet then check this out these
are little pair of speakers by the
people over at Arctic now they're USB
powered they plug in x 3.5 millimeter
jack and they actually sound pretty good
for something this small and like i said
before these things are really low price
or under fifteen dollars they'll fit in
a backpack the fit actually inside of a
lot of notebooks as well so if you want
to take this thing around with you
anywhere it's pretty solid pretty good
gift for that person who like i said
need some sound but doesn't have a whole
lot of space next up this is something
that i feel that pretty much anybody
that you know can use this I mean think
about it do you actually have any
friends family that doesn't have either
a smartphone or a tablet I don't know
anybody in that category you pretty much
have to be living in Timbuktu and away
from Wi-Fi to even be in that kind of
situation now
this thing's pretty cool because it's
adjustable you just push these two
buttons on the side and the standard
Justin will it folds up and fit splat so
I can fit anywhere but if you want
something cool it you can just set your
phone on check it out dial through your
music same thing with your tablet then
this is something you're going to want
to check out and like I said who doesn't
have a smartphone or a tablet no one I
know and last but not least we have the
AGP tech multifunction charger now this
thing's pretty cool offers four USB
chargers and has connections for
charging it around the world so pretty
much no matter where you're at this
little product can come in handy and
when you've got a lot of device you need
to charge all at one time hey this one
does four at a time is really
inexpensive and if you're looking for a
great gift that again most people use
