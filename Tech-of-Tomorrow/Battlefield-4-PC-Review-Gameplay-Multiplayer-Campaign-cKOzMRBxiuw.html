up tomorrow we're covering all the
biggest PC games to come out this
holiday season and today we finally have
our four of you one of the biggest games
not just to come out for this holiday
one of the most anticipated titles of
all year battlefield 4
updated with dices frostbite 3 engine
battlefield 4 promised to bring a new
level of realism and interactable
environments compared to its
predecessors does it live up to this
promise let's find out
you
so biofield for to begin with this game
is really pretty good-looking water
effects details and guns and structures
plenty of special effects going on all
at once and surprisingly not that
intensive considering as an example
check out this level right here Shanghai
the second mission of the single-player
campaign during the segment you see here
on our system which includes a gtx 780
and an i7 4770k processor on 2560 by
1440 we saw average frame rates at forty
eight point eight on ultra seventy seven
on high and 119 on medium while a 1920
by 1080
we got seventy six point five one
hundred fourteen point six and one
seventy seven point one average frames
per second the single-player campaign of
this one feels like a pretty significant
shift stylistically from the one in
battlefield 3 there's a much heavier
focus on your team of character
specifically giving them actual
personalities as well as character
interaction beyond that though there's
little to help this one stand out from
most modern military FPS campaigns it's
short only lasting about seven to eight
hours and what story it has is still
fairly straightforward there's an enemy
army you're a marine now fight your way
through the entire opposing force with
just three people I also find it a bit
odd and annoying that you played the
role of the team leader yet you
literally never speak and instead
everyone else always does your talking
for you and orders you around they also
love yelling your name about every five
seconds in game this one's also obsessed
with explosions to a full-on michaelbay
extent every mission will have at least
three points at which a nearby missile
hits a car crashes or a building
collapses causing you and your team to
fall down and pass out for a moment
overall the experience isn't anything
too special it's story is a bit more
engaging than threes but in the end it
still doesn't make itself any more
memorable though it is worth noting that
beating it and viewing different endings
doesn't lock weapons in the multiplayer
so it's at least worth running through
it for some target practice and unlocks
it's also worth noting that as of right
now the single-player has a lot of
stability issues there's a lot of
missions that will crash midway through
or even right at the end forcing you to
start back at the very beginning or even
situations in which levels don't load
properly or events don't trigger forcing
you to reload a checkpoint it's
something that's fixable with time but
still annoying now of course the
campaign in this one is really just one
gigantic tutorial and side diversion for
the main reason that most people buy
this game the multiplayer mode at its
core battlefield 4 feels very familiar
about
three though there are numerous little
tweaks and new features to note once you
start playing more classes serve the
same rules as they did in three divided
into assault support engineer and recon
all of the classes have received some
minor tweaks and new additions there
have also been some new weapon features
that are shared by all classes including
changeable firing modes and in some
cases multiple scope options players are
also now able to counter knife enemies
in melee if they are facing them overall
the class balance is okay but engineers
still feel like the most important class
in large-scale matches where vehicles
star and being able to heal them or do a
big damage to an opposing one it's just
way too useful of an advantage to pass
up now while these changes minorly
affect gameplay and what classes you may
prefer to play as the really big thing
that dice wanted to emphasize a change
on is the map designs currently without
any DLC there are ten different maps to
play on which can be used in all seven
different game modes which is a really
nice feature the one big thing that dice
did with their map designs they really
wanted to emphasize is LEvolution the
idea of maps changing and evolving as
games ensue now some of this is fairly
familiar terra-tory lots of destructible
walls and cover for instance but what
this has moved towards is that there are
more interactable objects on each map as
well as usually having one major event
that can be triggered to greatly change
the maps design the siege of Shanghai
map was their favorite one to push
because it involves a whole skyscraper
collapsing but other examples include to
surround bridges or other major
buildings that can block normally
passable places now I for one really
enjoyed this concept and I think it was
a really great idea to change match
follow-up instead of just having two
teams go back and forth there's now
different things that force you to
adjust your tactics in the long run now
battlefield 4 has also seen a change in
what game modes are available returning
modes include conquest for large-scale
area conquering domination which is the
smaller scale infantry focused version
rush where one offensive team tries to
destroy key points as we move around the
map and the classics in any FPS team and
squad focus deathmatch one of the new
modes included is diffused which is
basically counter-strike the mode in
which teams take turns trying to plant
bombs and there is no respawn until the
match ends the other new mode is
obliteration a larger scale version of
defuse in which two teams compete over
randomly spawning bombs simultaneously
trying to use to destroy enemy key areas
while defending their own defuse is a
nice addition for people looking for a
more squad and teamwork focused mode
where death is not nearly as forgiving
while obliteration makes a good third
option for the
interested in large-scale
objective-based battles but are tired of
playing nothing but conquest and rush
this game also features the return of
the commander mode allowing a player to
take a backseat support role in
large-scale matches to create extra
tactical benefits to his team like
calling in missile strikes or warning
his teammates of impending danger
there's also a nifty new single-player
mode called test range giving players a
free and open place to test out and
practice with the different weapons and
vehicles so they don't go in blind to a
match and anger everyone with their
horrible piloting skills now all that
being said just like in the
single-player mode the multiplayer mode
is having a lot of stability issues
right now there have been a lot of
crashing matches or even just having
problems connecting to them in the first
place it was a lot worse at the game's
launch and has been steadily getting
better but it's still a problem
especially if you consider how long a
conquest or obliteration match can last
and having all of that effort go to
waste those of you that have already
bought the game know this pain but if
you have yet to and you still want to
based on what you've seen in the
gameplay you have the benefit of being
able to keep your ear to the ground and
wait till these issues are less common
now in all honesty with all the changes
together the core experience itself
still feels very much the same new maps
new game modes LEvolution and an
increase in prettiness are all good
things but in the end this game does
little change the opinion of current
fans or dissenters basically if you like
to battlefield 3 you'll continue to like
battlefield 4 as long as the current
stability issues don't cause you to fly
into a rage if you've never been a fan
of the series even with trying it this
one's going to do very little to change
your mind well that was our review of
