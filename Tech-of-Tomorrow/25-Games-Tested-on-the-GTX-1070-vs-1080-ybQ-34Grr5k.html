here once again on tech Oh tomorrow now
a couple of weeks ago we brought you
guys the king of the Pascal ring the GTX
1080 now let's introduce you to its
little brother with 1070 now just
looking at the card you guys can see the
card looks exactly like the GT x 1080
it's based off the same Pascal process
the same 16 nanometer FinFET process all
that's exactly the same just some of the
specs are going to be a little lower the
1070 has a base clock of 1506 and a
boost clock speed of 1683 megahertz it
also ships with 15 streaming multi
processors and 1920 CUDA cores the gtx
1070 features a fully enabled to an an
56 bit memory interface and ships with 8
gigabytes of gddr5 memory and this
provides up to 206 gigabytes a second of
peak memory bandwidth it's 120 texture
units also provide a peak texture fill
rate of nearly two hundred and two Giga
texels a second the gtx 1070 requires a
to card slot and sizes in at 10.5
interests in length and four point four
inches in height another thing you guys
are going to absolutely love about the
gtx 1070 is its low power requirements
the recommended power supply is a 500
watt power supply and it has a single 8
pin power connector that only requires a
hundred and 50 watts to make it work as
you spend the car to run to the back you
guys can see it there's a nice backplate
in the back of the car we all have a
backplate because it keeps our hands
from getting cut and keeps our video
card from getting damaged and also i
were in the back of the card you guys
can see there are two sli fingers for
doing dual sli as far as the connections
go there are three display ports a
single HDMI and a single DVI connection
one thing to take in mind if you do have
a monitor that uses a G sync technology
you will need to use the DisplayPort to
use it like all the GeForce GTX GPUs
based on videos Pascal architecture the
geforce gtx 1070 ships with a new memory
compression engine that offers new modes
for color compression so all in all
those the specs of this beauty now
before we actually jump into the testing
i want to talk to you guys a little bit
about the boost clock speeds and how
this card performed now the maximum
power boost i was seeing with my 1070
now mind you this with the power target
set at under percent the temp set to 83
celsius was a maximum of 1822 megahertz
but this was when it was cool as the
card warms up it dropped to 1700 and 97
megahertz
as I was writing the card the voltage
varied from 900 millivolts to about 933
millivolts as the card started to warm
up and this is what the fan speeds
running around 2,000 100 80 rpms now the
worst throttle I ever saw was at 16
hundred and forty-five megahertz and
this is because the card actually had a
temperature threshold that was over 83
Celsius and at that time you can see the
card starts to throttle down now when we
ran the stress test this is running the
Heaven engine at a continuous loop we
saw maximum temp 86 Celsius but they
generally balanced out at about 84
Celsius and cut out all the throttling
now you have to take into consideration
the base clock on this card is fifteen
hundred and six megahertz and we can see
if the pretty much standard boots that
we're getting is 1784 megahertz so
that's a pretty damn wide boost for the
1070 for those of you wondering what
exactly do we use to test these video
cards on we use the following components
for the motherboard we used a gigabyte
z170 X gaming seven motherboard and
Intel i7 6700 K processor we also use
Corsairs 32 gigabytes of their ddr4 32
hundred megahertz memory a 256 gigabyte
SSD from kingston for a base drive we
also have a foreign 80 gigabyte Drive
from xot tech as our gaming drive so
with that said it's time to rock and
check out 25 games on the gtx 1070 let's
rock
all right folks so there you have it the
geforce gtx 1070 by your friends over at
nvidia and i think for many people out
there i think this is going to be the
sweet spot for them because you can get
this card for under $500 and you guys
can see it's still faster than a tight
neck so it's a really really fast
ask card as far as the temperatures and
all that stuff go you guys saw we were
hitting some really decent overclocking
just through the boost if we want to
increase the fan speeds and do all that
stuff and change the power requirements
to crazy things I'm sure we could boost
the clock even further but those numbers
right out of the box are just absolutely
fan-freaking-tastic and the fact the
card runs pretty quiet at that time I
also like usually through the videos we
usually the system going through the
entire time and you can't even hear the
system like I said the 1070 a bit louder
than the 1080 but not so much you could
be going hey man did you give me a fan
blower so all in all that's good so I
want to hear what you guys have to say
down below i'm morroc you guys been
watching ticking tomorrow and like usual
down below like button we'll have links
to where you guys can see more
information about this card or to get
one for yourself if you're looking to
buy you've been watching tikka tomorrow
if you're not subscribed well you should
be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
