asked for it and we brought it baby
that's right a two thousand dollar
gaming system based off the NZXT Manta
we also say we give a special shout to
the person who named that system and
that's right this person is Stephen
Lance so Thank You Stephen Lance this is
the manticore a two thousand dollar
gaming system with a lot of finesse
starting from the outside in we see the
NZXT mats a mini ITX case this is the
case that was featured in our what is a
curved case video and you guys had a lot
of great comments to say about it for
the mini ITX motherboard we wanted
something very high-end so we went with
the Asus Z 971 plus this is a mini ITX
motherboard without a whole lot of
features on a small board the CPU is the
Intel Core i5 4590 this is a three point
three gigahertz CPU geared for the LGA
1150 motherboard series for the memory
we wanted something that had just a
little bit of bling in it so we chose
the crucial ballistic tactical tracer
now this is an 8 gigabyte kit featuring
2 4 gigabyte sticks its ddr3 and the
speed is 866 megahertz but the really
cool thing is they light up now as far
as the CPU cooler goes I wanted
something that I knew would fit right
inside the Manik case so I got the X 41
now this is a 140 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooling system that does a great
job one caveat however about the Manta
case in itself there's really no room to
install a full sized hard drive it's
pretty much 2.5 drives if you want it to
look nice and clean so in that same vein
we chose a 2.5 drive that we thought
would be suitable now I know some of you
people out there gonna freak out the
price of this and everything else but I
wasn't really looking to make this as a
save money system just to make it a
really cool system so I chose a kingston
hyperx 3k for an 80 gigabyte drive from
my boot and storage but the thing is
with speed transfer rates at what they
are using USB 3.0 you can pretty much
just hook up an external drive and put
all your games and everything else on
that and you'll be absolutely fine
even though you guys can barely see it
powering this system is the Silverstone
tech Strider gold s series now this is a
750 watt power supply that's rated at 80
plus gold it also features a fully
modular design which makes it very easy
to work with for the video card I pretty
much chose as high of an in video car
that I thought I could get inside this
system this is an EVGA 980ti
I just want the reference series model
cuz I didn't need anything really bad
outstanding because I knew I couldn't
put an additional water cooler inside
this system and also I know many of you
people out there have said many many
times in the past I'll wreck if it
doesn't have an OS it's not a full
system so we've also included Windows 10
on a USB stick in the pricing as you can
clearly see though this build is very
nice and very elegant all the cable
management was done well everything
inside the system is completely clean
and nice making that air flow completely
non obstructive and the really cool
thing about that Crucial Ballistix
memory are the green lights that are
flickering whenever the system is on you
guys can also see the SSD mounted on the
back wall and when we spend the system
around and we remove the back panel you
guys can see that all the cables sit
back there very nicely all nice and
tucked away for no-one to see making a
very clean build overall so that's the
system build what parts are in it what
it looks like but how about some
benchmarks
so there she is folks the manticore a
$2,000 gaming system with pretty much
all top-of-the-line parts if you guys
actually check it out every single one
of those parts has great reviews now I
want to say right off the bat I wasn't
trying to design this system or build
this system on any type of budget I was
unlocking and saying oh I want to be
this price or another I just pretty much
wanted to be pretty much the best part I
could get my hands on the reason I
didn't use 16 gigabytes of memory is I
just figured for just gaming and stuff
eight gigabytes always seems to be
enough now I was really trying to at the
end when I started looking at going okay
we could probably keep this thing under
2k so we just went with that amount of
memory now I know you guys out there
I'll have oh my god I could do this with
this I could do that I could build that
feel free I mean go ahead you guys start
your own channel do whatever you want
it's all good with me you know I love
you guys all the way around but for this
particular system we wanted something
that was really nice and then that of
course a badass system it scores great
it runs cool it's very very quiet even
when it's on it runs very almost
silently cuz we kind of have the fans
turned down but still I think if we turn
the fans at the full blast the
temperatures will actually go down even
more but I kind of like my system to run
in silent mode as much as possible that
won't have to hear it I'm sitting there
all I want to do is work or play my
games I don't wanna hear a bunch of fans
none of that going and like I said 980ti
is pretty much the highest card you can
get if you're looking for a single GPU
right now and you want to stick with you
and video stuff you want to go through
the md card use something different in
your build but at the end of the day hey
this is a 2k system I like it
once again the guy out there man and
Steven hey thanks a lot forgive the name
this system if you watch this video and
you see me well send me an email and
we'll work something out most the time
everything's done on Twitter though so
if you have a Twitter thing it's easier
to contact me there so that's it thanks
very much for watching we appreciate you
folks being here would love to hear your
comments down below and the last thing I
want to say is that you know I know that
that SSD is very very pricey but they
sometimes go on sale a lot that a
particular Drive was on sale for 199
dollars just a week and a half ago and
I'm sure it's gonna go on sale again so
you know you can get a fourteen eighty
gigabyte drive out there for much
cheaper but a four and 80 gigabyte SSDs
very very fast and like I said with USB
3.0 those transfer rates are very
very fast so looking at external drive
you'll be just fine
and one last thing before I bounce a
tear since the case is NZXT and the x41
is NZXT if you guys want to completely
control and monitor your system when
you're not at home or even at home you
guys should check out NZXT cam it's
pretty cool now down below I'll have
links to all of these parts and the NZXT
cam and I'm Ehlert
we'll see you guys back from checking
tomorrow for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
