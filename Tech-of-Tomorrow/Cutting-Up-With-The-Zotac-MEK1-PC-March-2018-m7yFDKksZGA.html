cool on the table today from the people
over at zou tech now we all know that
video card prices are just off the
frickin hook right now and really the
only way to get around the high price
video card game is to buy a pre-built
system so ZOTAC sent me this little
killer Jim right here now this is the
mech one gaming system everything's
inside of this box a system I believe is
the keyboard mouse everything you need
but your games in an internet connection
ready to go so let's do something a
little bit different today I've got my
trusty little ninja sword here and I've
also got like two little ninja throwing
I've almost got my own foot and let's
fill those the cameraman hmm almost one
more let's try this these are pretty
cool little throwing a little knives now
he's moving don't move man I can't hit
you if you move quit being a sissy all
right now I wasn't really throwing to
screwing around check it out this is
what's cool today we're gonna be doing
eight basically a ninja sword unboxing
ninja sword right here in my hand up
here but the trusty blade up here we
shall insert the blade into the system
make it cut with the ninja sword
probably little overkill huh what the
hell Overkill's fun big ol giant sword
cut the side here too let's do some side
cutting shall we hope that won't cut my
hand off why I'm doing this all right
that's probably good enough
whoops the idea things going off I think
it's telling me Elric get a different
idea and quit using the damn sword pop
the cap alright there we go that cap
pops and oh this one's being difficult
ninja sword back to the rescue okay
there we go take that off pop this
alright so this is going to be a okay
well never mind alright so here this
little thing we're here to put the
cameraman missed him by that much all
right now oh this is gonna be a little
bit different here let me turn this to
the side because there's actually a box
inside a box once we're done with seeing
these box conception here we go alright
and a giant box which I will throw
on the floor so here we have the box of
the MEC one right here kind of a mini
workout there okay so what all's in the
box let's find out there's two little
tabs over here so I'm going to pop these
little tabs right here then we'll go
ahead and pop these open all right um so
let's tilt this your way yeah here's
what it looks like inside the box you
guys can see there's foam all around the
entire build so that when the systems
being shipped it doesn't get broken also
you saw they do ship it inside another
box so you have two boxes for protection
so you don't have to worry about it
coming unless UPS gets even more crazy
and they usually do and drop it off of a
cliff so where can we go from here
alright let's see here a big old giant
flat box right here
alright let's a probably first check out
the flat box what's in the flat box
everybody move out of the way and let's
look what's in the big giant black of
bucks here are often open alright a
couple rules popping caps over here I
will turn this your direction now so you
guys can see it now we shall go ahead
and pop this cap and then to do it
alright lots of stuff inside of here as
you guys can see so I guess let's start
off by bringing everything out and
showing you guys so first off this
little packet right here we have quite a
bit of stuff that contains all of your
warranty information for doing your
warranty on the system tells you all the
stuff about the system what's inside of
it all that other good stuff a lot of
paperwork manuals that type of stuff
everything you pretty much need now it's
really interesting though is uh you also
get a CD and a USB flash drive to put
your drivers in so it doesn't matter if
you have a CD player you know a lot of
people don't have CD players name but
you don't have to worry about it they've
got you hooked up because obviously
they've got a little flash drive here so
that's pretty cool it'll make things
much easier so we'll start here at the
bottom mouse pad rights right every good
system needs a mouse pad and this system
is no different in fact looks like
everything but the kitchen sink is
inside of here so it's first off let's
we've had oh yeah
this is really nice and here's what the
mousepad looks like it's very nice it's
got a nice smooth surface it's well made
you guys can see it's got a gripping
surface on the back of it so when you
put in your table it's not gonna go
sliding around all over the place and
it's very flat even after it comes
unrolled I could probably just stick it
back in here and roll it back in there
shouldn't be that hard although you know
what I think I'm not going to I think
I'm just gonna keep going but it'll roll
back up nicely I'm sure now we have the
accessories up next so let's see what
all accessories would get it if they can
get this thing out of here alright so
here's the accessories box up there so
okay
inside of here so first off we have the
two Wi-Fi antennas these are for your
wireless gonna need those to keep your
good reception next up the power cord
itself the stands let's open these bad
boys up there's one you get the other
one out so you're Chum - both at the
same time just get them out of here yeah
let's just forget about trying to be the
niceties let me just tear the bag get
these and here are the stands for the
system itself that way the system itself
just doesn't fall over onto its side
like humpty-dumpty and that's pretty
much it for the accessories pad the next
step we have the gaming mouse the little
gaming mouse open it up gold connection
rated cable controls standard controls -
controls on the top adjustable scrolling
mouse wheel got the changing for your
different dpi levels on the side you
have two more buttons so pretty much you
know the standard features you see on
most game mice out there so not bad at
all
especially when it comes in the system
now last up is the keyboard
just pop this baby out of here get rid
of all the sexual stuff so we can
actually take a look at it
obviously a your wrist rest get that up
as you can see that here is a removable
wrist rest like I said before in the k68
review I like a wrist rest for me this
makes it a lot easier and more you know
ergonomic and comfortable from hail
damage now here is the keyboard let me
pop it out here
nice mechanical keyboard the keys all
feel nice as we show you guys the full
review and set it all up and everything
will see you know what all its special
features are but that feels pretty nice
all the keys are obviously going to be
very easy to remove the way it's
designed and if it's spill proof on the
back obviously got your two adjustments
on the back you have your adjustments
for putting it to a different level like
I said I hate a flat keyboard and a lot
of people seem to agree with that so
that's the accessories let's check out
the system so it's kind of trippy inside
here they have kind of like this bungee
cable the zotac bungee cable we're gonna
pull the system out of there nice and
gently put the box over here off to the
side so let me spin this around here
interesting to remove the system you
just you have a little click here of
ba-boom and then we can get the system
out of there let me toss that off the
side whoa slight little bang there sorry
about that system but I'm sure after
what you've been through and shipping
that's probably not going to kill you at
all so continuing along let me just get
this thing or me so I can put the stands
on it so right here here are the stands
for the system I believe they just pop
on yeah they do they just perfectly pop
on smells like new computer so putting
the bottoms on simple slide those bad
boys on there and then like I said the
system stands up straight so internally
they're actually quite a lot of nice
features inside that you can't see so
you guys can see though the mech one is
a really nice
looking slim design system it's made to
be very futuristic looking in that
respect I think it definitely succeeds
now on the very front you have a little
sliding door the door slides down and
you can see the turn-on power button
both sides of the system are pretty much
identical they kind of look like a
spaceship in a way like it's going
through space with the vents that are on
it and then you also in the back of the
system you have another vent on top you
have your power supply plug in to the
right of that you have your video card
in all of its different connections and
then the i/o down below I like those two
antennas that we showed you before they
plug in right there under the Wi-Fi
making it very simple and even on the
bottom you have legacy Mouse and a
couple additional USB ports so all in
all it looks pretty damn cool now
internally powering this bad boy is an
i7 seventy seven hundred sixteen
gigabytes of ddr4 memory I'm not sure
what speed it is because I haven't
plugged it in and tested all that stuff
out yet it also contains a 240 gigabyte
m2 SATA that's really awesome
one terabyte hard drive and there's also
another m2 slot on the board but this is
being occupied by the Wi-Fi currently
and the video card is an 8 gigabyte 1070
TI probably their mini Edition card
which we brought you guys a review of
just the other day so all in all this
thing is a pretty well packed out system
now the price is currently just a little
under $1600 but you have to realize this
if you go on eBay right now or most
these online stores you'll actually see
1070 t is for almost $1000 around $800
seems to be the norm but some people are
getting $1000 these cards I don't know
how so when you're buying a complete
system like the CPU is probably right
under $200 the motherboard inside of its
we're gonna be probably another couple
hundred dollars you know building and
designing something this small and sleek
that all takes money in the R&amp;amp;D
department but overall it's cool it
comes to the mechanical keyboard comes
with a gaming mouse it comes with your
mousepad I mean pretty much all you need
like I said the very beginning the video
all you need is the internet connection
a monitor and then go down all your
games and get your game on now we'll be
bringing you guys a full review of this
we're gonna hook it up in our gaming
room you guys will check it out a little
bit with a nice
monitor and everything else while it all
G synced up and all that good stuff for
you people out there and then we'll see
how this thing really performs in real
life and we'll also find out more facts
about the keyboard we'll find out
exactly which motherboard is and all
that stuff when we bring that to you but
for now this was the unboxing and the
first look of the MEK one buys otech
down below at like button we will have a
link where you can check out more
information for yourself or even buy one
on Amazon and hey if you're not subbed
you know what to do sub and we'll see
you guys back here on the channel for
more giveaways and more goodness of the
PC world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
