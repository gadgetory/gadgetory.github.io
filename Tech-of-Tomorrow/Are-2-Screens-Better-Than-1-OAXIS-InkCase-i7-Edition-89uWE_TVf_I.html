welcome back once again to tech Itamar
now today's video was sponsored by Oh
axis the second screen for your iPhone 7
now today we're going to be taking a
look at the Inc case for the iPhone 7 so
let's jump right in check out the
unboxing the features and why you might
just find this a very interesting case
for your iPhone upon opening the box
you'll see there are four things inside
the package you get the case itself the
user's manual the charging cable and
then last but not least you get the case
removal tool which looks awfully like a
guitar pick even says one point two
millimeters on it so now that we've seen
the box let's talk about the features
now to use the in case is very very
simple
to install it all you do is pop on the
case on to your phone download the app
and then after that everything just
syncs up and works with your phone
absolutely great and me in case I 7 is
also very ergonomic it offers no
obstruction to the phone itself the
first thing to do after you install the
case on your phone is you're going to
need to charge it up but this is great
because it actually contains its own 460
milliamp hour battery so you don't have
to worry about it draining the battery
inside your phone and once you have the
case fully charged all you need to do to
turn on or off is hold down the button
at the bottom for five seconds and to
put the phone case in the standby mode
you simply tap the button once the in
case i7 features three touch buttons for
navigation the center makes the menu pop
up and the other two are for navigation
real quick though Before we jump into
the biggest feature about the incase i7
which is actually its secondary screen
let's talk about the specs the in case
i7 features a 4.3 inch e-ink display it
is a screen resolution of 480 by 800 and
217 dots per inch it has a Bluetooth 4.0
connectivity and the dimensions are 140
point 7 by 69 point 5 by 11 millimeters
and it's very light coming in at 62
grams it's actually so light you don't
even notice the weight on your phone at
all now another thing I want to talk
about about this case is that it does
feature something really different it
features a bubble Pro design now what
the bubble pro design is it's the type
of plastic everything used in the case
and it meets the military spec for
phone drops now if you guys want to see
a totally separate phone drop video make
sure you guys leave a comment down below
and we'll do something special all right
now that we've got those tech specs out
of the way let's talk about the
absolutely best feature about the Inc
case i7 and that is the secondary screen
which has four different modes to choose
from mode number one is picture mode now
what this allows you to do is allows you
to take pictures or choose the
background for your Inc case now mode
number two the e-reader mode is my
absolute favorite thing about the ink
case because for one thing if you're
like me and you're trying to check
things out in bright sunlight you can't
see it why well because your screen just
a blaring non-seeing thing and trying to
find shade or looking at it can
sometimes just not be convenient
whatsoever and with the great anti glare
features that you get on this you can
read your book or check your message to
do anything in bright sunlight without
having to worry about it or strain your
eyes now the secondary screen it's also
scratch resistant I took a tree branch
and my finger and the phone case
suffered no damage whatsoever mode
number three is the widget mode and what
the widget mode allows you to do is it
allows you to check everything on the
secondary screen you can check things
like the time your email schedule events
and you can do that all through the case
mode number four is the save news
article mode now what this means is say
you're out reading something and you
haven't got time to do it at that time
you can schedule it so you can see it
later on with after search for it again
you're somebody who's into your news and
you don't want to miss it that could be
a great feature for you all right Tech
fans so there you have it vo axis in
case i7 version like I said this
secondary screen to me is pretty doggone
amazing the ability to read your book so
I'll have to carry around a second
Kindle with you that's a great feature
all in itself I mean think about it
you want to carry that big old Kindle
around through ever when you all you
have to do is flip your phone around and
read it on the back and the anti-glare
features are even better than the Kindle
so that's a really cool feature I don't
know what you guys think but I
definitely want to hear what you guys
have to say
now currently this case is available on
their website for free shipping for one
hundred and twenty nine dollars we'll
have a link down below so you guys can
check that out I want to hear all your
comments about this what you guys feel
about it and definitely if you guys want
to see a severe drop test make sure you
leave a comment down there in the
comments section and let us know i'm
Elric you've been watching tekken
