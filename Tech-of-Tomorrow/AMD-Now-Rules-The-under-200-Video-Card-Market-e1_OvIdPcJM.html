has been an ongoing trend and this is
the battle between AMD and NVIDIA
traditionally nvidia has always had
faster stuff at a higher price
AMD has always had a little bit of
slower stuff and they've been at a lower
price point obviously it's sometimes
this is flipped a little bit but now
we're seeing the trend actually start to
shift for the very first time ever and I
think it's really great news for gamers
around the world now you guys all know
that last week Nvidia released the GTX
1650 card no one really likes that card
and to be quite honest with you and less
it is the version that requires no power
like the zotac I'm not into it I'll say
it straight up it's just well there's
other versions that cost more money
they're like almost $200 at $200 you can
be getting yourself an RX 590 that's
faster and everything else so today's
video is really about this we did a
video the other day comparing one $49
cards - cards priced identically at 149
dollars now some people keep saying that
Oh 100 dollars is an entry level entry
level video card but I'm just going to
tell you this right now if you're
expecting to get 60 frames per second at
1080p and only pay $100 maybe you're
looking about five years in the future
that just where it's at 149 dollars
excuse me
sometimes a little frog in my throat as
I gather my thoughts there what we're
seeing right now though is that AMD
actually is ruling at this price point
at 149 dollars which I feel right now is
pretty much an entry level gaming card
AMD gets the crown you guys have seen
from the tests that we have shown you
that the RX 570 this particular card and
we tested the 8 gigabyte card and yes I
know some people out there gonna go dude
they have some of these cards that are a
hundred and thirty dollars these are the
4 gigabyte version cards the 4 gigabyte
version cards in the test are barely at
all
faster in most cases then the 1650
that's just how it is it'll it'll beat
in some cases by a wee bit but the 8
gigabyte version that particular card
does better across the board so at this
time point right now for anything under
$200 AMD is ruling in this price range
they really are I mean you can get all
the way up until an rx 580 and pay less
than under $200 and if you want to spend
a little bit more and get yourself a 590
all I could just spend about 219 bucks
you might be able to find some of these
unsay Lauren being possibly even mildly
used for even much cheaper than that
so in this current time frame AMD has
finally succeeded and they're doing this
well at beating AMD in both price and
performance that's just how it is
I mean cuz like you said even if the 570
even if the 4 gigabyte version is still
beating it's still beating it period
that's really all that matters with us
by an inch a mile whatever it still wins
at the exact same price point so now AMD
is ruling in this area and it's
something that rarely is ever seen and
with NVIDIA having their prices of their
high-end cars like in the $1400 range I
mean honestly
that puts that card out of reach for so
many people out there in the world now
there's probably a lot of price market
margin which people have always get mad
at as well because they you know they
make the crazy comments about Nvidia
kind of an ingredient all kinds of crazy
stuff like that but honestly those cards
are priced so high there probably is a
shit ton of profit margin in there with
all that you know I'm saying so I don't
know just making only really SuperDuper
expensive cards make people more money I
don't know because it seems like to me
the entry-level and mid-level areas of
computing are where people are going to
be spending the most amount of money
because face it most people want to have
a computer at home and if you're not a
serious gamer but you still want to be
able to game you want a decent card and
now we've proven to you guys
that we can put a system together and
probably we can even went we could have
tightened our belts a little bit more we
could have got this system down to about
$600 so for $600 you can get yourself an
AMD based system that's gonna play all
of your games it'll do halfway decent
editing as well you can do everything
online everything you need to do and pay
$600 now obviously they're going to be
the snobby people out there going to
want the absolute best of the best these
the people at play a whole lot of games
and are really in the gaming I mean
that's kind of how I started my career
doing this stuff I started out just
being a gamer and loving to play games I
loved playing games so much I started to
want to write about it I was like oh man
well what can this computer do and what
computer can that do how does this play
these games you know who my god is like
really exciting stuff and this was back
like pretty much in the dinosaur area of
the PC industry and back then this same
type of thing was going on you prayed a
really high premium for the best stuff
and then the other stuff was cheaper but
really AMD now has successfully
checkmated Nvidia at the sub $200 price
range so anything that's going to be
under $200 right now Nvidia is pretty
much ruling that market
I'm sure Nvidia is gonna have their take
on this and everything else because
everybody has their opinion let's just
face it but we've done the testing and
for me if I had less than $200 in my
pocket and I was gonna build a system
and get a video card I would definitely
be going the AMD route at this time
plate if I'm gonna be an uber snob and I
really gonna play a lot of games sure I
might get a 280 yeah I mean excuse me a
20 80 and I might go for that direction
if I really want or one of the other
cards but for anybody who is please
games but games don't completely rule
their life you can build a system for
under six hundred bucks
using AMD parts and an rx 570 and you're
in like Flynn and other people out there
said hey man I'd really upgrade and get
myself but 580 well you know what if you
want to kick in a few more bucks 40 more
bucks guess what you can do that but
you're still under that 200 dollar price
range so this particular video I'm all
have links down below to just
a whole bunch of different cards you
know that you guys same kind of choices
too in this particular price range so if
you're looking to get yourself an RX 570
we'll have some down there to look at
we'll also have some 580 s to recommend
for you folks so just know if you're
tight on cash and you want some that's
gonna deliver and you've only got a
limited budget then hey
AMD right now is the clear winner under
$200 they're gonna take home the tech of
tomorrow product of the year for the
budget category and video cards for the
rx 570 peace hey if you're not sub you
can sub and you can try turning on
notifications because sometimes will to
notify you also we'd love for you to
follow us on Twitter we'll have a link
