again
e3 that's right can anyone say game
frickin overload we're gonna be covering
the entire show and bringing you pretty
much everything that we can so starting
off my Christoph had a ton of world
premiere trailers from small games like
Spirit Fair and tales of a rise to big
games like Lego Star Wars and the new
george RR martin game
Elden ring if you guys don't know this
guy just think of winter is coming you
know what I'm talking about
now Xbox showcased 60 games 60 games
that's right man 14 from Xbox game
studios and over 30 games premiering
with Xbox game pass now the Xbox game
passed for PC which was announced last
month launched in an open beta on Sunday
and includes games such as rise of the
Tomb Raider Wolfenstein 2 and prey they
plan to have over a hundred gains by
August and it's only $10 a month for
unlimited play that ain't bad the Xbox
game pass is also out and includes games
such as Batman Arkham Knights Metro
Exodus and Borderlands the handsome
collection you know the good-looking one
like me the Xbox game pass ultimate now
includes the xbox game pass for PC along
with xbox game pass for console and Xbox
Live Gold there were just a couple of
games launching on the Xbox game pass
these are dead static drive star
renegade tabs cross code River bond
secret neighbor and a few more
they also announced minecraft dungeon a
Minecraft game with 4 player local or
online co-op which will be out in spring
of 2020 so a little bit of a wait there
Microsoft also showed us a Star Wars
Jedi fall an order trailer which really
looks pretty cool
now the release date of this isn't that
far away it's 11:15 2019 and for all
those fans out there Oh Star Wars and
all their games which I happen to be
included this is gonna be something that
I can't wait to come out and I'm sure
there's lot to die-hard Star Wars fans
out there who feel the same way we also
get an update on cyberpunk 2077 and
guess what
Gianna Reese is one of the characters he
revealed it at the show he also came out
on stage to reveal the release date of
cyberpunk 2077 which is out 4:16 2020
and something that actually happened
that's quite funny is somebody in the
audience shelled out you are
breathtaking and guess what Keanu yelled
right back at him you were breathtaking
as well what a genuine dude right thumbs
up for Keanu another update was on Gears
5 which they showed a release date of
September 10 they also gave us a glimpse
of Gears 5 escape a 3 player co-op mode
Xbox also teased us with a terminator
dark fate character pack available when
you pre-order or play Gears 5 with Xbox
game pass by September 16th I guess I'll
be back for that Xbox also announced
their Xbox elite Wireless series 2
controller that's right a new controller
the controller has adjustable tension
thumbsticks
which is the first I've ever seen
actually a kind of a cool feature it
also features shorter hair trigger locks
new wraparound rubberized grips and even
three gamer profiles all built into the
controller itself so you can actually
have three different control
configurations for three different games
now this controller is supposed to be
available 11 for 2019 so not too long
the wait
they're one cool announcement I liked
was a Lego expansion pack for Forza
horizon 4
I love that game anyways but now lego
speed champions will be available June
13th and they even had a life-size Lego
McLaren Drive on stage you gotta admit
that's cool
who doesn't dig Legos
now Microsoft finished out the press
conference with a new Xbox console
project Scarlet's the process of the new
Xbox is supposedly custom designed with
Zen - and Navi technology from AMD
this will make it four times more
powerful than the current Xbox one X the
new Xbox also includes GD r6 memory with
frame rates up to 120 frames per second
and they claim it'll do this at 8k this
I gotta see
sounds like hype it also includes
next-gen ray tracing and a new
generation of SSDs in which they say
they use as virtual Ram and this is
supposed to give the new Xbox more than
40 times the performance increase over
the current generation consoles now
really the big thing about all this is
to get rid of all those boring ass
loading screens now projects go it will
arrive a holiday 2020 and will launch
with Halo Infinite which they showed a
new trailer for as well and it looks
pretty cool so there you guys have it
that is day one of ether we've got a lot
more coming like usual we'll have links
down below to all this information so if
you want to check out more information

information for yourself
