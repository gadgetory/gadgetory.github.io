going on today but before we jump into
the gaming let's real quick here word
from today's sponsor hey guys is soccer
your thing are you into the players are
you into the game well if you are check
this out
FIFA 19th has hit the market it's
regularly $59.99 but it's currently on
sale for $54 on SCD key and with an
additional coupon you can get even more
savings
so if soccers your thing get into FIFA
19 today don't forget about the ultimate
and championship editions as well to get
your savings on just use the key SK 19
alright so if you're into soccer there
you go FIFA 19 on the cheap even so
check this out a few days back maybe a
week now I talked to you guys about
how's it gonna be setting up this three
monitor gaming system with the ex3 203
monitors now these are those BenQ
monitors that I reviewed there 32 inches
wide they feature free sync they have
HDR they're really just really nice
monitors and they come to market at
about $700 a piece which I mean seems a
little bit pricey but when you're
talking about building a giant surround
area I mean it's really crazy and the
numbers are on this and the numbers on
this honestly are just in sane really
insane I guess the dog wants so bad to
me the video he's over here scratching
my chest you can see pull them up here
for a second since he wants to be in the
dang video so bad so I just got this all
set up this week we've got a pretty
decent system going on and also going to
be bringing you guys a video this week
because I told you guys that you could
build a really nice AMD gaming system
for under $1000 I'm gonna be bringing
that to the table this week as well so
pay attention for that but right now
though before I talk to you guys you
know about all the different scores and
all that stuff let's just take a look at
the three games and see how wonderful
they look on this set up now you guys
can see the setups all back behind me
I'm kind of waiting right now for a Zeus
to release their product they have this
product that you can stick in between
the monitors that totally gets rid of
having like you know looking it
little bezel between them it pretty much
gets rid of that altogether although
when you're in game you really don't
notice that you're so busy in the game
and you're kind of your peripherals are
just checking out all that you know
extra landscape that you really don't
even notice the small amount of bezel
that's on it whatsoever I thought that
I'd notice it a lot more when I was
doing my gaming but I started playing
the games I was like you know what this
really is it that noticeable whatsoever
so real quick though let's check out
tomb raider in what I would call ultra
ultra ultra widescreen so if you're
wondering what the resolution is and
what you're watching will you're
watching it at eleven thousand five
hundred and twenty by twenty one sixty
that's right I said it
eleven thousand five hundred and twenty
by twenty one sixty now this is just
huge pretty much going side to side it's
almost like having 8k now obviously the
up and now at 21 sixty that's just your
standard 4k but with that number of
eleven thousand five hundred and twenty
that is just a lot of landscape now I
told you guys I'd talk to you about the
system so this is an AMD based system
completely as well the CPU were running
is the 1900 X thread Ripper CPU this is
an eight core CPU with 16 threads really
nice CPU honestly runs just as good it's
pretty much any Intel CPU of I've ever
seen in gaming next $3.99 motherboard 32
gigabytes of RAM we have a couple of
different SSDs and hard drives in there
to store all the different games now the
only thing I feel that this system is
lagging and you guys will agree with me
is in Tomb Raider you know we're only
getting 19 frames per second at this
resolution and games got a little bit
choppy in some places although it was
never completely unplayable I'm gonna
clarify that it wasn't unplayable it was
just at 19 frames per second so the card
that I have in right now is a Vega 64
I'm obviously I'm gonna go out and get
another one put two of those in
crossfire and see how much those scores
improve because I just don't feel these
scores are all that great but as you
guys can see in Tomb Raider though I
mean everything still just looks frickin
amazing
I think with another video card the
numbers are going to go up even
more
now this next game it kind of does trip
me out because dos X dou X however you
want to say it tomato tomahto this game
has been out for quite a long time and
it only got 14 frames per second in mind
you we're running all these games at the
low settings if I put everything up to
the completely high settings probably
would even run this resolution by scope
but you guys can see even this game
though just looks amazing it's just
right now a matter of getting the right
power balance with this so that I can
get more frame rates on the screen now I
know there's rumors out there that that
the brand-new 411 7 driver from Nvidia
will support free sync and a workaround
if I can't get the actual frame rates
that I want with using two vegas 64's
and obviously i'll switch up and I'll go
to my 220 ATT eyes and I'm sure those
cards are palet you know power this
without any problem at all it'll do it
like it's a breeze but I really need to
work on getting that free sync feature
to actually work and work well before I
bring a video like that and make sure
that everything works so there's two
games out of three now let's check out
for honored and this actually did pretty
decent 40 frames per second better than
the other games and the graphics will
look really nice so we could probably
turn the settings up on this just a
little bit and still get the same
performance as we were getting in the
other two games the biggest thing about
all of this though is just all that huge
real estate and how beautiful I mean
that looks I mean when you're in the
game and you're sitting there playing it
the distance that we're playing it the
peripheral stuff just really goes all
the way around your eyes so you feel
like you're almost you know inside the
game you're more embedded in the game
now obviously if they had a way to make
the surround sound so it went completely
around you and like you maybe make BBB
some kind of tricky green screen that
they made that you know was seamless and
went around and you had that that would
probably make it really seem like you're
in real life but then you're probably
gonna have to use some of that stuff
that's more virtual reality and stuff
like that you're going to have to
definitely do stuff like that because
you're gonna want em you know be
interacting with the game more now
Nvidia says that with their new stuff
that we're gonna see a whole lot of new
change
is in VR so hopefully we'll see a VR
change we can maybe kind of mix this
type of surround sound thing into the VR
barn blend but make it so it's like more
affordable so people can jump into it
now the next thing I'm going to do
though is I'm going to test my racing
games racing games to me are like one of
my favorite things to do I didn't really
have a lot of time to do that actually
the last couple of weeks have been
really hard with the launch we had a lot
of people getting sick and me sick too
and everything was just like completely
tumbled over and we've been trying to
catch up with all this stuff since then
but for the price of these three
monitors you might go oh my god Eric you
know three times seven hundred is just
ridiculous well three times seven $2,100
I mean last year people were paying that
for a video card my worth of it's just a
fact so if you want this type of setup
it's gonna cost you a little bit of
money but if I get the chair
let's share I have upstairs excuse me
it's called the throne now the throne
chair has vibrations and all this kind
of stuff in it so I've got a
force-feedback joystick this chair you
know excuse me a racing wheel type thing
I'll bring this video guide to you guys
to you next week
got a racing wheel all this other stuff
now I know I'm not going to be able to
you know make that huge setup like you
saw you know if you went to CES or saw
the videos they this giant car thing
where the car is like moving all around
it's like you're in a real car I
obviously don't have the Duckett's for
that whatsoever so I'm gonna do what's
called the ghetto-fabulous version of
that you know what I mean I'll still
have petals and the joystick and all
that stuff I just won't have all that
you know pneumatic stuff moving me
around like I'm really in that really in
the game but I mean it'll be a much
cheaper solution when we get that all
set up I'll bring that to you guys as
well now if you guys had suggestions as
you always do
what would you suggest if you were doing
a setup like this with this particular
setup satisfy you or would you just be
like you know what at those frames per
second it's really just honestly not
worth it and and truthfully with those
frames per second with just one video
card
yeah investing in those three monitors
is kind of a crazy thing but I plan on
trying different video cards and you
know even putting a second video card
you know in here to up those numbers but
the point I really wanted to make with
this video is just how beautiful and how
great these
their monitors work you know in a
surround vision type situation and you
guys can see that with that really small
bezel man these monitors are pretty much
I feel a perfect candidate for doing
this type of thing now if they had a
monitor that absolutely no bezel at all
and you could pop them right next to
each other that'd be even cooler but we
haven't technologically got to that
particular place yet and until we get
there like I said I'm waiting for this
product from a Zeus that they showed if
you guys happen to miss this product it
was actually really cool what it did is
it is it fit in between each one of
these monitors things start for turning
around it fit in between each one of
these things it's kind of a plastic
thing when it did it spread the light
and it made it through you were looking
at it it really didn't look like there
was a bezel whatsoever and honestly it
was ghetto cheap it was like only like
200 bucks this particular product now
I've been bugging these guys for like
for the last year asking hey when's this
product coming out guys I really want to
show it off but it's always it's been
delayed it's been delayed hey I don't
know maybe it's not coming I don't know
I'm starting to honestly think that
though I'm starting to think that hey
you know maybe this particular product
just isn't going to see the light of day
but why it's not I don't know the only
thing that I can think of is maybe they
tested it with their own particular
monitor brenner only works with their
stuff for some weird reason although I
don't really know why that would be
happening but that's really the only
thing I can think of either that or
they're just really not happy with it
but I saw it at the event you know and I
thought it was a really nice product
especially for the price that it was I'd
gladly pay it even for the way that it
was working before me personally it
would it would just make that experience
just that little you know tiny wee bit
better so I want to hear you guys
suggestions do you guys particularly
like these three monitors in this thing
because I do I think it's a really great
solution I'd love to hear your guys
solution as well the system that we're
using yeah it's a complete AMD system
it's really kind of decked out
definitely need another video card I
mean come on 19 frames per second 14
frames per second and even though for
honor had 40 frames per second still
you're like what no but hey 40 frames
per seconds getting close that's only
you know 20 frames per second lower than
most people feel is like hey the decent
gaming value
so if I get to 60 frames per second in
all these games that would definitely be
a thumbs up I don't know if to Vegas 64
cards will power that but I'm sure that
two of the 28 he's had the cameraman
shaking his head come on no way dude
you're dreamin man you're on a pipe
dream
no just not I haven't smoked Jack diddly
maybe and maybe I should maybe it'll
make me think but anyways Cameron
chickens have you saying no frakkin way
so it probably isn't going to be enough
power but I know that 220 ATT is will be
enough to power this a decent framerate
so that'll be the next video that we
bring you guys actually you know what
I'd actually wish I could hear from you
guys what you would like to see first
would you like to see 264 x' and
crossfire first would you like to see
the video with all the gaming stuff and
a ghetto-fabulous
racing setup first or would you like to
see a video with 220 ATT eyes powering
this this thing and see how it runs all
have a thing appear will you guys can
vote and tell me what you want it well
whatever one is voted the highest is the
video that will do
so I'm Network you guys been watching
taking tomorrow I gotta say this is a
lot of fun it still has a poor potential
we can still make it even better than it
is now and make it more brutal and
stronger but that's the direction we're
heading so make sure you vote let me
know what you want to see if you guys
are in the soccer we'll have a link down
below to that thanks for watching the
channel we'll see you guys back here for
more tech on teka tomorrow
