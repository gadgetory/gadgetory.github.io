you know that music is a very integral
part of my life I mean I live for music
it's a part of my life every day and
music can really like change the way you
feel I saw this post either date a
friend of Mines house it was like music
plus everything the music could do and
there was just so many things on there
that music does for you it makes you
happy makes you emotional can change
your mood like I don't know I love music
I think many of you guys out there are
my fans you guys love music as well so
today's product is something really cool
it's by the folks over at Yamaha and
it's their brand new music cast wireless
speaker systems now this is the o3o
series and these things are cool they
come in white they come in black they're
30 watt speakers and internally they
have a three-and-a-half inch woofer a
one on one eighth tweeter and then a
passive radiator that's powering these
things in their 30 watt so these things
can actually power a twenty I think a 28
foot room so it's pretty cool so if you
have basically nothing blocking your way
you hook the speaker in there that whole
room will be filled with sound and
that's pretty cool now these speakers
will work with basically all the popular
music gaps and to use them it's very
simple you just plug in the speaker get
on your phone install the app and go and
another really cool thing about this is
with the app you can actually if you
have two these speakers you can use them
in stereo so it's pretty cool stuff all
the way around now Yamaha's been making
products essentially for as long as I
can remember if you were actually
walking around my house you would see
that personally I'm a fan of Yamaha
stuff my car stereo might receiver in my
living room that's been one of the ray V
receivers I've been using for years I
like Yamaha stuff I have a couple of
their guitars used even have a Yamaha
motorcycles so you can say I like Yamaha
stuff do you think we've had a keyboard
at one point yeah that's right huh big
old giant keyboard from Yamaha so Yamaha
stuff is geared for music from the
musician to their audio products so
what's real quick though let's jump in
and let's just see how easy it is to
actually use these speakers let's real
quick take a look at the aesthetics of
these speakers and see how nice they
really are from the front they offer a
very nice curve and elegant look and on
the back they're flat and there's
different type of connections on the
back you have your power cable
underneath your neck connection now like
I said before getting up and going with
the wx0 3-0 series is very very easy to
do
each speaker comes an including power
cable and all you need to do is connect
this power cable to the back of the
speaker plug it into available wall
outlet and then you're ready to go to
get the speaker's up and going all you
have to do is simply tap the power that
turns on the power and to get the
bluetooth you hold it down for four
seconds
now the WX 30s can be used natively out
of the box with your Bluetooth but if
you want to use other things you need to
install the music cast app and once you
get the music cast app installed you
have access to some of your favorite
musical programs such as Rhapsody Sirius
XM Apple's AirPlay Plus Pandora and
Spotify which is actually my favorite
some really cool things about the app
are the ability to add multiple speakers
in your chain by simply using the
linking feature and to actually use two
speakers and stereo through the app as
you guys can see the apps are just the
way that you're used to using them
there's nothing really different about
them you don't have to retrain yourself
it's everything you're used to all
within the music cast app the thing that
I think that's the most really coolest
feature though about these music cache
speakers is that not only do they
receive signal they send signal as well
which means if you have the speaker in
your bedroom and you don't want anybody
hear what you're doing you can actually
hook up a set of wireless headphones and
connect through the speaker and use that
as your base so that's actually
something really cool I think that's
great
also if you'd like to mount the wx0 3-0
on a wall it's very easy to do on the
back of the speaker there's a little
threaded plug right here which you can
mount right to your wall now the only
thing I don't like about really mounting
these things to a wall though is that
obviously since they have to be plugged
in there's going to be this obtuse cable
hanging all the way down off the wall
which I really don't like so I'm sure
there's ways to get around you can
probably modify your house to do it but
that for me is like a cavity that I'm
not really too happy with I think no I
don't know this is not my thing other
people may disagree let me hear your
comments down below I always love to
hear them um but pretty much real quick
now let's take a listen to these
speakers and see how loud they actually
get at 30 watts I think you guys would
be surprised at how
they work
and
Oh
I'm
can you
you
you
so oK we've covered the specs we've told
you what's inside of these bad boys
we'll let you hear what they sound like
and all that but they also have another
feature that haven't talked about yet
and that is the ability to work within
the music cast system of the Yamaha now
they have all these brand-new AV
receivers which have separate actually
rooms that you can use it's really cool
these receivers that they're having and
I'm going to have one to review for you
folks so you guys get to check this
technology out are just simply
incredibly you have other zones so
basically when you're running a receiver
in the living room listening and stuff
you can actually have different stuff
playing in the different zones in your
house so like I could be watching a
movie my kid could be listening to
something another room my daughter and
another and if we've had another third
speaker the dog could even be having his
own jam somewhere in the house so that's
all pretty cool stuff now at the end of
the day some of the cabinets for me are
this these things are very very basic
the trebly part of the speaker to me is
not really on the high end a lot of
people prefer that it's kind of you know
to me more kind of a gaming type of
sound I like a lot of high end tweeter
you can obviously adjust things you know
through your application you can go in
there usually and adjust the equalizer
and all that stuff but there's no way to
actually adjust it on the speaker which
I thought would have been really cool I
could actually adjust the bass or the
treble on the speaker trouble but I say
trouble trouble on the speaker's played
really really really better sometimes
that first in your talk in my mouth
shots get all dry wrong I work at
scratch but these things come to market
about $249 I think you can probably find
them on sale different places what links
down below you guys can check some of
these things out but if you want pure
Yamaha quality something that's very
well-made with a name that you know that
you can trust with a great warranty and
a company that's basically just been
around forever these things are
something going to want to really check
out the XM 0 three zeros they may not be
the real reinvented but for people that
are looking for a wireless speaker that
does more than just work off your phone
and can actually be integrated into a
home audio system these are the a ticket
I'm Miller if you guys been watching
teka tomorrow we'll see you back here in
the channel like I said all this
information will be down to like button
and to check it out I'm even going to
give a pair away so
see you later Soha for those you stuck
around know you guys are asking well
how's this contest going to work really
all you guys need to do is leave a
comment down below with the hashtag I
love Yamaha and in ten days from now I
will pick a winner and I will announce
it on this channel as well as all the
social media stuff so stick around for
more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
