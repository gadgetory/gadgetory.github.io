right because they're always dropping
that crap everywhere and you don't want
to break it you don't want to destroy it
you basically want your phone to be
protected now the samsung galaxy s3 it
is one hell of a great phone and all
kinds of people out there use it in our
fans of the Android technology they're
like a frickin gang so what's up guys
I'm network Ferris here in Tekken
tomorrow and I'm here to do the unboxing
installation of the super allegro pro by
the people at aks it says a case the way
a is done now what the heck that exactly
means I don't know but I do know that
cases range all the way down from like
five bucks all the way up like 60 bucks
depending on what they do this one was
about 13 bucks but it looks like it's
going to be a pretty solid product I
bought it on amazon because you guys
know me I'm a prime member at free
shipping so i buy stuff to there all the
time I just thought hey I wasn't really
happy with the last one I had it was
pretty durable and pretty tough but
after a while I don't know just was like
huh need change so with that said let's
check it out i'll show you guys in front
of the box right up here we'll do this
freestyle mode because there's not going
to be too much crazy to this here's the
back where you can see the minimum pc
requirement so I'm just kidding no
requirements required isn't that cool
and they have a galaxy s3 phone it's
about your requirement so anyways go
ahead at the top of the box here people
say they're bored with my knives so i'm
going to use mine i'll just go ahead and
crack that thing open you know pull it
out and I else in there nope pitch just
the case from outer space I'm just
kidding so there it is all in its glory
and we'll go ahead and take my galaxy s3
phone right here I'm going to come up
closer to the camera range so you guys
can see this very close up anyways so
here we have the case and the phone
we're going to go ahead and just gently
put the phone inside of here
snap it into place you hear all the the
water beating around as I try to just
pop the thing in there almost there
there we go so that's it folks pretty
simple installation leaves the proper
holes open that you need no mess no
press I guess there's a little part down
here I'm still trying to get pressed in
there we go so there we have it
installed ready to go and rock and roll
in a couple seconds not bad and you guys
are always saying it's dropped it
doesn't matter all right camera let's go
over here so I don't know I don't know
how far off the ground this is but I'm
not dropping in some eggs red you might
think I'm destroying my phone but but
check out this is what normal people do
their in their house I mean yeah
sometimes you're outside the door at a
drop test in the house so here we go
it's dropping and look my phone should
be okay let's pick it up and it yep good
to go super Allegra pro by a case
thirteen dollars or less i got on amazon
you can just google that up and
find out where you want to get it at but
it's pretty cool snaps on very easily
like i said it's pretty simple not much
to this thing i guess that if you want
you can pull different parts of it off
and separate it I'm still like sitting
or screwing around because I'll probably
try to take a day or two to I totally
used it but the volume controls all work
so I'm impressed not bad cheap easy
ready to rock and roll see you later
I'll go make phone call to someone who
cares</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
