you here once again so first off a
couple of clarifications before we move
further into the video so check it out a
little while back we made a video and we
were showing you guys battlefield 5 when
we were showing you how RT X and this
thing's we had a dad pretty much like
really took a lot of frame rights off
the game now a lot of people and even
Nvidia have told me that you know all
the high settings are broke and you need
to run the game on low settings so I you
know pretty much proposed the question
we locate well on low settings are we
still losing frame rate so there was
like yes so whether we ran the game on
the ultra or the low the frame rates
being cut would pretty much be the same
although I guess that I did
misunderstand understand something when
I was speaking with these guys and you
know I was sick at the time I pretty
much thought that they had told me that
RT X was going to be you know like I
said my video is going to be able to run
all these games without a massive hit
well they said but that's not what they
told me and I misunderstood the minutes
possible so if that's true hey my
apologies to anybody out there obviously
great racing in the beginning right now
is definitely going to be taking a lot
of frame rates off you know of your
games that's just how it is it's new and
when technologies new that's just how it
is mainly I guess the Nvidia really just
wants to press that they could have just
made a card that did more frames per
second like they always do but why do
that let's do something different so
they introduced this rate racing stuff
and yes even though the world and all
the games out there really aren't quite
ready for it yet I mean I guess you know
the card is there it has the stuff on it
we've seen you know AMD do the same type
of thing they had you know chips back in
the day that were already supporting
stuff that wasn't even out they had
64-bit support for windows before 64-bit
windows was even there so I mean
sometimes I think the tech does get
ahead of the product that's out there
and hence this thing so one other
clarification we made a video and we
talked to you guys about Final Fantasy
15 and we said that Arctic scans located
I guess it was never supposed to have RT
X it's just DL SS so and they're saying
that this is still going to happen on
the game it's underworks they've just
like transferred a lot of the
development
I think and so that particular thing is
being done so we're going to be able to
see that in the game and today's video
we can trend real quick before we jump
in today's video let's here just a quick
word from today's sponsor Corsair the
Corsair k70 mark 2 is lightweight
durable and built to last forever
featuring German made Cherry MX key
switches you'll get the reliability and
accuracy you demand in your game you get
maximum grip and feel as well with
textured and contoured key caps it's
also compatible with Corsairs IQ
software so you can customize the RGB
any way you want and if bright white
just happens to be your color the
special edition is available as well so
if you're looking for a kick-ass gaming
keyboard and check out the corsair k70
mark 2 today alright so there you have
it looking for a killer keyboard will
then check that baby out we'll have a
link down below so today we're going to
be talking about the new Colossus the
latest in the line of Wolfenstein games
whether you're getting chased around by
bad guys and you're killing them and
blowing them up and today we're gonna be
testing the latest thing on the brand
new artix cards this is the adaptive
shading and in this particular video you
will see that this particular aspect is
really nice it actually is things look
better you're not getting any kind of
really performance you know Nicks at all
in fact I'll just make a spoiler you're
actually getting better performance yep
so check that out better performance
with it on than using anything from
before so that's an improvement
ok and there's a lot of different ways
that you can use this adaptive shading
you get controls for motion influence
now what this is is the shading rate
sensitivity to motion you get quality
which is a distribution between coarser
and finer shading you get colored
different sensitivity which is the
shading rate sensitivity to color
differences between neighboring pixels
hopefully everybody loved
neighbor and last but not least the
brightness sensitivity which is shading
rate sensitivity to dark regions which
means different areas that are dark you
can adjust them to your satisfaction and
what you like to see the customer
controls are really really cool and I'm
sure people are out there gonna be
playing around them and come up with all
kinds of different custom settings that
make their PC run the absolute best that
it can but for today's testing we just
ran the three different presets now
these three different presets offer
three different types of a gaming
experience you get balanced performance
and quality and we tested all of these
presets at all the resolutions 1080 1440
and glorious 4k for the test system
shown in today's video we used in our TX
2080 card we used in a Zeus maximus hero
motherboard and i7 8700 K 32 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory for boot drive we're
using a corsair 500 gigabyte SSD and we
have to fire cuda Seagate drives that
we're storing all of our games on so
with that said let's rock out to the new
benchmark song and let's check out those
scores
okay you're back so you guys can see
that even with the new adaptive shading
on you're getting really good numbers on
balance we see eight frames per second
more on performance we see 10 to 15
frames per second more and on quality we
see 1 to 7 frames per second more so all
in all no matter which one of the
presets you use you're getting better
performance and I'm sure with custom
settings depending on your system you
can go in there and play around that and
probably even fine-tune it to get even
better scoring for your particular
system so Final Fantasy 15 is the only
game so far where you can run a
benchmark and CDL SS but I'm really
waiting for an actual game to come out
so we can see its performance and bring
it to you guys so so far in my book it's
been this ok you know we have all the
ray-tracing yes it does take a
performance it makes stuff look pretty
good some people say it's not what they
like but it does make things look more
realistic more shining a lot more
reflections and all that kind of cool
stuff and we see with this brand new
adaptive shading and that they've done
something cool and you can turn it on
and get a better looking game and still
get better performance so at the end of
the day I have to say that this is a
definite win out of all the stuff I've
seen so far this to me has a lot of
potential because it's probably pretty
easy to implement a lot of games so
hopefully we'll see this type of stuff
coming in all the new games and
hopefully some of the older ones as well
I milk you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow like usual we'll have a link
down below to the card in the parts that
we use so if you want to get a system
like ours you can do it and we'll see
you guys back here on our new protector
tomorrow for more videos so be sad if
you're not sug you know what to do and
hey make sure you have notifications on
it you just won't get notified you won't
be one of the cool kids you'll be left
out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
