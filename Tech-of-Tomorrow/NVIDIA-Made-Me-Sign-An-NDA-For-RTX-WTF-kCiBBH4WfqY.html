with even further discounts now like I
said I had to sign an NDA agreement with
Nvidia but the thing is is that I'm
tripping out on how it's kind of being
perceived around the internet and before
I jump into that my last few videos it
seems like people are like tripping out
and saying oh you've been paid for
Nvidia you can't say anything nice about
Nvidia I want to you know clarify some
really really valid points here in any
of my videos that I've made thus far if
you watch them have I once recommended
to you to buy the new r-tx cards even
once did I ever say hey you should buy
these cards I recommend from teka
tomorrow to go buy these cards I've
never once said that honestly not even
once have I said that also I said that
Nvidia can't fail with their r-tx
everybody peoples like oh my god they're
mad they're upset the bottom line is the
numbers pretty much show that Nvidia is
leading everything they sold out of all
their presale cards they've made lots of
money and this is probably going to
translate into them dropping prices on
the previous generation cards which is
great for gamers it actually is a really
good time if you guys should be going ok
cool now all those 1080i cards and stuff
that I want to buy in the past I can now
probably be able to afford one and stick
one in my system you don't have to go to
RTX what so ever it's the
if you want a lot of eye candy in
certain games so if you want all the eye
candy turn on you don't want to lose any
frame rates then sure RTX may be for you
but um 1080i has been doing me good
that's what I've been using for gaming
it works absolutely great there's no
reason I see that you have to upgrade
whatsoever so I've never said to jump on
the new bandwagon when I said that
there's no reason that they can fail
it's because of the numbers game that's
what I'm talking about and this is
reality nothing I said in that video
makes me a paid person from Nvidia I
haven't been paid any money from Nvidia
ever to say anything about their cards
so with that stuff said and clarified
let's talk about the NDA agreement so we
see that Kyle Bennett from heart OCP is
like spreading all this stuff around the
internet saying you know Nvidia is this
evil company trying to make me sign this
NDA they only want us to use their
certain drivers they're controlling who
the board partners give the video cards
to on lunch date okay of course that's
how it is that's what an NDA agreement
is it's a non-disclosure agreement and
when you sign that agreement you're
agreeing that until launch day just
until launch day you will not release
any type of scores or information that's
under NDA until the time point that they
say it's okay to release this
information there is nothing in there
whatsoever controlling a reviewer I've
been working with the people in Nvidia
for a long long time
even some of the people they're used to
working 3d effects and I was working
with them I've been in the game since
the very beginning I have long-lasting
relationships with both sides now just a
real quick thing the AMD thing like I
accidentally broke an NDA I thought the
NDA was supposed to be 12:00 midnight
the NDA was at 6:30 in the morning I
posted my video I was really sick I went
to sleep the next morning it's been
havoc things have been rocky ever since
that's completely my fault I take the
blame I've apologized to them
we've worked things out somewhat you
know I mean I'm not complaining and
whining that they're not giving me any
samples I buy my samples and just move
on with the day
now when all this GPP stuff came out
last year
Kyle kind of had some stuff going on
between him and NVIDIA about the GPB
stuff he fought with him back and forth
and probably gotten to himself into a
hornet's nest to stuff over there with
them so right now they probably don't
have him on their sampling list because
the things that we're going on I guess
just weren't really probably going on
too well and so instead of fighting they
will cut people off for a year so and
let them deal with it
I've been where I didn't get sampled
from Nvidia as well there were two years
of time where I didn't get sample is
when I first got my feet amputated when
I first got my foot amputated the very
first one I was going in the hospital
and I released my video but it was like
20 minutes early only 20 minutes mind
you but I broke the NDA so therefore I
didn't get sampled those couple of years
I had to work with the board partners
after launch and just eat the crap for
fucking the things that I did at that
point you know to make those things
happen an NDA agreement has never from
Nvidia ever controlled me in any way
through all this time I've ever worked
with him whether I've said something bad
whether I've said something good I've
never been contacted by them ever at any
point and had them tell me hey alert we
don't like what you're saying we need
you to change something retest something
redo something they accept my reviews as
valid because I've been doing this a
long time those who follow me know I
don't make up stuff I don't create
bullshit I bring you guys strictly the
numbers exactly how they are some people
disagree or some of our testing methods
they have other ways of doing things
that's just life there's a billion
recipes for making cake sausage
everything else so there's a lot of
different ways to do things we do things
our way but the NDA agreement doesn't
hinder me in any way whatsoever and
obviously with the AIB partners and
everything they're going to be
controlling who they give the original
samples out to because they're not going
to want those samples to go out to
people who are not like right now under
and league with an NDA from Nvidia so
obviously if you haven't signed and
agreed to an NDA you're not going to be
on the sampling list whether that's from
a board partner or Nvidia but this is
only like once again like I said
at launch time after launch time the
initial launch and the reviews come out
any site out there who's got a
relationship with one of these companies
will be able to call them and say hey
I'd really like to have your car to
please let me test it in those companies
I'd have the good relationships will say
sure no problem sir here's that card and
go ahead and review it it's happened to
me it's happened to lots of sites out
there if you don't want to sign an NDA
and you don't want to have a
relationship with a company don't expect
to get sampled it's not just like any of
us me you anybody else out there has any
right to demand a sample every sample
that we are given is honestly a gift a
straight up straight out gift that you
should be appreciating these companies
pay money for these products they send
them out to us to try to give them good
light on their product I try not to beat
stuff up too much some people don't like
that style they think I should basically
beat up everything from you know the
plastics not the right bright shade - it
doesn't smell right you know I don't
really do that too much unless there's
something about a product that really is
bad and needs to be worth mentioning I'm
usually not going to focus on that I'm
gonna probably try to focus on the more
positive thing that's just my
personality and how I prefer to review
stuff that's just how I am
NDA I signed it didn't bother me
whatsoever there was nothing in it tying
my hands other than the fact that if I
ever get one of their cards I haven't
been sampled yet who knows if I will I
hope I do I don't know for sure but I
did sign the NDA so I hope I get sampled
but if I don't hey that's just the way
the cookie crumbles I'll be bummed but
I'll have to move on with it I'm not
gonna make like a hate video the only
reason I ever made the video about AMD
thing wasn't about the company AMD which
a lot of people mistake it was about a
relationship with a certain person there
who was trying to control me and tell me
what I'm doing and that person is no
longer there so I've tried to work
things out and work with them I haven't
signed in the NDA with them I haven't
got any products really either so I just
keep buying my products off the shelf
which I'll continue to do if that's what
I have to do but an NDA in no way even
from AMD or Nvidia or any company out
there that you're going to sign that
I've ever seen really ties your hand
and says it there may be some companies
out there who have an India it says hey
we need to see you review first we need
to approve your review first we need to
make sure that you know you're saying
what we want you to say and you're you
know on our buddy team car you know I'm
saying here my pal buddy you know I mean
I haven't seen any company actually do
that ever
I had it happen once with AMD but with a
certain person I've never had it happen
with nvidia so all this stuff out there
about oh you know an nvidia is the big
bad wolf because they're making me sign
an NDA it's a lot of hype a lot of guys
are getting a lot of hits on this kind
of stuff I mean because I you know I
know how it is it's like the old song
says everybody loves dirty laundry man
kick them when they're up kick them when
they're down you know that's just how
people like the stuff to be so I've made
a couple of videos that are you know
somewhat in that type of realm sometimes
so I'm gonna say I'm completely immune
to it sometimes those videos you know
actually you know get good hits and
they're kind of fun to make but overall
sometimes those videos aren't always
completely utterly accurate you know and
and what things are being said a lot of
us just speculations speculating on
things and saying hey wow this could be
Wow this could be oh that might be and
all that good stuff so at the end of the
day if you're thinking oh my god and
Vidya is super bad because they're
making people sign an NDA it's not
anything but business as usual that's
all that it is there's nothing new about
this it's been in the business since the
very beginning before there was a
computer industry they at NDA for stuff
before that so this took this cycle of
signing NDA's is nothing new it's
nothing evil why kyle is going on this
you know tirade about that I really
don't understand I mean there's a lot of
stuff going on it's really crazy like
Tom's Hardware you know with their
little thing about just buy it and a
really weird stuff about them talking
about their employees and their stuff I
don't know it just seems like there's a
lot of crazy stuff that's going on like
I said a mother video about it being a
bad time to be a gamer or a sad time
rather be a gamer because there's just
crazy stuff going on there is crazy
stuff going on all over the place but an
NDA it's not one of those strange things
business is usual nothing different
about it if you want to get products
from a company you're going to have to
have a relationship you're going to have
to sign an NDA
if you want to play in any game any game
out there there are rules to every game
that's how life is
