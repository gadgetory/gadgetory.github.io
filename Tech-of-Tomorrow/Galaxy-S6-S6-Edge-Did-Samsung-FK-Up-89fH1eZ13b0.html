new galaxy s6 and s6 edge but did they
 up alright folks before we jump
into today's video i just want to give a
special shout-out to my friend Jonathan
from TLD he went up there to San
Francisco and check that stuff out cuz
you guys all know I'm injured and still
laying here my butt but he got some
great footage and there's a lot of cool
things about these new phones from
Samsung but first off you got to pretty
much anything you've ever known about
these phones as far as the design and
all that stuff you pretty much have to
just toss that out with the window and
expect something totally totally
different now these phones are made
totally different obviously neither
previous generations these are like a
trifecta it's kind of like the galaxy s5
the iphone 4 and the iphone 6 we're all
thrown into a blender and you blend them
together and you came out with hey the
new galaxy s6 and s6 edge now these
things are made out of aluminum and
glass and they look totally totally cool
actually looks like one of the best
phones you're going to see probably this
year just as far as design goes now I
know Samsung in the past seems like
they've failed in some of the design
areas people always complain though
they're not up to par to all the new
stuff well they've taken drastic
measures to actually make these phones
you know close that gap now with all
that said there are two things though
that stand out that are going to make
users out there just go what and the
hell is Samsung thinking and that is no
more removable battery that's right so
for those people out there who dug the
fact of being able to have that
portability remove a battery and stick a
new one in you're not going to have that
now to me personally I don't care about
that feature I've actually never taken
my battery out of my phone back got my
s5 right here I take one of those little
portable chargers around with me and I
just plug the thing into that and away I
go but for some people out there they're
going to say I want nothing to do with
that phone that's your choice now the
next one is though no expandability as
far as memory or anything else so you
can't stick an SD card in there and get
some more expandability what you're
going to get though is that there are 32
gigabytes right off the bat all new
models though have 32 gigabytes of
onboard memory instead of the original
16 on the previous generation so what do
you guys think is a new design worth
sacrificing those features let us know
down below
in the comments now though let's talk
about some of the really cool features
of these new phones now first of all
they each have a 5.1 AMOLED screen and
that amounts to 2560 x 1440 resolution
that's really a high pixel density and a
really tiny screen think about this most
big old monitors have that resolution so
you're going to get that same resolution
in a 5-inch screen so it's going to look
really really clear another great thing
is one-handed use as far as one-handed
use goes my friend from TLD said that he
would actually sacrifice and give up his
iPhone his iPhone that's like saying
give his mom way for Christmas almost
like he's willing to sacrifice his
iphone to have that so that's obviously
a really really great feature being able
to have the phone in one hand look at it
operate everything on it that's actually
pretty cool some phones are too big some
are too small but this one's kind of
like that story about the three bears
this one's just right now the new Galaxy
s6 and the s6 edge feature a lot of the
same features they both have an
eight-core processor they both feature a
16 megapixel camera they both have 3
gigabytes of RAM and they both come with
Android 5.0 lollipop the house will all
have the same 5.1 screen which features
that 2560 x 1440 resolution now the edge
just like the name implies has two edges
on each side unlike the standard Galaxy
s6 now the cool thing about the edge is
that it gives you notifications shows
you the time and it has a couple
different modes it has night mode which
offers lower screen resolution and lower
obviously brightness and this helps
conserve battery life so you can also
set it we roll your finger across it so
it actually brights up to the normal
thing another really cool feature about
the edge and this is actually really is
a cool feature is that you can know if
your phone is facing down who calls you
by this color lighting up on the side of
the phone check this out this looks
really cool so if your mom's calling you
family friend or whatever you can
actually set them up V your contacts and
when the phone rings it'll ring in that
color also when it gives you a message
it will show you that color so you set
up to read if you know that's the
absolute you'll want to talk to you is
calling you up you can just totally
ignore it and if it's green it's mom you
know to pick up that phone earlier video
I talked about batteries now the galaxy
s6
enter has a 25 50 milliamp battery and
the edge has a 2600 milliamp battery now
this isn't going to really result though
at all in the edge having better battery
life in fact battery life in these
things isn't that well at all we'll talk
about that a little bit more but it
basically just bounces out due to the
fact you have that edge that extra
screen will obviously that's going to
take up more battery power true so to
compensate with that they've given the
edge a little bit bigger battery now one
thing that my friend Jonathan touched on
about the video is that one of the
technology doesn't seem to really be
advancing is battery life I mean in all
actuality with my thinking every phone
that I've actually got from Samsung the
battery life just keeps getting worse
and I'm not even joking about this at
all my original one I hadn't had awesome
stuff I had the note to that damn thing
would literally last me three days
without a charge I'm charging this every
day and it seems like with the new and
if I get it I might be charging twice a
day so that's a technology that really
needs to be worked on and I guess it's
true they keep trying to make the phones
you know thinner and thinner and thinner
thing foot in your pocket you guys all
saw the big ass been gate thing flew out
there and all that but maybe having
a little bit bigger phone with a longer
battery life would be something to
seriously think about both the galaxy s6
and the s6 edge both feature a 16
megapixel rear facing camera now this is
the same as previous generations but
there are some new features a much wider
aperture allows for a lot more light to
enter into the camera which allows for
better close up pictures and more
blurred background as well as those low
light situations you'll get a much
clearer picture now the front facing
cameras also improved as well it's gone
from a 2 megapixel to a 5 megapixel with
all those same features one complaint
that people had on the previous
generation galaxy phones was the ability
to quickly access the camera now all you
have to do is double click the home
button from anywhere and you're
instantly into your camera another
really cool feature is tracking
autofocus now what this allows you to do
it actually allows you to track the
person while they're moving and still
keep them in focus here you guys can see
Lamarr Wilson is we're tracking him and
you guys can see this feature works
pretty well I was thinking about maybe
doing a music video with the camera and
seeing how well would actually do that
and locking on to musicians actually
moving around their instruments and just
seeing how well it works now folks
before i bounce out of here i want to
talk about a feature that i think is
actually really great and a lot of you
probably were out there will agree and
this is multitasking now both the new
phones have this there's no difference
between the two now if you go into your
recent apps menu you guys can see
there's a screen on top but if you
scroll down below that you can actually
open a second screen so not only can you
access one thing but now you can XX to
within that apps menu that's a serious
improvement for people who like to do
more than one thing at once this is a
great feature so I'm network you guys
have been watching tech of tomorrow this
has been the video just pretty much
introducing the brand new galaxy s6 and
the galaxy s6 edge all the information
will be down below I want to spend a
special thanks out once again to my
