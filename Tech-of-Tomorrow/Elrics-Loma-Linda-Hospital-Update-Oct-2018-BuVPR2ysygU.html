in the hospital after a nice two and a
half year fight of trying to heal that
foot ulcer I finally lost the battle got
the infection and well here I am and
it's been kind of crazy I even have a
new thing called fall risk and we can't
see the Sun now you fall rest since I
can no longer walk fun stuff right okay
so I got here there wasn't any gangrene
luckily there was however an inch of
bone that had the infection in it so
what they've done so far is they've cut
about two inches off of my foot they've
cut off all of the dead flesh they've
cut off all of the dead bone they
actually took my ulcer and they closed
mile so with some brand new stuff and
they're using some experimental
techniques that involve stem-cell
research very expensive stuff luckily I
finally was able to get some insurance
thank God that helps a lot otherwise
it's where there's been another million
dollar debt to me and you guys have no
idea how far in debt I am with medical
stuff so this is a big help to me to
have that I'll be stuck in my bed for
the next 8 to 12 weeks so videos you
know they're probably get bored because
they're all probably gonna be from my
room because I'm not gonna be able to
walk and this time I'm I'm not gonna do
anything else but heal myself it's not
worth losing my leg just to have my fans
back if I have to lose a few fans which
is unfortunate and I really hate that
but it seems like when I make a lot of
these videos thousands of people
unsubscribe but I just don't really I
don't understand that at all kinda hurts
my feelings but I just roll with it
I don't know why people are doing that
but I'm right in the middle of going
through a huge health ordeal all those
months that I was sick I actually had an
infection inside me that I really didn't
even know about so those few months in
between that last period where I was
just ultimately sick and this period
were really all connected it was just
really giving me a reprise from the
infection but it was so bad at home I
couldn't hold any food down at all I
took a bite of banana
I threw it up ate an orange threw it up
no matter what I did I threw it up and
if I took too many of my medications
then I'd be throwing up and diarrhea all
at the same time
having hot colds chills the whole name
you name the gambit madwoman my Tim
should be 104 I'd be sitting here
sweating balls and freezing cold in the
next second I'm just freezing cold and
shaking and feeling like I'm just going
to die over so um I'm at Loma Linda
Hospital here in Murrieta California I
have to say these people have been
absolutely wonderful with me they've
been absolutely nice with me all at MIT
man when I came here I was in a pretty
defeated State I was ready to pretty
much just take the coward's way out and
I was like hey you know if you've got to
amputate my leg just make sure you do it
so I can walk buddy the dog and let's
just do it you know right underneath the
knees so I can do it and for once and
this is a first the doctor actually got
mad at me and told me one and I got a
fight from my leg which is different
than any other hospital I've ever been
to and also I want to send a very
special thanks out to a person named
Ingo he works the Mayo Clinic over in
the next state over and I'm in Arizona
and he contacted me and if it probably
wasn't for him I might have just died in
my bed because I was in so much pain and
so scared of this I was ready just to
roll over and just let it be you know I
know that's wrong it's cowardly but I
was really scared and losing the leg is
a major ordeal I know how you think
about that but I mean I walk around just
dude we'll take a pee he'll lean over to
pet the dog everything kind of requires
you having a leg or relearning your life
all the way over again so where things
are right now they want me to fight and
they want me to try to save my leg so
I'm joining the fight full force I'm
putting all my fears and all that stuff
and I'm shoving it down into my belly
I'm trying to have a you know a rock you
know solid foundation in my heart and my
soul to do this so I'm gonna be fighting
all this stuff hardcore I'm getting a
new type of diabetes medicine it's
really expensive they actually inject it
into your arm and it stays there so this
is gonna be a pretty crazy thing that
I'm gonna be getting but it'll help me
monitor my blood sugar a lot better now
I know a lot of people aren't gonna
start saying hey dude diet diet diet
I've been on an extreme diet for a long
time I wouldn't be losing all the weight
constantly if I was on a diet
I was just peeking out and eating sugars
and all this stuff I would bloat up you
know
and you guys can see from a channel I'm
continuing to lose weight I maintain a
pretty good diet the only time I do
break my diet and I'll admit it is every
so often I'll get a craving for like a
grapefruit soda so I'll have that
grapefruit soda or I might just have you
know an extra piece of fruit or
something like that and I have you know
I've broke my diabetic diet a few times
but mainly I stay on my diet but when I
get out of here I plan on switching it
up even more I particularly am NOT a fan
of an all greens diet but it just seems
like the people that are doing these all
greens died I don't mean keto anything
like that I mean an all green diet or
pretty much everything I'm eating is
just green healthy vegetables that seems
to be the only thing that's curing
diabetes so I'm gonna have to learn to
shut my fat mouth quit sticking food
through it of any type other than what's
healthy for me and maintain that diet I
really don't want to lose my leg for all
of you people out there who sent me well
wishes and prayers I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart and so it
means a lot to me and obviously with all
the people's energy doing these prayers
and stuff well look a miracle really did
happen because when I came here the
entire thesis was I was going to be
losing my leg I believe that I Roommate
believe that gee do it we all thought
this is it I'm losing my leg but luckily
with this new technology and the
stem-cell stuff that they're doing I
have a fighting chance of saving my leg
and I'm going to give it a 1 million
percent effort to save my leg for many
many reasons not only for my help for
you guys it's been really sad for me I
have mail to walk my dog in like two
years bill my roommate has to walk the
dog and if you're a dog owner like that
you know how bonding that is walking
with your dog and playing with your dog
and I've been robbed that and honestly
eats in my heart like bad I feel
guilty you know and I want to get back
into a normal lifestyle so it's really
time for me to completely grow up past
any that I've had in the past
man up like a man take care of this
stuff and that means I can't eat good
food I can't do exactly the things I
want to do we'll not just how it's going
to be otherwise I'm not going to be able
to be here to bring you guys you too
videos I won't be really around to do
anything because eventually I'll just
die kind of surprised me though my
coming in the hospital I just saw my
oldest friends Randy Greene he came and
visited me in here and like I haven't
seen him in a few years and he looked
quite a bit older to me and when I first
checked in here the nurses and stuff and
here they all thought I was in my mid
30s and even when Randy came today he
said hey man you look like you're in
your 30s so I mean I guess I've been
pretty lucky that I'm not like you know
facially wise growing old SuperDuper
fast but my body itself is falling apart
and it's time to balance that out
man if I got to look a little older I'm
good with it
but I got to take care of this body take
care of this temple get myself killed
get back in line so I can bring the
videos to you guys and just enjoy life
all around and spend lots of quality
time with my pup who believed me buddy
if you're watching this video I miss you
a little sucker I wish I could bring you
to the hospital because I love you so
much and I love you guys the fans for
all your support for all the years you
guys have been absolutely wonderful for
you people who keep unsub just because
I'm having health issues I think that's
really sad but there's nothing you know
that I can do about it and I still wish
you the absolute best even if you're
giving up on me so god bless I'll see
you guys back here on the channel
they're about to give me my meals and in
the hospital is just that but I'll eat
it anyway just to keep my strength up
possible chance that I'll be released by
Monday and I'll be back at home and bed
rest and we'll start doing all the
retraining so I'll keep you guys
appraised I do have a couple of their
videos in the queue that I'm gonna be
gonna be releasing but I just wanted to
give you guys another update to let you
guys know exactly what's going on what
my state of mind is and where things are
for me mr. Elric love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
