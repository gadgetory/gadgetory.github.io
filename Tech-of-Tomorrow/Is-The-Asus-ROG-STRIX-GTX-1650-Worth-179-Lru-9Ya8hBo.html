what are you thinking okay well
yesterday and video released the brand
new gtx 1650 and it seems like a lot of
people out there just really do not like
this card whatsoever a lot of the
reviewers out there gamers nexus saying
it's dead on arrival
it doesn't seem like the review people
are really liking this card whatsoever
now i have to say this it is kind of a
strange market about where this
particular card is going at the price
level now we checked out the zotac
version yesterday and it was a little
bit of a slower version this particular
one we're gonna look at today today
we're gonna look at this a Zeus one this
is their overclocked versions the rock
Strix version so you know it's pretty
much like going to be like the probably
one of the top-end ones of this
particular series however this
particular card is a hundred and seventy
nine dollars now it is overclocked
though quite a bit they had two
different kinds that excuse me there are
two different kinds of boost on this
particular card you have gaming mode and
overclock mode in your gaming mode you
get eighteen hundred and thirty
megahertz and in the overclock mode it's
eighteen hundred and sixty megahertz
everything else about the card is the
same still it's 896 CUDA chords
recommended three hundred watt power
supply this particular version that
you're gonna see has two different fans
on it and obviously it's meant to be
overclock since you know the boost clock
speeds are actually that high but where
exactly is this card going to fit in the
market is what's really strange now the
zotac one we saw yesterday I can kind of
understand where like somebody has
really an older system and they just
have to have touring shading then maybe
they might want to buy that car but
there's other cards in the market that
don't require you know a power plug
either and a lot of people make comments
in videos saying hey you know you can
just buy a cheap little molex power
connector and put it up well not
everybody has that technical knowledge
or even the ability to do that in the
particular power supply so yes whoever
made that comment you're right in some
cases you can't just buy a molex power
connector and use the AMD the rx 570
like we showed you in the yesterday's
previous video which by the way if you
have to miss it we did a head-to-head
comparison comparison blew between the
rx 570 and the
16:50 and at the end of the day at the
same price the RX 570 actually did
better it was a much better performing
card has a little bit but you know more
power requirements and it runs a little
hotter but miss your performance well it
was better so let's go ahead now let's
check out this particular card the Box
in this card I'm not gonna waste my time
because it's a box yep it's a box you
can see the front of the box and then if
I spin around then guess what the front
and then yadda yadda yadda yadda the
back okay so that's the box yay
alright thrill thrill thrill thrill
thrill ville so let's pop the cap here
do it to do to to where I went into it I
am a box
hi I'm a box all right there we go yep I
guess I'm gonna silly mood today let's
see you're okay alright now we've got
some little velcro strips here these are
for doing your cable management and
stuff like that so you know you can put
your cables all of the way I set that
off to the side I don't think there's
actually anything else in here
whatsoever it's not looking like it um I
got a card let me set the card down for
a second look in the box
yes alright on the bottom of the box do
to do two - let me get that up there in
the bottom of the box you can see there
are a couple more things so I'm just
gonna go ahead and set that down what
have we got here obviously we've just
got oh hey we have a driver CD yay
most people are gonna be downloading
their driver off the net as they you
know come out but they do include a
driver CD and they have a speed setup
guide so if you absolutely have never
installed a video card before they'll
tell you hey where to plug it in but I
know my fans you guys know exactly
what's up so caught here let go of my
sweater okay so card nice and steady
bag I'm gonna go ahead and just zip tag
thing in the back here alright okay
alright here we go
now this particular card has some nice
features now two fans for one thing
right off the bat on the front so the
other card actually around the zotac car
was running at like 64 Celsius under
full load even in the Gamay toes case
which doesn't have the absolute best you
know airflow in the world
it's decent but not the best
so you guys seem card looks pretty nice
rod card gonna have a really good
cooling and all that stuff
now one thing about this card though
that I'm going to say it's kind of
strange the maternal to the side now is
you're going to notice that this
particular card requires a six pin power
connector now with a six pin power
connector that to me takes away what was
really cool about this otac card the
zotac card I liked because it didn't
have any additional power requirements
whatsoever and for people who had older
systems it would be cool but this
particular card with the fact that it
has that well guess what you're going to
need guess what a power connector and a
power supply that will support it
another thing is this particular card
actually has RGB so if you like all the
shiny likes then hey you might just like
this particular version now another cool
thing is this car does have guess what a
nice solid backplate you guys are going
to notice there's this little tiny
button also on the back of the car this
is for turning on and off the RGB so if
you like pretty lights turn them on if
you don't turn them off but it's really
nice to have a nice cover on the back
regardless so for those people out there
in the previous video who said hey I
would buy a card that was a better
version of had a little bit better
cooling and it had a backplate well then
this might be the particular you know
gtx 1650 that you're looking for however
it is you know like I said a little bit
higher priced now the rear i/o this
particular card is also a lot different
than we saw on the zotac card in the
zotac car we saw a single DVI a single
HDMI and a single DisplayPort on this
particular car there's no DVI whatsoever
you strictly have to display ports and
two HDMI ports featuring all the latest
technology of course but still there's
no DVI whatsoever so if you needed that
connection that might be a caveat for
you the card size is in at nine and a
half inches by five inches and features
a two slot design and like I said before
it does require a six pin power
connector to power the card but it only
requires a 300 watt power supply alright
so this is the unboxing of this card and
the first looks of this particular card
for those of you guys I think most of
you guys know Nvidia kind of like put
really kind of the squeeze on us
reviewers this time and I'll
a lot of people complained about this as
well so I will address this a lot of
people said they were selling the card
you know before any of the reviews even
came out I mean I don't know for me it
was kind of really crappy because we
couldn't get our reviews up really in
time we had to do an unboxing and then
test all day yesterday and try to get
the video which we got this you know
yesterday morning and now we have to
repeat the same process today because
the drivers just worn here until the
launch but if you're in Student just
check-in this card out we'll have more
information down below and like I said
we'll have the full scores and
everything will be bringing this to the
table we're also going to bringing you
guys some game footage of anthem and
seeing how it actually plays on 149 $179
card so stick with us I'm at work you
guys were watching Tekken tomorrow if
you're not sub K we'd love to see you
guys sub here on the channel we have a
patreon site a website we have Twitter
