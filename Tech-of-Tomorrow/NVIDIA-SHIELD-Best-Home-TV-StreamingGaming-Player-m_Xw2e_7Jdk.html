with TECA tomorrow and today we're
taking a look at the Nvidia shield which
is geared to make other streaming boxes
look like a console does against a PC
now what I mean by this is that compared
to a Roku an Apple TV or a fire TV the
Nvidia shield is simply more powerful so
in the box you get the shield itself AC
adapter HDMI cable USB cable and shield
controller optional accessories include
a shield stand and a shield remote now
the shield remote for those people who
prefer its use over the controller
visually speaking the shield itself is
pretty minimal but it looks badass that
glowing Nvidia green and makes a sweet
addition into your home entertainment
setup on the inside the shield sports an
NVIDIA Tegra x1 processor 256 Core
Maxwell GPU 3 gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of internal storage it's also
powered by Android TV and Google cast
through android 5.1 lollipop on the
backside of the shield we have a micro
SD card slot for storage expansion two
USB 3.0 ports Gigabit Ethernet HDMI 2.0
a micro USB 2.0 port and in terms of
wireless support you get a tow 2.11
AC dual band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1
there's also an IR blaster in there too
so out of everything we just talked
about something that should stick out to
you is hdmi 2.0 because that is
something that separates the shield
apart from the others the ability for 4k
UHD playback up to 60 frames per second
so if your 4k TV is feeling a little bit
lonely the Nvidia shield offers 4k
streaming right out of the box with
Netflix and YouTube what's also really
sweet is the ability to cast from your
phone and it's open to both iOS and
Android where you can get content off
the small screen and on to that big
screen in your living room now I know
you gamers are familiar with Nvidia's
grid cloud gaming where you can stream
games via your PC to your TV but there's
actually a ton of games that can now run
natively on the shield because of that
Tegra x1 processor as far as gaming goes
it's really easy you just go to the
download section choose the game that
you want to get pay for it and download
it I experienced absolutely no lag
so ever during gaming which was great
you guys can see here I played doom
which is what old-school title and
there's no lag whatsoever in the game no
freezing up no lag no stutter no nothing
just absolute smooth gameplay if you
consider yourself though a hardcore
gamer you might want to consider getting
the Nvidia shield Pro and take that 16
gigabytes up to a massive 500 gigabytes
then you can get your game on the
included controller isn't mind-blowing
and design-wise looks very familiar but
it works well and feels solid plus the
built in stereo headset jack and
microphone for voice search is a nice
touch touching a bit on voice control
it's powered by Google Voice Search and
it works really solid stargate sg1 so
overall the shield is a pretty fantastic
option if you're looking for something a
little extra out of your home media
streamer it's a little pricier than the
other options but it's also more
powerful offers 4k and is in a league of
its own when it comes to gaming so
thumbs up if you like gaming i'm noah
you've been watching ticker tomorrow
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
