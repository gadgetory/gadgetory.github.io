once again on TECA tomorrow are you and
those people out there looking for the
killer system that will play all your
games 4k and is completely via already
as well let's check out the FPS
Devastator
right off the bat though I want to
address something with all of you guys
out there many times all the comments
down below or like hey man I can build a
way cheaper system by using parts picker
and all that stuff and I agree that you
probably can do that all the builds that
we do here are just suggestive builds
for you to do I'm never making any claim
in any videos this is the most boobers
you know price sensitive video we get
stuff in for review then we try to take
the absolute best of those parts and
then bring you guys a system now this
particular system we're doing today will
do everything it can double as your
workstation it'll render video it will
kick ass in gaming and the biggest thing
of all the question in everybody's mind
is this thing is totally ready for VR my
HTC vive is coming and I'm going to have
a bunch of different system to test on
and compare all the way from low-end
systems to high
so now though let's check out the FPS
Devastator which i think is one killer
ass system for $2000 for you fans of
razer i think you guys are really going
to dig the case that we used on this FPS
Devastator build we're using the NZXT h
440 razor edition case now this is a mid
tower case it's matte black and has all
kinds of cool lighting including a snake
on the front a snake on the power supply
and neon glowing lights on the bottom
overall this case is pretty badass and
it fits everything that we need it into
the build the motherboard powering this
beast is the Z 170 X gaming 7
motherboard this thing has some awesome
features including onboard lighting and
we were able to actually change the line
to match the green of the system bill
which is pretty cool some of the
features are ddr4 and it's all built for
skylight technology the CPU we chose to
go with is the intel skylake i7 6700 k
now this is one of the latest processor
from Intel it's a 4 gigahertz processor
and it's completely unlocked out of the
box for overclocking this motherboard
and chipset requires very fast ddr4
memory so we chose the Corsair Vengeance
lpx memory this is a 16 gigabyte kit
which consists of two a kick a bite
sticks and it's clocked at 3000
megahertz like I said in the very
beginning of the video I didn't build
this system around you know price I
didn't go my god what's the cheapest
parts I made it so that it would be the
way that I really liked it and I loved
to have MS 8 up for my boot drive so I
used one from the people over at Plextor
this is very very fast you guys all know
this is derp
to the motherboard and offers really
intense transfer speeds and boot speeds
in fact this system boots in about nine
seconds so it's really quick so for one
drive I have a 256 M SATA then I also
have a 256 SSD that's for some of my
stuff and then last but not least I
chose a Western Digital one terabyte
black drive from my main storage and the
reason that I did this is because the
manger games that I play the ones I play
all the time I'll store those on the 256
M SATA for the ones I play a little bit
less I'll store those on the SSD and for
the ones I play you know the absolute
least are the ones that don't require a
lot of power I just put those all on the
hard drive so daughter goes that's the
way I choose that my system obviously
like I said before this is just
suggestive build you can put whatever
you want in yours to cut costs and it
doesn't matter
so please please don't leave a comment
down below going oh I could have built a
cheaper system obviously I could have -
but I'm not going to go into parts
picker I use what I have so I just want
to be very clear about this throughout
the entire video so let's move along
let's talk about the power supply now
for the power supply even though you
can't see it it's from Corsair this is
the RM 750 I plenty of power for this
system because I'm only using a single
video car at this moment in our original
configuration we had used a Western
Digital blue drive but that drive failed
so we switch it out to the WD black
which is actually a better Drive in any
case in the past a lot of the systems
that we built required a total custom
liquid cooling system for the entire
system was a lot of work this time we
decided to go with all a i/o stuff so
that everything's all-in-one it makes it
much simpler so for the video card we
use one by EVG it's a complete hybrid
card now this is their 980ti series and
it comes with its own liquid cooler and
everything right out of the box which
once again is geared for those people
doing overclocking the major feature
about the hybrid card is that it
features not only liquid cooling but it
also features a fan onboard as well so
no matter what's going on your cards
going to get cooled properly I also
wanted everything to fit inside the case
really perfectly so to cool the CPU I
chose the kraken x41 and what's cool
about this is that the kraken can be
completely controlled through the cam
software i don't know if you guys have
seen this before i know some of you guys
would follow channel do but cam is is
completely free software from people
over at NZXT it does all kinds of
monitoring stuff and i
you guys are going to be pretty
surprising we get to the scoring because
a lot of people in the past and said oh
my god you know running cam like makes
my system go down and I think you're
going to be kind of shocked when we get
there actually so this coolers looks
really really well you guys can see the
temps on both the CPU and the GPU are
running very very cool even under
complete load many people think that
using liquid cooling means that it's
strictly for doing overclocking and
although it's great for overclocking
it's also great just for having your
system run completely quiet and still
remain cool I know a lot of you guys out
there probably seen the H 440 case and
other builds from other people and one
of the great things about that we like
is that it has great cable management
you guys can see that we were able to
get all the cables out of the system so
there's no constriction of airflow it
doesn't look messy it just looks totally
clean almost all the wiring is located
in the backside of the case and once you
put that case cover on you can no longer
see any of that just making a really
nice build some other nice things are
you guys can see if this system can be
completely lit up green so it matches
that complete NVIDIA theme I wish I
could have got a green motherboard but I
couldn't find any so that's why I chose
the one I did but if I could have found
a motherboard that was all green hell I
would have chose that one too but a
really cool thing about this motherboard
is it has onboard hue lighting so you
can turn that light in green and match
that Nvidia theme and if you want to
access the hue lighting it's done all
through the bios of the motherboard so
those are all the parts in the build and
how the build looks and all the cable
management all that stuff and all this
comes to about $2,000 I know some people
out there gonna say oh my god out the
price like I said this is just a
suggestive build you can do whatever you
want with your particular system but on
that note let's now check out the system
how cool it runs how it scores and how
it does and what we are asking VR the
first test that we ran was Geekbench and
we ran it without cam on and then we ran
the test once again with cam on you guys
can see that for some reason with the
cam software engaged it actually scored
higher in this particular test now the
reason that we ran Geekbench twice is we
want to see how cam would affect
performance when it was enabled and you
guys concede that with cam enabled the
score was actually better
so obviously system performance hits are
very minimal at
test now let's check out the rest of the
scores we ran everything in 4k because
obviously if the system is running
everything in 4k it almost 60 frames per
second or better you guys know in 1080p
and 1440 it's going to seriously kick
ass and really the main question is how
does this thing do for VR is it V
already and I think you guys will be
surprised because the FPS Devastator
will devastate in 4k and in VR if you
want to test your system for VR the same
way that we did all you need to go is
download Steam install Steam and then
run the steam VR program it tells you
clearly whether your system is ready for
VR or not
all right tech bands so there you guys
have it the FPS Devastator for you guys
wandering out there how it came about
the name I was watching a movie other
day and they had a ship you know it was
hmm as something like Her Majesty's
Secret Service you know or Her Majesty's
service so I thought hey what about you
know like a ship type names like FPS
Devastator because obviously this system
is devastating the FPS as you guys can
see from all the scores now the entire
theme is build though was pretty much
was hate will this thing be able to do
VR there's some seriously killer stuff
going on this week and that I can't tell
you about but it's going to change the
face of all kinds of things going on and
my HTC vive is on its way so we're going
to be all set for VR next week with a
lot of different systems like I said
everything in this system cost about two
thousand dollars if you're interested in
this type of system for yourself and you
think it's awesome
we'll have pricing availability down
there below that like button if you like
it you know what to do like usual I
always want to hear your guys's comments
but I really don't want to hear it kind
of a saying hey I could have built a
cheaper system because nowhere might
Thailand anywhere does it say this is a
cheap system built for pricing you guys
need a really clear to get that head
because a lot of times I get a bunch of
dislikes and a bunch of people saying
hey I could have went over to PC parts
picker and did this sure I can go to PC
parts picker check the absolute
cheapest parts there are and build a
system just like anybody else and throw
it out there we actually take the time
to get good parts in there for review we
take those parts then we build the
system and then bring it to you and
that's why we're going to continue to do
it if in the future you guys want me to
do some kind of PC parts cheap-ass
cheaper build I could probably do that
and accommodate you but I try to just
make things that are really killer and
honestly I try to build systems that I
would want to own myself I would be
proud to own this PC and I think you
would be as well let me hear your
comments I'm Eric you've been watching
ticking them on like I said if you guys
want to check out kam for free we'll
have a link down there below
I like this software it does a lot of
different stuff and the best thing about
it is it's free and replaces a bunch of
other software with one install see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
