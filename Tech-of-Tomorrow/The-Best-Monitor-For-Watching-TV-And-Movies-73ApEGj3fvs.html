back here once again now I don't know
about you but usually when I buy a
monetarist for one or two reasons either
I'm buying a monitor to do my work on
and I'm not really too worried about how
super-high the specs are as long as it
works and people concede it the working
environment that's a cool monitor of
that or I want a gaming monitor a gaming
monitor that has all the crazy features
on I mean it's got to have free sync
it's gotta have juicing SuperDuper high
fast hundred forty-four Hertz refresh
rate you know all that good stuff those
are my buying choices I don't know about
you guys but now it's kind of
interesting cuz BenQ is come out with a
monitor that's not really made for
either one it's kind of like in the
middle area and it's totally geared for
people who watch videos and watch movies
that's right now I know so we were
saying oh you know I just go on my TV
and the living room and watch on my big
screen and believe me I that was kind of
Mike my first attitude as well but when
I started thinking about it what about
people though who are in college dorms
or just in places where they don't have
access to a giant TV screen but still
they love to enjoy all of their movies
and content and the absolute best
environment that they can do it well
that's where this brand-new BenQ monitor
comes in now this is the e W 277 HDR now
the HDR high dynamic range you guys are
probably familiar with this it's the
thing about how you're coloring your
darkness and your contrast and all these
things translate to the viewing that
you're seeing a lot of TV companies have
incorporated this technology in them
because let's just face it it really
does make kind of a difference in your
TV viewing especially if you like stuff
to be very bright very dark and
everything just to be like really
over-the-top I have to admit I like the
way this monitor looks it's very clean
and very elegant now some of the basic
specs this is a 16 to 9 aspect ratio
monitor features 8-bit color 27-inch
screen it's a VA pal 1920 by 1080
maximum resolution featuring 178 degree
viewing angle you can pretty much see
the monitor no matter where you're
standing with your right in front of it
off to the side it's pretty much gonna
look pretty clear now as far as the
refresh rates go through fresh rate is
that sixty Hertz now a lot of people may
not notice this but like I said as a
gamer when I'm using a monitor it has to
be at least 144 Hertz or I just get
headaches
for watching movies and stuff like this
60 Hertz won't matter whatsoever looking
through the specs we did discover that
they were actually two different
response times there's a 12 millisecond
response time which is black white black
and there's also a 4 millisecond which
is gray to gray one thing you guys are
gonna notice right off the bat about
this particular model is it has a very
small bezel it's almost not there at all
honestly I think it's probably one of
the smallest ones I've ever seen with
that you'd have to kind of redesign
technology to make the monitor be able
to stay there because let's just face it
that little bezel around the edge is
probably what's helping holding your
monitor in place the stand itself is
also very nice and just looking at the
monitor you gotta admit it does have
kind of a nice little futuristic look to
it
now what gets kind of strange is here on
the back of the monitor you have a
single D sub and then two HDMI 2.0 ports
and they really kind of say that you
should use the cable that comes with
that I think what they're saying is that
you might have an HDMI you know older
cable that's not 2.0 standard it might
not work with the HDR so that's why
they're saying to use their cable but if
you do have an HDMI 2.0 cable you can
use that as well not everybody out there
likes to listen to headphones all the
time nor do they have nice speakers in
that case this particular monitor does
have 2 2 watt speakers built in there's
also a headphone jack if you want to
listen your headphones it's there and a
line in Jack from your computer to the
monitor one of the particular features
of this monitor is an ultra high
contrast ratio of 3000 to one now this
is three times the normal there's on a
standard monitor and what this really
translates to is that all your dark
colors and all your light colors are
just much more vibrant and much more
defined one of the reasons that a lot of
the monitors out there may not be so
great for watching TV's and movies on
it's because of their brightness not all
monitors have great brightest and great
separation this particular model
actually has 33% more brightness on it
than standard monitors now houses
achieves the HDR technology with HDR
technology you get 400 nits of
brightness that's really really bright
almost want to be going ah this next
feature is something a little bit trippy
now this particular monitor features a
hundred
of rec709 or 93% of dcpip three now what
exactly this is to me what it means is
that all the movies that are being made
in America have a certain standard now
when you watch these movies the color on
these particular movies may not be
accurate on other monitors but on these
particular monitors like it said 100%
with the first technology and with DCI
p3 it's 93 percent so that really
translate to all the movies that you're
gonna be watching especially the ones
that are made here in the United States
you're gonna be able to get that color
exactly how it was filmed most people
out there know what g-sync and freesync
is now this is the technology by both
the big video car companies that makes
your monitor flicker free and gaming you
get no ghosting no flickers or anything
like that now even though this
particular monitor doesn't have those
type of features built in it does
feature flicker free technologies when
you're looking at your monitor you're
really not gonna see any flickering so
watching your movies doing standard
stuff all that stuff you're not gonna be
a notice anything and get no eye strain
on your eyes now as far as the tilt goes
in this monitor it is very very mental
only 5 to 15 degrees so you're not gonna
be able to move this thing all over the
place but do you really need to do you
need a portrait monitor and all that
stuff for something you're gonna be
strictly watching TV and watching videos
on I don't really think so
do you visually speaking the monitor
looks very very nice and with four
different HDR settings you can pretty
much find one that actually suits your
needs perfectly so if you don't like it
a certain color you like it to look a
little bit different hey all you have to
do is switch through these four
different HDR modes and I'm sure you'll
find something that'll suit your needs
and changing through the different modes
is very easily done by a button located
on the bottom right hand side of the
monitor and located right underneath the
HDR button is the on-screen menu you can
access all the different buttons very
easily right underneath the monitor
scroll through it and set it up to your
desire okay so we play with this monitor
for about a week checked it out and just
got used to being around the house and
some things I have to say about it are
this obviously the way of design is like
I said the beginning this is a very
nicely designed monitor and all of your
movies and all that stuff do look really
good even gaming looks pretty cool the
only thing I don't like about it for
game
like I said before it doesn't feature
freesync or g-sync it doesn't really
have a hat you know really fast refresh
rate does that fast response time really
this monitor is like really geared for
people who want to watch movies and it
really does that really well the whole
thing is though how many people really
out there only want to monitor for
watching movies that's the thing and
with a 60 you know with 60 Hertz is a
refresh rate a lot of people are gonna
be like so it's kind of got its own
niche market plus the price on this
monitor is like almost 300 bucks like
two hundred and sixty bucks right now
and I honestly feel that that's just way
too much money for the specs that you
get this particular monitor I mean there
are monitors out there that even though
they may not have you to the three times
more contrast ratio the 33% more
brightness and that you know DC i3p
thing even though they don't have all
those things built into them they'll
still probably work for you and things
will look really good I'm sure you could
probably find a monitor out there for
140 dollars even though it doesn't have
all these same specs
it'll still be a 27-inch monitor that
you can look at at 60 Hertz and do stuff
so the price to me is the biggest
biggest weight on this particular
product if this product came in to
market and about $199 you'd be seeing me
with my thumbs up saying editor's choice
you know but because it's not really a
gaming monitor and it's so much money
and such a niche market because how many
people really are gonna buy a monitor
just to watch TV and videos on I know
there's a group out there obviously the
air like I said before people are at
home or at you know the house to school
and stuff like that they don't have
access to all this stuff those people
it'll be pretty cool but honestly how
many people is that really going to be I
mean honestly at the end of the day so
as far as the specs go and everything in
this monitor it looks absolutely
beautiful great colors you don't see any
kind of screen tearing or anything when
you're watching movies and stuff and the
ability to change through all those
different HDR modes I mean if you're a
movie buff and you really care about the
stuff let's just face it you know like
anal about the color then I would think
that you'd be really really impressed
this monitor and hard-pressed to find
one that'll actually play your movies
with the same exact amount of clarity
and detail so that's about it folks at
the end of the day great specs high
price like usual all this information
will be down below
