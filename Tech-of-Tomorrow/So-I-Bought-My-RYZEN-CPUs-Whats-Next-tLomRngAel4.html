leaving a ton of comments down
below or where are the risen test well I
got to tell you we're not getting very
much support from a and B right now so I
went ahead and we bought all of the
risen CPUs ourselves they'll be here
next week and then we'll bring you guys
all the Risen testing now already before
rizzens come out we've seen that Intel
started slashing prices on their CPUs to
be competitive now this is something
very interesting because usually AMD is
always the price leader with until being
the performance leader but the rumors
are having it that these CPUs are
actually going to be able to keep up
with all the same Intel CPUs now here on
TECA tomorrow we have a lot of things
going on with risen I purchased all
three CPUs back to my buddy John from
TLD bought those for me so peace out
John thank you very much so we have all
three of those CPUs coming in the house
I've gotten a bunch of motherboards
lined up from various manufacturers
Anthony has made a totally custom badass
case this will bring that to you in a
few days you guys can see it it's just
the ultimate case for building
an AMD system I think you guys are
really going to dig it now how I'm going
to do my testing this time is going to
be a little different than i normally
test what i'm going to do is I'm going
to do all my testing based on dollar per
dollar testing which means that if an
AMD cpu costs four hundred ninety nine
dollars i'm going to try to find the
exact equivalent cpu from intel at that
same price point the same thing all the
way down the line there are three new
CPUs coming out from AMD each one of
those CPUs will be competiting with now
the exact specs are actually the 1800 x
the 1700 x and the 1700 vanilla flavor
now obviously the standard 1701 isn't
going to be geared for doing the most
ultimate overclocking but obviously the
ones with an X at the end of them these
are going to be serious competitors for
overclocking so I'm going to try to get
up but hold ilysm show my words here a
buddy of mine is fugger you guys might
know him he's a supreme overclocker he's
been around for years he's been doing
stuff he competes with all those guys
like kingpin and all those guys well
I've been friends with John worse for a
long time and I'm going to contact him
and actually help him reinvigorate all
of our overclocking stuff which is
really funny because in the very
beginning I was one of the first people
to
ever do overclocking and as over
collecting got to be something where you
had to like have huge giant tanks
pouring liquid nitrogen and stuff like
that I kind of shied away from that and
the reason being is if you guys follow
the channel you guys know I play guitar
so the thought of me losing one of my
fingers by an accident totally alienated
me from overclocking so even though I
pretty much introduced overclocking into
the world it got so out of hand that I
just like let it go these guys nowadays
who do overclocking that way I mean I
think it's cool for competitions and
stuff but let's just be real are you
going to sit at your house in your room
with a giant tank and pour liquid
nitrogen in your CPU all day to keep it
running at those high speeds and most
the time they burn up the CPU completely
running them so it's really doing that
extreme overclocking anything honestly
with a dick leg I mean is it I mean in
reality what do you guys think I want to
hear you guys opinions really down below
do you think that all this extreme
overclocking is anything but dick
wagging do you think that it actually
has any real relevance in everyday task
and stuff I really don't think it does
and in fact with overclocking in general
I just feel that the performance level
is so minut that to keep your CPU
shorten its life and all that stuff for
me and I prefer actually just run my
CPUs at stock I mean I'll do
overclocking for the videos to show you
guys what's going on but me personally I
like my cpu to last as long as possible
I don't know what you guys think but
that's how I feel so stuff coming up
this next week nvidia stuff that's right
going to be heading up to san francisco
tomorrow morning in fact for the nvidia
stuff so that means guess what what do
you guys think let me hear your comments
down below what do you guys think i'm
going to be sing at nvidia editor today
i'll hear you guys comments down below
will it be a 1080p I oh I don't know but
I sure the hell hope it is because that
will be one bad as card also i do have
new AMD cards coming in we have some
coming in for power color so this whole
new arisen launch have no fear i may not
be able to be the first one to have the
stuff out of the table because i have to
buy it myself but believe me my reviews
now will be completely gloves off i'm
not going to have to like in the future
like say anything nice you guys always
want me to be like the most raw crazy
reviewer well guess what you're going to
get your hopes up now we're actually
going to your chance to see that because
we're now on if I can buy all my part to
get all my parts here I can see exactly
what I want about everything and that's
my plan for 2017 so I'm Miller you guys
been watching tech of tomorrow next week
lots of exciting stuff I got a new
engraver coming in I got a 3d printer
coming in we're trying to work with this
other company called X car lots of cool
stuff coming up here on TECA tomorrow so
stay tuned to the channel when i get
back i'm sure i'll have news for you
guys of what happened up at editors
aiden video and to be some more cool
stuff at the end of the day so have no
fear risen will rise on tech of tomorrow
you have my word mr. buddy here's
getting uncomfortable so thank you guys
for watching the channel we'll see you
guys back here next week for more videos
and more stuff regarding AMD's risen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
