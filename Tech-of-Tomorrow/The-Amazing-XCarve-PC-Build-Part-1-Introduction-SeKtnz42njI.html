back to the channel got some pretty cool
stuff going on here at Tekken tomorrow
now you guys have probably seen the
x-carve machine because a lot of people
out there I've had one bar necklace has
had one algerian has one Charles Gant
has one there's a lot of guys out there
doing a lot of different stuff on it but
you know us we're PC stuff so we're
going to be doing a lot of different PC
stuff on this x-carve now if you don't
know at all what our next carve is let
me just explain to you it's basically
like a home CNC machine it'll do all
kinds of crazy different stuff so if you
know what a CNC machine is it's
basically a machine that you take
computer information you program it into
it and then it automatically cuts
whatever you're doing so first off want
to thank Brian from Inventables forgive
us the machine awesome stuff it's been
kind of an uphill kind of learning curve
for us because we've never actually seen
one of these before so getting it all up
and going getting it built and
everything was a little bit a wee bit on
the hard side you definitely have to
have some kind of a background and
building to put together the machine I
mean if you have no technical skills
whatsoever
I suggest finding somebody to build it
for you or you know work closer with the
people that invent Buhl's because
putting it together did take my friend
Chris quite a bit of time Chris thanks a
lot for all your effort man we really
appreciate it
so our first project that we're going to
be doing is building a PC that's right
and we want to know what you guys think
or what you'd like to see which is
pretty much do you know the thing about
this video so right now I currently have
three ideas in my head we either want to
build a PC that's like a board cube like
a temple or we were thinking possibly
about making one that was like totally
like an old-school like radio so one of
the main purposes for this particular
videos I want to get the feel of you
guys the audience of what you'd like to
see so at the end of the video I'll have
a poll for you guys where you guys can
click on and tell me what you guys want
to see in the video but so far we've had
some pretty cool success once we got it
up and going we made our mistakes almost
burnt the machine up actually I did a
measurement wrong and the whole the
whole entire thing that crochet is
actually went in the wood so far it
started almost like a fire it was crazy
crazy exciting but crazy
we had to fix a little adjustments there
now on the table right now we have our
first guitar body that we're trying it's
a fender body it's going to be a
Telecaster it's coming out pretty well
now one of the main things though that
people question out there and I've even
seen it all over the places do you need
SuperDuper expensive software there's a
software program called aspire now
aspire is super duper high-end program
for doing everything in the world but
there's a program that comes with the
system and it's called easel and you
don't actually have to have this
expensive aspire software to do your
projects because there are so many
projects out there right now that are
uninvent opposed and all around the net
that you can pretty much find any one of
these projects and you can import the
files right into easel so easel comes
free with anything it's you buy from
Inventables so if you buy any one of
their machines you're going to get that
software and it's really easy to use
once you get your machine up and running
it's simply going over the website
opening the program up sticking in
whatever thing that you want to do and
then beginning your car now as far as
you're doing the carving everything it
does take a little bit of pre prep and
set because you have to make sure that
everything is in the exact right angle
because this remember once that thing
starts cutting it's a little bit too
late for you to go home I should
have measured that better so preparation
honestly is probably the number one
thing but the second thing is this evil
software is so easy to use honestly once
it's set up I believe that even a high
school student or anybody else who has
the time to sit and pay attention to
what they're doing can use this machine
very very well and the thing is with the
x-carve
honestly you're pretty much unlimited
now although it won't do like big giant
like 3d like statues or anything like a
3d printer will do it'll do pretty much
everything else that you would expect
you know from from what CNC type machine
you can cut out guitar bodies you can
cut out signs you can do cutting boards
you can do I mean god it's amazing like
I saw this guy he has a full business on
and all he does is make wooden signs for
like bars and restaurants on the X car
and he has a completely successful
business yes I'm saying this for real a
completely successful business they do
goes in his garage he gets his account
he cuts it out and he's up and going
so our first part
like I told you guys's we're going to be
doing a PC challenge this is just video
number one why we're getting up and
going we'll be making another video we
actually challenge other youtubers and
stuff to get involved and then
Inventables will actually probably be
sending them a machine so they can get
into the competition so this is going to
be a really neat thing so this is just
video number one me introducing you guys
to the x-carve now you guys can see
looking at the machine that it's
actually pretty simple layout it's flat
it doesn't take up a whole lot of space
as far as height goes with goes it does
take up a little bit of a space because
the one that we got is actually the
largest one that they make and you guys
can see even our work table it takes up
quite a bit of room this is a big old
huge 8 foot table that we bought and
built actually built up a pretty cheap
86 bucks total for the parts at Home
Depot so that's not bad at all but the
machine and the PC itself do take up
quite a bit of space now our setup right
now you guys can see we just have a
computer in the desk we've a modernist
but that's actually going to be gone in
the next few days I'm going to be
getting a full-blown monitor like a nice
big screen like one of my older TVs and
I'm going to hook it up to the wall
further cleaning up that the room on the
desk that way we can move our machine
which is called a Carvey we'll get it
out of it later so we can put the car
via machine up here too so we have both
of our machines up here on the table and
then we're going to mount the computer
underneath the desk so the whole air
will be clean so today's video is
basically telling you guys hey check it
out welcome and check out the brand new
x carp from inventables very cool
machine but I need to know from you guys
in the poll that I said what would you
guys like to see built first would you
guys like to see a computer it looked
like a board cube would you like to see
a computer that kind of looked like that
that hotel in Vegas that has a big
pyramid thing you know I'm forgetting it
what's it yeah the Luxor the Luxor do
you guys want made by Luxor or if you
like one to be built like an old school
radio also I'll put up another there if
you guys have different ideas you're
more than welcome put them down below in
the comments section I definitely want
interact with you guys on this so please
leave a comment answer the poll and let
me know what you guys want to see
because that is our next project coming
up once we have everything in place we
know what people want we'll start
bringing you guys step-by-step videos as
we completely build a computer from wood
now obviously I'm not gonna be able get
a wood motherboard what a video Carter
in that stuff but the case itself I
guess I should probably say wouldn't
Kate instead of wouldn't
see so whatever case which you guys
would like to see that's build let us
know and then we'll all do our best to
bring that to the table for you guys and
we're going to get other sites involved
like I said in a competition giving them
the PC challenge so it'll be like
basically a challenge between me and
other sites seeing who can actually make
the most badass computer out of wood so
I'm Eric you guys been watching Tekkit
amaro like usual all the information
about this video will be down below like
button I hope you guys like this video
because I want to be very interactive
and very fun for everybody involved if
you don't like the video please if
you're going to leave me dislike tell me
why you're just like I'm always learning
and I'd like to know what you guys don't
like so the I as a person can improve
and bring you guys better videos I'm
Miller you've been watching Tech and
tomorrow look for more tech and more
stuff on the x-carve here on the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
