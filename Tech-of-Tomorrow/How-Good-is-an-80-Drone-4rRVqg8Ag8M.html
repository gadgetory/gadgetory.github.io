once again TECA tomorrow you guys if you
happen to see it we had got the drone in
before we really didn't know what the
frakkin heck we were doing with the
thing and we actually had one of the
propellers on the wrong way so we could
never get the thing to take off uh yeah
it was a kind of a floppy day so we had
the video as a drone failed but thanks
to all you guys all your comments we
figured out what was going on with your
call your comments about setting up the
ground putting the controllers they're
changing repellers for the right way we
listen to it all and so we headed back
to the park let's see what happens on
day two so once again we headed over the
park now this time we had a complete
success
you guys can see I was able to get the
drone off the ground and fly around the
part successfully many times without a
problem
we even have some footage from the
onboard cabinets you guys can see that
shows me flying around and crashing ah
we really had a lot of fun this day
because obviously we got the drone to
fly it did take a few tries before I was
able to do it perfectly and get it to go
all the way away from me and all the way
back but I after a few tries I actually
was able to do that I was able to take
the drone all the way to the end of bill
Blevins Park all the way across the side
bring it down and then actually land the
drone pretty much right in front of me
and it was so much fun we found a couple
kids in the park this is Joshua and Ty
and these guys begged and begged they're
like man please let us fly the drone
dude and so after they fetch the drone
for us for a little while I was cool
enough to give those guys each their own
few tries doing it and here you guys can
see them fly the drone around the park
they really had a great time and it does
prove that even a twelve-year-old child
can pick up this thing and start flying
the control unit although it's not the
absolute best controller in the world
because obviously the drones about 149
dollars it still works perfectly well
now a few things I got to say about our
day in the parking today though is that
with some of these crashes came
destruction now the first thing that I
broke was the onboard camera I had a
crazy experience where I crashed into a
tree we also had a few crazy accidents
where the thing was just way high up in
the sky we cut off the controls and it
fell straight to the ground almost
breaking the legs and after many many
crashes I'd say we had about nine or ten
crashes the unit had a slight bit of
damage but we were able to actually come
home and fix that damage and keep the
drone going
all right folks so obviously day one for
us was a complete fail and there's a
probably reason for that you know this
is an old saying called RTFM you guys
know what takes that mean it means read
the frakkin manual and after looking
around and we start digging in deeper
okay we actually found out okay though
we did have the propeller on upside-down
but that was pretty much the only thing
we did wrong we just never really seen
this thing before and thought it just
should be a simple thing of just
throwing them on there and going to the
park okay obviously it does take a
little bit more thinking than that
so I retract my last comments about it
not being cool for kids and stuff
because obviously as you guys can see
it's totally cool for kids now the only
thing you got to watch out for is this
thing really does go high in the damn
sky mean we were honestly frickin
shocked at house you know high up in the
sky one of the final things as Jesus had
a thing way up in the sky and they were
going to do a barrel roll do a barrel
roll and he does him the controller but
then he turned it back on it it actually
flew straight at high volume to the
ground yeah but hey we fixed it it it's
still going so honestly I can say for
the price that this is it's less than
140 bucks it's pretty damn durable it
stood up to me and my antics stood up to
Jesus and his antics it also stood up to
both the kids Joshua and I both dropped
the thing in the ground and it's still
up and going so I do retract my previous
statements and I think that for the
price for an entry-level drone this
thing's pretty cool I mean obviously
maybe the camera should be a little bit
more durable but come on you can pay it
more than 140 bucks for any camera so
for 140 bucks and lower for a drone that
has a camera I guess the lesson is just
to be a little more damn careful but
that comes at raining like you do all
the information we'll have links to this
and I really people that provide this
was a company called a band good so
we'll have a link to that down below so
if you guys want to check one of these
out I gotta say they're a hell of a lot
of fun once you know what the hell
you're doing see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
