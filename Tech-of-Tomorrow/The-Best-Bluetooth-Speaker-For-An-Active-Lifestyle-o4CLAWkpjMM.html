another edition of TECA tomorrow I'm
mark your host and today's video is
sponsored and brought to you by private
if you wonder who tribe it is they're a
North American company they're a bunch
of these guys who are sound and audio
engineer guys who got together to bring
you guys quality products now I know
that out on the market there are a lot
of Bluetooth speakers there just are the
markets fill with them but the X boom is
actually something a little bit
different for one thing it has 360
degrees of sound and it has incredible
bass on it do the way the speaker's
design they call it X boom and it's
basically this tube becomes a base
cylinder pumping out the bass I'm
serious the speaker has a lot of bass in
it and the clarity of the sound coming
through it is really nice it'll actually
fill a pretty small room now it's 23
watts of power it's a Bluetooth
connectivity you can actually connect to
this up to 60 feet away which is pretty
incredible and once it's charged up it
has 20 hours of continuous sound so Rob
the bet I want to say this product does
sound really good we'll show you guys a
sound test here I'm coming up but the
design is really nice
on the front you simply have your volume
up and down your pause on the back you
have your on button you have your X boom
and you have a little compartment right
here that opens up and underneath this
compartment right here is where you have
your charging cable and a headphone jack
so if you don't want the audio to come
out of the speakers you just want to
listen to a pair of headphones and still
have it as your main audio source you
can do that as well now inside the box
what you get is actually this particular
speaker which I have my hand the X boom
and you get the power USB cable as well
now the design is also very nice on the
outside is a really nice fabric that is
really soft to your hands and the really
cool thing about this is is that up to 3
feet this speaker is completely
waterproof that's right so if you're
taking a bath or something or you're
like by the pool and you knock it in
you'll probably be ok now it guarantees
it but 3 feet but probably if you were
in a 4 or 5 foot pool and it just fell
in and you went and grabbed it real
quick you'd probably still be ok but you
guys can see though that even when you
drop it into a tub of water it still
actually works just fine and since it's
not plugged in you have to
about it giving you electrical shock
good luck in your tub
since the sound is really nice like I
said if you're not in a giant-sized room
you're in a pretty medium-sized room the
sound will fill the room and if you have
two of these you can actually wirelessly
connect them together and have stereo
sound so you can have stereo wireless
sound to watch with your TV or something
else out there so if you're into that
type of thing you can do it
see
now currently this particular product is
about $69 on Amazon it's also an Amazon
choice product which means that a lot of
people have purchased the speaker on
Amazon are very very happy with its
design also it's very very portable I
can even hook it onto my wheelchair and
go strolling around the house and listen
to music you could hook it up to your
bike it's small enough and lightweight
enough where it doesn't like you know
feel like it's a ton of weight so if you
want to stick it in your backpack or
something on a hike it'll absolutely
work that way and plus you can be on the
top of a mountain you could be by the
side of a lake pretty much anywhere that
you have Bluetooth connectivity whether
it be with your iPad with your Android
device no matter what you have you can
connect it up to this and like I said up
to 60 feet away so even throughout doing
something from 60 feet you'll still
connectivity with the tribe edx bill
which is really pretty cool most of them
are not that far they're usually around
30 to 40 feet so having 60 feet is
actually a little bit of extra distance
so if you guys want to see more
information about this product we'll
have a link down below where you guys
can buy one of these for yourself it
really is a good deal I know like I said
there are a lot of Bluetooth speakers
out there this one sounds good it's
waterproof its lightweight its portable
M no really the bottom line is it sounds
good
I mean that's really the most important
thing all the other stuff is just kind
of icing on the cake but the sound that
you're going to be hearing for this
particular device if you get a
chanceless and you're gonna go hey i
give it a thumbs up there's a reason why
it's an amazon choice product so hi mark
you've been watching tucker tomorrow
like I said this video was sponsored by
try bit so peace out and we'll see you
guys back here on teka tomorrow for more
tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
