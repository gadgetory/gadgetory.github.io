something that a lot of people out there
gonna go holy mackerel when they see the
price now people who are audiophiles I
probably won't strict and be like yeah
okay that's totally in the thought of a
product but these things we're looking
at today who these are on the higher
spectrum of things and that's because
they're basically an audiophile
headphones that also doubles as an NFC
and Bluetooth device at the same time so
they're really really high-end these
things are by Aladdin audio they're
pretty new company but these guys are
trying to compete with all the big boys
with Sony
you know what's all the big names
they're gonna throw all out there you
guys know who they are but they're
trying to compete at that same level and
when I first got the headphones in and
took a look at them everything I thought
wow this is like shocking when people
buy them we actually went out we did the
research these headphones are actually
for what they are are in the right price
bracket so they're not actually
overpriced whatsoever
these Aladdin audio things these are the
accurate Pro headphones and they have a
lot of features including that they're
like you know totally made of metal
not that type of metal oh I'm sorry I
thought it was that type of metal I
guess I was wrong
so with that said though let's pretty
much let's jump in let's take a look at
what comes in the box let's actually
talk about how comfortable they are what
they're made out of and how they
actually sound let's go were you folks
out there who are interested in the box
here's the front of the box here is the
back of the box
spin it around alright so that was that
for those you like that anyways and we
have another box which shows even more
stuff in here more their design and all
that good stuff this little thing pulls
out right here which is kind of
interesting have not had an unboxing
that's quite you know this type of look
it's a little bit different so let's go
ahead and pop that open pop the top open
you guys can see right now all the
components that come inside the box so
before we take a look at the headphones
let's take a look at the accessory pack
which is actually pretty well fleshed
out you get the USB wall cable you get
the actual fast charging cable and
charging time is about 2.5 hours and it
says the charge and the headphones lasts
about 24 hours that means you get 24
hours of listening on those headphones
before you got to use the fast charger
again
so that's pretty cool you also get the
mini two standard little headphone
adapter nice little gold thing there
this is also cool little caliper bracket
out if you guys do a lot of hiking and
stuff like that you guys will be
familiar with that this actually hooks
up to the case so you can take it around
with you if I want to go this little
thing right here and now you just loop
it through there put it in your backpack
wherever you're going you're up on the
side of the mountain which is pretty
awesome so that's a pretty cool feature
totally portability there's also a
little adapter right here for like an
aviation connection not exactly sure
what that is because I'm at an aviation
guy but it's in there so if anybody out
there knows what that is leave your
comment down below because I'm always
willing to learn as well last but not
least we have the headphone cable itself
and on it as well is a microphone and it
also has adjustable stuff right on so
not only are you actually getting a pair
of headphones you're getting a totally
controlled environment as well you have
your volume control and all that in the
cable and once you get to the headphone
to talk about those you can actually
control your songs and anything
on those so let's get this out of the
way and get to the meat of the product
just a nice leather case as well this is
made very nice and tough great and
portable it's also very lightweight and
obviously the headphones are folded up
because they're inside of this little
case so they pulled up nice as well so
boom check these out these particular
ones right here these are nice they look
white and gold there's four different
color variations that come with these
and the NFC is actually built into the
headband so it's pretty cool
these guys are really want to talk about
the foam headphones because they're made
out of this type of material that's kind
of like memory foam on a bed so that
when you put them on your head and you
put them back on when you take them off
they're meant to totally surround you
ear totally isolating so you don't hear
any noise outside of the headphones and
they work pretty well in that department
once you put them on there on your head
the outside noise I mean obviously it's
coming up somebody and screaming at you
hear it of corn honking aloud you'll
hear that but general just side now and
the ways you're not gonna hear wind
blowing or anything like that on a plane
they'd be great as well for that plus
they're totally adjustable and they're
made out of this really killer metal
which like in the beginning you guys I
was talking about that was a metal
version but the reason they're metal is
because of what they're made out of and
the metal actually helps these
headphones to have less type of static
whatsoever so we're using on Bluetooth
and all that stuff you don't have to
worry about any type of static because
the way these things are made they're
made to cut all of that stuff out of the
headphone so pretty cool stuff all in
all I mean now this is the part where
people are gonna really get kind of
freaky these things are $399 but I got
to say when Aladdin audio first released
the Acura Pro they were $600 and we kind
of held back on our review we were like
wow $600 for a pair of headphones I was
kind of worried how did you guys react I
thought you guys might sort of throw
rocks at me through the screen but then
we started getting into them started
playing with them we're like wow now
obviously I talked about Bluetooth so as
you guys can see right here they're very
easy to connect by the Bluetooth and
another great feature of these is by NFC
is by doing the one touch now one touch
all you have to do is actually touch the
headphones the top of them
up to the screen of your phone and then
boom they're instantly connected this is
great from your at the gym and stuff
like that you don't want to worry about
the Bluetooth you just want to get up
and going really quick you can bam get
up and going very very fast top rate the
Acura pros is actually really really
easy and like I said before they're not
only headphones they're also a
controller so to turn them on he just
told the center button for three seconds
that will turn the headphones on and
then after that you guys can see the
boom boom boom the light comes on or up
and going and not only you can you
control the volume you can control your
song so say you're at the gym and you
hate the song you're listening to you
don't have to go back over to your phone
or anything you can just simply click
forward or back through these simple
commands right here and you're good to
go
so everything's operated on the
headphones that's totally I would say
hands-free but it's completely wires for
you that's more accurate statement now
they're also very stylish and they have
weight on them now I know if you want to
say wait stop right there the way
they're gonna be on my head stop that
way
they're waiting but they're they're nice
I know you guys out there play guitar
you'll relate to this when you get a
guitar and it feels really heavy in your
arms you're like wow this thing just
feels like solid these headphones feel
solid they don't feel like junk at all
like okay we had a pair of headphones
that we talked about the other day thus
anyone's there like $39 headphones
compared to like the sendee headphones
these are like an ultimate Ferrari
rolls-royce they just really are and
these are not geared for gaming they're
not marketed as a gaming headphone
whatsoever
these headphones are marketed it as high
quality audio file
edie phones and that's why they have the
included cable so if you're no other
palate than you go oh don't give me
that's why all this stuff it brings more
music quality down you've got your snob
nose here and your English accent
Northend singles I'm just joking but you
know I'm saying you've got your little
slowly thing going on nope you've got
the cable but the thing is in today's
wireless world with the NFC and
Bluetooth environment things do sound
really good and if you're at the gym do
you really want to have your phone and
bouncing when you're on that treadmill
up and down once you've bounced with
your phone your pocket and cable
dragging around I know I don't not at
all
so especially you got headphones like
this and if you're really in a high
quality music in there me
snob doesn't matter where you go you
want high quality audio and these are
those so with that said though let's
right now let's jump in and let's
actually take a listen and let's hear
how based out now I know this isn't the
most absolute you know dollar for dollar
or you know Apple to Apple test but it's
the best that we can do without being
there without you being here with us so
let's do it
my hurt your back so I gotta say turn
the bad boys up not bad not bad at all
really good bass response clean mids
nice highs not to over grounding in any
department I mean you can obviously you
know have an equaliser inside your phone
or whatever and you can change those
settings and for those people out there
who have max you know any max you have
pretty much already has a Bluetooth
device in it so you'll be able to use
that and use all your iTunes and all
that crap further people out there at
pcs and stuff he's got a stick a little
Bluetooth unless your motherboard has
one you're up and going but I gotta say
these are really great headphones
they're $399 they're priced just below
the other headphones of this exact type
of caliber II don't believe me when we
go with the link down below you guys can
check out other ones the same type of
thing you guys will see there's some
craisins there even ten thousand dollars
per set of headphones like the comments
you just me were looking at me so they
better be made of solid gold and
hit the because of it yeah for that
price they better be these things are
totally well-made they're very flexible
I don't think you want to flex them
around too much because obviously you're
and I've seen stuff control is on here
very flexible control band I like it 40
millimeter cones inside of these things
delivers superb sound I just I don't
know I gotta say for $309 if you want
audio file level headphones and he wants
them you can take anymore and use
anywhere the actor pros they're a pretty
solid deal who have a link down below to
both their website where you guys can
pick up some of these for yourself if
you can find any out there or out there
anywhere you want to go check out go
listen to them you won't be disappointed
I'm a lark your watch the ticker
tomorrow I'm off to listen smart by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
