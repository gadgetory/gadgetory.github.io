the channel by the way if you like that
song in the beginning we'll have a link
down below where you guys can check it
out so what's going on today
today it's the noctus falcon system
that's right system coming in around
$2,100 and we did something special for
you guys you guys asked for once again
to have a time lapse video and a lot of
you people out there asked for hey man
what about that cable management so
we're going to focus on that today
today's build has a lot of Knights parts
in it like I said it's coming in around
$2,100 all AMD so you ain't e fans out
there who are like going I love AMD well
check it out this system can be for you
and like usual these are just suggested
builds you don't need to lead me to
snarky I want to chose this and done it
this way if you want to build that
system do it in your channel I'll check
it out
but hey this is our build done our way
baby we're like the Burger King of
freaking pcs we do it our way not your
way now there's being a smartass but
anyways let's jump in let's first let's
talk about the parts and everything that
we use in the build and then let's jump
in and let's see Anthony builds in the
time-lapse video so you guys can see
exactly how he put together this awesome
system so let's rock the NZXT team
knocked this 450 mid tower case is a
really nice case if you guys are looking
for something that's mid tower matte
black can fit up to 2 cards inside of it
it's made of steel and ABS plastic it
looks really nice it'll take ATX micro
ATX mini ITX motherboard inside you have
up to 8 bay so it's pretty cool
expansion slots or 7 but take a look at
the top of the case you guys can see
that something's kind of off here though
because there is a power button but
there's actually no restart button you
get 2 USB 3.0 s 2 USB 2.0 s and there's
also a mic and headphones a Kazakh ace
is something kind of neat here is where
you can turn on or off the lights or
turn on that glow underneath the
computer for the motherboard I chose the
Asus prime X 370 Pro this is a really
nice motherboard has enough features for
us to be good enough for this build you
can do 2 cards in it for crossfire one
thing that I have to say though is that
once we put all the parts in it though
you can barely see the board so the
silver and black theme that I want to
kind of get kind of got faded away into
the rest of the build but overall this
is a great
motherboard powering this beast is the
AMD risin 5 1600 X processor 6 cores 12
thread CPU with a frequency of 4.0 and
it's Boost this CPU is used in many
gamers build because it offers a really
great value between price and
performance cooling off the CPU is the
NZXT kraken x52 all-in-one cpu cooler
now we were able to mount this on the
top it looks really clean you guys know
that the Krakens are a really nice
series they cool your CPUs off very well
one thing that I personally like however
is that on the CPU block you guys can
see there's like this infinite mirror
spinning thing in there and for visual
effects this thing just looks badass
featuring 16 gigabytes of Gayle's ddr4
Evo memory at 3200 megahertz
this memory is really nice it has all
kinds of RGB features it's 2 8 gigabyte
sticks and it also looks really nice in
this system you guys involved a
challenge you guys probably recognize
this video car because we've done a few
different things with it in the past
this is the gigabyte ARS Radeon rx 580 x
CR 8 gigabyte graphics card this card is
made to rock and it's actually one of
the very best rx 5 eighties I think you
can get your hands on you guys can see
there's some pretty cool lighting
effects inside this system now these are
the NZXT AER RGB 140 fans and we also
use their few lighting controller in
this build so that makes the system
fully capable doing all kinds of
different RGB colors for the boot drive
of the noctus Falcon we wanted something
really fast so we chose a 4 and 80
gigabyte Corsair Neutron XT 2.5 SSD this
thing has got plenty of room on it for
storing most of your games and it's also
really fast on the boot sequence and for
our main storage drive I use the Western
Digital blue one terabyte drive even
though you can't actually see the power
supply because it has a nice NZXT shroud
over it we use the BitFenix whisper em
80 plus gold fully modular 850 watt
power supply this is a really nice power
supply and you can actually get this
power supply for right at a hundred
bucks right now so it's a great deal for
a power supply at 850 watts alright so
those are all the parts now let's check
out Anthony put this damn beast together
now you guys can see that Anthony does
something a little different he likes to
use a lazy susan ways putting together
everything he just finds easier to spend
the case around that way and look at
everything before he jumps into the
build now it does take him quite a few
hours to do a build of this magnitude
with all the cable management stuff that
takes even more time
you
Anthony is now beginning his cable
management part of the build and this
usually takes him the most time one
thing you really want to focus on when
you're doing cable management is looking
at everything before you actually put it
all together in the system you can test
it out before you lock anything down
make sure that everything is going to
fit in the case the way that you want it
to fit and so it doesn't look like it's
just jammed in there that's one of the
most important things about cable
management is everything not just
looking all bulky and stuck together and
you guys can see that when Anthony does
this type of thing
he takes his time and slowly builds a
system that's totally unobtrusive to any
of the airflow so the system just looks
great it's not messy it's just a
completely killer and clean build
are you still with us well if you are
now that you've seen the system put
together all the cable management let's
check out the performance scores
you guys can see the CPU got up to a
maximum of 72 Celsius at its maximum
heat and the GP was almost the same at
73 Celsius the GPU got as high as 14
hundred and 25 megahertz and we saw the
memory clock at 2000 megahertz so there
you have it gamers and tech fans the
noctis frickin Falcon coming in at a
little over 2,100 bucks this is a very
very nice system if you want to get an
800 X CPU and change it in or something
else you can always do for like always
your just suggested bills I know
everybody can do something different
that's the option of having choice and
be thankful that you have it this system
runs very very nice it's actually been
running the entire time that we've been
filming in the background so you guys
can hear that it does not run very loud
whatsoever it's really nice and quiet
actually mr. buddy wanted to get in the
video and say hello to all you folks out
there he was missing you guys she was
really like running across the floor go
on let me in the video dad he I think he
thinks he's the star here maybe you know
I don't know vote who's cuter mere buddy
I'm just kidding we all know mr. Buttle
always went over and over but at the end
of the day guys this is a really really
a nice build I will probably change the
CPU out in this bill to the 1,800 X in
the future because the previous build
that we did the black cami of you guys
had to miss that level link down below
to that as well but that was our build
for pretty much the Intel side of things
and I want on the AMD side things for to
be pretty equal so I'm most likely going
to change the CP out in this V 1800
extras I think that's more competitive
to the 7700 K I don't think this would
be very fair I'm sure you guys would
agree with that but all in all it's a
really nice system it runs cool it looks
beautiful
the lighting is awesome and best of all
to me it's stable man no lie people talk
about overclocking all this stuff and I
don't really do a lot of that stuff
anymore because to me the absolute most
important thing in any build to me is
stability stability is first performance
comes next and then anything else that
boots nails after that so do you guys
have it folks hope you guys like this
vid if you did hey there's a like button
down there you guys can hit it and below
that we'll have all the links to all the
parts that we did in this build so you
guys can check them out for yourself
also if you want a Windows key just go
online and type in windows key and
you'll get directed to so many places
selling windows keys from 15 dollars up
to 30 dollars that it will blow your
mind so I don't need a link for that you
guys can find it for yourself I'm Elric
buddy the dog mr. G's behind the camera
we'll see you guys back here on TECA
tomorrow for more badass tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
