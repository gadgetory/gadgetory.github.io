comes actually with its own driver and a
manual as well so you guys be able to
get this thing hook it up and get going
and for only $39 I have to say this is
an amazing deal these things are made
really well I think for product that
sits in this price range I have other
headphones I made by their companies
they're still made of the same type of
material some might be a little bit
fancier with a name but I gotta say
these Cyndi's are pretty nice I mean
some of the detail on them is quite
good-looking too so if you're looking
for stuff that's pretty fancy it
actually does a work well in gaming as
well I'll say this as well I tried these
out hence we have these I don't you guys
watch the following video that we had we
actually offer these another video
because they're such a good product that
we actually bought them and said you
know what we need to get these in-house
and really see how good they work and
they do work pretty well and I gotta say
for the price it's a solid deal 7.1 just
a little headset microphone all your
controls and everything on the control
cable not bad folks let's keep going
are you or those folks that's been
sitting on the fence for a long time
about upgrading your PC to an SSD well
if you're one of those folks that time
has never been better to jump in and get
yourself one this is the Patriot torch
it's a 120 gigabyte SSD that's currently
under $50 so think about that
the price per gigabyte is amazing and
when you're booting up your system
it's so much faster and accessing all
your programs is just so much faster now
120 gigabytes isn't the largest one but
for putting your boot drives on in a
couple of games as once you play all the
time time has never been better
Patriot torch 120 gigabytes 150 bucks
are you looking for a programmable laser
gaming mouse that has nine buttons has
total weight adjustment and is under
fifty bucks then you might want to check
out the one from Ankur now I've got the
anchor a two hundred dpi high-precision
programmable laser gaming mouse now this
thing features adjustable weight tuning
nine programmable buttons a laser
tracking and it's very comfortable for
those people with a medium-sized hand
I'm person to medium sized hand you guys
can see it lights up blue works very
well and actually is really funny that
works in either a Mac or PC as well I
plug this in right now to the Mac that
were to like viewing and it just starts
up no problem had no issues at all so it
doesn't even need a driver to work
pretty cool little product it's got a
nice design on the left-hand side which
will be operated by your thumb we see
the first three buttons then on top we
have two more buttons scroll wheel and
the adjustable dpi button which you guys
can see here I can automatically a
change on the fly at the nice little
glowing anchor blue logo there on the
right hand side there's nothing
whatsoever just a place you to balance
your finger now for people with the
medium-sized hand this is a very very
comfortable Mouse and it works with both
a Mac and a PC without drivers it's
simply plug and play inside the box
there's a little sticker that says not
happy all you do is buy yourself the
anchor mouse and then you'll be happy
and it's only in today's computer world
USB devices are everywhere I mean
they're everything we use from our
printers to charging our phones I mean
man USB is everywhere and sometimes your
computer simply just does not have
enough points well in that case
sovereign has you covered with their ten
port USB hub now this thing features the
ability to do 3.0 all the way across and
it also features a five volt 2 amp smart
charging port right here on the end for
charging your phone
like that now it comes with everything
that you need inside the box to get up
and going and this is a very solid
product has great ratings around the
world and for those people who are
looking to just have more USB hubs this
thing has you covered
it also features three power buttons for
choosing which part of the device or all
a device at once that you want to use
another great feature it doesn't matter
what type of computer that you use this
device is completely plug and play with
all Mac or PC devices so no matter who
you're using sovereign's got you covered
and last but not least we have the
Logitech G 105 programmable gaming
keyboard now this thing features six
programmable G keys with 18 functions
per game which is pretty interesting and
all the keys are backlit blue in both
the WASD keys and the direction keys are
separate color gray for you guys to
easily see even in daylight there's also
a game desktop switched now this allows
you to disable all the things are going
on your Windows environment so you get
no interruptions while you're gaming you
know that is sometimes you're playing a
game something happens in the windows
background office and you're kicked out
of the game going what the practice
happened and it was something in Windows
oh hey with the g105 they have you
covered and you eliminate that problem
altogether now in the backside you guys
can see it's totally awesome red so with
the black and red color scheme it'll go
with many of those builds out there who
do them like raagh or just that standard
black and red theme which for me I you
know relate to your AMD or Ferrari you
know this kind of color scheme or rock
those are the three big ones now for
those people out there looking for a
solid gaming keyboard you don't really
give a crap by getting mechanical
keyboard gotta say this is a very very
solid buy so for those folks out there
just looking for a really awesome
keyboard that's for gaming and they
don't care about having a mechanical
keyboard this is a really awesome one
though do the job for you with those
programmable keys you'll be able to play
your games and use those instant things
you need to kill your opponent which can
be really handy when you do those games
that involve spells me I'm more a
first-person shooter but I've seen these
guys men who are using these spells and
hit these multi Keys and it's actually
really cool maybe I'll get into a little
bit give a spell myself and last but not
least before I bounce out of here I'd
