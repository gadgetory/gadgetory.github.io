tomorrow bring guys another benchmark
test this time it's the much anticipated
witcher 3 which a lot of people are
curious about because of those daunting
spec requirements now just taking a
quick look at the options menu you can
see that the game does have its graphic
settings divided in two separate
sections graphics and post-processing
graphic presets come in low medium high
and ultra while post-processing is just
low medium and high so we ran 4 separate
tests running both on low both on medium
both on high and ultra with high now as
far as what gameplay segments we chose
to run these tests through we picked one
of the game's open-world side quests
which is where you will spend a lot of
time in the game it's during a clear
sunny day while fighting enemies and
traversing a lot of terrain your mileage
may vary a little bit based on what the
current weather conditions are what kind
of enemies are fighting how often using
spells or if there's fires in the
background but as far as just the
average game time goes this is what a
lot of its going to look like now if
you're not familiar with our test system
that we've used in previous tests it
does include a gtx 780 as well as an i7
4770k processor that is overclocked if
you guys want more in depth specifics we
do have that link down below as for how
all this ended well let's take a look
so as you can see the game can
definitely be daunting at higher setting
it's just barely missing 30 frames per
second at max and it will go lower
during more hectic scenes but it's also
a bit more forgiving on lower settings
seeing it jump up nearly 50 frames per
second at its lowest so while it will
take a good bit of power to get the game
running smoothly on high settings you
can still get a pretty good framerate as
long as you don't mind sacrificing a bit
of the graphics quality world detail
definitely takes the biggest hit on
lower settings but interior places and
character animations still look great
across all settings as for how the game
is thus far I'm absolutely loving it
while this one does deviate a decent bit
gameplay wise by opening the world up
and focuses and items being more readily
replenishable and with shorter durations
the whole thing feels like just the
right mix of keeping the complexity and
difficulty of older Witcher games but
making it all a lot more accessible and
easier to jump into combat is fast paced
and a hell of a lot smoother than either
of its predecessors and the move to
open-world has made monster hunting a
much larger and more interesting part of
the game focusing on you tracking beasts
down figuring out what exactly it is
you're up against and getting hints as
to what kind of weapons spells and
potions will help you out the most
against them I'm only a few hours in and
the game feels absolutely massive and
there's a lot more ground to cover
before I can give a proper full opinion
but if the early games pace keeps up
witcher 3 looks to already be a huge
contender for game of the year if you're
interested in grabbing the game we do
have it linked down below as always if
you guys enjoyed the vid wreck that like
