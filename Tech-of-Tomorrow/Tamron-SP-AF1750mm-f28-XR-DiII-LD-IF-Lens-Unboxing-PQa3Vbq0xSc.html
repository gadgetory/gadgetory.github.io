today here on techo tomorrow we're gonna
show you something pretty interesting
now I know a lot of people ask questions
about what we use when we're filming and
how we do it well we're gonna have a
whole video based on that and we're
getting ready to upgrade the lens on our
Canon d60 camera so with that said we
went out and we looked online and we
found a bunch of different ones and
actually this Tamron one the DI two
seemed to be the really best one for our
camera now the model were going to look
at today is the SP AF it's the 17
through 50 millimeter lens the model
number is basically you know the f - 2.8
XR LD a spherical I app now these are a
lot of different things I don't really
know about these things I'm in front of
the camera but the camera man behind the
place these guys all said hey get this
really cool ends it'll make our filming
better so we're gonna do that and today
we're gonna do the unboxing and show you
guys this thing now you guys can find
its thing on Amazon it's about four to
nine nine dollars and really kind of a
really nice wide angle lens the lens
that came on my Canon DS 60 it's a
pretty decent lens but everybody's
saying hey this lens is much better for
what you do
so we've bought it and we're gonna bring
it to you and today we're gonna do the
unboxing so show you guys in front of
the Box flip it up here to the front
flip it around the side pretty much all
different stuff is the same now on the
other side over here though it does show
an award let me get this up here you
guys can see this lens is actually won
an award and this particular model is
made for the Canon series of cameras
obviously to fit on my camera otherwise
we didn't go to use it you know I'm
saying you know I'm saying right alright
so check it out this is a little clip
here as I'm unboxing it - there'll be a
page in there that shows you guys all
the breakdown features that'll also be
in the description below if you guys
want to check those out but today we're
gonna show you the unboxing so here we
go right on top you got a little piece
of paper it says this product will
self-destruct in five everybody get out
of here
I'm just kidding it just says the model
number so there's a model number I'll
get that
very gently set that off to the side
here's the Tamron instruction guide and
stuff in there I'll hold the little lens
over here my lap and I'll get this stuff
out yes and see it it's basically just
telling the different ways to use the
camera there's a lot of stuff that's
written and I believe Chinese I said
aging you guys made fun of me but hey
Chinese our agent aren't they right I
wasn't wrong I suppose being specific
you know so we got that there's that
part of it man we've got another part
it's just basically just telling you
caution precautions when I'm not going
to open that up
caution precautions yada yada yada yada
yada yada there's one more little piece
right here this one's actually
explaining more about the lens how to
mount it under your camera all that kind
of stuff so this is probably gonna be a
more important one let me get it out of
here open it up here so you guys can see
what it is but whoa I almost lost the
lens there that would have been nice so
there we go
there's all that stuff oh you guys can't
just say I didn't show you the stuff in
the unboxing check it out there's all
that stuff all the good instructions and
then here's the lens right here and
right about now is probably a good time
for you know you guys can see all the
features here I'm not talking about
before you can see those all listed
there you know I'll come back to the
unboxing right here move the lens out
and that's pretty much it we'll set the
Box off to the side okay so here we see
the inside they got one of those little
you know things to keep out moisture
I've said before don't eat this kitties
it's not candy it's silicon gel but it's
not jello so don't want you to know
Munchie Munchie on this thought the
Cameron he's on it
actually I am - we're getting ready to
make a killer lunch today I'm gonna make
some of the most awesome grilled cheese
vegetarian sandwiches that anybody's
ever seen I should just start a
restaurant show - all right so here we
go first part that's gonna go outside in
the outside of the lens now remember
folks if you're gonna make comments I
don't know crap about cameras and stuff
hey you're gonna be absolutely right
because I don't I am NOT the camera man
now I am in front of the camera and you
guys it's tough but here's the lens if
you can I'm gonna make some nice
close-ups of it
you move this right here and then screw
this part into your camera
here's the front the lens cap cover two
little squeezy squeezes and there's the
lens II to move around who has some cool
sound let me get up here so you hear
that
hi MA robot dick Flint please make me
work proper but alright so there's the
winds here's the different settings so
basically folks this is a wide-angle
lens for the canon d 60 supposed to
really improve the clarity and the color
scheme and stuff we're also gonna be
investing some money and getting a bunch
of cool different filters so we can
actually work outdoors you guys seem to
really like it when we go outdoors so
