looking for a gaming monitor that is a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 which is wqhd
we'll check it out picks you as a brand
new one that just came out on the market
now this is the px 27 6h now this
particular monitor does boast quite a
lot of features for its you know pretty
hefty price tag now if you're a person
out there who's looking for HDR well
guess what this monitor has it built
inside of it but the only cabbage that
is it has to be done through an hdmi 2.0
cable which they do include in the box
which is pretty cool now inside the box
itself you get the monitor you get the
instruction manual and get the power
brick the power cable and an HDMI cable
now if your person like me who usually
use their DisplayPort you know cable
well you're not gonna be wanting to use
it on this monitor especially if you
want that HDR feature now if you guys
don't know what HDR HDR just basically
makes all the colors blacks and whites
much more vivid on the monitor all the
color is a lot better it's much more
lighting inside the monitor overall it's
just better for lighting inside of games
now this particular panel is 1
millisecond it's very fast a TN panel
which means gonna be the fastest refresh
rate but the colors aren't going to be
the absolute best because obviously you
have this kind of monitor it's geared
for gaming it's really not for doing
graphic design if you're watching movies
it looks okay it's not absolutely
totally go oh my god when you're
watching movies but it still looks ok
but in game with the HDR feature on it
looks really nice now to give this
you're also gonna have to have the
latest version of windows installed in
your computer because if you don't have
it installed you're not gonna get those
features either but when you see it in
game it does make a difference between
being on and off and you guys can see in
a couple screenshots here there is a
difference it's just really all about
the lighting and the way the lighting
looks to look more natural more bright
that's what it's all supposed to be now
this water is also very very fast 144
Hertz and it features free sync
technology now even if you don't have
free sync technology you can still use
the hundred and forty-four Hertz feature
they call it overclocking within the
monitor but if you have an A&amp;amp;B card now
freeze thing it's going to be the way to
go you can be able to hook this up to
any of your AMD cards that support that
and if you guys don't know a free sync
as I know many people do but for those
who don't it makes your
so that runs totally smooth no screen
tearing it's like having vertical sink
on on on speed because it pretty much
just takes everything makes it run
smooth clear so would even when things
are moving SuperDuper fast motion you
don't get any blurring or anything like
that on the screen everything just looks
smooth so that all your gameplay is cool
now another carrot that particular
monitors even though it has onboard
speakers these particular onboard
speakers are pretty weak sauce they
really are they they're just not very
loud whatsoever I mean unless you're
like stuck in a dorm room somewhere and
you can't really have loud sound I'd
probably recommend you know either using
headphones or getting yourself a better
set of speakers but I mean at least
they're in there so if you you know
you're absolutely desperate and just
need to have some sound hey it is there
but it's not yeah definitely not the
best option that you would want to
choose
now the other thing about this monitor
is the bezel is a little bit big for my
taste especially if I was gonna do multi
monitor setup now if you don't care
about that type of thing you just want
one single monitor that particular fact
means absolutely nothing to you but for
those people out there who are looking
for that fact it actually does make a
difference now I also went out and I
bought a tool a little while it goes
those of you who follow the channel know
I got this this this tool that actually
measures input light because a lot of
people are saying hey I'll work you know
all these features and all this stuff is
cool but what is the input lag so the
input lag in this particular monitor is
21 milliseconds so honestly that's
really short amount of time and the
whole spread of things you know it's a
thousand milliseconds to you know to
even be in something so it's basically
you're not gonna really notice that
whatsoever the response times gonna be
just perfect everything about the
monitor is gonna be great for doing
gaming now as far as like the color
things like I said you know between the
TN VN and then the higher-end panels you
know they're really the difference is is
that the as they go up they get better
in color and they get slower and how
fast the refresh rates and response
times go and that's just how it you know
it is TN panels are the absolute fastest
that's why you're getting this really
fast one millisecond response time but
that with 144 Hertz of refresh and with
with freesync that's gonna be just
perfect for gaming and as you guys can
see I mean games do look really awesome
when you're playing them all the colors
and everything are bright their vivid
it's really really cool and since this
monitor really is you know geared as a
gaming monitor I mean I could sit here
and kick it in the button so okay yeah
it's not you know great for doing
digital editing and blah blah blah and
it's not good for watching movies not
the best thing in the world but it
really it's not game for that it doesn't
say hey you know hey this particular
monitor is a gaming TV editing monitor
it says strictly this is a gaming
monitor and for those particular tasks
you guys will see it's pretty good now
if you're wondering can this monitor be
vaison mounted yes it can it can be
mounted to a wall there's no problem
with that whatsoever the stand however
is pretty sturdy you don't have to worry
about anything like that the design is
nice on the back you don't have a whole
lot of different connections you have
your display port you have your HDMI and
you have your power it's pretty
simplistic back here not a whole lot to
talk about there
all in all it's a very straightforward
monitor and if you're looking for a
monitor that
a lot of adjustment definitely you're
not gonna want to be looking at this
particular monitor it only just has a
little bit of a tilt feature but for a
lot of people that really doesn't matter
for others it does matter depending on
their desk is they want their monitor to
be able to go higher lower this
particular monitor does not have that
feature if you know if the monitor sits
you know right in front of you where
you're happy then the tilt feature will
be just perfect for you you don't have
to really take that into consideration
but if you're a person who does need
those features you're also gonna want to
take that in consideration before you
think about purchasing this particular
monitor the OSD itself it's actually
pretty easy to navigate and use it's
located right under the right-hand side
of the monitor just put your hand
underneath there with your fingers you
can feel it to click the buttons it's
very easy to navigate and go through as
you guys can see it's very simple you
know it's just like pretty much all the
monitors out there of all it's really
different where they're located you get
into them you scroll around you change
through things you save your settings
you go out blah blah blah it's the same
thing pretty much in every single
monitor out there this one's knowed you
know better or worse than any it's just
there and it's there if you need to use
it a lot of people probably won't even
touch that particular aspect of the
monitor unless for some reason their
monitors not being read on their video
car they're gonna go hey what's going on
at the input but most the time it's
going to auto detect by whatever your
cable you have connected to and you're
not even have to worry about really
messing with those controls whatsoever
all right so that's everything there is
to know about the px 27 6h monitor now
like I said this monitor comes to market
at about three hundred and nineteen
dollars and in a lot of ways pixie will
be fighting kind of an uphill battle
with that price even though it does have
a lot of great features that people are
gonna be like hey those are cool
features pixie oh that hasn't really
made you know the total name for
themself like Samsung and some other
companies out there that are famous in
the PC world they're kind of new to it
so in that particular aspect they'll be
fighting an uphill battle now is there
really anything to really complain about
well not really if you look at it from
the aspect that it's a gaming monitor it
plays games and it looks great now like
I said before if you want to have the
HDR you're going to have to use an hdmi
2.0 cable but it comes in the box so
it's really not baiting a big dude you
don't have to go onto Amazon or Ebay
click and go buy to come to inside the
box not to worry about that so as long
as your card supports that feature
you're totally good to go and almost all
the new video cards on the market
totally support that now if you're an
AMD guy obviously you'll be able to use
free sync now I know that there
been things around the internet that say
them you know they have a workaround so
that you can use Nvidia cards and use
free sync now when this becomes like a
standard thing where anybody can do it
then I'll probably talk about that but
for tricky things that don't really work
all totally perfect all the time I kind
to avoid them I may look into it a
little bit though because I have built
you know a really nice system to power
my three monitors this will be written
string as well but at the end of the day
the pick CEO does have a lot of features
kind of a little bit of a price tag do I
like the speakers in it do I think it's
great for doing three monitors and no
but just as a gaming monitor looking at
it playing games it's really nice to
view all the games look great
they're fluid they're no motion with the
HDR all the colors are really great and
with that 144 Hertz one millisecond
response time obviously you know that
all the action is going to be smooth
fluid you're not gonna see any kind of
screen tears whatsoever it's just gonna
be nothing but a fluid gaming experience
