computer out there needs a good power
supply and you like me are always
searching for one that'll last a long
time have great features and won't break
down middle it's using us and causing us
to go crazy so we can't game well today
we're gonna look at the brand new
flagship power supply from the people
over at c-- sonic now this is their
AirTouch gold 850 watt gold power supply
and some we were going what exactly does
Gold mean well what gold certified means
is that the power supply ran at ninety
percent of its efficiency at a fifty
percent load for long periods of time
meaning that the power supply is very
solid also one thing really cool that
you guys are gonna see as we get into
this is that this power supply has a 12
year warranty that's right
a 12 year warranty and I don't know
about you guys but I've really never had
a system lasts for more than three or
four years at the max so having a power
supply that is a 12 year warranty means
that you can build lots of systems and
if it ever breaks down within that 12
year period you guys can get a brand new
power supply so that's pretty crazy so
with that said though let's jump in
let's see what comes inside the box
let's talk about the features and why at
the end of the day you may just consider
this power supply for your system
everything you actually need comes
inside the box you get the power supply
itself you get all of the cables you get
all kinds of goodies for doing cable
management but what you also get which
is something I've rarely ever seen is
they actually include a PSU tester in
the box that's right this will allow you
to perform a quick and easy jumpstart on
the power supply and each prime air
touch series power supply will also ship
with a SATA 3.3 adapter now this
supports the power disable feature on
the newer high-capacity hard drives to
maximize flexibility the 180-degree SATA
connectors ensure more flexibility and
easier installation which means they're
very easy to use in the cable management
because they fit in more places and are
actually a lot simpler to use in the big
giant round cables of the past so that's
everything that comes inside of the box
now let's talk about the different
cables that actually
come in the system before we go in-depth
on the power supply first off we have
the main power cable there's a single 24
pin cable inside the box and it's 610
millimeters in length as far as the CPU
cable goes these are the eight and four
pin cables there are actually two of
these and these are both 650 millimetres
long as well as far as the PCIe cables
go there are three different cables with
a total of six different connections so
you can hook up SLI or crossfire if you
want to now as far as the SATA
connections ago they're actually quite a
bit there are two cables that each have
four connections on it another cable
that has two connections on it and
there's actually a molex cable that has
an additional two connections so
altogether you get a total of 12 SATA
connections inside the system now
additionally there's also a floppy disk
cable I don't have any people are gonna
actually use this and the power cable
itself so first off let's take a look at
the bottom of the power supply now
underneath the shroud you guys can see
that there's a fan but this just isn't
any normal fan this is actually a new
fluid dynamic fan that supports a high
performance fluid dynamic bearing now
these type of fans are designed to take
advantage of the impact absorbing
effects of oil which means that they
react the oil inside of them now these
particular fans are also very low noise
and generate almost zero heat which
means they're gonna last a really long
time hence being able to give you that
12 year warranty now one of the latest
features of the air touch power supply
series is something called micro
tolerance load regulation see Sonic's
latest design keeps the output voltage
within a very tight range achieving
under a 0.5% load regulation now this
electrical performance and stability
means that this power supply is geared
for extremely high-end systems each side
of the air touch features the same exact
thing it just says C sonic and air touch
on both sides on the very bottom of the
power supply you guys can see the model
number where it says it's the prime air
touch 850 gold plus it's 80 plus
certification since this power supply is
completely modular which means no cables
are cooked up to it whatsoever you hook
them all up individually on the
front hand side of the power spot you
can see where all of the different
connections are it's very simply labeled
so that you can plug everything in
exactly where it goes and be up and
going pretty quickly now on the backside
of the power supply is work it's a
little bit interesting you have your
normal power connection your on and off
button but then this button right here
actually changes your fans to five
different speeds that's right and each
one of these different speeds coincides
with a color when the fan is set to
turbo mode which that's highest mode the
color is red high cooling mode is yellow
medium cooling mode is green low cooling
mode is blue and silent is white I think
that for most people who aren't gaming
they're probably going to keep it on the
silent white feature that way it's you
know not creating a lot of noise in
their system it's still got air flow but
it's not going to its maximum Rev but if
you're doing overclocking and you got a
high-end gaming system you're probably
going to want to gear this on the higher
fan speeds now one thing it's also kind
of cooled many people out there like
doing theme type builds means Ferrari
AMD and you guys can see the color
scheme being red and black will fit with
all kinds of different things out there
including a Zeus's rock series and many
other stuff out there so if you're
looking to build you know if you're
looking to have a build that's going to
be very you know color-coordinated this
power supply might also be something
that you're looking for now the only
caveat I have to that whatsoever is
let's just say you have an AMD build and
you don't always want to keep the fan on
at full power well then all someone you
change the fan speed you're going to be
changing the color I think would have
been really nice if you could actually
change the colors to whatever you want
to be then it would actually be a total
thumbs up as it is it's am you know of
three quarters of the way thumbs up but
if you had the ability to change all the
colors on the fly I'd give it a
full-blown thumbs up for being RGB now
last but not least underneath the hood
you guys concede that this new power
supply is completely cable free it uses
the absolute latest in capacitors and
components ensuring extremely long life
and you can see that everything is
completely soldered
to a copper board so no more cable
connections whatsoever and that's where
you know reliability gets a little iffy
having this particular design means the
power supply is gonna run for a really
long time it's gonna run cool and it's
not gonna break down on you probably
when you're doing something really
important which to me is actually a very
important aspect of the power supply
most people talk about just the features
and stuff like that but the actual
design of the board and all the
components in it are very much important
just as much as all the features of the
power supply all right so there you have
it folks everything that comes in the
box
all of the features everything you
pretty much need to know about see
Sonic's latest flagship power supply
this is the AirTouch gold 850 watt power
supply fully modular lots of features
you guys can see that in the Box you get
stuff for cable management you even get
a power supply tester I mean how many
people actually provide a power supply
tester for you inside the box that in
itself is pretty incredible plus that 12
year warranty now I'm not particularly
sure if this product is actually
released yet we'll have a link to their
home page you guys can check out more
information about this but for now this
is it man our really nice power supply
great warranty great features probably
going to be in the $200 price range no
NC Sonics power supplies and the way
they go because most of their good power
supplies are all over a hundred bucks so
if you're looking for something like
this hey check out more information I'm
Eric and you've been watching teka
