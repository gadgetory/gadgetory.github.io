what Thanksgiving is all right Marie
wine Shh white folks showed up over on
the shores cheated Indians out of their
land ly do them took it over they had a
big feast to celebrate and then from
then after we've been celebrating
Thanksgiving so it's basically a
celebration of how we came and extorted
the Indians out of their land and ate
some food with them I mean that's really
the reality of it don't let anybody
 you any different that's really
what it's all about I mean we celebrate
it in a different way for us in our
hearts it's for everybody to get
together and celebrate but honestly
Thanksgiving seems to be about the
celebration about us coming here and
taking land from the poor Indians
because basically this was their country
and we came here and I respect that fact
I respect you and IAM folks out there I
notice ought to be your country but
anyways I just want to say happy
Thanksgiving everybody and for us
Thanksgiving means family friends loved
celebration inviting strangers over to
your house that you don't even know to
come eat food thanksgiving for us now in
our celebration in our hearts means hey
everybody get together have a good time
people you don't even know or welcome in
your home you treat them like your
family and on that day and thanksgiving
to a lot of American that's even a
bigger holiday than Christmas Christmas
is about presents but Thanksgiving Day
is about thanks giving thanks for
everything you have and sharing that
with all the people around you so always
remember that your money doesn't matter
all that really matters your help your
friends and your family and that said I
wish all you guys out there in the
entire world a happy thanksgiving
