once again a ticker tomorrow we've got
some more CES 2017 coverage so let's
jump right in first up we have a Dell 8k
monitor now this is a 32 inch 8k desktop
monitor with 1.7 billion colors it has a
resolution of 76 80 by 4320 an amazing
pixel density of 280 pixels per inch now
this is as many pixels as you'd get in
for 4k monitors or 16 Full HD panels for
you artists out there though who looking
for the absolute best you can get this
monitor does have 100% coverage of the
Adobe RGB and srgb color gamut
it's also made of aluminum construction
the only caveat this thing's $5,000
that's right $5,000 the picture it's an
8k monitor if you're an artist out there
or somebody's in the industry and you
want to work on a lot of things this is
going to be bad ass because check it out
you can be having your 4k video you know
up here editing something else over here
like I said for 4k monitors can fit on
that screen so that gives you a lot of
places to work with if I had the cash I
got to be honest with you I jump in
there just because productivity is going
to be insane now for you people out
there I know there's no 8k movies or
anything really out yet none near least
not at home but when they get here this
is cool stuff all in all it sounds
pretty good but hell that's one big-ass
bag of gold so all right in our last
video we showed you guys a ten thousand
dollar laptop from the people over there
at Acer their Predator X 21 it was
pretty badass but now razor has
something even more insane how they can
even call it a laptop I don't even know
but this is check it out I'm not even
freakin joking they're lying to you
triple monitors on a laptop what see
this crazy this is insane triple
gaming laptop is right now codenamed
project Valerie now this features three
17-inch monitors these are equally sized
at 17.3 inches and each sporting up to a
4k resolution the monitors also jisuk
enabled so you can play all your games
without any screen tearing now this
resolution is completely ridiculous
eleven thousand five hundred and twenty
by twenty one sixty it also features a
desktop grade NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080
graphics cards I guess there's not two
of them and project Valkyrie weighs less
than 12 pounds so check this out three
17-inch monitor 7.3 to be exact at the
4k resolution that is very light 12
pounds come on that Mumma we were
looking at before the 10k one that
weighed 20 pounds so if project Valerie
actually takes off this will definitely
be a secret weapon for the people over
there razor because it's just fricking
bad ass now pricing and availability it
ain't out yet but when this hits the
market I'm sure people out there with
bucks are gonna definitely want to jump
onto this and take advantage of having
three 4k monitors that you can stick in
your backpack and go play in the woods
if you've been following us in the
channel you guys have noticed that
lately we've done a few builds within
one cases we did one in the 805 and then
we did another one the 909 just a week
ago and these cases are incredible
now anyone also had a case last year
called the towel it was badass a lot of
people built systems in it it looks very
very Spacey and Star Trek it pretty much
looks like you pulled out some science
fiction theater it doesn't even really
look like a case because all the weird
angles and stuff but now they've built
the system at the show based on the new
tattoo and this thing looks badass
let's talk about the specs and what's
inside this new tattoo now the tattoo
itself is a full tower case made of
aluminum and tempered glass it has 5 2.5
inch drive bays and 5 3.5 inch drive
bays so plenty of room for expansion and
it doesn't matter what kind of other
boards you have it'll fit inside the
Tautou all the way from microwave TX all
the way to expand it EA TX 12 inches by
13 inch maximum so you can fit a huge
board inside the case and the
motherboard powering the system is the
Asus Republic of gamers rampage 5
edition
they also have the a Zeus rod Strix GTX
1084 the video card there are two drives
for your storage inside of this system a
single HyperX savage SSD at 240 gigabyte
and also an intel SSD 750 series at 800
gigabytes the cpu is the i7 59 60 X
you've got plenty of power there and
powering this piece is an n1 si B
thousand 65 watt power supply features
in win aurora fans and the liquid
cooling is provided by ek you guys can
see though overall this build just looks
really nice it's elegant the glass looks
cool when you look inside of it all the
colored lights everything gleaming and
reflecting off this thing is just
one bad ass built when we get the case
we plan on doing our own build and
hopefully you can make ours even more
badass you guys know I love that word
buy that's in fact you guys should have
a drinking game how many times I say
badass in videos how many times you take
a shot so I heard you guys say before
slow do it do it do it just do it I'll
give you my Magnum face alright well
that's it folks
this is the end of our CES coverage

lot of stuff coming up from corsair just
