personally I've always been a fan of
comics I have always been a fan of iron
Matt and since the Iron Man the Avenger
seemed to be a really big thing these
days it seems like Samsung is jumping on
the bandwagon and getting their ass in
the Marvel Universe what am I talking
about we'll check this out in select
countries you're going to be able to get
your hands on an S six version that's
going to be a totally Iron Man limited
edition phone now this thing's going to
be crazy and Samsung's gone to a lot of
effort to bring an incredible unboxing
it's one of the coolest unboxings
actually i've ever seen i wish i had the
budget doin like that cuz it's actually
really cool but it's coming folks that's
right so this might be good news for
some people who haven't bought a phones
you're like alright cool I big iron man
and I dig samsung but if you've already
bought one you might feel like the whole
can be like Hulk smash but that's it
folks now this thing's gonna be a little
bit pricey and like I said it's only
coming to a few selected countries at
first that's Korea Hong Kong and China
right now there's no US release I was
saying with the frick mando yes release
we would buy that we would buy that I
would buy that I think you would buy
that as well now check this out as well
for those people out there who happen to
be on a limited budget and can't afford
to actually go out and buy this phone
the cool people over its slick wraps
they have you covered why well cuz check
this out you can get a product from
slick wraps that actually makes your
phone look like the Ironmen limited
edition but at a much lower price now
slick wrap actually offers a whole bunch
of different products these guys
basically make a sticker type product
that you apply in a various amount of
stuff changing the way it looks adding
logos design and everything else all
through this company and they've got one
for you covered for the Essex and for
the Iron Man
addition and what's even cooler is the
slick wraps addition is only twenty-five
dollars and looks almost identical to
the s6 version they even have a skin for
the wireless charger that looks almost
identical to the one of the limited
edition pack and for those people who
are interested this will have that link
down below so you can get your hands on
one so you can be one of the cool kids
one of the latest trends to hit the
market and it's actually a pretty
negative trend is people sending you a
text message that is actually something
that will crash your iPhone worst case
scenario it'll crash your entire phone
or cause it to reboot without warning or
at best it will lock uses out of the
messages app so what this equates to is
that this cannot be done randomly it's
done by people on purpose who have been
singled out as targets and if you do a
quick search on Twitter you can see a
bunch of pissed-off victims who have
felt for this prank and apparently if
the person who sent you the initial
message send you a follow-up message
it's supposed to unlock the messages app
at this time point details about what's
going on is really sketchy but one
Reddit user claims this is due to how
the banner notifications process the
unicode text but of course that's just
one explanation and many others will
have their own opinion problems like
this have service in the past and Apple
always fixes them very quick an apple
spokesman said they are aware of an
iMessage issue caused by specific series
of Unicode characters and they will make
a fix available in a software upgrade
hopefully none of your friends are
stupid enough for silly enough to send
this to you when I think of the word
periscope the very first thing that pops
into my mind is a submarine and out
destroying some stuff but I guess
nowadays periscope is a live streaming
app which has been available a little
while in the iphone but now it's
available on android and there are a few
differences the biggest difference
between the two platforms is how you
start a broadcast when using android
you'll see a big red button on the
broadcast screen this is a design
element that fits into google's material
design aesthetic which they first
introduced in android 5.0 lollipop
those is in the Android version will
find that push notifications are a bit
more granular and it's easy to jump back
into action after fielding your call or
completing some other task that
interrupted your broadcast just tap the
return to broadcast notifications on the
android home screen and you're back in
the action for those people out there
for some reason don't have to know what
live streaming out there is probably
none of this audience is but there might
be somebody if you are those people then
with live streaming is is basically
broadcasting what you're doing live now
this is really really cool because if
you're running your text show or doing
something you can stream it live so
people can be right there at your event
with you this is something that's
catching on more and more and more and
here at Tech in tomorrow I might be
looking into this because I've been
thinking about doing some live stuff and
if this thing is all that it says it is
hmm I think I'll check it out let me
know what you folks think down below LG
fans if you're based in the US your wait
is over because the LG g4 is now
available in the US but right now it's
only being advertised by t-mobile and
with that comes some really cool news
t-mobile is getting early buyers a free
128 gigabyte micro SD card so that slot
doesn't have to be wasted whatsoever and
with 128 gigabytes you can put a lot of
music on there or do some really cool
movies so that's right folks I said it
it's here you can get your hands on the
new LG g4 we're also going to have a
full video on that coming up soon and if
you guys got to see it or not but we had
our video the first 24 hours with the LG
g4 if you miss that you guys can check
that out so that wraps up today's hot
stories folks like usual all the
information will be down there below

the people out there will helping at
these stories together links will be
