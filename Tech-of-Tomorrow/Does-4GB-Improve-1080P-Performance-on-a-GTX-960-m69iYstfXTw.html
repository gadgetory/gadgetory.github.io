here once again so what are we doing
here today well today we're going to be
checking out a four gigabyte version of
the GTX 960 from the people over at
gigabyte this is their wind force
addition and does 4 gigabytes actually
really mean at 1080 let's see so
let's first start off with taking a look
at the car now right off the bat you
guys can see there are three fans
predominate on the top all with the
gigabyte logo on top underneath that you
can clearly see the aluminum heat fins
and there are four heat pipes also to
keep the card running cool down below
that you guys can see the PCI interface
and once again you can see more of that
aluminum heat fins on the side I'll spin
the card around the back you can clearly
see the four copper heat pipes emanating
from the back of the card looking pretty
cool now as we take a look at the top of
the card you guys can see more of the
heat fins you can also see the six pin
and the eight pin power connectors as
well as more of those aluminum heat fins
now with the wind force logo is this
lights up all the time but on the side
you can see there are two little lights
now these light up when the cards in
silent mode and then they go off when
the cards fans running so if your system
is running nice and cool the card will
go on silent mode the fans won't be
spinning at all it'll be completely
silent and it'll say silent and as soon
as your card heats up enough to run
those fans those lights will go off and
your fans will start spinning once again
as we flip around the back of the card
you guys can see once again see the g1
gaming logo by the way this is the g1
gaming 4gb edition of the car the total
nomenclature is the envy and 960 g1
gaming Ford GT that's its full-on Norman
clay churn you guys sincere here in the
back it has that g1 gaming and the
little tiny Egyptian I also you guys
totally are in love with these back
panels I don't blame you I'm going to
love with them too they offer total
solid protection for your card also we
can see up there in the right-hand
corner the single SLI connector this
card can do two cards in SLI mode
another really cool aspect about this
card is actually the rear i/o now many
people have contacted me lots of times
they're trying to hook up multi monitor
going hey man do I have to have a power
to dapper what's going on I can't get it
to work well with this card and the
option that they have on the rear i/o
they have quite a bit as well as
guys can see you guys can hook up four
different display types with different
connections and they'll all work out to
buy any type of adapters or anything
else and that's really cool now as far
as the outline of the rear i/o it goes
like this you have a dual link DVI DVID
HDMI and three display ports this card
has a base clock speed of twelve hundred
and sixty-six megahertz and it's boost
clock is at thirteen twenty nine
megahertz now this is just
out-of-the-box experimentation and where
you live you might get better or worse
results it just depends on actually
where you live and how cool your system
is the maximum resolution of the card is
4k is 4096 by 2160 and like I said this
card should do very well for those
people wanted to use multi monitors now
as far as the gaming goes on multi
monitors that four gigabytes should come
a little bit into play now having four
gigabytes of extra memory should
actually translate into better graphics
at higher resolutions and we'll get in
that a little bit later but we found
this card at 2560 by 1440 even with
those four gigabytes it really wasn't
doing too much this card's geared for
1080p that's where it shines with that
said let's jump in right now let's first
take a look at our test station then
rock out to the benchmark songs and see
how this card does against the
competition let's rock
maybe
all right so there you have it man the
gigabyte g1 for gigabyte version of the
GTX 960 now as far as the car goes this
card is very well made the three fans on
top all of its cooling stuff all of the
backplate all this stuff makes this card
really nice including all that ability
took up multiple monitors so this card
has a lot of positive features to it now
as far as just out of box testing goes
well you guys can see that there were a
few other cards that actually tested a
little higher and that's due to those
cards being way more overclocked but you
can use the gauntlet soft floor and I'm
sure you can overclock this card just as
well it was like 39 at sitting still and
66 under full loads so you know this
card has plenty of room to do more
overclocking I'm sure the car can
probably get up to like probably 90
Celsius and still run just fine so the
Headroom on it's very very large so
don't really you know look at those
numbers and just go a while you know
this card sucks it got sore because you
can always overclock it to those same
numbers they're just doing it out of the
box with that said though I think this
card offers a lot of features if it
wasn't $49 more I would actually get an
interest choice and say whoo awesome
awesome awesome but I know people out
there are tight on money in that $49 it
just might be the squeeze above 200 they
people go oh I don't want and plus like
I said this card's geared for 1080p it's
not geared for 2560 by 1440 so it's no
real surprise that this card is not
totally kicking ass in those resolutions
hence why we left them out of this
review we test them we were like ooh
okay yeah that's uh not doing good there
so four gigabytes of memory might be
good for multi monitors you might be
able to turn some stuff up and get a lot
but I don't know that extra vram to me
just isn't making this card the sweet
spot for most people at 1080p I feel you
get a two gigabyte card overclock the
 out of it put two of them in SLI
mode if you want and get even more
substantial power and you're still going
to save money so you bought two of these
cards you'd actually have almost enough
money saved you know to buy the extra
card so I'm Elric thanks for watching
Tech tomorrow peace out I love you folks
thanks for watching the channel um I
don't know if you guys are sub you're
not hey I wouldn't mind if you were sub
because and you seem in your inbox every
day and I hope you guys like this video
peace out
and be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
