to another edition of tech of tomorrow
I'm Miller your host but today I'm here
with a very special guest this is Liam
we're the product managers over gigabyte
and he's going to show us something
really really cool now if you guys have
followed the channel you guys have all
seen we've done already some reviews on
the gigabyte bricks Pro but now we have
something totally different this is the
gigabytes probe basically projector so
let's let Leon talk about this product
and tell you what it's really all about
so what's up with this thing all right
well I do have a Brix projector that we
brought here for you guys today and just
let you guys see it's a gigabyte Brix
projector this isn't actually our pro
model so to actually differentiate this
is running an i3 where the Brix Pro has
like an i5 or an i7
okay the big difference that you guys
want to take note of is on this one you
actually have a projector lens like you
see in the graphic here this is actually
a completed model so we're gonna do a
quick unboxing for you guys so let you
guys see what you get when you get one
of these models out of one of your
retailers all right so let's go let's
take this thing's let's pop little cap
there sure why not let's take a little
tap off over here so we see we get the
little cap right here on the front I'll
have the camerman zoom in is here's all
the nomenclature of the actual thing if
you're looking forward to purchase this
will be down in the description below
but just in case any of you people are
looking for it there it is right there
so let's get back to further unboxing
lands now taking the little product out
of the box and you guys can see it's all
completely ratty up has a little nice
you know clear wrap on it it's the first
layer there's more layers it's like an
onion yeah holders are like onions let's
bring everything out so you guys say
Stanga no no they have layers know they
have layers so you get a screwdriver
here for this sorry this is actually the
rubber seal for the front for your spit
if and also your 3.5 you get a Quick
Start Guide a manual you get the driver
discs I know a lot of you guys recognize
that you know with such a small
form-factor we don't have a disk drive
so you might need to use another
computer to actually transfer the
drivers it's just for just put it all in
what I did with mine I took all the
drivers off the CD and I just
them over to a USB stick and I just used
the USB stick in fact for me personally
that's why I do it the entire thing I
put my OS and everything on a large
format little flash disk and then I did
everything off of that and it works
pretty good and it's pretty simple too
so the dis is ya right and that's what
most users would do the dis is mainly
for convenience so you don't have to
waste all that time downloading off the
website and you can do it right right
after you open the product and install
everything are you sure about that
because like I could use this as a
weapon against the frickin evil camera
man you guys you guys want to see that I
know you do maybe shaking his head no
like I better not I think he drank a
little bit much lights on you might get
violent on me so I'm gonna skip throwing
the disc at the Cameron today will just
not do it and say that we did huh how do
you like that
so look so basically everything here all
you get all your cables right there and
the box is now empty we have and we're
selling the empty box for the low price
of $19.99 that's right you can get this
square pick up by box for the low price
of $19.99 send your money now no I'm
just kidding or purchase or free given
price right with every purchase of the
gigabyte bricks projector you get a free
box think of the value on that folks you
guys aren't just you but look
here's everything that's gone out here
the unit is very very very small I mean
if the footprint on it is almost
non-existent the only thing I've seen
smaller is the Apple TV and it's just
barely larger than that so you get a
full scale computer I three version all
inside of this now a lot of people asked
before is it actually a full computer or
is it a projector it's actually both
it's actually three three thumbs for uh
so we're gonna break this down right now
first thing you get the Brix projector
of course you get the driver disk you
have your power cables we've included a
tripod stand tripod stand down for you
whoo nifty it even screws in folks we
also have a mini HDMI to HDMI now this
is where this unit comes in handy
because what you can see when we go
through the back aisle right now you can
see we have our power we have our HDMI
we have a display port we have Ethernet
and we have two USB 3.0 now this on the
bottom part of the unit is all for the
computer portion
so um you can use this as a regular
computer you can connect it to a monitor
a TV a home theater PC that's what this
whole bottom section is for and I want
to mention some real quick folks and a
lot of people think that you actually do
have to have a total projection screen
for this you don't actually have a
projection screen will make it better
but if you just have a blank wall on
your house anywhere that's a white wall
you can hook this thing up and slap it
right under the white wall when we're
done with this we'll actually show you a
quick demo just on this little thing we
use to do the white balancing on our
videos and it actually shows up quite
well on that right and we're in a
lighted room so we're gonna use the same
settings we are not gonna turn anything
down we're just gonna show you with the
system on so moving forward you can see
right here actually if you zoom in
there's actually a little port right
here that's an HDMI IN so if you have a
laptop if you have another computer that
actually has an HDMI output you can
actually transfer that output over to
the projector okay so let's make this
clear for you guys what are you saying
is you have a laptop you can use the VGA
out on that put it HDMI on what makes
you my same thing your VGA HDMI excuse
your video basic connection you can take
that connect it into here and take that
information into this little box so that
means you're not even stuck using it you
can take something and put it in tandem
and just keep going right so in that
sense you see we have a computer on its
own you can use the projector on its own
or you could use it together as a
computer projector all-in-one alright
let's get it down the table it can also
be used for this folks
let's camera can you zoom down here so
say you're filming a scary be horror
movie it's the gigabyte bricks projector
it's coming to get you wait till your
leader alright just kidding but anyways
we'll move on all right I just got a
like to have fun with here so what's
it's on the side here so is our focus
button right for focusing the screen
that's a focus ring so basically
depending on your distance from your
wall or your projector screen you can
actually focus in on focus your image so
it's not as blurry or it's not it's it
can get sharper yeah it's pretty much
just like those clocks that you buy that
extends the image out you just change it
until it actually fits the screen
practically on the front we also add two
USB 3.0 so if you got a high-speed USB
you want to use that to transfer
everything out you can do that works
pretty quickly one thing I think the
thing about these things that's really
great though is that say that you're
somebody who does
a lot of businesses and he has an actual
talking about this is what I thought
about a lot of businesses you walk into
and they right up the bat they have a
projector sitting down the table and
they want to show you all of their stuff
you know the little pie charts and all
that stuff all on their projector well
that projector many times about sixteen
to eighteen hundred dollars for a pretty
decent one
this little units gonna be way less than
that and you can pretty much achieve the
same exact thing right and we actually
got a lot of feedback for that for
business users people you know they take
it out to meetings and then they go back
to the hotel room they can watch Netflix
they can do whatever they want with it
for teachers for when they're actually
teaching if you have like a tablet you
can actually connect it to a tablet and
you could instead of using the
old-school projector or films you
actually can do it on the spot so that's
really good for it
we also have included on it a built in
audio so it actually has speakers in
this so if you don't want to be carrying
around speakers that's something else
that is actually in the system now as a
stereo speaker or just a small little
little one is bigger Dolby speaker but
at least you get one speaker so that we
can at least monitor what you're doing
if you want better sound that which
obviously some people are going to want
to do but if you're just watching slides
in a room it's not gonna really matter
but I've heard it taste good with salsa
no no I don't think so I thought I'd try
maybe cheese alright but well it's
pretty much in focus we're gonna
actually give you guys a demo and show
you guys how this thing actually works
cuz a really cool little puck I know
people out there saying well it's kind
of a crazy confusing product but there
is actually a market for this me
personally I feel this market is more
like he was talking about in the
business sector cuz if I was a business
person and I was coming to your office
and I had all my slides and all my stuff
together and I want to show you
something this would be the perfect
little traveling companion it's small
can throw my backpack come right into
your office I can laugh at your
equipment and just break out my little
tiny gigabytes projector and away I go
that's good but we also get people who
want actually want to use it for home
theaters as well so home theater systems
people who want to do movie nights at
friend's house that's also a good
solution now also one question to say
what's the resolution it's actually WVGA
so it's eight six eight five four eighty
okay so it's still it's a decent
resolution there's you're not getting as
much real estate as you usually would
with the 1080p or 1925
but it's good for those movies when you
fullscreen it so when you step back you
can hit about 70 inches on it on a blank
wall wow that's a pretty big obviously
like he's saying though you know
resolutions other projections that have
the high resolutions are also a lot a
lot more money like these projectors
I've seen them into the five thousand
dollar range for a really good one this
one's kind of made as kind of an
introductory level to that market it's
not gonna compete with the super duper
high end ones but the people don't have
the money for that are gonna be like wow
I just made a grand of savings buying
this little gigabytes projector that's
right
all right well now let's go ahead and
let's actually show you guys how this
little bad boy works alright folks so
check it I know this isn't like the
absolute greatest m1 in the world
because I don't have like any movies the
system doesn't have an OS or anything on
it but one is still I'll show you guys
how the projector works so you guys can
see we have the gigabyte logo up on our
little white balance screen like we said
before you can adjust like this you guys
can see it goes out of focus and then I
can totally adjust it until it comes
into focus core blurs completely out of
focus depending where you're going now
if we had a bigger better screen we can
make this larger like you said earlier
Leon said this will go up to 70 inches
which is huge that's basically about the
biggest at most TVs you can go by so you
can add that 70 inch sub paradise right
on your wall now the resolution may not
be the most highest greatest high
resolution in the world but you'll still
be able to watch it and enjoy that at 70
inches alright and just want to make
note we are in a lit room we haven't
changed anything so far all we did is we
just turned it on for you guys just to
give you guys a look at how big the
screen is how bright it is and we're
about just to two-and-a-half feet three
feet away from the screen right now yeah
I mean that's really amazing because
actually you know to film these videos
for you folks we actually have to have
the room very very well lit so you can
say this room is lit enough to film a
video on and still you can see the
bright as the projector is still
ass-kickin so that's pretty good that
means even in a totally well-lit room
you can hook up the brick's projector
put it on your wall and boom away you go
with no BS alright folks so there you
guys have it the gigabytes Brix
projector now like we said this thing is
really small really efficient has a
really great price on it
well from the damages can see it works
very simply and for those people out
there who want to like change it up use
walls use all those things you have many
many options
ain't that right yeah so we have lots of
more stuff coming this year from
gigabyte gigabyte has a lot of new
products coming out this year we'll try
to cover as many as possible in fact
we've just got a brand new a little mini
board from this guy that we're gonna be
bringing you guys a little steam box
we'll be paying attention to challenges
we got lots more from gigabyte coming up
for you this year Leon thank you very
much for coming by we appreciate having
you on the show and we'll see you guys
back here on teka tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
