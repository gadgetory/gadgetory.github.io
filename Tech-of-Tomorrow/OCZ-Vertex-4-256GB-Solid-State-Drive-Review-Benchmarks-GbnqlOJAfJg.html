host and today we're going to do
something cool we're going to show you
basically the content not a formal
unboxing with the content of the new
vertex 4 from ocz featuring their own in
the links controller this is the 256
gigabyte model it's all based off the
news say 23 so six gigabit per second
transfer rates we're going to hook the
thing up up to our test system but
before we do that here will show you
everything that comes in the box you can
see you get obviously the box you get
the bracket Bray you get the screws you
get the drive itself a little sticker
and the warranty thing so that's
everything that comes in the box folks
now we're going to hook it up to our
test station that is behind me this is
based off of the z77 chipset I've got
the a zhuzh this is their rampage for
extreme motherboard I've got the i7 3770
that's the CPU i'm using the 612 cooler
that's the people over at coolermaster
I've also got 32 gigabytes of the new
crucial ballistix extreme memory you
guys can see all that stuff back there
and now I'm going to hook it up to the
controller that's onboard this is the as
media controller it's say 23 just like
the drive so now let's hook it up and
let's do a doe and a SSD and see how
fast this Drive really is against the
competition let's go all right folks on
the very first thing you're going to
want to do is Sue's yoke of the drive
and go in the winners environment is
you're going to want to make sure the
drive is detecting she want to go into
your system and security create and
format hard drive partitions so you do
it it's going to come up it's going to
ask you to make it a master boot record
then you'll see up here i have two
hundred and thirty eight gigabytes
unallocated i'm going to make this a new
simple volume I'll click Next since it's
going to be a test drive I'm going to
call it drive x
I'm going to format the drive and after
the drive is formatting I'll be ready to
go into doing my testing you can see it
comes up now here new volume X and
there's nothing inside of here as if now
it's a completely empty partition and
drive so I'm going to click out of all
these i'm going to go ahead and start up
at oh alright folks so here we have a
dell this is one of the main thing that
people use to test the rest is these
these days I'm going to go in here and
i'm going to choose drive x and then
we'll go ahead and start beginning test
in the drive and let's see how it fares
the test runs through a variation of
iterations that test different things in
the drive to give you a final result but
at the end we get a final read and write
score
so all right man you guys can see this
thing is a very very fast drive both
read and write scores are off the hook
look at the read score 565 38 in
credible score right is over 500 as well
513 752 unbelievable really really nice
scores next up let's jump into a SSD and
let's see how it is all right folks next
up a SSD benchmark let's see how the
drive performs we're going to go to the
ocz vertex 4G guys can see here and
let's let the test begin we're going to
have sequential 4k 4k 64 and then access
times and then we're gonna have a final
score here at the bottom so let's go
wow you guys can see the score
unbelievable next up we're going to show
you some comparison charts so you can
see how this drive fared against the
competition
hi folks oh there you guys can see the
new ocz vertex 4 is 1 akele a fast drive
it's actually one of the fastest drives
that we've tested in house yet smoking
most of the competition across the board
it's a very very fast drive now a lot of
people out there have problems with ocz
they say they out of failure rates I've
only had some failure rates with
onedrive the octane every other drive
ahead from OCC is work just fine so
maybe experience is very but you guys
got to get to a break because out there
there's always going to be a failure
rate from somebody somewhere do you guys
want to know how fast it was that's what
we brought you guys to the table so
there you have it you guys see it the
ocz vertex 4 thanks for watching teka
tomorrow we'll see you back here well
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
