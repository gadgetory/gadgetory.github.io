big guy you weigh between like 360 and
440 pounds you're a pretty hefty fella
I'm pretty hefty fella myself but
today's video is about a brand new chair
from the people over at vertigo it's
their plus series it's the pl 6000 and
they're really the biggest thing about
this chair beyond its comfort is that it
can take a massive sized warrior up to
440 pounds can see his ass inside this
chair without worrying about it breaking
or anything else and be in total comfort
now if you're a big guy out there you
really do know how important it is to
get a chair that won't break you sit on
those dang things they crack they break
these they just you know what I mean I'm
a pretty big guy like I said I've
damaged some chairs gee our cameraman
he's a pretty big guy too he said this
chair was really comfortable you know so
obviously that's what I'm gonna say is
the major factor if you're a big guy and
you want a comfortable chair that you
can sit on that's not going to break the
PL 6000 is probably for you now the
comfort level in this particular chair
is very very nice my ass feels other
comfort I was gonna make like a joke
like it's not a pain in my ass it's like
a cushion on my ass but it is this
chairs really comfortable there's tons
of adjustments all over just like every
other choice you have for your arms up
and down you can scroll back you can
even lay completely back in this and go
to sleep it's very very comfortable you
can even put a stool out in front if you
wanted to and just totally lay back like
a bed and crash in your chair and you
wouldn't have to worry about it now the
thing that's really special about
today's chair though that's right
silence their little silence to do
today's chair was actually made for me
that's right
so who's a spoiled bitch with a new
chair this guy that's right and they
made it just for me so this one has all
of the particular tomorrow logos on it
it's got teka tomorrow stitch in the
front on the back it's got our logo so
no matter what I mean we got a chair so
we're fish
that's it you know I'm the first member
on the the book chair of the board board
chair chair you guys know that I mean
chairman of the board there we go haha
so I'm the chairman of the board I got
my first chair right here behind me but
honestly folks you guys should check
this company out they have a racing
series of chairs that these things are
crazy these particular chairs come to
market about $400 but the thing about
this cool is that like I said first of
all if you're a really big guy they're
great for you but you can have these
chairs custom-made and if you're a team
or something out there you can contact
the people over there and they will make
a chair for you like just for your logo
so if you have your logo whatever you're
like like team dragon slayers I mean you
can have all that stuff you know on your
chair being your chair like so real
quick let me move me in the pup here
because he looks like he's a he's
getting a little impatient he's like
come on man quit talking and get on with
it but then again he wouldn't stand the
video it's kept jumping in my lap
jumping in my lap so he wants to be a
star but he wants to do short
non-talking we're all right there you go
so check it out I'm gonna stand it now
right here Berta gear the text of
tomorrow logo all nice and beautiful on
the chair and there are a couple of
different things that come with the
chair I'm gonna it comes with this nice
little headrest as well so you get this
headrest and it's very comfortable but I
want to be able to show off you know all
this stuff so I didn't put it on there
but if you want to stick it on there you
just slap it on there and it's good to
go another nice thing lumbar support not
only do you get this cushion which kind
of pushes you a little bit you know
further chair um if you're a really big
guy you're probably gonna want to just
sit all the way back but the lumbar can
actually be adjusted on the side of the
chair so that's pretty cool so not only
do you get lumbar support you get lumbar
support that that's you can you adjust
as far as the materials high grain all
the way across the board you got leather
you've got nice aluminum parts it's
completely well built I mean it has to
be to give it for a big guy you know
you've got to be able to be able to have
strong parts sorry I don't write scripts
I just make videos next year we'll
probably changed it up a bit but we've
been trying to freestyle it for you
so let me spin around the back real
quick once again you get the ticket
amaro logo their logo as well
dual branding oh yeah there you go and
we just show you guys something makes
cruise back around here just interesting
video ever we've ever done something
like this so check it ah so you can spin
around too until you go crazy but
pressure spin around
but anyways beyond the craziness
everything about this chair is
high-quality it's got really big nice
thick wheels you don't have to worry
about those things breaking off you know
that happens quite a bit the base on
this model has been made so it can
really take like I said a large person
it's extended out so you not to worry
about like rolling the chair and flying
forward or trying to go backwards and
falling over all those things are really
nice about this chair as well so if you
want a chair like this you guys can
check them out like usual we'll have a
link down below I wrote an even know
really how to make a video on a chair
because well we sit our butts in chairs
every single solitary day but I guess
when you want to look at something
that's called like a gaming chair being
a gaming chair the things about a gaming
chair are really a lot of adjustments
the comfort level about it cuz I mean
let's face beer game you're gonna be in
your chair for hours on end the lumbar
support I have to say for me I really
like it when Anthony sits in the chair
he always seems to take it out doesn't
like it but I prefer it quite a bit so
that's it folks this is a Christmas
present to me from the people over there
Shan Henry love you guys thank you guys

months but hey it was worth it Christmas
