once again now this is the first time
I've ever done this in the history of
the channel drag the team back over here
on a Sunday because I'm so upset about
seeing the comments in a video right off
the bat I want to say thank you very
much the people who actually got the
concept of this but for the people out
there who have totally miss
conceptualized this I really want to
explain what we're doing here what we're
trying to do is interact with you people
this contest was never about who has the
best triple monitor setup it wasn't
about who had the best computer I was
trying to be a part of your life invites
you into our lives by interacting with
you showing us systems is no big deal
you could have a laptop a cheap computer
all I wanted to really do with you guys
to see where you guys work at and see
what kind of personality you have you
guys all act like this contest is about
he who has the most money I didn't put
that up there at all and that was not my
intention and for some reason something
that I did misconstrue that I apologize
but I really wanted this to get to know
you people better this has nothing to do
with who has the best system at all zero
I need you guys to be very clear on this
nothing to do with it you could have a
laptop you can have a console I don't
even care what you have I'm looking to
see what kind of people have personality
you could have cool little thermaltake
guys in your desk you could have some
cool pictures it does not take money at
all to have a cool workspace and for the
people who have left all the nasty
comments and stuff you guys have really
hurt my feelings to the point where I
wanted to make this video some people
got it but there have been so many
negative comments that I blew my cool
for you few out there who i know i've
sent you a couple of nasty messages i
apologize but you guys have definitely
prickled me too much with these comments
i meant for this to be a lot of fun with
my users i wanted to get to know you
guys and I wanted to give you guys some
cool stuff people have said the prize of
crap the contest is crap like we don't
have to do these things whatsoever I
didn't even have to release a video on
Saturday I could have took buddy to the
damn Park spent my day enjoying with my
family but no I spent my day arguing
with my crew trying to bring you guys
something cool and
right only to get a lot of people being
very very negative i love my audience I
love my core fans and I did this in an
effort to get to know you better because
you guys know me I love you all for
those whites in the nest meshes once
again I apologize but hey I met this to
be a positive thing and so many people
have turned this into a negative event
that has broken my heart
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
