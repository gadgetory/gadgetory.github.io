welcome back to tech tomorrow I'm mark
your host and today we've got something
pretty cool to look at from the people
over at P and Y this is their accelerate
enthusiast Edition GTX 770 video card
now this thing features their own unique
new dual fan cooling and it's supposed
to be something totally different than a
reference base card now we looked at a
couple 770's from these guys a little
while back I thought those were the ones
that had this cooling but those actually
weren't those were just like a triple
fan kind of a little bit different but
this actually features really extremely
good cooling on it one thing I got to
say to my friends over P&amp;amp;Y though J hey
you guys need to name your cooling
everybody else has a name wind force you
know they have their cooling stuff
direct see you you know I'm saying Twin
Frozr P&amp;amp;Y you guys got to get yourself a
name now with that said let's jump in
and let's actually check out what comes
inside the box alright folks so here we
have it the PNY accelerate enthusiast
edition graphics card like we said it's
the geforce gtx 770 flavor features
they're all new cooling just gonna flip
it on the side real quick 2 gigabytes
comes overclocked out of the box not too
much more to see on the box to show you
guys the back it just shows you the
basic stuff it's an nvidia card and all
that stuff and they just reiterate they
have their key features i'll bring it to
the camera just so we can just go down
here i'm not gonna speculate too much on
this you guys pretty much know all
what's on here the big things about this
card are the cooling and let's jump in
and let's take a look at that so I'm
gonna take the BOP here just pull it out
of the box here they got little end caps
here go ahead and figure out this little
end cap opening pop it there usually
these guys have all the accessories in
the backside of the box so I'm gonna go
ahead and pull it out and hopefully all
the accessories don't go flying anywhere
and they didn't so we're good to go
so we've got dual six pin to eight pin
converter some polls might need that if
their power supply doesn't have the
appropriate connections we also have
their little what it says right here
accessory kit so that right there on an
accessory kit
has information on how to install it I
think most of my people out there know
what to do this is the DVI to VGA big
and China and Asia not really use much
here in America at all put that off to
the side here we have the installation
disc this is going to contain the
drivers and any other necessary stuff
but actually most people are going to go
to the Nvidia site and I actually would
recommend that you go there and download
the latest drivers so you get the best
performance so let's take that out of
the way take a look at the card go ahead
and just get it out of the little
plastic packaging here and pull it
alright let's leave in the package real
quick and just take a look at the back
side here you guys can see we have two
sli fingers in the top you can do triple
SLI configurations with this card only
EVGA Carter the special driver can do
Quad SLI and those are on the 780 cards
down here we see the PCI 3.0 insertion
you guys can see they use a black PCB
and here is the nomenclature of the card
now let's go ahead and just continue
looking at the card now like I said this
card has superior cooling it's a little
bit difficult to see but as you look
here on the side of the card you can see
all of the copper heat pipe
so there's aluminum heat fans they've
also had the copper heat pipes and
that's gonna help dissipate all the heat
away from the card and then get blown by
these two fans and I got to be honest to
you guys this card really has that new
part smell I mean it really does you can
smell even like a couple feet away it
smells really new you guys know what I'm
talking about out there new has a smell
and this has that smell underneath you
guys can see the aluminum heat fins
they're all underneath there flip it
around show you guys the backside here's
some more of the aluminum heat fan here
the dog is liking that as I'm clicking
he's going to scratch look it's matching
where am i doing that hmm I don't know
so here's the top of the card flip it
around you can still see some more of
the cooling inside of there we have one
six pin and one eight pin power
connector located right there all right
now let's take a look at the rear i/o
rear i/o offers nothing different than
any other Nvidia card out there they're
pretty much all exactly the same single
DVI I sing with the
PID single standard HDMI and standard
DisplayPort all located on the rear i/o
you guys can see it's a two slot design
it's gonna take up two slots in your
system and they say the PNY sticker
right there so you know what's up so
that's it folks that's everything that
comes in the box you guys can see this
card's really pretty cool-looking if
you're using a couple of the msi boards
that had that yellow and black color
scheme this card is actually gonna work
very well with that if you want to build
something like a metro type theme it's
gonna work like that as well the reason
I say this is I've noticed that most
people out there doing builds nowadays
seem to choose some kind of a theme has
to do with a color or a video or
something people choose a theme so
yellow and black you know you've got a
few things to work with bumblebee from
Transformers you know you've got a
school bus or you got yourself the new
Metro last light which is probably what
we're gonna be building a system on so
hope you guys like that this is the PNY
accelerate enthusiast edition of the gtx
770 thanks for watching tikka tomorrow
