hate them Google is pretty much involved
with everything that US people in the
media are doing I mean just think about
the invader their whole search engine
all the stuff they've been doing all the
ads obviously YouTube where you guys are
viewing me right now Google has their
hand everywhere and now they've just
come up with what they feel is the
biggest news that's ever hit their
company now these guys have a computer
that's right a quantum computer even
that's called the d-wave and right now
it has 512 qubits qubits it's right kind
of weird thing we'll touch on that a
little bit more down the line now their
computer the d-wave is getting an
upgrade baby is going up to eight
thousand cubits that's right a thousand
cubits and they say the machine is
actually so powerful that they don't
even really know what it's capable of
and the really cool thing about it is is
that not only does this thing double up
on its power it actually doesn't take
much less power to run it here I mean
you get much more strength but not
energy taken to bring this so that it
actually in itself is just really really
killer news and these guys have been
working with NASA NASA excuse me they've
been working with you surra and at their
Mountain View location they have this
giant d-wave computer now this d-wave
computer is actually made in canada so
it's a Canadian thing Hey and they
promised that for the next seven years
they're going to be continuously
upgrading the systems you can expect for
the next seven years that this stuff is
going to keep turning over and over and
we're going to see more developments but
picture this if quantum computing can
become the real thing of the future
imagine how powerful computers can be if
it doesn't take more energy to run them
especially think about you have a cell
phone if you could actually get a
quantum computer inside of a cell phone
somehow or some way and you could double
its power without a double up the
battery or how big it is think about how
amazing that really is so the prospects
are really huge and like I said earlier
Google considers this to be the biggest
thing in their history the d-wave is the
thing to be surfing
so what is the Cuban or a Zico the cubit
what is this thing on a normal computer
a transistor holds a single bit of
information mean that you when you have
you on or the off like in a normal
computer that's totally gone with
quantum computing they actually use the
on the off together at the very same
time bringing a whole new level of
computing to the market and you guys
have all seen the television program
probably you know you mind on my ear but
quantum leap or they use quantum
computing to send this guy all over the
galaxy because computers are so powerful
the qubit with its ability to take both
the 0 and the 1 at the same time and
turn that into actually four streams of
information makes the quantum design and
the more qubits that you add the more
the system gets powerful and these
people have claimed from the Canadian
company d-wave that no matter how much
more stuff they make this powerful the
energy requirement is not going to
increase much at all so I thought we
think that overall even though we're
talking about this quantum computer the
cool things the big thing I think is the
energy draw because portable stuff and
all that and the energy draw you know
that's a big thing you talk about you
get a cell phone you're like oh man my
cell phone battery that's the big thing
you talk about if they can somehow take
these quantum computers narrow them down
make them smaller reduce the power
requirements the whole entire elemental
world of computers will be changed now
along with all the good news there are
some people out there like the scientist
over at USC who say this isn't really
quite quantum computing but what they
are saying that it is showing quantum
annealing which is somewhat like that so
I don't know if you know the d-wave
machine is really the true like quantum
computing that everybody's talking about
but it's definitely pushing things in
that right direction I mean let's just
think about it even if you're getting on
the same page and working towards
something that means you're getting
close so are they really exaggerating
calling it a quantum machine oh maybe
not maybe so but either way it's still
pushing technology in a new direction
which is good for us
right I want to see you guys's comments
down below by the way I got the story
over the cold wires if you guys want to
check out the full story you guys can
see that down the link thank you guys
for the idea but I saw this and I
thought wow this is amazing stuff so
there you guys have it man
the brand new upgraded D wave goes from
512 qubits to a thousand cubits bringing
massive power to Google's d-wave machine
and like I said folks they said that the
scientists were kind of a little bit
disappointed because I think they were
really expecting it to like you know do
magical things right out the door
but even what it is right now its
potential is pretty much unlimited so
let me hear what you guys got to say I
think quantum computing is really cool
what do you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
