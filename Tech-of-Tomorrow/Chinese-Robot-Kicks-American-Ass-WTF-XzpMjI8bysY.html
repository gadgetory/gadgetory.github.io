than a robot I mean come on
robots are definitely the future they're
the way things are going in one way or
another they're gonna be a part of our
life now we've seen crazy-ass robots and
the x-men via Ultron we've seen happier
robots we've seen it on with the little
boy robot we've seen robots everywhere
and they're becoming more and more
relevant day by day now previously the
people over at Cornell these guys had
the longest-running robot in history
made Guinness and everything else it was
like 65 miles in 30 hours but check this
the Chinese own by the way the name of
that robot was the Ranger
so the Ranger though is now getting its
Ranger ass kicked right down the line by
Yip the Chinese Americans getting their
ass kicked by the Chinese in a robot
walk this Punk am i right son not known
for innovation whoo no more for you no
imitation now these guys are actually
seriously kicking ass because they have
this new robot called the Xin Jie
number one now this thing has gone the
farthest that any four-legged robot has
ever gone before this thing's actually
gone 83 miles in 54 hours that's 340
thousand steps or 134 kilometers which
is trust me a long long way and the
Singhji number one did this on 0.8
kilowatts of power now they did this
between October 24th and October 27th
now I don't know what you guys think but
robots are really cool now this thing's
gone a long way for transportation and
stuff like that this could be a really
cool thing think about it you could have
a robot come to your door which kind of
actually kind of leads into the next
story tip for today like picture instead
of the Amazon drone coming to your house
picture this you guys could have the
Amazon robots hi I'm the Amazon robot
I'm here to deliver your package robots
you say Elric what about balloons in the
sky that's right folks Google is now
doing something that sounds entirely
crazy and they're doing this with the
Indian government this is Project loon
which sounds crazy right ah Project loon
yeah I guess you guys get it so check
this out the whole idea is to place
balloons in the sky
and run your internet through these
balloons so check it out your internet
would be streaming snooze from balloon
that might be right down the street from
your house now they're gonna test this
out in California and New Zealand so you
folks who live in California you guys
are gonna check this out and New
Zealanders hey you guys are going to too
so I don't know this sounds kind of
crazy but it could be something really
cool are we've already talked about like
the drone thing possible delivery robot
delivery but what about you know kind of
balloon delivery I mean if you already
get your internet stream and all this
stuff through these balloons isn't there
somehow we could have some kind of
balloon little delivery system you know
the balloon floats up comes down they
migrated I guess it's still a drone but
it's a balloon neurone so check that out
that's pretty crazy right so putting
balloons in the sky to stream your
internet Google's really like stretching
new bounds once again is totally tech of
tomorrow by the way I want to ask you
guys a question out there I'd love your
feedback down below a lot of times I've
been doing PC stories and stuff like
that I know builds and stuff for what
you guys like and giveaways but would
you guys like pretty much like daily the
latest actual tech news to fit more than
name tech of tomorrow because I'm
actually thinking about kind of like
changing the format a little bit having
like once a week a really cool PC like
total thing that's dedicated to that but
the rest of the time just actually
bringing you guys the latest stories
which would truly be tech of tomorrow
let me hear your comments down below now
the last story is all day long people
are on their cell phones but how much
time do you really think that you spend
on your cell phone I'll give you guys
look second just to sit there and think
about it but your answers down below
believe it or not actually a third of
your life is spent on that damn cell
phone so you talk about a leash people
say I want to be free with that cell
phone all honesty we're never free we're
connected we're hooked up now this is
kind of crazy I was watching this
episode of sliders so many buddy out
there I guess it shows my age but you
guys ever seen sliders there justice
owed where they have these people called
on liners and off liners we're basically
there's one group people that are all
online they use the internet they're all
teched-out and geeked out they even go
outside and the other people who aren't
on the Internet whatsoever they're all
poorly like Liban checks which is kind
of a crazy crazy thing but more and more
we're actually getting to that point
Lyonne technology everything about
today's video is about technology robots
obviously what do you think the first
thing that robots are going to be used
for obviously they're going to be used
for labor that's just how it is in the
past
giant civilizations they use slaves we
all know that slavery is up and
uncool we've seen it in history so it's
not a good way to repeat bad history
but robots if they don't have an
intelligence and they're just electronic
does it truly matter if you use them and
I know a lot people I say oh I'm going
to lose my job and all this stuff but
maybe wouldn't maybe you'd be a
technician who repaired that robot or
something else I'm sure that we can work
it all out because think about it there
are a lot of people that are crippled as
well and robotics could help us well you
guys know I don't have any feet like you
can probably see me like shaking back
and forth I remember first thesis on or
anything but it would help me a lot it
would be totally cool to have robotics
to help people so I'm totally down with
robotics as long as it's not a robot
that's thinking that can make decisions
because you don't want to rule making
decision because let's just face it
folks we're screwed and you need your
robot with common sense is going to look
at us and go what the is wrong with
these people we should all get along
love each other and a let technology
intermingle with us so I'm mark you guys
been watching Tekken tomorrow you guys
want more information on these stories I
will have links down below to them so
peace out and we'll see you guys back
here on teka tomorrow for more tech news</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
