homes are the way of the future but with
the August smart walk and August connect
the future is yours today hey I'm Eric
and welcome to tech go tomorrow today
we're gonna be checking out something
really cool from the people over at
bogus now this is the August smart walk
and August connect with technology
growing and growing a smart home is
naturally the next step in the evolution
and with the August smart lock you can
have that technology today because the
August smart lock offers something I've
never seen before in any other product
the August smart lock upgrades the
interior portion of your existing
deadbolt and you have totally key free
access to your home via iPhone or
Android and it's really easy and simple
to set up inside the box you get all the
parts necessary to set the door in your
house you get an adjustable bracket a
manual and the actual smart lock itself
it's very very easy and simple to
install it also comes with its own
double-a batteries so you don't have to
worry about going out and buying them so
that's a pretty cool thing I think Mike
total installation time was about 10
minutes and most of that time really was
just trying to get the other lock off
and figuring out the bracket beyond that
though it's very easy to get it set up
all you do is download the app install
it follow the instructions and you're up
and going you guys can see that I set
mine up as Elric's home and after
installation it sent me a password to my
email and I was up and going
automatically being able to unlock my
door through my phone with it you can
add friends lists invite friends you can
actually give your friends notes and
send them messages it's really cool
stuff there's also another addition that
you can get to this and this is the
August Connect this allows you to unlock
your door remotely from anywhere
you just plug it in any wall socket
within 15 feet of your smart lock and
you can access this from anywhere in the
world through the internet this is
actually incredible now these features
for me are really really awesome
I've got buddy the dog here and say that
I'm gone or I have to go somewhere and I
can't get home I need my dog to be taken
care of and it's an emergency so I can
automatically get like some of my
neighbors or a relative or anybody I can
get to come to my house and be able to
get into my house via their phone and
without a key in the old days you'd have
to like leave a key outside of your
house for any of your relatives or
anything else and they'd come over and
get it and come into your house or if
you lost you it you'd be like Oh where's
my lost key with this you're not to
worry about that anymore
you really don't you can have your key
and still access the door with your key
you don't have to worry about that so if
you want to deal that way as an
emergency you still have that option but
you really never need to leave a key
outside your house ever again so I know
some people out there doing well hey how
does this thing connect well it actually
uses wireless Bluetooth connectivity so
it doesn't use your phone service or
anything like that at all and the
auguste connect it actually uses the
Internet now let's just see in your
house so either way you're covered now a
few things I just want to go over before
I get out of here now the cool things
about this though are that you can add
family or friends so if you lock
yourself out of your house unlike the
old days if you don't have a key don't
have to go break a window call somebody
crazy
you just have when your friends come
over and when soon as they walk up to
your door they can access it now check
this out every lock is another cool
feature where after a predetermined set
of time it will automatically lock your
door so think about that you're like a
king you come strolling up to your house
doors automatically open for you when
you leave no I got to worry about did I
lock my door did I lock my door there's
my door and lock or poor buddy to get
stolen that no because it will
automatically do it for you and having
these features is really cool and it's
really the first step in turning your
home into hey a smart home it's great
technology I think it's very very
interesting prices are right easy to set
up I think with all these features you
guys should seriously check this out for
yourself like usual all the information
this will be down boat like button hope
you guys like this video and me and
buddy we'll see you guys later here on
tech Oh tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
