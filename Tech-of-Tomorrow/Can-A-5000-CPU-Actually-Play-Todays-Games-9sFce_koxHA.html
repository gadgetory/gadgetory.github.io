here once again on the channel now for
you fans who've been following us you
guys know that we've been doing a lot of
testing with the 1,600 X and with the
brand-new i-580 600k now we've brought
you guys a lot of different scores using
a 1080 and also using the Vegas 64 but
today's video is a little bit different
now today we're gonna show you a video
using an h1 100m motherboard and a G
4400 CPU now this is a 50 dollar CPU and
a 50 dollar
motherboard and we're gonna actually
show you guys the comparisons and see
how bad does your video card actually
get bottlenecked using this low end CPU
and also if you guys would like to see a
full on review of this system we built
it's really super duper low-end
um let me know and we'll bring it to the
table because it actually is a very very
low entry system it's only about three
hundred and eighty bucks has a low end
video card in it for the visits that
we've been building on it but if you
guys want to see that let me know now
obviously we're gonna have different
test systems like I said if you guys
have followed the channel you guys know
the other test systems that we use we
showed them many times in the past and
like usual we'll have a link down there
below but now real quick let's jump in
and let's see how bad does a $50 CPU and
a $50 motherboard actually make your GPU
suck so with that said let's check it
out
all right folks so there you have it and
you guys can see that even though a $50
CPM fee dollar motherboard will play
games it doesn't play games with
high-end video cards very well at all
but think about this you're a person out
there you don't really have a whole lot
of money to upgrade a system but you
still want to be able to play video
games and have a good video card that
you might possibly able to transition
into your newer system well this video
is probably really good for you because
you guys can see you know how it's doing
also you see with you upgrade from that
how much better results you're going to
get so at the end of the day obviously a
$50 CPU doesn't play games that great
unless you're going to be using a really
duper super duper excuse me low in video
car if you're gonna be doing that
playing and low in graphics and stuff
you'll probably just okay using a super
low in video card and that small and
system that we talked about once again
like I said if you guys want me to bring
that full system to the table just let
me know and I'll bring that system to
table as well but I got to tell you it's
not the greatest gaming machine in the
world but it is under $400 so that's a
thumbs up so there you have it folks
obviously if you've got a lower older
and CPU the higher the video cards you
get the more it's going to be restrained
and bottlenecked in the lower the video
card the better your results are going
to be so there you have it I'm milk you
guys been watching teka tomorrow we got
lots more stuff coming up all kinds of
interesting stuff come up here in the
channel so stay tuned for more tech here
on tech of tomorrow and hey like usual
like I said all the links to all the
stuff we've done previously will be down
below that like button below peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
