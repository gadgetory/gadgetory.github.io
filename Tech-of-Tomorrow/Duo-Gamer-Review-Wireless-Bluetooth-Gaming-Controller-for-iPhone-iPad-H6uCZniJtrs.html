again on TECA tomorrow we bring you all
the tech all the time now today's
product is a very interesting one for
one thing it works exclusively with game
lost games it's made for any version of
the iPad all the way down to the iPad
main which we're gonna be using today
this is the duo gamer by duo now what is
this thing well pretty much is kind of
like a stand and a wireless controller
all for your iPad and for 39 bucks it's
not that bad of a product whatsoever so
today I'm going to take the product out
of the box and actually show you guys
live gaming with it when we play a game
called asphalt 7 this is actually pretty
much a lot of fun and at first I didn't
think I was gonna like this product but
after I started playing with it this is
actually a really really cool thing so
let's take out of the box and then let's
check out some gameplay shall we alright
folks so now let's just check out the
box here you guys can see the front of
it not too much there got the Bluetooth
connectivity the name of the company the
duo and the duo gamer game control for
iPad please exclusively with Gameloft
games apps for iPad see that flip it
around to you guys back the box it's
just some stuff on there and tell you
how to connect it and everything pretty
simple stuff now if you take a look down
here where it says step 2 they show you
the different games that are available
right now including asphalt 7 modern
combat some others there you guys can
see all those long hair so now we'll go
ahead and we'll pop up we'll go and take
the product out of the box pop the cap
here not too much to this is pretty
simple go ahead and pull it out right
here as you guys can see it's the
instruction guide how to get started
Bluetooth wireless connectivity and
blank paper for you to write notes on
I'm just kidding alright
don't become to the controller show you
guys the top of it first so
four buttons just like any other
controllers your power button if you
press that on it turns blue means it's
powered on it comes with batteries so
right to the left we see the d-pad then
we have a set of analog controllers the
on and off button and then your standard
key just like any PlayStation or
anything else has out there now up here
on top on the rear side we see we have
two more buttons right here then we have
the game wop little thing right there
times where you can get your games show
you guys the back of it on the other
side of it that's pretty much the
controller now code people said they
thought that the design of it was a
little bit wack um I didn't find to be
really that wack at all I thought it
played pretty well and was pretty
ergonomic when I did it before the first
time that I ever saw this thing I
thought it was gonna be a little bit
wacky but it actually is pretty
ergonomic in your hand it feels well
it's different than all the other ones
out there that's for sure
so let's move past that here we're gonna
shoot the Box plastic crinkles there not
much do that like I said it's half stand
and half product so this is just the
stand nothing there here's the bottom of
it there's the top of it I'm gonna go
ahead and set it down
I borrowed a friend of Mines little iPad
Mini go ahead and stick that on there
turn that bad boy on and uh let's get
into some game
all right folks so there you have it
the duo gamer by duo in action playing
asphalt 7 so you guys can see no signal
loss at all between the Bluetooth
connectivity you can actually play from
about 10 feet away all the while you
ever would I don't know because you
won't be able to see it but it's still
pretty cool that you have that option I
think most people are gonna play it
probably right on a desktop right in
from them but you guys can see it's
pretty fun turns your iPad into a fully
functional gaming center they've got
shoot-'em-up games they've got racing
games like I said before they have about
six titles to this now also in the link

well and check out the pinball voting
cuz if you're into pinball you're gonna
dig this thing so with that said hope
