YouTube land it's me our hero from the
tech of tomorrow YouTube channel to
bring you guys an unboxing of a pretty
cool air cooling fan for really pretty
much any AMD or intel basic dip socket
this thing won't work on the new 2011
xiv 9 platform but beyond that this will
work on anything else what is this this
is the new arctic freezer pro 13 now
this thing features a giant fan it
features fins and a copper base and it's
geared for basically anything and here
comes my dogs running across the floor
as you guys can hear his happy feet
anyways this thing's pretty new to
market let's check out what comes inside
the box and what some of its features
are okay so here you have it folks
here's the box what's actually not
really a box actually a package a
clamshell type package arctic cooling
this is the freezer 13 pro like I said
before this will work on any ZIF socket
be it intel or AMD other than the new
LGA 2011 which is the x79 this one just
doesn't go on that in the back of my
flipping around you guys can see i'ma
try to bring it up to the camera and
closer so you guys can see it basically
this thing's supposed to run cooler and
quieter than most of the fans that are
out there says it features a new cross
flow design on the side 300 watt
compatible you can basically it's
compatible with all of those different
types of sockets this is basically with
all of them in the 2011 which again I'm
gonna bring it down here good and begin
the unboxing I think the package just
comes apart so here it comes apart look
around it maybe I won't maybe I'll need
a knife maybe I want ok folks after
sitting here and trying to do this thing
for a second with not getting a knife I
admit nope I've got to use a trusty
knife this thing is just not opening so
can you go in take a mess inside here
couple slits
but this makes it a little easier for me
now there we go okay then we'll start up
we have an instruction guide right here
you guys can hear all the neighborhood
dogs barking and brain in the backyard
today it's a wild animal kingdom outside
today here are the instruction guides
gives you a little details of how to
hook it up everything else different
ways to mount your fan do you mount your
fan okay here's the base real quick you
guys here's the base back plate here all
the mounting pins and all the different
types you can see they've got all kinds
of different things on here for all the
different types of mounting the clips
for various AMD ones these are all here
so that's that and then here is the heat
sink instead of going to start from the
bottom you can see there are a bunch of
copper heatpipes leading off of here
solid copper base mounted on some
aluminum aluminum fins all the way up
there's a fan inside of here this is the
cross-flow fan I'm going to try to get
this up to you guys can see that it's
kind of hard to see with inside of here
there's another fan so this is the cross
hope they were talking about this fan is
blowing air and this fan as well is
blowing air giving you a cross flow
design also keeping this cooler running
cooler so basically all the heat from
your CPU is going to be gathered up into
here and do these heat pipes those will
go up into here in the chambers and then
all that heat will be dissipated out by
the two fan design put them on the top
guys can see it's kind of tall there's
the back so basically all this stuff you
see right here so this has been the
Arctic vertebrate freezer pro 13
