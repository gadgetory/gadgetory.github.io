Carrick you guys know these guys they
make all kinds of applications for
hands-free stuff you guys know me I've
got one inside of my car for talking to
my phone when you get a ticket and today
with Theodore it's gonna explain a brand
new product that's great for in-home use
it's for watering and taking care of
your plants so that's the theater
explain this great new product you know
so it's a table this is a Bluetooth
smart lens and so so basically is going
to keep your plant alive so how do you
have here poor system of four sensors
and the first one here the first and so
is a light sensor Wow
tell me that
so why put it on the sole you research
seems to be okay
brings me and then up to why
have some needs like you water so here
is telling you that in two days it would
be pouring forget this is something that
we are planning to integrate also D
because there is a big demand for that
so all the rules must fall and
everything will come from these two
meters that are right here on this as
well yes and here you can see that big
one E is telling you that you have to
feed me right away otherwise I die and
the last point after one week is going
to conclude the kind of nice to me of
your plans so will be able to predict
the needs of your plans so for instance
one will you know you have to before
every three weeks or whatever I need a
watering so don't tell me that it's
going to be like by pre-production yes
exactly
okay and good very good especially when
you planning to go outside to go abroad
for one month but then you can say okay
one week have to fill my plans is to
which have to put fertilizer then in
that bunch you can call your friends
okay can you go back to my apartment and
put some more water let me eyeshadow
another question though or like
hydroponic gardens and stuff like that
they have these that can actually hook
up directly if you guys have any plans
of actually writing software that could
be on like an auto one water
program this may be the second step but
today we're not work on that it's just
basic omean legs okay all right well
thank you very much - thank you all
right guys you guys see it keep your
plants healthy go with parrot we'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
