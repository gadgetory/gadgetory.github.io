another edition of tech of tomorrow and
today I've got a special guest I have
mr. Jacob Freeman from EVGA welcome to
our Channel how you doing brother good
thanks for having me how's your brother
Gordon doing alright alright see I
haven't seen him in a while b.a.p famous
yeah it's been a while since we saw what
are your parents feel about that cuz
like he's the more famous brother than
that do you feel like you live in his
shadow or a little bit yeah you know I
don't know how to get to me alright good
good brave hearted soul here so check it
out everybody's always looking for the
ultimate power supply to power their
ultimate building you guys know we're
always building these ultimate bills
we're getting ready to do another one
including using their x99 classified
motherboards so it's gonna be a badass
bill now this thing is the Super Nova
that's right super nova 1600 watt ps2
power supply it be p2 p2 power supply
pardon me pardon and he's gonna walk us
through this but this thing will
basically it'll power up to even up to a
Quad SLI system of pretty much anything
easily easily and at 1600 you're like
pushing the limits of everything like I
even heard the doctor who is got one of
these is the alternate power supply for
the TARDIS that's right and it'll even
power nuclear sub right that's what we
build it for see so like this thing's
the Platinum Edition too by the way I
guess some other people out there have
taken a look at the Gold Edition but
this is the Platinum Edition it's the
more it's more playa down it's more but
more efficient it's like you know kiss
platinum - and please don't ding us on
the copyright there I just real quick
there so anyways we're gonna let Jacob
walk you through it unbox it and tell
you all the features about this power
spot we're gonna hand the microphone off
to him and talk about it so let's check
it out here it is those those are the
fans fans welcome Jake alright so this
is like you mentioned 1600 watt 1600
watts of power it's platinum rated
efficiency so that means it's up to 92%
efficient at about 50 percent load so
we'll go ahead and check it out
on the inside here so right on top here
this is like all our cables it's a
completely modular power supply so that
means that there is actually no cables
attached to the power supply at all semi
my joints not fully modular so here's
all the cables that you get of course
just enough cables here it's a power
that the four graphics card alright it
looks an industrial this is a crap now
hold on 8g camerman come up look at this
look at this power cable people this
isn't a power cable this is a weapon I
could beat you with this so if you leave
a bad common I'm gonna come to your
house another
biatch slap you with this cable I know
you'll sue but what the heck those
things industrial yeah it's industrial
grade I think it's like 14 gauge wire so
it's that's pretty beefy damn I've never
seen a power supply like this this is
incredible
now if all you could change the end I
could use it on my guitars over there
but oh well unfortunately not and so of
course you got more cables in here for
you know your graphics cards everything
SATA and Wow we get a couple of these
are some tie wraps and a nice little
carrying case for all your extra cables
that you don't need Wow so look at this
book that's all I have in the table
we're not gonna break these all down
individual if you guys want to check
that out we'll let that down the
description but obviously if we said
it's gonna be enough to power anything
and everything that you have including a
big wad even a floppy oh hey all right
there so if you're in those people who
has a floppy I feel sorry for you guy if
you do but if you got a floppy you know
maybe get some vigor I don't know there
support right here for that if you need
it so alright so check this out in the
main thing I'm done done two things are
freaking brick dude yeah it's it's very
heavy
it feels like my 25 pound weight I
wonder if it's at it maybe not that
heavy it's probably about eighteen
nineteen pounds you know the actual
weight in it not sure but it's probably
close alright some around there real
quick guys you can just see this here's
how it's gonna come in the box then once
again I'm sure Jacob talked about this
so that's the manual that you get with
it tells you everything
about the powers play and where it was
made the guy who made it not that detail
about hot his wife is not not quite that
detailed it doesn't come up the white
commuter oh man and here's power supply
itself so it's a 30 40 140 millimeter
fan it also has a feature here there's a
switch right here it comes default off
but if you flip that to the on position
basically what that does is the fan will
not turn on until the power supply
reaches I believe around 35 degrees
Celsius oh so it's kind of like kind of
like the same thing of that cadet some
other people have in their motherboards
it only engages you know when so when
you're when you're when the system's
idle it basically doesn't spin so can
you change that though cuz they're a way
to set anything if you want it to always
yeah yeah you just flip this is off turn
it okay and then it'll just always spin
but if you want a completely silent
machine when it's idle then you just
turn it off yeah pretty cool stuff
though so how much this thing going to
be selling for put so what's the
basically the the reference price
reference price I think is around $300
or so right on that we're still so um
yeah it's available now just start
shipping a couple weeks ago smells like
fresh paint yeah
it's Brandon I have has that guys that
has a freshman it's kind of like
different though like when you open a
motherboard smoother or is that that
other kind of smelled this has like
almost like a capacitors it's a master
than their Forte thank you folks you
guys gonna see this man the power button
the back here is just actually ginormous
you guys can see that just humongous so
that's pretty much it folks now real
quick though I'm gonna disappear off the
cameras for a second I'll be back relax
x99 motherboard their motherboard guess
I'm sharpteeth I'm sorry at the camera
all right once again I'll leave the
camera
look look I'm magically back look hey
didn't go far
it's Gordon to the side of this alright
so we got the power supply out here
we're also be gonna getting some 1980s
we're thinking about doing either a
triple or quadruple the top I know a lot
people gonna must be saying hey you know
awesome just go all the way but honestly
that fourth card kinda just for show all
the tests move around the fourth car was
just kind of like hey it's like you know
like a you know penis wagging contest
you know hey check it out mine's bigger
so if you want bigger is better well
then go with four but I'm thinking three
because that's actually going to be
efficient and still give me what I need
so let's get some of this other stuff
out of here let's let Jacob talk to us
about his x99 board and some of the
things that set it apart in the pack so
here's your board let's talk about this
freestyle of free formula render hooks
so this is the x99 classified on the
board we have three X 99 motherboards
this is our highest anyone we have a
micro ATX motherboard and then we have
one step above that's called the FTW and
then we have the high end with the
Kasbah
so you can see these are all the
accessories that it comes with of course
the manual here this one is a quick
guide DVD nice little case badge in
there too oh yeah check that out will
simple to get that in some beer a little
nice cake badge I'm sure all the
accessories a you want like
people this long you probably want to
show this one alright let's check them
out very good
all right USB 3.0 breakout cable hooking
your USB header on the motherboard out
to your rear bracket there SATA cables
SATA cables you like this no space
important data cables alright there's
more SATA cables lock the SATA cables
okay
it's like satin or Satan of course you
have the SLI bridges the hotel see now
to see me hey you guys actually sell
though and even like more hardcore SLI
bridge directors called the pro pro SLI
bridges crew sli bridge is not for the
faint-hearted it's it's basically the
same but it looks really really they
look really cool right yeah we're gonna
get one don't worry folks well twist his
arm I swear to god I'll make sure you
alright say no arms twisting even yeah
we don't we don't have to be violent
around here yeah says primary primary so
that's where four-way SLI and then of
course two-way SLI is this one here you
nice little cable there's a flex cable
then we have this here this is actually
called pro bit so this is say there's a
connector on the motherboard I'll show
it to you when we pull that out but
basically that plugs into the
motherboard and then on the other end
you have a bunch of leads and on those
leads you can connect the voltmeter to
it and you can measure the voltages and
real time of them on the board like the
memory voltage CPU voltage for those
guys who do that extreme overclocking
 and the rest of you guys out
there you guys all love that stuff if
you think it's a little bit of overkill
because I wanna hurt my fingers I play
guitar could you imagine me freezing my
finger and sand that stuff no no no day
isn't like that and then we have the i/o
shield here you still does more the
cables that go with that so those that's
actually called GPU link so it's like
imagine they like to be everything right
it's another for the video card right
kind of it's another accessory for the
hardcore overclocker guy and basically
what that does is if you're familiar
with the soldering iron you know how to
use that one end goes to the graphics
card another end goes to the motherboard
and you can control like some voltages
and stuff from the motherboard boss oh
so making so you have to go out and
actually the Correa's Tweaker you know
if you do that to your graphics card
it's probably gonna void your warranty
but for those extreme guys the
brave-hearted
yeah kingpin you know you type so I
actually just saw at the Nvidia vent the
other day I was like hey yeah there's
Vince so here's the pup Vince here's the
motherboard here of course it's x99
platform so it has eight dims supports
around twenty four hundred megahertz
membrane above you can support 2667 2800
2014 higher speeds no I like about it
though man is that the entire
motherboard is solid black yeah with a
nice big just red accent makes it good
for a lot of bills you wouldn't even
have to totally stick with the red you
could actually build a different color
event of it yeah pretty much you know
it's the black color kind of goes with
most pretty much any kind of case theme
this the motherboard here supports for
whistle I won it well to SLI through us
live for Wes why of course it's ten
power phases so it's good for
overclocking you know we're able to get
very good overclocks with most of the
CPUs out there I know some people out
there gonna like gonna Nasir go hey you
guys made me like my video carts like
what some that you would say that like
separates you from the other companies
that make sure like boards stand out
yeah I would say number one would be the
layout certainly we put a lot of effort
on the layout making sure that it
supports a wide variety of
configurations like up to 400 SLI in a
standard kind of standard form factor
it's e ATX and then you know more layout
things right angle 24 pin power
connector that's kind of unique to EVGA
but we also do a lot of right angle
connectors here like a right-angled fan
headers so he's talked about right here
is right here on the board right here I
can see the 24 pin power connector it's
actually tilted sideways makes it a lot
better for cable management and stuff
like that instead of having it come all
the way around in the loop you can just
stick it right here and make it easier
and this little button right down here
this is actually the button for their
triple BIOS that's right not one not two
but three different biases so you can
screw up quite a bit and still have this
EVGA board up and going for you right
and right and some of the things I want
to know folks about the motherboard what
be really showing you all the stuff I'm
sure but like looks nice doesn't look
all crowded the whole boards not all
crowded doesn't look like it's all on
top of each other and that's something I
actually like about it now are these
chips over here you guys do sound stuff
yeah so it comes with creative core 3d
audio it's a quad core audio processor
has the creative drivers that come with
it as well so all those EAX features and
those extensions room there as well and
so for you gamers out there who don't
want to buy a sound card you have this
on board and that's actually a good
thing another thing is as you guys can
see they don't go on and on about it
like some people do but they actually do
segregate the audio as well it's
actually off to the side so they didn't
put a line on it you know like trying to
make they like a like a wall like the
Berlin wall but it's still segregated
some companies create the Berlin wall
but I think it's kind of like more or
less just to like for looks I don't
really know yeah it probably is I mean
it is we do separate it and it does have
a separate ground to reduce kind of
audio and interfering but we don't
actively go out there any because you
can see there's plenty of silicon all
the way around that that's keeping it
away from the other components anyways
and that's gonna be we're getting at the
scions anyways lines nice but yeah it's
okay and then this kind of goes with the
appearance as well so this is an
optional accessory it just goes on wow
that's even metal yeah and this heavy
metal it just makes it look check this
out folks
you guys put this on nice option booze
it up go it yeah we go there we go yeah
looks good in the case Heights all that
Pam looks very very nice I like it it's
very very well laid out x99 has been
good all around I'm even liking this big
huge hardware thing you guys did up here
too yeah it's all hardcore and heavy
heavy metal now over here the idea these
just you start you reason about reset we
have clear see
here as well so you can reset the CMOS
by just pressing that button there this
here shows you your post codes when you
boot the system you know while the
system's booting I'll show you the post
code diagnostic LEDs but once the system
has boot into Windows it'll actually
show your CPU temperature oh really yes
so that's pretty cool yeah that's
actually you have a window you could
just look into your interior window and
you can see very easily oh that's
awesome I didn't actually know that
that's a cool feature I'm sure a lot of
enthusiasts will dig that hey if it
makes it actually useful some say they
have a crazy number you can actually see
what's going on now on the back I also
noticed there's no little red button so
I take it as another clear CMOS sensor
so if you can't get to the inside of
your case easily you know you could just
hit that button on the outside of the
chassis and then you can reset the
seamless right on so that's pretty much
it folks like I said we're gonna be
working very close to the TV Jade in the
near future we're gonna be having an
awesome system it's gonna be featuring
another Corsair 900 d-- that they had
completely custom painted it's totally
awesome like let's aqua blue and we're
gonna have one system that's going to be
dedicated to the AMD video card side of
things thanks for a tailor and then for
the nvidia team green we're gonna have
stuff from EVGA in there so everybody's
represented properly in x99 so Jacob
thank you so much it's nothing great
stop us no no you came here this time so
that we think we're stopping by go to
your office it's done see they're used
to they're used to me going to the
office but nope they're here now so
folks thanks for watching having me yes
there you go like I said all the
information about both these products
will be down below this power supply is
brand new so if you're looking to get
into that kind of stuff what options
available T down there as well on motor
contech you tomorrow today's guests was
Jacob Freeman from EVGA we love you
folks if you're not sub and you like
what you see hey you know what to do
peace out brothers thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
