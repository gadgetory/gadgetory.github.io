of tomorrow and today we're bringing you
the asus gtx 680 directcu to top card
this was just announced spices yesterday
so we're very luck to have it here and
you'll notice these sexy claw marks it
just brings out the beast in everyone
now let's take a look at this box and
see exactly what it offers besides a
little uh something down
hey guys this is Shannon from techie
tomorrow so I'm sorry for a little intro
you know we like to with you guys
kind of give you something to laugh at a
little bit before we get you into the
technical stuff here this part was just
launched yesterday so let's go ahead and
take a look at it and see what exactly
we're getting here okay where the ACS
box is a pretty box because I'm sure
they want to see that and then we have
our ASIS ASIS manual and no CD like we
were expecting right let's see here it
is wow this thing's pretty beastly it's
got a full cover back plate so you'll
notice that we do have the like we
mentioned before the read points are
actually the GPU hotwire points where
you can solder it directly with wiring
that plugs directly into the board so
that's something requires a little more
skill you don't want to exactly do if
you're gonna be running it on air this
is more like guys who run extreme liquid
nitrogen things like that so you'll
probably remove the back plate in order
to get to access to a lot of the things
you're going to do with that but that's
going to hear their coolers coming off
anyway speaking of the cooler we have
the direct CU 2 cooler seen this on a
few other model devices really quiet
really cool this one basically cool
really works it's a triple slot cooler
so it's really large and it also allows
it to be a lot choir than a lot of the
stock fans you see they come on the car
with reference it is to weigh in 3-way
SLI compatible via the two bridges here
and being pcie 3.0 via slot here um
especially at Ivy Bridge just launching
it's a perfect fit because pcie 3.0 is
ready to run on this thing so with the
triple slot definitely going to be
looking at a board that's spacing
something like the asus p8z77-v s board
would be a great choice because you have
a slot spacing there so you still have
one extra space if you run two of these
cars you also have your tool DVI outs
you will notice that only one of the
actual DVI outs is analog compatible not
that many people are going to buy this
card view the VGA monitor but just be
keep that in mind if using an adapter to
this also you have your HDMI and your
display port and then you also because
of the cooler type and they want to keep
card super straight for you you have
this bracket going across that keeps the
thing just completely solid also one
thing on the card is it unlike the
standard 680 it which has a stacked six
and six this actually has a side-by-side
six and eight so therefore you don't
have to worry about the stack with some
people have concerns with you know
fitment especially with different type
of modular plugs this has a six and
eight which also includes the extra
power for the GPU for extreme
overclocking so something that will
definitely be a benefit for power users
then in the box we also have the dual
six to eight pin power connector I'm
thinking most people who buy this
probably won't need this because well
you're gonna have a pretty high in power
supply pushing this thing but if you
need it is here and also there's a
really long SLI ribbon because most
motherboards don't come with one for you
know the really wide slot spacing you're
going to need to run this card to
another one because it's not a standard
dual slot reference card this thing's
huge I mean this thing's huge i wish i
had a reference card here to hold up
next to it so you can see luckily doc
supplied us with another card to compare
it to you we actually have another
extreme on the hog variant here we have
two gigabyte super overclock card so as
you can see this is a standard dual slot
card compared side-by-side or even more
so just take them and hold them together
you'll see you got a full another slot
with coming from this card to that one
hey Shannon can you do cards together
back to back and do a crossfire
connection you could try okay just
thought I that doesn't do me that'd be
awesome no I really don't think that
would work but it'd be an awesome
concept will have to ask a sous if they
could implement that just sticking cards
together with what they've done here I
would say it's probably not outside the
realm of possibility now let's take a
look at how long this thing is because
you know we like it long looks like it's
almost exactly 12 inches to the end of
the IO bracket so figure you're going to
need a lot of space there and with we're
looking at about two and a half inches
in height well being a custom PCB it's
slightly higher than normal at you'll
see a threat above the IO bracket figure
the full cooler is about a full inch
over the standard size io bracket so you
want to make sure that unless you're
running it in a test bench configuration
that you're running it in a chassis that
has enough clearance above the IO to fit
this guy otherwise you're gonna run
inside panel fitment
use which probably the least of my
concerns I don't think this thing you'll
ever see a case okay guys and with that
we're going to sleep and come back with
some crazy benchmarks on this maybe even
if we can come up with it maybe run it
on some cold and see if we can break
some records at this thing thanks for
watching and this was Genentech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
