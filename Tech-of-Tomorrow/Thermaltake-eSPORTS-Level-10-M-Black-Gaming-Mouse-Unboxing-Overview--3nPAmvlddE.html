I know it's Monday morning everybody's
back at work dreading the job well at
least most people are you guys know I'm
unemployed I'm just here on the channel
for you folks
so that's said on Monday morning I've
got something really cool for you folks
it's all been rumor and I guess over in
Europe it's been out for a while but
here in America it's just arriving on
our shores what is that it's the new
thermal tech that's right the new
thermal tech level 10 M Mouse now this
thing's been co-designed by Thermaltake
and BMW design groups this thing's
really cool now I don't know if it's
going to be totally all fashion and no
go that's yet to be seen
but I do have the black one now there's
going to be three versions coming out
there's going to have their diamond
black their iron white in their military
green there'll be three of those coming
out I have the diamond black one in my
hand and let's go ahead and Minh box
this thing and talk about some of the
features of it as we go let's go all
right folks so here it is this is
exactly what it's going to look like if
you order from Amazon or some of the
other online e-tailers so for now I
don't think I'm gonna need the knife
take all Manila we're going to do is
just do a couple ridges here and after a
little Rivage we'll get this thing out
so here it is level 10 Gaming Mouse a
little 10m born to be seen now this
thing is going to be totally
programmable twin to have 11
programmable buttons with five different
user interfaces 128 kilobytes built in
programmability so that's gonna be
something cool it's all supposed to be
adjustable totally adjustable that is so
anyways I know you guys don't care too
much about the box but here's the front
of it for those out there who do care
here's a little bit of nomenclature on
the side show the back
so the other side not too much to that
right alright so let's see if I'm gonna
need the knife for any of this uh well
yeah well maybe not I always like to
break out the knife I can but this time
it looks like I can get away with it and
just peel the tape and tape it on the
cameraman there we go
we're just behind the camera so we're
gonna take it out let me here see here
the level 10m gave me mouth once again
born to be seen a little tab right there
a perfect excuse for the knife right
yeah hey see I knew we can find a way to
use that bad way in there alright done
done done done
ah Oh a little operatic moment there
alright then so there we have it inside
the package even the packaging is
looking pretty damn awesome right yes
yes yes yes it does okay so go ahead and
take it out of the packaging here so
here's what it looks like there flip it
around we'll get back to that let's see
what comes in the box there's a pouch
which you can use to take the mouse on
the go or put into your fist and punch
cameraman use as necessary pull it off
put it off the side the level 10m Gaming
Mouse probably going to have the driver
and everything in there so let's pop it
out and see what all is in there
hopefully it'll have a CD in there with
all these buttons and all this stuff
should have something oops didn't mean
to tear the package in there there's an
accident alright so let's bring all this
stuff out first off looks like we get
two postcards so these are just send
your friends I go hahaha bro did you get
one of these yet
bet you didn't he's gonna be like oh man
he's gonna buy one he left two and it'll
send you some facts we get one two three
four postcards so you can send these out
to four of your friends these are
actually different colors we spoke Oh so
here we go
military green they're like playing
cards
military green diamond pack and finally
iron white not to be confused with Iron
Mike Tyson plus out of the way and here
is a little warranty policy and yes we
do have it the driver CD you will need
this nuts out of the way what else is in
here there's a little box that's got a
tool ah interesting interesting
interesting interesting now this tool
I'm suppose is going to be to adjust
this thing so let's go ahead and get
back to the mouse let me go ahead and
take all these little twist ties off
once again a good time to use the knife
here make sure I get it away from the
product
take a nice Swift cut there over here we
have another one an iPhone in there nice
little cut there donates all that
hassling get that other oh so here we go
so let's start up the top boom
now this mouse has an aluminum bottom
and the top and bottom are designed so
they look and feel like they're totally
separate from each other notice the way
that it swivels the mouse is totally
adjustable you can adjust the height
which side to side it goes to probably
most likely with this little tool here
that we have right here which is used to
adjust it you can see it going up going
down going up so you guys can see that
so if you prefer the mouse to be lower
to the ground you can make it as low as
your hand wants it or as high whatever
your comfort level is now there are four
places for lights lights will be
underneath over here and once again
underneath over here and when it lights
up you can see it very well will plug it
and actually show you that as we
dang video so here on the side now imma
turn it have more buttons here see here
OFW profile so this must be the profile
button for programming your profiles and
unchanging them as a little thing right
there's probably very hard to see I'll
try to bring us up very much closer to
you guys to check this out
flip it around show you guys the other
side or once again we see a tool where
we insert this now know if you guys can
really see the some great treasure in
the camera ok watch it's going to go to
the left now or to the right you see
that folks that also gives it a slight
tilt as well to that even if you see
that or not but it also tells it or you
can make it just dead center which is
where I want it to be got two more
buttons right here the cable on the
connectivity in the end go ahead and
remove this for you folks we're going to
see supposedly gold-plated hardware we
see that so it's gold plating all nice
and beautiful I stays before but there
are 11 programmable buttons on here
there are five user profiles this means
five different people can set this up
for them and you have 11 different
programmable keys which are all going to
be modified on the on screen interface
so right now just from feeling it it
feel very tripping the way that it
slides side to side is going to be
pretty interesting how it does the
buttons are down here on the bottom so
I'm going to actually lower this down
lower for my comfort level before I plug
it in go ahead and take this thing as
low as I can get it because my hands a
little short little chubby hands so okay
that's a little bit better for me I
don't know about these buttons over here
now these two buttons right here to me
honestly are very hard to get to my hand
is going to be up here trying to get to
these two buttons way over here not very
ergonomic I'm just going to say that
right off the bat so you guys can see
that getting these buttons is going to
be a major pain in the ass now the ones
on this side though
are no problem at all so let me do this
a little bit different for you folks
standard hand analysis buttons you can
hit this one's kind of redundant because
once you know program ahead unless
you're five different people are playing
five different games possibly you know
you're not going to use that very much
so for five different games you might be
using it now that once again I say these
buttons over here not very ergonomic I
should I could almost take my hands off
to use these buttons they're very far
down not liking that so and now let's go
ahead and plug it in and we'll see what
it looks like in a little environment
alright folks so now we've plugged it in
and we talked about what it looks like
as far as changing the colors so let's
go ahead and change the colors and cycle
through them button down here in the
bottom cycles thrown
let's hit the button see a color change
there another color change there another
color change alright folks
now that we've showed you how it changes
colors there's actually more I believe
through their interface first thing I'm
going to do is you guys are going to see
this little sticker on the bottom says
peel off before use I'm just going to go
ahead and take my thumbnail there and
remove that off of there
then you can see it's going to open up
the optical port there so we can see the
dang thing I've just installed the disk
into the system so I'm going to go ahead
I'm going to run the drivers you can see
right here on the screen the run setup
executive so now I'm going to go ahead
and install the drivers we'll do it in
English just because go and just
installed on my C Drive
it says it's done now somewhere over
here there should be some kind of a
little a Seuss thing for me to go in and
look at so let me see if I can find it
in here to eSports level 10m I'm going
to click into it now it's loading on the
screen up here alright folks so now I've
installed the driver you guys can see
the screens the level 10m Gaming Mouse
you've got one two three four and five
profiles that's what I was saying
earlier it's all programmable you have
normal mode battle mode
my dog is not barking you can also see
in the screen it says that when I go to
this mode it switched the illumination
effects will change according to the
clicking frequencies so that might be
kind of interesting do that for another
video I just want to show you guys this
real quick also on screen you can see if
I click the mouse here you can program
everything all via through here as you
click through it has all the different
buttons this is how you can go through
and program everything so I think for
the unboxing and overview this is pretty
good you guys seem pretty much most of
the effects now I'll have to play with
it and see what it's like alright
everybody so there you guys have it the
level 10m Gaming Mouse by thermal tape
this has been the unboxing and overview
I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you
did you can always show me some love by
hitting that like button make sure you
subscribe because we're always having
contests and in case you guys missed it
yesterday we announce the winner of four
of our contests just so we could get cut
back up and have more contests for you
folks so that said we'll see you back
here on teka tomorrow I'm going to go
off and do some gaming with this mouse
