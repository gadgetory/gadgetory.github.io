particular you Samsung fans what's going
on today well the new Samsung s7 and s7
edge have hit the market but there are a
few things you need to know before you
buy the release of the new s7 and s7
edge isn't like reinventing the wheel in
fact it's more like the differences
between the s6 and the s6 edge the new
s7 has a 5.1 AMOLED screen and the new
s7 edge has a 5.5 inch screen and both
of these phones offer 1440p resolution
which makes everything really sharp and
easy to view obviously both are really
clear to look at but if you're looking
for a much bigger screen you're going to
want to be looking at the s7 edge as
even that slight little difference in
size makes a world of difference when
viewing now me personally I liked the s6
edge I really like that edge
functionality and with the new s7 edge
that functionality is even further
improved and more intuitive to the user
which just makes checking out all your
things and going through everything much
simpler and easy another feature that's
very big and very important is battery
life the new s7 has a 3,000 milliamp
battery but the new s7 edge has a
whopping 3600 milliamp battery which
means you don't have to worry about that
phone running out of juice on the same
day or using it Samsung's always on
display is something pretty cool but I
know a lot of people are wondering my
god is this not going to run my battery
out what you really don't have to worry
about it because he always on function
only uses the battery to power the
pixels that you're seeing at that time
which means doesn't waste any extra
energy I know many people out there
we're getting really discouraged about
all the phones going the way with no SD
card like I didn't like it I know a lot
of you fans out there didn't like it but
check it out with the new s7 and the new
s7 edge that's right people the SD card
slot is back so not only do get the 32
gigabytes internally on the phone right
now you can store up to an additional
200 gigabytes on there with the
possibility of up to two terabytes as
the market expands currently Samsung's
only talking about what is markedly
available at this time another thing
you're going to notice about the s7 and
s7
edge is that they've taken away the hump
on the phone no more hump is there and
in fact they've made the phone just a
little bit thicker to be more durable I
guess we're not going to see a Ben gate
on this one camera functionality has
also really improved and even though
it's gone from 16 megapixels down to 12
I think you guys will be surprised at
how well these new cameras work and with
dual picture technology focusing is
faster than ever and with a wider f17
aperture you get much better low-light
filming and pictures and like I said
going from 16 megapixels down to 12
seems to mean absolutely nothing using
the camera is really really intuitive
and one of the best that I've seen yet
another feature that Samsung has brought
back is the ability to be water
resistant both the i7 and i7 edge
feature a water-resistant IP rating of
68 which means that your phone can be
submerged in 1.5 meters of water for up
to 30 minutes but with the removal of
the USB flap I don't know how well I
trust this phone to go into a pool or
take a shower with its water resistant
but I really don't know how much I would
want to push that with my brand new
phone alright folks so there you have it
the top new features of the s7 and s7
edge not a whole lot of new technology
coming to the table but definitely
enough to whet your appetite and get
those people who want the latest and
best from Samsung you're going to want
to get your hands on one of these now
like usual all the information about
these will be down below like button
colors availability all that stuff will
be down there I'm network you've been
watching tech of tomorrow we'll see you
guys back from the channel for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
