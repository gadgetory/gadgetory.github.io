detector tomorrow today's video I just
want to say to you guys up front is
sponsored by LexA their slogan is be 3d
and today we're gonna be showing you
their brand new 3d emperor gaming mouse
now the unique things about this gaming
mouse is that it has two joysticks built
into the mouse itself that's right so
not only is it your standard Mouse it
also has two different joysticks built
inside of it now this is where things
get really interesting because this
mouse is not only geared for total
ultimate gaming doing your head shots
and doing all that stuff it's also made
to work in the pro side of the things so
not only can you use this mouse to play
your games you can also use this mouse
to develop your games and that's
something pretty cool if you want to see
all the applications that are supported
we'll have a link down below where you
can check it out on their website but
all in all this is a pretty unique thing
so let's jump in real quick and let's
take a closer look at the LexA 3d mouse
looking at the 3d M pro from the top you
can see it looks just like any standard
Mouse out there but under the hood there
are a lot of different features like I
said now you get to click buttons you
get your scroll and click button and
then you get your dpi adjustment button
now the DPI on this mouse can be changed
all the way up to 8200 dpi which is
simply incredible things to be flying
around your screen really crazy and also
when you're working inside a
professional program you can set it 3200
dpi so that you get really accurate
tracking there are also two more buttons
located on the left hand side as well as
a two axis joystick and all the buttons
on the mouse can be programmable
programming these buttons is also very
easy but to do so you'll need to go over
their website and download the software
like I said earlier having two joysticks
built into a mouse is something very
unusual and actually pretty cool
the first joystick is internal and it's
controlled by tilting the mouse shell
simply tilt your mouth shell up down
left to right to control a variety of
moves this particular joystick is made
entirely for use with the palm of your
hand and it's very easy to use and it
actually has precision to plus minus 20
degrees now the second joystick it's
controlled by your thumb now this gives
you ample customization it also gives
you premium ergonomics and a truly
three-dimensional gaming experience and
you
never need to add additional commands
keys or shortcuts now this is a two axis
joystick with full precision up to plus
minus thirty degrees in all directions
another thing this mouse brings to the
table is a premium gaming laser sensor
there was no skimping whatsoever in any
part that's used to build this Mouse and
the sensor is very very accurate like I
said before up to 8200 dpi adjustment on
the bottom of the 3d M Pro you guys can
see they use a different type of feet
than most gaming mice out there these
are actually made of ceramic and they
slide across any surface very very
easily there's no drag no lag it's just
absolute smoothness across the board on
my first experience with gaming with the
3d M Pro I have to say that it is a
little bit weird and takes a bit of
getting used to it's not just like plug
the box and then get up and go and
everything's gonna be you know like
usual because this mouse is a little bit
different now the very first joystick is
really crazy because let's just face it
it's your mouse itself so you know you
tilt it to the right you go to the right
you tilt to the left you go to the left
and that's not usually how you do things
usually the controller's you know on
your keyboard use WASD or whatever
custom keys you use but you're usually
not doing that thing right with your
mouse yourself and the second joystick
using your thumb to control and try to
shoot things is it's kind of cool but it
also takes a learning curve to get used
to because let's just face it on your
everyday gaming you're not using your
thumb on a joystick to game usually it's
either your mouse yourself like I said
or it's your joystick separate and
having those two things built-in the
mouse although a cool idea and as I get
used to it I can see it being a really
thumbs up thing in the beginning it's a
little bit trippy and different to use
for sure now as far as how well the 3d M
Pro works in a professional environment
I don't have any of those auto cad
software eating that stuff installed on
my computer but I'm sure that it
probably works just as well as it does
in game and just gonna have a little bit
of a learning curve one thing to take
note of the Kickstarter program right
now this Mouse is a hundred and ten
dollars so that is a little bit pricey
so as just a standard Gaming Mouse that
might seem a little bit high but with
the other features in it if you're
someone who does both gaming
you work in the professional world
there's pretty much nothing like this on
the market right now one thing I have to
say though is this mouse is very
comfortable it's kind of made for a
smaller hand people have extremely large
hands will probably completely engulf
the 3d empro but if you have a medium to
small size hand it's going to fit very
well in your hand and it doesn't give
any discomfort even after using it for
long periods of time so if you guys are
interested in checking out more about
this mouse we'll have a link down below
I'm Erik you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow we'll see you guys back in the
channel for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
