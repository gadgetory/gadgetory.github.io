once again to the channel now you guys
know that right now it's a total
crypto-currency phase that's going on
people are totally getting into this
video card you're going up in price some
places are price gouging it's really
really care easy and I know that this
kind of sucks for gamers out there or
trying to look for a gaming card you go
online you see it's your favorite video
card that's normally three or four
hundred ollars now six or seven hundred
dollars that's just absolutely crazy
crazy stuff now a long time ago they had
Bitcoin mining it used a sick and it
wasn't really popular for a while I even
had a system but then they change the
way that you got paid when they changed
what you got paid for me it kind of
completely screwed things around and I
was like with my machine I can't even
really make any money I'd pretty much
have to get like you know warehouse full
of stuff and now we see cryptocurrency
coming back but this time using video
cards in the stuff that's inside of them
to get your money and do your mining I
mean this craze has gotten so popular
that you now hear Nvidia is saying that
hey we're going to come out and we're
going to have our own cards for doing
mining which is just crazy because in
the past
nvidia has never really publicly said oh
hey you know we support mining we're
going to be doing this but now they are
which shows a trend going on and AMD
right now seems to have the lock on the
market because like i said all those
cards are just selling for outrageous
outrageous prices now the question I
have for you guys is do you guys
actually think that cryptocurrency
will become an actual cash standard or
digital cash standard which what I mean
by this is will you be able to go to
places like eBay Amazon your local store
walk in with a card and be able to use
your cryptocurrency just like you use
cash now obviously the petro dollar
standard probably won't ever fade
completely out and another thing I want
to talk about also is that currently
right now seven of the major countries
around the world have all claimed
financial problems which means that the
dollar value around the world no matter
what kind of currencies in that country
it's all faded and is gone downhill was
this is happening people are getting all
crazy they're saying oh my god crypto
mining it's the latest thing you know in
the future theory of mining let's let's
let's do this but my question is do you
guys actually think that this will ever
actually become a real
standard for money will just continue to
be a fringe thing for a long time down
the road and do you guys think that
video card prices will finally start to
go back down again like they were now
NVIDIA is going to release their batch
of cards how they're going to be exactly
what they're going to do I'm kind of
curious I'm sure you guys are as well
because it will be very very interesting
stuff and if all of this crypto myung
does become more popular do you plan on
getting into it I mean I myself time
looking getting a machine even though I
don't have the absolute highest hopes of
you know getting to be a rich off this
or anything else and AMD stock was
rising pretty rapidly but for the last
few days we've seen that stock actually
fall down a little bit which is kind of
weird because I mean everybody I've seen
the columns is like by AMD stock it's
the thing you're going to be rich you're
going to be rich my friends let's all by
AMD stock now is this only due to the
cryptocurrency phase or is this due to
other factors as well because at the end
of the day I mean I've never seen AMD
cards get you know priced at a way
higher price in any time except for what
it has to do with like mining stuff then
you see all of these stuffs go up up up
up up and like the comments I'm sure I'm
going to see a bunch of comments of
people are going hey man the miners
and I understand why you guys are doing
this because you can't get your hands on
a video card for an even decent price
and people who do price gouging I really
don't think that's very cool I do
believe though that Best Buy has some
580 s in stock right now that you can
get for about 350 bucks so that's not
really too bad but I see a lot of other
places on the net just totally price
gouging and trying to get your money so
don't pay any of this high money for a
video card right now why all the crypto
Minds going on because you're just going
to be paying from the teeth and like I
said before in other videos you can buy
you stuff from people but I'm even
seeing on eBay that they use you know
the use telling people are selling you
stuff are just gouging people and trying
to get their money so cryptocurrency
seems like it's a big thing but will it
actually come in to play and be a
standard just like in the old days it
was gold now the petrodollar
I'm sure in the future it will change is
something else but do you guys think the
crypto mining will become the de-facto
type of money
that you use in the future I'm kind of
skeptical because like I said in the
past that coin came around Bitcoin was
real popular everybody was into it this
guy even bought an expensive ass car
using Bitcoin but then it just kind of
faded away and you didn't really see
that many people going Bitcoin crazy and
now was this new stuff with
cryptocurrency two remaining and all
these different types I believe there's
like five or six different types of
mind--it's you can do currently right
now but all of those things all kind of
equate to the same thing it's type of
digital currency which is a fringe type
currency right now it's not accepted
anywhere like I said you can't go to a
Best Buy you can't go in those places
and use it but if you could that would
be really interesting so at the end of
the day my questions are for you are you
guys totally into cryptocurrency for
your own personal stuff do you think
it's a waste of time and at the end of
the day or like the any of the end of
time maybe I'm not exactly at a time but
do you guys think that this currency
will ever actually be an accepted thing
all around the world or is this just a
phase
I'm our thanks for watching take it
tomorrow we got more tech coming this
weekend so we'll see you guys here on
the channel
