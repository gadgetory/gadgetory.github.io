Tekken tomorrow Elric here now the other
day I release a system called the
Hellfire system and a lot of the fans
out there just went completely crazy
sending me eight Philly mails and watch
it again tell me how I suck and all this
stuff now wrap the bat I'm going to tell
you guys it's not my fault whatsoever
that AMD video cards are so pricy due to
mining and shortage of stuff these cards
are very expensive but you guys took
that into me and I have no
responsibility for that whatsoever and
like I even said in that video you can
choose to use whatever video card you
guys want you guys seem to act like I'm
writing the Bible here and I talked
sacrilege why didn't I do this we'll
check it out I did listen to you guys
though most of the comments down below
where I came at at 10:50 T I would make
this a sweet system and I'd be into that
so check it out we're bringing the video
back to you so if you guys want to know
about the system we'll have a link down
below because the only thing that we
change in this system however was we
change the video card now there were
some also comments down there but oh you
know the memory is not 3100 megahertz
it's not going to do this well if you
want to buy 300 megahertz it's not going
to be on a budget system or a mid-level
system you're talking about married it's
going to be in a few hundred dollars
which is once again Gunderson creased
the price of the system I was trying to
keep it budget now the system now is
about $550 I got an open box video card
from EVGA 1050 Ti for a hundred bucks so
now this build is less than $600 it's
got the 1050 Ti on let's jump right in
let's check out the benchmarks now I
will say this though me personally I
don't really know if I would really go
with the lower end CPUs for a gaming
system I know a lot of people are out
there on a budget they're like oh I want
to make her you know really cheap system
well pretty much it's this if you have a
4k monitor and you can afford to buy a
really nice expensive video card and a
4k monitor then yeah these lower and
CPUs might be ok for you but at 1080p
there's definitely bottlenecking going
on a little bit less at 1440 and you
know unless you have a great video card
you're not going to be playing 4k
anyways but that's just my opinion so
real quick let's jump in let's check out
the benchmark song let's see these
scores at the end of the day see whether
you guys think this would be worth your
money
five hundred fifty bucks let's rock
and they will be
all right fans so there you have it this
system like I said brings the cost down
now to under $600 so it's pretty much a
great entry level system at that price I
do not consider any gaming system trying
to say oh I want to turn to fit your 300
hour gaming system there's really no
such thing if you're talking about a
really good gaming system yeah you might
have something that'll play games at you
know low settings and be okay but that
to me is not a gaming experience at all
that's just like you know I don't know
it's like buying a bicycle when you need
a car just isn't really going to do the
trick now you guys can see that using
this card since it's such a low I mean
card at $100 most of the frame rates are
actually under 60 at 1080 and at 14:40
they're usually hovering around 48 to 50
and a lot of the games as you guys saw
but like I said this system is very very
entry-level so if you're looking for
something that you can buy put together
and have a really nice system that's
easy like we didn't use any really
custom cabling or anything like that
whatsoever so pretty much any of you
guys out there should be able to emulate
this build if you want to go and wrap
the cables up a little bit more you can
do that you can customize it but you
guys can see this system is very clean
inside there's no cable mess whatsoever
it's just completely great airflow run
completely through the system and I like
that so here you guys go man Hellfire
version 2.0 coming into the market at
under $600 like usual underneath the
like button hopefully you guys will be a
much kinder in this video than you were
in the next one and all the parts will
be down there so do you want to build
this build you can do it for yourself
I'm Eric hope you guys are having a
great day peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
