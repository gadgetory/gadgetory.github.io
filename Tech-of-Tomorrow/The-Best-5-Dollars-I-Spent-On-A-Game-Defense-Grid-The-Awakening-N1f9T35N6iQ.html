me elric Ferris your host here in the
tech of tomorrow youtube channel I want
to talk to you guys about something kind
of cool now a lot of us spend lots and
lots of money on video games out there
I've dished out hundreds this year alone
I'll probably dish out hundreds next
year if you're like me you're a hardcore
gamer you're doing the same thing now me
personally I prefer to play my games on
Steam origin has some issues that i'm
still not too happy with sometimes it
kind of pissed me off with only four
downloads and i have an EA game so i
think that's terrible but what I want to
talk to you guys today about is probably
what I consider to be the best five
dollars I've ever spent on steam that's
right five dollars i paid for this game
it's called defense grid the awakening
and if you're into tower defense games
this game is just really the i
honestly love this game five
dollars my son walked in the other day
and he was like dad he was like you
played that game for like eight hours
he's like you don't even play most games
that long and honestly it's true most
games I played him for a little while
get in I do testing on them this game I
installed it and by the way it will work
on any OS all the way from XP all the
way to windows 7 and what you basically
do is you have all these crazy-ass
aliens coming to kill your ass and what
you do is you build all these different
type of towers to defend your base and
basically all of your computer cores you
guys can check it out right here here's
a shot of the computer core right here
and these were these little alien
buggers kill you or at least they try to
continue by taking your things and
escape
the grid right here you can see the
front of the grill where all the aliens
walk in now you can see the back of the
grid where all the aliens walk out now
depending on the missions you can
actually make the aliens with the
directions as you want and use all kinds
of defense strategies to defend yourself
one of the things that we really like is
the damn Tesla cannon the Tesla cannon
just rips the out of victims tears
them all up if you have a lot of Tesla
cannons you can really kick the enemies
but into the ground I actually filmed
some fronts videos to show you guys a
couple different things you guys can see
it check it out folks here we are
playing some live gameplay this is on
one of the more advanced levels I've
moved it up this is kind of crazy a lot
of enemies come in here didn't give you
any money or anything else but still
starting off and trying to do it one
thing I like is the ability you guys can
just zoom in you guys see a lot in frats
do and what we hear the corny actually
shows you how many frames per second i'm
getting i'm actually filming it and now
i'll stop filming and you see the
framerate shoot up it's locked at 60 but
everything looks good everything plays
good I've had a lot of fun with this
game my system actually is a pretty
decked out system but I'm sure to play
in any system do you guys and see
everything looks really cool I've had so
much fun with this game and five dollars
I've got like eight hours of gameplay so
far and I barely scratched the surface
of this game so I have to say I think
it's well worth the money you get a
whole lot of different things over there
we have a lot submit or laser Tim portal
media cannon the Tesla which we spoke
about earlier i'll go ahead and show you
guys that as we build a Tesla right here
on the screen here's the Tesla being
built so you'll see this right here this
one I built right here slows the guy
down you see this slows him down and
then either Tower shoots him and kicks
his butt slows them down and gets their
butts kicked but anyways I'm going to
jump back into the game defense grid the
awakening the game looks really awesome
it's not the most visually you know
intense thing in the world but it works
on any video card as well graphics
requirements of earlier low and so our
PC requirements and plus I mean really
the great thing let's face this
this game is four dollars and
ninety-nine cents that's right all this
glory all this ass kicking all these
powers all of this great which is
good by the way for five dollars so
me I mean I've bought a lot of games
i've seen if you saw my steam account
you just go holy what you a game
crack addict but no I've just been doing
this forever and ever since steam came
out I really liked the idea so ever
since they've been out I've been buying
my game so there so I mean my list is
pretty substantial but for five bucks i
don't think i've ever purchased a more
fun and cool game the defense grid the
awakening and the cool thing about it as
well is if you want to keep playing
you'll like it they got lots of dlcs for
just a couple more dollars that you can
add to it so at the end of the day I
just want to say to you guys hey check
this out if you liked our defense
strategy and you really like a game that
you can just sit and click your mouse
and up defense grid the
awakening is an awesome way to start and
it's only five dollars and in my opinion
the best five dollars I've ever spent on
steam that all said I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
