noise and those articulate challenge who
behind closed doors we call tech cards
what was love today we're going to the
unboxing first look and general overview
a brand new motherboard for the people
at hey soos one motherboard am I talking
about
it's in this little box back here it's
the e 45 m1 - I now let's go inside and
see what comes in this No
alright folks here it is b25 everyone -
I know alright I'll go back to normal
voices yeah otherwise I don't think I'm
crazy I have a little crazy I'm just a
little crazy there so we're going at the
minimax home entertainment center
motherboard which means that things
geared basically so that you can have
yourself an HTPC that's a very very
small doesn't require a lot of power and
will pretty much fit anywhere because
it's so tiny
that's is the e 45 m1 - I deluxe
motherboard so there's a lot of features
about that we'll talk about those in a
second just show you the back of the box
now and then I know you guys don't like
so much about the box but here if you
guys are interested in purchasing this
I'll show you guys the side of it right
here then if you want to go online and
purchase this anywhere like say Amazon
or something you can go buy it so let's
dig in let's pull this little bad boy
out I guess first of all we should
probably just look at what comes in the
box so here's what comes in the box
already see I'm just kidding all right
so the first thing we're gonna see in
the box we have these two things right
here these are the two antennas they're
gonna connect directly to the
motherboard will show you that part of
the board when we get to it we have the
rear i/o it's padded made for being
silent keeping the noise inside there we
have these SATA cables these are the new
SATA 3 type you can tell by the way
they're made the color coordination then
we have the Asus 845 m1 - I deluxe
user's guide and manual and then finally
we have the CD and a little case badge
in it as well case badge CD so that's
the other content now let's look at the
heart of the matter
let's look at the motherboard itself now
this motherboard is integrated with the
AMD fusion apu e450 dual core onboard
processor with AMD Radeon HD 6320
graphics supports the AMD turbo core
technology I guess this is based off the
Hudson m1 chipset it's the AMD fch 850 m
so let's look at the board let you guys
see it here we have the memory slots it
supports two dens of
maximum eight gigabyte of ddr 1333
megahertz
1066 megahertz non-ecc unbuffered memory
it also is single channel memory
architecture so it's not dual chatter
it's a single channel memory now as far
as expansion slots we can see we have a
single pcie 2.0 x 16 that's right here
we have one two three four five right
here there's five SATA controllers these
are all the six gigabit per second type
and there's one eSATA port as well one
of the main things you're going to
notice about this motherboard beyond
house really small it is you're gonna
notice that it has a completely passive
cooling system it also has heat pipes
going in and out which is going to help
dissipate the heat away from the APU
that's underneath there now here on top
we have an expansion slot for a 3.0
connector also here on the board we can
see there's a debug this little switch
for debugging the board you have a four
pin power connector here 24 pin power
connector here you can see the board is
very simply laid out it's pretty much
basically the passive cooling solution
that's what a major part of this board
is right here next to the memory we can
see the mem okay button pushing this
button will allow the memory to
automatically recalibrate itself so if
you're having a memory problem you push
that button it will automatically set
the memory to what it can work with and
reboot the board so it's a really good
feature to have so now let's take a look
at the rear i/o to the far side we can
see there's two connections and those
are for these antennas do you connect
those two go then we have a legacy
keyboard and mouse connection to USB 2.0
connections digital audio HDMI DVI then
we have additional two USB then eSATA
the LAN port which we talked about
before which is real tech and then we
have two USB 3.0 connections the onboard
audio is also brought by the realtek ALC
892 eight channel high-definition audio
codecs
every means boards gonna be quiet it's
mini-itx
so it's very small features the ef5 bios
here we see the BT to go adapter with
this you can wirelessly connect with a
lot of different devices in your house
and connect them automatically to the
board it's pretty nifty so that's it
folks will close this out just go to
some quick features basically mini ITX
very small all-in-one board costs about
a hundred and eighty dollars but
everything is on board that you need the
only thing you'd have to do with this
board is basically hook up a power
supply to it hook up a hard drive to it
and you've got a complete PC you can be
up and going put it up for your htpc and
for that price it's probably a pretty
good deal so for those who are looking
for something very small but totally
all-in-one the new 45m one - I might
just be the motherboard you're looking
for this was the unboxing and first look
here at Echo tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
