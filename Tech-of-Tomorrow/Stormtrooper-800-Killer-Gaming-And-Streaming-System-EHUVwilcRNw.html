back to the channel you can welcome this
guy back to the channel because I've
been sick with the stomach flu all week
long and it's really been the shit's and
more ways than one I got to say because
I've been sick as a dog but I'm back now
and this time we got another really nice
system for you guys I just want to say
right off the bat this is a suggested
build I'm not saying this is the
cheapest build in the world the best
build in the world I'm not making any of
those claims but I will say this the
Stormtrooper build that I got right here
is pretty damn bad at it's coming to
market at about $800 it's all nice parts
this thing is a beast
it'll stream it'll game it'll do just
about anything you want to do plus the
big thing for me though is I like
systems that look really clean sometimes
I use parts that are a little bit more
expensive sometimes I don't now we did
the last build a lot of you guys made
comments about the power supply and
stuff like that's what I essentially did
is I took most of the parts from that
build bought a new case and a new power
supply and therefore we have the new
stormtrooper here now I got to say this
case is really really awesome
it's from Thermaltake we haven't
actually seen a Thermaltake case in
years but I bought this one and here it
is in our house so let's jump in let's
see what all the parts are inside the
system and why at the end of the day
this system for 800 bucks is very very
badass take a drink let's check it out
so first off let's check out this case
this is the thermal cake Versa c2 - RGB
Snow Edition ATX gaming mid tower case
but the cool things about this case
though are the looks it's elegans inside
of the case it's absolutely completely
beautiful no sharp edges whatsoever
there's also RGB lighting built into the
system so you can change the lighting to
a bunch of different things whatever
suits your build now you can control
these lights right on the top of the
system right next to the restart button
and the power button it comes with a
glass window and just overall for 65
bucks I think this is a really badass
case let me know what you guys think as
far as the power supply goes I'm the
last bill you guys said never sacrifice
on the power supply so I didn't really
want to sacrifice in the power supply
but I didn't want to spend a ton of
money either raising the system price so
for once in my life
I actually bought a used
power supply from Amazon it's an EVGA
600 be 180 plus bronze power supply has
a three year warranty and this thing was
only 38 dollars and there's still some
more to be had so if you're looking for
a great power supply at a great price
check this one out I think it fits this
build perfectly the motherboard is once
again the gigabyte GAA be 350 gaming 3
motherboard obviously for the AMD arisin
that's the way we've been doing things
lately trying to get as many rising
builds out there before you know all the
flash of rising goes away before Vega
gets here and puts in the shadows so
once again we use that motherboard this
motherboard comes the market about 125
bucks it's a really good motherboard and
I gotta be honest with you guys as far
as the overclocking goes it seems like
these boards do just as well as the 370
boards for a much lower price for the
CPU we want the AMD risin 5 1500 X
processor this thing comes with its own
rates fire cooler coming to market about
189 you guys by now know this processor
is great for gaming but it's also great
for streaming and all kinds of different
things at a really good price now the
video cards that I chose some people
might think it's controversial they're
like it's like old school but the RX 40
Red Devil has been a great card we've
done a few builds with it it's a really
solid card unfortunately it's about $269
so it's like the exact same price as
many of the five days we've seen out
there but since I had this card in the
house I decided hey let's just go ahead
and use it
I like this card a lot you guys have
seen we've done many builds with this
card and we've done many reviews of this
card so overall I just think it's a
solid card plus you can find different
forties now out there in the market for
much cheaper I've seen some of these 580
cards sorry I've seen some of these boy
D cards be going for less than $200 now
so if you look around you can definitely
find a price for a 480 that'll beat a
580 let's jump back in now for the
memory we found a nice crucial 8
gigabyte kit ddr4 2133 this memory is 55
bucks for both sticks and even though it
doesn't have heat sinks on it it still
keeps the system within a nice budget
and it still looks pretty cool even
though it's missing those heat sinks
what do you guys think and last but not
least for all your storage we use the
saving twin at rpm Western Digital blue
one terabyte drive this Drive comes to
market at 50 bucks and it's a great
price and a perfect mid-range drive for
building a system of this caliber
all right folks so there is the bill few
things I want to mention as far as doing
cable management between the back plate
and the motherboard it's very very
limited in space but you can see we were
still able to do a totally clean build
with no cable mess anywhere whatsoever
and since we've been listening to you
guys we've stopped using all those
cheap-ass cables and we're constantly
using really nice cables in all of our
builds one thing I want you guys to take
note of though you can build the entire
system without using this cable kit the
cable kit is really just for looks for
something to look pristine but if you're
a gamer and you just want a system
that's going to kick but you don't care
about any of that special wiring you
don't care if it's custard ketchup and
mustard eat a hot dog I guess but you
know if you don't care about that stuff
you can cut this completely out of the
price because the cable kit itself is
about 84 dollars and that's what pushes
the bill right in the overall over the
$800 range but beyond that it's bitchin
it's totally clean you guys can see it's
elegant now let's jump in and let's
check out those performance scores and
see how this bad boy the Stormtrooper
performs will it kill the Rebel Alliance
as far as the tents go you guys can see
that even though this isn't a
liquid-cooled system the CPU is running
really cool and as far as the video
cards go you guys can see that it's only
running at 80 Celsius under full load so
once again this system is running really
cool for what it is alright folks there
you have it the Stormtrooper eight
hundred dollar bill here from tech of
tomorrow now obviously I know that
people can go out there and go to parts
pickering pick nasty cheapest products
they can find throw it on you and go oh
look my system is cheap or honestly I
don't give a I don't if you would
have watched in the very beginning video
I said this is suggestive build you can
change anything around to what you want
so please don't put a link down below
going over here my builds better and
it's $30 less I don't care go do that on
your channel like this is a suggestive
build like I said you can change
anything around in it but you guys can
see though look this thing is really
cool it lights up total RGB it's
beautiful it's a clean build all the
scores are right the temps are right I
mean if you want something though that
is a really solid system that looks
really excellent and still performs
really excellent and you don't have to
worry about any of that water cooling
stuff whatsoever come on man the storm
trooper is pretty cool like always
though I do want to hear your buttons
down below you guys opinions matter to
me as you guys know I listen because I
change the powers pull out listening to
you guys and I kind of direct the
channel according to what meaning to
comments say if I get a comment like 15
times it says hey Laurie this thing is
wrong you got your head up your ass so I
usually pull my head in my ass and then
change the build around to meet with you
guys expect but at the end of the day if
you're looking to build a PC something
like this we'll have all the links to
all these parts down below and plus if
you want to buy use parts which you can
do on Amazon you cut this price even
more and using a used power supply I got
to say it was actually a pretty great
idea a great power supply for a less
than 40 bucks come on there's no losing
with that I'm Miller you guys been
watching Tekken tomorrow I still ain't
my absolute best because I'm just barely
getting over the stomach flu but hey I'm
back and we'll be bringing you more
videos every day as many as we can here
on tech of tomorrow hope you like this
video if you did you know what to do if
you want to be subscribed to channel and
check out what we're doing then hey
subscribe we'll see you back around
Tycho tomorrow for more tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
