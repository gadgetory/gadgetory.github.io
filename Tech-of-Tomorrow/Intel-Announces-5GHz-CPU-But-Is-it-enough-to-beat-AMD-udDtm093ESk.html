Computex 2019 videos today's video is on
what Intel announced and I gotta be
honest with you I think with everything
else going on especially with AMD that
both Nvidia and the Intel launch are
both kind of and just kind of ho-hum at
this point but hey let's check out what
they launched and what they said in any
case so this time intel's launching
their ninth generation Intel Core v Pro
mobile and desktop processors now the V
Pro is a purpose-built platform design
for professional enterprises Intel
showed off knife generation V Pro and
some laptops and even a couple of
monitors yeah Intel also announced 14
new Xeon e processors for entry-level
desktops and mobile workstations and
that's kind of interesting itself
because usually we only see into using
their Xeon processors pretty much in the
server side of things and to see the
Xeon processors now for desktops and for
mobile workstations this could actually
prove to actually be interesting now
these CPUs are gonna feature eight cores
16 threads 5 gigahertz single core turbo
frequency now I don't know if you guys
have ever ran the Windows System test
but if you do overclocking you'll notice
that when your CPU gets over 5 gigahertz
you actually get quite a bit more
performance so I'm wondering now that
Intel's gonna actually have a CPU that's
based cores at 5 gigahertz had a single
core turbo frequency that's gonna be
kind of interesting to see exactly how
that pans out now this system is also
going to support native obtain memory
and these next generation x-series
processors are supposed to come out this
fall now Intel also showed up a couple
of desktop systems with the new x-series
processors as well as the new Asus
Zenbook a laptop that has two screens
for more productivity laptops are
additionally supposed to be pretty light
so having two screens either gonna be
really really heavy or some really small
screens Alienware also announced their
new M 15 and M 17 thin and light laptops
with ninth generation Intel Core
processor
now these things are being tattered as
the fastest thinnest and lightest
notebooks in the world twenty point five
millimeters thin and under five pounds
up to a 240 Hertz display 144 Hertz
options with an OLED display now those
are some seriously badass laptops until
also announced the IEEE 999 hundred KS
processor the world's fastest gaming
processor and five gigahertz with all
turbo cores right out of the box now
that is something that I do think is
pretty exciting even though AMD you know
released a lot of new stuff none of it
was touching on 5 gigahertz so this
should really be something cool for
intel intel had a gamer named dr. Lupo
show off the new processor in a new
fortnight demo on a laptop which looked
pretty good actually
and they also demoed a 3d studio for
streamers with various backgrounds and
effects they could use in real time now
this badass processor will be available
in fall of quarter four of this year
unfortunately though Intel did not
release any prices about this particular
CPU both AMD having a $500 CPU that
looks pretty damn good the competition
is going to be really strict at the end
of 2019 intel also announced that
they'll be releasing Intel's performance
Maximizer and intelligent and automated
overclocking tool which will be
available in June for absolutely free
now according to Intel this overclocking
tool examines the DNA of your processor
and tests every core automatically
setting the most optimal speed to run
your CPU one-click overclocking honestly
it sounds too easy but let's see if it
works
Intel also gave an update on project
Athena which was first announced in the
last CES this is pretty much a vision
for new advanced laptops someday they
may see the light they did however
release the athena 1.0 specification
basically an expectation list for
various categories like performance AI
battery life and more for next
generation laptops which are being
dreamed up in some lab as we speak
lenovo also showed off the yoga s 940
laptop
using athena 1.0 specs yoga that's a
weird name for thing yoga it says like
Yogi Bear anyways it's thin it's super
light and it'll actually be available
this holiday season so maybe you can get
one for Christmas oh-ho-oh Intel also
launched their tenth generation ice Lake
processors 11 new 10 nanometer ice lick
excuse from core i3 all the way to Core
i7 with new CPU architecture and new
generation 11 graphics engine built
inside of them Intel also showed off a
couple of laptops with Gen 11 graphics
from content creating and gaming to
super res which uses AI to fix
resolution in videos and photos and
candy blur a photo in just one click all
this new stuff actually sounds really
cool however a lot of it doesn't have a
release date yet but that pretty much
wraps it up for what Intel released this
year at Computex 2019 personally I
thought it was kind of a ho-hum thing I
mean the CPU that's going to be 5
gigahertz
that's pretty doggone cool but
everything else just seems kind of like
yeah but we'll have to see what happens
and plus it's all not coming till the
end of the year anyway so we've got a
little while to wait I'm Miller you guys
