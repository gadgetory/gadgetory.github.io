in Orange County talking to Justin from
hydro methods about painting these three
cases yes again this is Justin with
hydro methods we're down here in Orange
County in California we're just talking
about the new process that allow us to
do a full custom paint job to a number
of different products one being these
computer cases that we're going to be
doing today we've got a number of
different kind of patterns that we're
going to be doing for these three we've
got a real nice skull pattern we've got
another carbon fiber and we've got one
called a wild bomb over here but we'll
go over down the road and in the video
is more of the process but we've got a
hundred different patterns to choose
from these are just a few select few
that we're going to be rolling with and
I think you're going to enjoy the video
we're gonna start by taking all the
stuff off of here so he could paint it
it means we have to take off all of the
electronics the grill the filter on the
bottom so the paint could stick to just
the case so I'm gonna start taking it
apart right now
all right well we got going on is when
the first step of doing the hydrographic
/ water transfer printing
they're both synonymous and industry the
the most common misconception is that a
hydrographic process is like a rap and
it couldn't be further from the truth a
rap is like a sticker a lot of them are
very detailed and a lot of them look
fantastic and they're different
applications that are best suited for
either process for this the hydrographic
process it is hands down without any
confusion a legitimate custom paint job
with that said the whole process from
going from start to end is identical to
a custom paint job with the exception of
the process where I would usually be
hitting it with an airbrush to get those
custom graphics and the custom design is
what I'm actually dipping it in the tank
and applying that custom image and up
through that process instead however
given that this is a custom paint job we
do always follow the first step in any
paint job and that's with a very
thorough and well prepped piece prepping
is one of the most critical and
important process in the entire step if
you don't do it right or if you half-ass
it it's gonna end up compromising your
piece and the paint and the image isn't
going to hold up to the elements down
the road so it's something you do not
want to have fast you don't want to skip
through you want to make sure you're
thorough and you do it diligently
otherwise it's gonna show in your work
now with any kind of paint job you got
to make sure it's clean fortunately
we're using brand-new pieces so we don't
have to worry about all the dust and the
dirt and the mud being stuck to it
however you always still want to hit it
with so something like a similar to like
a degreaser it's really a solvent that
takes off any kind of like a sticker
residue or oil or any kind of really
strong oil or grease that soap and water
won't typically get rid of and it's a
simple process especially given where
we're at now being it that is brand new
we hit it lightly with with the
degreaser or the solvent excuse me it's
not an actual degreaser but we hit it
with the solvent we wipe it down and
then we hit it quickly with the second
clean rag that way we're not leaving any
kind of formal residue that could
ultimately be left there for the paint
out here - you want a clean bare piece
of product or substrate that you're
going to be actually painting so once
that's done after we hit it with the
solvent then the the next process and
any kind of paint job would be to scuff
it down and different kinds of products
such as plastic metal wood whatever it
may be may require different kind of
scuff and materials this is a plastic
the only thing that's necessary is a
simple gray scotch brite you could do a
real fine piece of sandpaper if you
wanted six to eight hundred would be
fine really the what you're going for is
just giving it a light scuff excuse me
and trying to get rid of the the gloss
of the yellow once you scuff it you'll
see it the finish dole out and it'll be
almost like a matte finish when you see
that dull appearance you'll know that
it's scuffed will enough to continue to
move on to the next part now the reason
why you scuff it is so that you're
building those that that bite for the
paint to adhere to your right now it's
got a real flat and slick finish when
you scuff it it gives it that that extra
bite so that the paint is able to adhere
to it and and withstand those the
longevity of what a paint job needs -
whether it's outside in the elements or
even inside underneath your desk taking
out the elements of kicking it when
you're frustrated or spilling your your
energy drink on it either way that's the
process it is I can't stress enough a
legitimate custom paint job and like any
other paint job prepping is critical and
that's what we're going on next so I'm
gonna go ahead and move forward we're
gonna wipe it down get it cleaned up but
we're gonna get scuffed and we'll move
on
next piece
alright guys just like in any other
paint job this one we finished prepping
everything I wiped everything down with
a nice tack cloth made sure all the dust
is free and that there's nothing in
terms of particles or dirt or dust that
could be on the product at this point
it's time to spray the primer down the
first stage and actually laying down the
paint we're gonna go and lay that down
give me a white primer after that we're
going to proceed with the silver paint
and once we're done with that we're
gonna proceed with the fun part that's
getting the dip going so you'll see me
laying down the primer now we'll we'll
get going on the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
