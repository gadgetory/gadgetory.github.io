ticket amaro youtube channel i know art
fairest your host everybody i know has a
cell phone whether you're a little kid
all the way up to an old person
everybody has a cell phone the only real
difference seems to be how much they use
the cell phone old people they tend
mostly just use the phone for maybe text
and for phone call while the younger
generation tends to use their phone like
a five dollar hooker they know every
feature and they know everything on i
could probably walk up to any
twelve-year-old reza phone and he'll
know more about it than any fifty or six
year old i know there's going to be some
differences in between but generally
that's how it is and we're always
looking to get a better cell phone that
said LG is coming out with something
really cool it's going to feature a new
1.5 gigahertz that's right a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core processor in their
new phone this is the new optimus 4x HD
let's hop in and let's check out this
new phone
LG is getting things started with the
optimus 4x HD inside its NVIDIA Tegra 3
processor is clocked at 1.5 gigahertz
this is really fast it also sits behind
a 4.7 inch 1280 x 720 IPS display that
means it's really really clear the phone
is also going to have an eight
millimeter thin body thankfully this
phone is going to launch with Android
4.3 me and that should sing along quite
nicely on the quad-core chip along with
one gigabytes of RAM and a 16 gigabyte
internal storage capacity it also
features a 2150 milliamp battery to help
with a massive processor and lastly it
has an 8-megapixel camera in the back
and a 1.3 megapixel camera in the front
all in all really cool stuff this thing
should be coming out really soon for all
you fans out there who win two phones
this is something to take a look at so
that's it guys you guys see LG's coming
out with another new fast phone and I'm
sure they're mean a lot others to follow
the biggest thing about this is the
Tegra 3 processor from Nvidia this
quad-core bad boy is so small and it's
actually faster than the very first
processor ever owned on a desktop that
said see you guys back here on tech of
tomorrow for more tech goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
