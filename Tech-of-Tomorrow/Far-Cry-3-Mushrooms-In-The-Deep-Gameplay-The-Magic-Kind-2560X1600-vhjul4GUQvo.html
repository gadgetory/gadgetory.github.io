something different here and today on
techna tomorrow first of all we're going
to bring you guys something really cool
from Far Cry 3 now a lot of you guys
made comments about uploading in 4k and
all these crazy resolutions what most
people don't even have monitors that
support that so even if I could upload
it like that I don't even know if I
really would I was just basically trying
to show you guys the gameplay and I
always try to push it as far as it can
go now today's going to be funny as a
I've got my own camera here that I got
and I thought film the cameramen filming
me so this back here is Jesus play
newark camera and say hi Jesus to all
the lovely fans out there since you guys
never get to see him he's the Mr Cameron
back there oh and for you guys out there
who think that I'm really throwing stuff
at the camera and hurting him Jesus am I
ever really thought he heard in you you
bastard he's lying man I'll get him
after this man in fact meiosis I met him
right now but check it out we're gonna
jump into gameplay now this is far cry 3
and this is a mission that's very very
interesting it's called mushrooms in the
deep and basically you're on this you
know island this crazy doctor he's got
one of the chicks that you're hanging
out with their who's already been kidnap
and escaped she's all messed up and
homeboy tells you that you need to go
out and find yourself some magic
mushrooms that's right the old a magical
kind you'll see exactly what I mean so
if you've ever wanted to know you know
what it was like to you know but it's a
little hippie mon and like trip out on
like the shrooms well this is it man
check it out as a my character here he's
tripping out on shrooms let's go trip
with him
this crazy doctor better know what he's
doing leap of faith
ah

very much myself
long week
studio called I got the role
but the restaurant
I thought we could talk about this like
grown-ups Lisa R in Bangkok together I
can't believe how beautiful Shh
promise that I take care of you
Riley is your little brother he looks up
to you
hey Jake your house
just sharing
dr. Earnhardt
Oh
are you afraid of
great
mushrooms
there they are
so all right what do you guys think I
thought that shit was funny and one
thing really cool about that particular
episode is there's a lot of different
color variation and all kinds of cool
fucking physics shit that's going on
like everywhere I know it's probably not
exactly physx because it's not you know
nvidia base game geared but still you
know what I mean it's all that kind of
physical like stuff going all over in
the game that looks really cool and I
thought that was awesome and this
mission really shows off that stuff a
lot of the other missions just
straight-up you're running around
killing people shooting people I'll
bring you guys some more that in fact
I'm going to bring one that's going to
be really cool it's going to be textures
and water so that'll be pretty
interesting as well so hope you guys
like tripping out with a mr. Jason there
