again with another video of Technology
this time more VGA goodness got this
card right in front of me right here
this is the X FX r9 380 X card for
gigabyte card coming to market about two
hundred and forty nine dollars of kind
of strains positioning its between the
gtx 960 and the gtx 970 being that as
things two hundred and forty nine
dollars but that said though let's do
what you guys like let's do an unboxing
so first of all here's the front of the
box here is the back of the box nothing
too spectacular there it's a box
so we'll go ahead and pop the cap here
and inside we have more box section with
a box inside of a box again like always
pop it up see the contents not too much
in there if that going if the cameraman
once again slamming it smack down
everything is that one with the smacking
so what do you got in here so alright we
have two molex to 6-pin power connectors
so if your power supply doesn't have the
proper ones you have two more two 6-pin
right here you have the warranty card
registration card
you've got the drivers and you've got to
bet this'll always crack up a driver
installation guide to tell you how to
use your CD first take your CD from
package then insert it into the CD
player and follow on-screen directions
that's right and then last but not least
we have a card itself and we'll pop that
out of there I have it's anti-static bag
and there we go so let's jump in and
let's start checking out the card
aesthetically speaking the card is
pretty simple but it's also pretty cool
looking it sports two simple fans in the
front that both have the XFX
nomenclature and if you spin the card
around on the end it continues to have
that nomenclature at the bottom of the
card and as we spin the card to the side
you guys can see part of the cooling
apparatus you can see part of the heat
fins coming through as well as some of
the electronics of the card and as we
spin the card around to its back we can
see there are two 6-pin power connectors
AMD recommends a minimum 650 watt power
supply but XFX themselves says to use an
850 watt power supply according to what
they feel take a look at the topic card
you guys can clearly see all of the heat
pipes and a little bit more the
electricity all underneath that on the
circuit board and
everything's pretty much focused on the
GPU everything's focused to keep that
GPU running cool and the two fans
actually blow across all the electronics
but the main cooling is going to the GPU
all of your heat pipes and all that
stuff and that's being dissipated out of
those heat pipes and then just blown out
away from the car to keep the card
running cool as far as the cards
dimensions go four centimeters it's
twenty three point four by eleven point
five by three point eight one and for
those of us here in the states that's
nine point two one by four point five
three by one point five inches the r9
3dx has four gigabytes of gddr5 memory
with a 256-bit memory interface and the
memory clock speed is clocked at 5700
now as we spin the card around to the
backside I know this for some people
including myself are going to be a
little bit disappointed because there's
no backplate I really love a backplate
on a card it protects it and just makes
the card much better place and really
with no backplate that just to me is
kind of like just an easy way to short
your card out having that backplate to
me is a very important thing I think
many of you people feel the same way hey
leave your comments down below now last
but not least we're gonna take a look
through our EO which features a single
DVID single dvi-i a DisplayPort and an
HDMI connector so that's the card that's
what comes in the box now let's get to
what you guys really want to know how
does this thing do against the
competition let's check that out real
quick before we check out those
benchmark scores let's real quickly take
a look at our test system we've been
using this test system for quite a while
we'll be upgrading it around the first
of the year but this has been pretty
good push so far
all right folks
so those are the scores and how the card
looks and let's talk about some other
stuff as far as power consumption goes
an idol it was doing about 1/12 under
standard operations it was doing about
311 and when was overclocked and stuff
it was doing between like 336 to 338 so
that's not all that bad now as far as
heating temperatures go an idol it was
about 33 and was booming at full blast
it was about 70 degrees Celsius so all
in all it's learning a little bit of a
hot for a card its size now the big
thing that I concerned about about this
card is that it's 249 dollars in the
$249 price range it puts it in a very
weird spectrum with the people at Nvidia
because they have cards that are just
slightly higher but that run a little
bit faster of them you can get a GTX 970
card for just a wee bit more and it runs
a lot faster so that kind of like puts
this card like I said in a really weird
spot now if you're an AMD fan and you
only want an AMD card strictly then this
is something you're going to want to
look at I think however that some of the
8 gigabyte cards the 390 X's in those I
would be more tending to go in those
directions unless you're really trying
to save money I mean this part to me is
ok no offence Nvidia but as far as the
whole market of card goes this is one of
those cards that I have to say in my
opinion just kind of man it's kind of
all right it's kind of there I don't
know if I'd really go out of my way to
buy this card and that's just me but for
people out there who are solid a and B
fans there's absolutely nothing wrong
with this car at all so I don't want
anybody to get a mixed messing thing
there's nothing wrong with this card but
if you're gonna be going for raw
performance and stuff and you're looking
at the numbers and stuff well then it
starts to become a very tough decision
so I know you guys been watching teka
tomorrow and hope you guys like the
style of video I just want to tell you
guys that I am going all the way back to
my roots starting at the beginning of
the year everything will be consolidated
back to here I'm doing my absolute best
to get my health back together and I
know what you guys want you guys don't
want all those other stuff I'm doing you
guys want my PC stuff so it will be
going back to my roots and bringing you
all kinds of crazy PC stuff so stick
around don't give up on me yet I
appreciate you guys being here for more
information you guys are looking to buy
this car do you guys want to find more
information it'll be all down there
below that like button so peace out and
we'll see you guys back here on teka
tomorrow for more tech goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
