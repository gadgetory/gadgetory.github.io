buddy bringing you a secret it's gonna
be the top 5 tech goodies under $100 and
there's something I think you're gonna
think you're going to find a very mmm
strange I'm just telling you right now
it's not my back baby it's not mine it's
not mine I swear it's not mine
let's go on so this top 5 video is going
to be a little bit different than other
ones an AMD fans you're gonna take note
of this because it's a brand new
processor from the people over at AMD
and that's the x4 845 that's right here
this thing's got a 3.5 base clock 3.8
gigahertz turbo clock and the first of
my top 5 things is a motherboard that I
need to build the system with this for
you guys so let's check out that
motherboard it's from gigabyte and it's
pretty cool the AMD x4 845 processor
requires a socket F M 2 plus motherboard
so we chose the ultra durable series
from gigabyte this is the f2 a8 8 X - D
3 HP this motherboard has a lot of
features coming in for under $100 so
we're not the bat this motherboard
series supports the AMD FM 2 plus plus
the FM to a series 8 P use it features
fast USB 3.1 with the USB type-c 4 dims
of dual channel ddr3 memory two-way
crossfire graphics support it also
features the audio noise guard with high
quality audio capacitors has HDMI 1.4
connections and finally this is an ATX
form factor motherboard that sizes in at
thirty point five centimeters by 25
point five centimeters so not only does
this motherboard have quite a bit of
features you guys can see it actually
looks pretty damn cool too so if you're
looking for a board that's not gonna
look in your AMD system it's also gonna
performer you don't have a lot of money
this might just be your a ticket now I
know that there are a ton of Bluetooth
speakers out there there are a lot of
them from A to Z but this one offers
something a little bit different now
this is the M pal armor plus now the
armor plus is cool because it actually
has two eight watt speakers inside of it
so this is a stereo device
all built into this tough case and like
I said it actually has water resistance
to it so if you like spill a drink or
you're out in the rain it's not gonna
ruin this device whatsoever
it's totally Bluetooth compatible so you
can take it on the go with you and click
to whatever smart device that you have
and it's very very durable
now bose has something very similar to
this and this unit sounds pretty much I
think really close and this one it has
way way more balls and way more bass in
the Bose the unit the Bulls unit to me
it's kind of you know kind of clear in
camp it's kind of like yeah this one
actually has some balls to it so if you
looking for something that is like a lot
of powerful a lot of a bass sound to it
you're definitely gonna get that with
the armor plus all the controls are
located simply on the top so it's very
easy to use and operate and it's very
simply connects to any type of device
you have whether its iOS whether it's
Android you can connect it up to your
smart device and take it on the go and
listen to it wherever you're going and
the very fact that this thing is so
durable I don't really think you have to
worry about it getting damaged I mean
it's drop proof it's pretty damn tough I
mean seriously the case on this you guys
have heard like the armored phone cases
well this is pretty much the same thing
it's like having an armored case all on
your little portable little Bluetooth
speaker so if you're looking for
something that's really tough that
sounds as good if I don't know my
personal opinion I like more bassy than
just as Bose not a big boast as you can
tell then I would check this one out
it's under a hundred bucks it's tough
it's durable but truly the best feature
probably about the armor plus in my
opinion is the fact that it's battery
lasts almost an entire friggin day the
5200 milliamp battery Nair last 22 hours
of uninterrupted playtime that's right
22 hours so you can go for almost a full
freaking day without having to charge
this that means you can be on the go for
quite a long time before you got to
recharge this bad boy yep
the armor plus also works up to 30 feet
away from whatever smart device you're
using to connect it to hey it's the
armor plus by empath this next product
is something that I definitely think
that any person out there who owns a car
or vehicle can definitely use as a
product by fixing and this is a portable
battery jumper so what that means if
you're out somewhere
no or no or land and your battery takes
a crap and you need to jump and you
can't find anybody else to help you
that's when this thing comes in handy
the fixing is not only an auto car
battery jump starter it also has a built
in flashlight and a dual USB charging
port and safety protection for your
truck van or SUV
the most important feature however about
this product is that you're able to
jumpstart you to your gas or turbo
diesel engine around 20 times and you
can do this with 500 amps of beat
current it also works with motorcycles
motor boats and snowmobiles the fixing
also doubles as a power bank and as an
internal built-in thirteen thousand six
hundred milliamp hour battery and this
is used to useless USB ports so you can
charge your phone smart device or
anything you want while you're on the go
you don't have to worry about your
safety or getting hurt either because
the alligator clamps feature overcurrent
protection short-circuit protection over
voltage protection and overcharge
protection this also protects your
devices and your car from getting
damaged the fixing also has a backlit
LCD screen and it features main switch
controlling which reduces the drain of
the current and prolongs the lifespan of
the unit the flashlight features an
ultra bright LED light with SOS and
strobe light modes so when you wrap it
all up you get the jump starter 12-volt
battery clamps 12 volt car charger 15
volt wall charger USB charging cable
laptop connectors kit laptop converter
power cable storage base and the users
manual the fixing is also very very
portable as you guys can see and it
comes with a two-year warranty so all in
all I think is a pretty cool product
this one I want to know what you guys
have to say about it let me see your
comments down below but overall I think
this is a really really handy and
definitely something you can use in your
life if you have any type of vehicle
whether it's a snowmobile car truck
whatever if you are a gamer that means
you want the absolute best headphones
that you can put on your head now these
are the sound Buster xh5
professional-level gaming headphones and
these things are built to rock they are
solidly built totally adjustable killer
a killer bass I have to say they also
come the detachable microphone so
instead of having the mic have to always
be in your face if you're just playing
you don't need to talk or anything like
that or play you know on one of those
multiplayer games you're talking to
people or you know answering your phone
or whatever then you do not need to use
this you can remove it but if you need
to use it you just simply come on in and
smack it in there and away you go now
these things are extremely comfortable
like I said they fit very snugly and the
ear cups I gotta say are like butter on
your ears these ear cups are just
amazingly comfortable and you can wear
these things for hours
these things are lightweight they're
comfortable the band doesn't even really
feel like it's on your head whatsoever
the mice completely adjustable once you
connect it so you can get it like right
up to where you need to be so that
everybody can hear you while you're
talking through it now what you can't
see is that inside each of these cups
and powering your sound are a pair of 50
millimeter neodymium drivers and this
makes great bass and really clear sound
quality the h5s will also not only work
with your PC they'll work with a Mac ps4
and the Xbox one but you have to get a
headset adapter to use it with that they
have a frequency response from 20 Hertz
to 20 kilohertz the impedance is 32 ohms
the sensitivity is 118 DB and a milla
wat at 1 kilohertz the h5s also include
the award-winning proprietary sound
blaster x acoustic engine life audio
profile software suite dan was that a
mouthful and like I said they feature a
lightweight and durable frame with
memory foam ear cushions for the
ultimate comfort during long gaming
sessions the sound blaster xh5 s also
come with 2 different types of audio
connectors your standard audio connector
and then one that you can use to adjust
all your sound your audio and your
microphone so pretty much everything is
included inside the box and these things
come to market under under bucks so if
you're looking for a pair of cans that's
totally designed for the professional
game room the h5s might be what you're
looking for right let's see your
comments and last but not least we have
the Hydra smart bottle hail Hydra now
the Hydra smart bottle is more than just
a BPA free water bottle it's actually a
Bluetooth speaker with speaker phones it
also features a four thousand milliamp
power bank charger multicolor LED light
and it features a free Android and
iPhone
which I think most things do these days
I've never hurt anybody charging for a
nap inside the Hydra smart bottle you
can store 20 ounces of BPA free water
you can also listen to audio via the
premium 5 watt Bluetooth speaker and the
built-in microphone turns your Hydra
into a hands-free speakerphone as well
and in case you have an emergency the
Hydra smart bottle also doubles as a
bright flashing red emergency light a
standard white laner and a multicolored
cycle option is there as well and
there's also a four thousand milliamp
ultra safe polymer power bank built
inside what charged at 2.1 amps through
the USB output now I got to be honest
with you as soon as I saw this the first
thing I thought of was Austin Powers now
me you guys were out there with me
remember this you know Austin Powers
comes in he's all pissed on my back baby
I don't belong to me well you know damn
well Austin Powers was using this too so
you guys have to know it leave a comment
down below but this is pretty much it
man like I said this thing is not only a
water bottle it's a portable music thing
which you can connect via any of your
smart devices like we said you know any
Android iOS typical and it's really
weird they push that they give you free
software because I think any app for any
device is usually free it's you do not
buy my thing and then pay five bucks for
the app you'll be like but anyways it's
free so you want something that you can
take on the go store your water in
listen your speaker charge your USB
device your headphone sub-8 so you could
be on the run listening you this thing
hey listen to this you can run down the
road drinking your water on an exercise
listening this is your listening device
and then you you have your smartphone
with you and it starts dying so you
can't listen your music so all of a
sudden use the built-in power pack and
you charge your phone in Europe and
going once again yada-yada
alright tickers so there you go the top
