teka tomorrow and as many of you are
aware the newest Call of Duty just got
released and while the series doesn't
have the best history with its PC
versions this one does look - thankfully
finally be a graphical leap from
previous games so we want to give you
guys a little idea of how it runs on
different settings at 1080p resolution
now the game doesn't offer any preset
graphics options so we had to come up
with our own custom tech up tomorrow
settings which we've labeled as low
medium high and extreme and you can find
those settings linked down below in the
description if you want the specifics as
well as the system are running it on the
core of which consists of an i7 4770k
and a GTX 780 so without wasting any
more of your time let's check out that
gameplay in benchmarks cue the
benchmarks off
well there you guys have it call of duty
advanced warfare running at four
different settings and obviously not the
most optimized game for PC as is the
series history definitely still some
clear favoritism for the console version
but we know a lot of you guys out there
still want to grab that game on PC and
want to give you a general idea of how
it would run on your system now once
again if you want to see the specifics
on what settings we used and the system
we ran it on we do have those linked
down below as well as a way to follow me
on Twitter and links to other projects
we've been working on with this game
including my day 1 impressions as always
if you guys enjoyed watching this video
please make sure to sure you can that
like button to let us know as well as
subscribe to stay up to date on all
future content I'll be seeing guys again
soon but until then I'm Kevin Kenson
