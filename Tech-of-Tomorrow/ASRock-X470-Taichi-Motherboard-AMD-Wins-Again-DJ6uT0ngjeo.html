you guys back here on the channel today
we're gonna be taking a look at a very
nice AMD motherboard and the people over
at ass rock this is the x4 70
Taichi let's jump in let's check this
board out so obviously first off we're
going to take a look at the box use the
from the box not a lot to it however on
the back of the box though there are a
lot of different features we'll be
talking about all these different
features as we check out the motherboard
like I said this motherboard is the x4
70 it's going to support all of the
latest AMD CPUs with that said though
let's go ahead and let's just start
seeing what actually comes inside the
box I'm gonna go ahead and just pop the
top cap here go ahead and take the
motherboard out of a giant sized box
flip it around once again see the ass
rock nomenclature on there go ahead and
pop the cap again so starting off on the
top we're going to have all of the
different stuff that comes in the
motherboard so I'm gonna go ahead and
remove all of this stuff out of the box
first take all this stuff out of the box
so and you first unbox everything in the
box figure thing out of the bubble
now the box is empty as you can see I'll
set that off to the side here's the
motherboard and here are all the
accessories now there are quite a bit of
accessories so first up we have a
software setup guide next up we have a
quick installation guide this is gonna
have all the different information about
your motherboard all of its features
everything you're gonna want to know
about the motherboard is pretty much
gonna be in this book I'm glad I kind of
open it up right there cuz there's
actually some stuff be between the pages
now these little screws right here or
one screw this is for connecting the M
to SATA and there are 2 m 2 SATA slots
in this board and there are two screws
to go ahead and put those in there
and we'll get that part later you'll
notice that the M 2 s are also covered
so they have a heatsink on top of them
now this is kind of interesting this
looks like a postcard
so if you want to send someone a
postcard you go hey man my motherboard
is better than the years well here's a
postcard to do it you know next step we
have to BNC antennas this is for the a
pong board Intel Wireless and actually
the Wireless is pretty interesting
because it actually doubles as a two
point four five gigahertz Wireless and
it's Bluetooth as well here is the SLI
on this particular bracket only works on
the 1080 and 1070 motherboards it won't
work on I mean excuse me the 1070 and
and 1080 video cards rather excuse me
it's not gonna work on the newer cards
so we'll set that out there we've got a
total of eight SATA cables and you'll
see on the motherboard there's actually
eight SATA headers as well we have the
rear i/o we have a little system case
bed if you get that in there a little
system case badge and then the driver CD
and that's all that stuff that's the
contents they come beyond the
motherboard go ahead I'm going to take
the motherboard out of its protective
packaging now so now the way of the
motherboard Abbot's package you guys can
see there's a lot of room on this
motherboard lots of room around the CPU
for using aftermarket coolers and all
that type of stuff now starting at the
top of the board underneath here you
can't see it but this is an XXL aluminum
alloy heatsink now underneath the shroud
and by the way this shroud is called IO
armors to protect your IO here in the
back right here now underneath that
there's a premium sixty eight power
choke there's also a premium memory
alloy choke features a dual stack MOSFET
Nietzsche con 12 K black caps this is
actually going to make the motherboard
run for a long time all these black caps
are lined up right along here you can
see those would also have Mitchell con
caps in the auto we'll get to the audio
as well we'll get to that a lot of the
stuff you just can't see another
interesting thing about this motherboard
is it's a matte black PCB and the design
of the motherboard is very different as
well it features a high density glass
fabric PCB and two
of copper now you guys are going okay
lark what the heck is a high density
glass fabric PCB well what it means is
that everything on the motherboard is
denser and closer together and this
helps to keep away from electrical
shortages I'm just like on your monitor
the more didn't you know dense the pixel
the better the picture the same thing
with them with the motherboard in the
PCB the more dense everything is the
better that it's going to run I'm gonna
go ahead and just take the motherboard
I have us a little thing here I'm gonna
go ahead and just sit it out right here
so let's start off the very top of the
motherboard on the top of the
motherboard on the left hand side you
guys can see are the two power
connectors is a single eight pin a
single four pin there are also five
different headers for different types of
fans and there's actually even a
connector if you want to hook up a water
pump now you can see this shroud right
on top the shroud completely covers this
this particular part is there I of
protection
this right here is their digi phase
control this has a 16 phase power design
so this will actually keep all the power
running to your motherboard without
problems the particular socket here this
is the am for socket it supports all of
the current AMD CPUs that are on the
market this includes the pinnacle ridge
CPUs the summit ridge CPUs and the Raven
Ridge CPUs now right to the left of that
is the memory now this is dual channel
ddr3 memory now what's interesting about
this is depending on what CPU use it
actually has different support for the
memory now right behind the memory you
guys are going to see the 24 pin power
connector that's the last of the power
connectors now as far as the five fan
header connections go
there's one right next to the top where
the first two power connectors are there
are two more up at the top of the board
there's a single one to the right of the
memory and there's also another one
right here below the CPU and right here
below the CPU is also where the
connector is if you're going to be
hooking up water cooling or using a
water pump another thing that's
interesting about this motherboard is
you actually have a Type C connection on
the motherboard right below the ddr4
memory next up underneath the CPU you're
going to see the first of the m2 SATA
connections this supports the latest
Intel
now there's one here on top and there's
another here on the bottom now
underneath that are the first two of the
PCI slots now these particular PCI slots
both have steel around them so they're
going to be very strong stuff you put a
video card and that's really kind of
heavy this is going to help eliminate
the sag that you see in a card between
these two you're gonna see a PCIe 1x
you're gonna see another PCI 1 X down
here at the bottom there's also another
PCI Express this is called the PCI 5
slot now if you use this particular slot
on its own it's a 16 X but when you're
using this particular slot it actually
disables the m2 above it so you might
want to take that into consideration if
you plan on using both slots now 2 left
of the PCI slots this is all of your
audio right here now this is 7.1 channel
HD audio and it also has content
protection this is the realtek ALC 1220
I do codec now this features premium
blu-ray audio support it has surge
protection
it supports purity sound 4 it has
nichkhun fine gold series audio caps 120
DB signal-to-noise ratio has a really
premium built-in headphone amplifier so
don't have to worry about buying a
separate headphone amplifier to listen
to your headphones
it has PCB isolates the shielding so you
know that none of the electricity from
the motherboard is actually going to get
into the sound this is actually a pretty
cool feature and hopefully this sounds
is good at to my ears as it sounds on
paper another thing I need to mention is
that there are 15 gold contacts on the
DIMM slots on the PCI slots and there's
also gold connections on the audio on
the other side of the motherboard you're
going to notice that there are eight
different SATA connectors and these SATA
connectors are actually different six of
them are all supported by the
motherboard chipset and two of them are
supported by the as media ASM 1061 now
the six Sata's that are by the chipset
these support raid 0 raid 1 raid 10 ncq
8ci and it does have hot plug
availability the other chipset supports
ncq HCI
and it also has the hot plug feature
now another thing about the storage of
this motherboard this particular
motherboard does feature AMD store and
my technology if you're unfamiliar with
this what this particular software does
is it allows your standard hard drive to
run it almost the same speeds as an SSD
so you get much better transfer rates
much faster everything all the way
across the board using this technology
and it's also something exclusive to AMD
motherboard now the motherboard actually
lights up in three different places next
to the Taichi gears next to the audio
and next to the i/o shield and all this
can be controlled like I said through
the PI chrome sync software and the RGB
lighting actually comes with some
pre-installed settings such as static
breathing and that type of stuff so you
can change it to actually match whatever
style you prefer now at the very bottom
of the motherboard you're going to
notice here's where all your case wiring
gets hooked up next to here you're going
to see the post LED this will light up
and tell you if there's a problem with
your motherboard starting up so you can
diagnose it and fix the problem and
something that's actually interesting
down here there's also two different
headers for the RGB lighting one of them
is addressable so this means you can
actually hook up another set of LED
lights and still control them all from
the motherboard software now checking
out the rear i/o we'll start off on the
left-hand side you can see there are two
BNC connectors this is toward the
built-in wireless LAN
it supports 2.4 gigahertz 5 gigahertz
and also doubles as Bluetooth
connectivity next to that we see a ps2
port 2 standard USB 3.0 ports below that
next to that we see the reset button now
next up as an HDMI port this can be used
with your CPU so if your CPU has onboard
graphics you can use this connection to
hook up to your monitor next up we see
the Intel and below that 2 more of the
USB 3.0 connectors next to that there
are two more USB 3.0 connectors the next
of that is something actually
interesting this is a type A and a Type
C USB connection this is something kind
of interesting so
what kind of USB device you have you'll
be able to fit up to this motherboard
now last but not least we see the audio
now the audio feature is a spit of
connector it also features 7.1 like I
said and all the connectors you can't
see them but these are all gold-plated
to ensure the best connectivity alright
Tech fans so there you have it the
asrock x4 70 Taichi now not only does
this motherboard look good you have to
admit this is a very clean design all
the new features that have been
implemented in this motherboard make it
a very high quality product it's coming
to market of about two hundred and nine
dollars but like I said two ounces of
copper and the PCB features a whole new
different PCB design that's much denser
the slots for your video cards both have
steel inside of them so if you're using
a bigger video card you have to worry
about them flopping over all of your
support for your audio is really really
nice you get 7.1 you got mystic on caps
neat Yukon comes with saying that right
you have been here on the audio you have
them up here so you know your
motherboard is going to last a good long
time as far as the memory goes depending
on what CPU you're using like I said you
can even use some ECC memory depending
on what CPU you're using so that's
actually pretty cool
the designs nice the price is nice next
up is for us to build a system see how
all that cool RGB lighting works with
all the sophomore and just see overall
Albert's motherboard works I mark you
guys been watching Tekken 2 mark you
guys want to get more information about
this particular motherboard we'll have
that down below so you click that link
if you want to buy one for yourself or
just check out more information you can
do that also if you like what you see in
the channel and you'd like to be sub
thing we'd love to have you here as part
of the family I'm mark thanks for
watching we'll see you guys back here
for more tech on Tekken tomorrow
