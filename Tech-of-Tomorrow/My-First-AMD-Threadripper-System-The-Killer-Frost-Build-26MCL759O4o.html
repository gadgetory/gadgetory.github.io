on tech tomorrow we try to bring you
guys at least one custom build and
that's right during the holiday season
we're about to bring you another one and
this is our very first thread Ripper
system that we've ever built but it's
absolutely incredible I mean this thing
looks good it's very fast
it's totally quiet and overall just one
of the nicest systems that we've ever
done here at Tech and tomorrow and all
the parts inside of it are extremely
high quality parts and you guys just
have to admit this thing is just
beautiful also I'm a big fan of like the
Green Arrow and all those DC people so
this bill is called the killer frost
because it's going to kill your wallet
but it runs really frosty
inside the killer frost are a lot of
high quality components from the case to
the video card to the memory everything
is pretty much top-of-the-line
now for the case we went for the Corsair
crystal series 5 70 X RGB case now this
thing's got a whole lot of nice features
tempered glass and few folks out there
with RGB hey it's all built in the case
gigabyte was totally cool enough to kick
us down annex 399 designer e^x
motherboard now this is X 399 this is a
very very expensive motherboard it's
kind of why we use the name killer frost
for one thing it's gonna kill your
wallet and it runs pretty frosty being
that this is my very first thread Ripper
system I went with the AMD thread Ripper
1900 X and this is an 8 core 16 thread
CPU it's made for pretty much doing
absolutely anything you want content
creation gaming streaming anything you
want can be done with this processor
it's very powerful and it's not really
the most expensive processor in the
world though because it only comes to
market about five hundred and forty nine
dollars so for a high-end system it's
still not too overly overpriced before
we did this build I had read online that
a lot of the CPU coolers out there would
not really cool the thread over CPU
optimally well of course our Hydra
series 81:5 I it worked absolutely
perfect and at the end will show you how
cool this system runs even under full
load one thing I really wanted to do
with this build is try to stick as much
AMD inside of the computer as I can and
we all know that the AMD Radeon rx Vegas
64 cards they are a fortune now
unfortunately the model that we're using
it's the power color red devil it's not
currently available at least I'm not
able to find an online anywhere for sale
we'll have a link down below for a
substitute card but this red devil card
is really amazing and they're known for
overclocking they're known for running
cool and being absolutely pretty much
the fastest rx Vegas 64 is you can get
your hands on for the boot drive we're
using the Corsair Neutron series NX 500
400 gigabyte PCIe SSD now this thing is
incredibly fast so for transferring your
files editing doing all that stuff it's
going to be one of the fastest things
you can get your hands on
for the storage drive we want the
seagate constellation es series drive
that's a 2 terabyte drive with 7200 rpm
64 megabytes of cache and actually one
of the more affordable parts in this
system
one thing about AMD boards and memory is
a lot of the boards that are out there
you can't get the true speed of the
memory without doing some overclocking
and some voltage adjustments well the
memory that we use actually right off
the bat is 3200 megahertz and as soon as
I installed in the gigabyte board hit
the XMP profile it ran with that
automatically with no weird stuff like
old revolting or anything else now this
is a g.skill 32 gigabyte trident z kit
there's actually 4 8 gigabyte sticks in
the kit it's ddr4 and like I said 30
Twitter megahertz right out of the box
with no adjustments but here's where
you're going to a brick this memory
is almost 700 bucks yep I said it
powering the killer frost is the corsair
rm7 50x power supply now it's 80 plus
gold certified and 750 watts which was
actually perfect for this system inside
this build you guys can see that we used
a lot of fans there are two in the front
one in the back now these particular
fans are the corsair ml1 40 pro fans
these only light up white but they
feature magnetic levitation if you don't
know what this means it pretty much
makes your fans completely silent even
when they're running almost full blast
and the three fans on top are the
corsair ll series the ll 140 RGB now
these are 140 millimeter dual light loop
fans and they're absolutely quiet and
you can get these fans in a 2-pack for
under 100 bucks you guys can see that
the cable management in this system has
to be really good because obviously you
can see everything inside of it and that
can be a real pain in the ass to get
perfect but anthony was able to achieve
that no problem you guys can see that
everything inside here is totally clean
and the fans are all set right we have
two intake fans in the front and a
single fan in the back for exhaust now
that we've seen what makes the killer
frost such a killer system let's check
out those benchmarks
you guys can see that the thread Ripper
CPU handles everything without a problem
and one of the really nice things about
this system like I said before is it is
totally quiet and the temperatures you
can see that the thread Ripper CPU never
got over 59 Celsius even under full load
and the Red Devil video card even though
that sounds really hot never got over 68
Celsius I was really really excited
about doing our very first thread Ripper
build I think it came out really
excellent obviously the price on a lot
of these parts are over the top but like
usually you know the case in the design
of all that is really the look of the
system the motherboard yeah it looks
absolutely great but I mean you could
probably find one that was a little bit
lower price I don't know if I'd have the
same quality of some of the board
because this motherboard really kicks
ass but you could probably do that at
the end of the day this system you could
probably build it around this you can
find good prices probably for about
$3,000 unfortunately the video card the
one that we have inside the system it's
actually not out for sale right now I'm
sure it will be soon but overall this
thing just looks clean like I said
before it to me it's kind of like art
and industry all in one system
everything on it runs nice it runs quiet
it's beautiful I mean other than the
fact that it's really expensive there's
nothing to really complain about about
the system now for you guys who follow
the channel we've got some cool
coming up on the 14th of December we're
going to begin the 12 days of Christmas
that's right so from every day from that
day till Christmas day we're gonna be
giving stuff to you and yes it's
international but I want to be clear
upfront if you're an international
winner we're not gonna give you like
stuff and ship it to you International
shipping right now has gone up so much
that I haven't even been able to ship
the last prize to my buddy Carlo I mean
that's how expensive it is for you guys
over there I'm gonna give you guys
triple-a game tiles that's right
not cheap games really really good games
and the latest games that are out so for
you people out there who are
international instead of just cutting
you guys out of the picture I'm gonna
keep you guys in the picture but it will
be just high-end games but come on a lot
of these games are 60 bucks so it's like
a 60 buck Christmas gift so really no
need to complain we'll start this
contest up on the 14th we'll have a
video about it I hope to see you guys on
it I like to use Twitter I know a lot of
people said to use this gleen thing or
whatever but I prefer to use Twitter
because I'm going to tell you this a lot
of people said oh you know the people
that are gonna be in there aren't going
to be your fans well I go through every
single one of the people that are in
there and make sure that they actually
have been following us on Twitter and
are actually one of my audience and I
feel that using Twitter is just more
personal because for one thing I can
reach out to you I can send you a
message we can talk it's much much
easier trying to get stuff away here on
YouTube it's next to insane you guys see
I have over half a million subscribers
so just imagine if I had your pic to a
half a million people to pick a winner
that even programming to the computer to
get a random number would be a nightmare
I have to hire a full time crew to work
for a month to do it so doing it through
Twitter is much better for you guys as
well and also if you'd like to see some
stuff on Facebook again let me know down
below and hey I can do something on
Facebook as well right the more the
merrier
it is the holidays so Happy Holidays to
all you folks I know there's a bunch of
different religions and stuff to me it's
just a great time to spend with your
family try to be happy and I know there
are some people and you know I'm not
gonna make many names some of my friends
lately at the lib overseeding stuff
things are so bad there that suicide
just seems to be going up so if you're
feeling really bad on the holidays and
feeling lonely reach out man
I'm on facebook I'm on Twitter I can
talk to you anytime you want like usual
all the parts that we used in this
system except for the video card
obviously will be down below that like
button so I hope you guys liked this
video I thank you for following the
channel next year we have all new stuff
coming brand new website it's just been
finished we're just plugging in all
plugins I got to write a bunch of
reviews again obviously to get up
on there and that we have a brand new
forum so coming in 2018 Tekken tomorrow
is getting a whole new look whole new
makeover and we're going to change up
our style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
