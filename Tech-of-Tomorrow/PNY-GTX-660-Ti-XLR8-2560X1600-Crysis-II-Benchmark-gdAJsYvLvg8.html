excited because we've got the new 60 TI
from PNY over in the test station and

benchmark so when we're going to do
right now is crisis to always a popular
amongst everybody out there so let's

it's freaking time anyways hey check it
out you guys saw that cards pump it out
now it's only at 29.1 is the average
frames per seconds on this but remember
once again the 60 TTI is really only
geared for a market of 1920 x 1200 or
1920 x 1080 that's what you know and he
claimed in their reference call audited
stuff so that's about it it runs good
though it still plays and with
resolution of 1920 x 1080 or 920 x 1200
