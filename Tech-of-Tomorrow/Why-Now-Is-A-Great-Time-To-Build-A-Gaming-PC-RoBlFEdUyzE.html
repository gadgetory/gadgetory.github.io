gaming PC because let's just face it in
2018 there was a lot of shinik happening
that would definitely deter a person
from going out and buying themselves a
gaming PC that is for sure
but real quick Before we jump in and
I'll let you know why right now is
actually a really great time to build a
gaming PC let's hear a word from today's
sponsor are you looking for the absolute
best way to manage and control the
password for your iPhone or iPad device
if you are you should try I scoffs
unlock tool it helps you unlock your
iPhone or iPad in just minutes no matter
what the passcode touch ID or face ID I
sky soft unlock can easily remove it
it's fully compatible with iOS 12 and
the iPhone XS so if you're looking for
the best way to control your passcode
for your iPhone or iPad device check out
the link in the description below and
give I sky soft unlock tool a try so
alright now that that's out of the way
let's talk about why right now is a
really good time to build yourself a
gaming PC first of all let's talk about
video card prices right now we all know
that Nvidia is released all their new
r-tx stuff it's SuperDuper expensive but
check it out all of the last generation
cards you can find used for unbelievably
cheap even cheaper than the stuff that
we found today for you guys and you guys
can buy you stuff use video cards for
really an unbelievably low price right
now because right now there's no mining
going on there's nothing right now
that's taking you know gaming video
cards away from the gamers what's where
that's where they're supposed to be
they're supposed to be in the gamers
hands are not supposed to be in miners
hands making my to buy stuff with
digital currency no they're supposed to
be in your computer playing games having
fun and making your life interesting so
you don't feel like jumping off a bridge
or going crazy right exactly we talking
about playing PC games keeps us sane you
go on your game you blow
shit up you have fun you go around your
shoot stuff up you blow stuff up or
whatever your thing is you chase around
in a dungeon no matter what PC gaming
any act gaming actually takes your mind
off the stress of normal life you get in
there and you have your fun and escape
that stuff and not being able to buy a
gaming PC because video cards are so
off-the-hook expensive which was what
they were through most of 2018 because
of all the mining craze we saw video
cards selling for three to four times
what their face value was and that just
absolutely totally stunk
because it made it so people couldn't
really buy a game PC you could get all
the rest of the parts and when memory
price were really high last year it made
buying memory high as well but right now
right now things are really cheap
especially if you're going for last
generation I mean you know in all cases
when you want to buy the stuff that's
like right now the most hit best most
expensive like stuff that's gonna be the
really really new stuff but you don't
really need that anyways you may think
you do but you really don't you can get
a very nice video card rx 580 honestly
to me right now and the GTX 1060 those
two cards in my opinion are two of the
best cards right now for entry level
gaming both those cards are right about
the $200 level which is a very fair
price and if you're doing only 1080p
gaming hey you are good to go
both these cards will play your games
they'll play a lot of the games at
really nice settings and still look good
honestly and now that we've just talked
another video we now say that even if
you have an Nvidia card that you can use
a free sync monitor so it really doesn't
matter if you're a free sync matter who
you buy anymore you know what cards you
buy you can still be using all that
technology which is really really cool
just make sure that you're using the
DisplayPort cable because it's not
supported by HDMI also CPUs last
generation really really inexpensive
memories come down in price we've
configured a few systems for you guys
just using Amazon
they're from like 600 to 700 dollars and
you can change the parts around as you
like these are just starting levels you
could use a little bit less and make it
even cheaper or you could use a little
bit more and you can make it like a
9-under or $1000 system but you guys can
just get an idea of right now how cheap
stuff really is to put together a really
good entry level gaming system I mean it
really is not hard right now at all so
if you're thinking you know hey I've
really been wanting to build a gaming
system and I've been waiting for the
time to be right now is a very good good
time a seriously good time like I said
we've configured these systems and if
you're willing to go and deal with eBay
or knew these other places and buy used
parts and wrists and roll the dice I'm
sure that you could build a PC for way
less than even this it really comes down
to how many hoops you're willing to go
through I start thinking about this
yesterday because if I really really
wanted to be the ultimate ultimate
cheap-ass to buy my PC Parts I would
literally have to drive over to Micro
Center make sure I bought probably my
motherboard my CPU and memory probably
from those guys because they usually
have the absolute best price I'd have to
drive over there like 20 miles away I
have to eat the gas the time all that
stuff now that's for the cheapest price
or I can probably pay 25 or $30 more
just click the button on Amazon or
somewhere else and get it you know I
mean it all depends on how many hoops
you're willing to go through if you're
willing to go through all this stuff you
can find cheaper parts buying some at
new way buying some from micro Center or
you can simply go online and click a
button but even going online and
clicking a button right now you can
still find serious deals on stuff and
get really good systems for a low price
we all know that 4k gaming yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah whatever some people
claim that you came and really see it in
4k and it's just a complete waste of
time
honestly I've never really noticed that
much of any greatness and watching a
game in 4k if I'm playing it in 1440 or
1080p and then I switch it into 4k it to
me a lot of times it just seems like
things just get a little bit denser and
you know maybe it's a little bit clearer
but is it really worth trying to pay all
this money just
trying to achieve 4k gaming when you can
spend way less money build yourself a
system that will play 1080p games and
just go crazy it you know you can get a
really great monitor 144 Hertz I mean
you can either get a free sync monitor
which is way cheaper and price if you
want to get a free sync to mana they're
a little bit more because they're a
hardware based solution we all know
g-sync monitors are like way overpriced
and obviously in some ways now that
Nvidia is admitting you know that they
can actually support a free sync monitor
I really don't know how G Singh sales
will do although I will say that you
know juicing using the X 27 predator
monitor everything looks the best it is
the best gaming monitor I've ever used
but it's $2,000 and talking about
monitors even right now I've seen a
27-inch monitor 144 Hertz super low
latency super fast response times 120
hundred and thirty dollars now so let's
just face it you go in you buy yourself
a system power six hundred bucks you
spend like a hundred bucks on a monitor
you buy one of those keys on online from
SCDP or somebody else and you get your
Windows key you can have your whole
system Mouse and everything else and if
you have like even a nine hundred dollar
budget you can get speakers everything
and be completely set up for your gaming
PC and that's why I feel that right now
is a really great time to build yourself
a gaming PC because monitors are cheap
peripherals are cheap GPUs are cheap and
let's just face it we just left the
Christmas season we left Black Friday
Cyber Monday all that craps in the past
so all that stock that people had that
didn't sell well guess what there's new
products coming out from AMD we're gonna
obviously see new products from Nvidia
this year and that just gonna further
drive the products of the other stuff
down lower and lower and lower making it
more affordable for both you and for me
we'll have links down below to all these
different parts for these systems take a
look at them because I think they're
actually pretty decent systems you guys
can change stuff around inside the
configurator on Amazon but you can see
that on Amazon you can build yourself a
really nice system and they have a great
warranty they ship everything like
really fine
second day if you got an Amazon account
so that's why we're you know using the
Amazon thing plus if you guys do buy
stuff through Amazon it helps support
the channel it helps keep me in business
and helps me keep bringing these videos
to you guys on the table if you're not
subbed a please do so I would always
appreciate it we'll have links to my
music down below we'll also have new
musical versions of the new benchmark
songs out available very soon so you
guys can be able to purchase those as
well but for now everything really is
just down below there the system the
links all that good stuff if you don't
have your notifications turned on make
sure you do we also have patreon going
on we always have different stuff going
on patreon different giveaways and stuff
like that I'll always appreciate your
support peace love you see you guys back
in the channel for more tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
