plus alright glad to see you guys here
once again on tech of tomorrow so what's
on the plate today well you guys all
know that AMD has released their 290x
but the card that originally came out
had their stock cooling it was kind of
iffy on overclocking and stuff due to
its heat and how loud it was well now
we're going to see the next generation
of cards begin to come out and we have
our hands on the latest gigabyte
windforce edition that's right so this
is a win for sedition features their
triangle cooling it's the 49 50 watt
version this thing's tricked out over
clocked out of the box and geared to be
for an enthusiast who wants performance
so with that said let's take a look at
the box and what's inside of it and see
what's in store for you with gigabytes
latest entry into the 290x market
alright folks so here we have it the Box
in its normal little square form factor
here gigabyte windforce 450 watt out OC
guru to radeon r9 290x with 4 gigabytes
of gddr5 so you know it's going to be
really fast on the side of the box just
shows you basically it does AMD
eyefinity 4 gigs 512 bit memory
interface directx 11 28 and a demeter
process and the back of the box were
just basically tells something about
their triangle cooling so i'm just going
to move on you guys told me you could
give a rat's ass about the box so i'm
going to move past the box as you guys
have requested so get it out of there it
off the side a field gigabyte local once
again a little black box the box ception
will pop the cap on that that I'll peel
back see the card all nice and sealed up
actually though folks to be honest this
carb probably was already opened I
believe that the entire time at CES
gigabyte had all these cards on display
so it's probably been open once before
here inside we see a little container
and absolutely positively nothing else
in the box so yeah this was probably one
of the samples that gigabyte actually
used on their tour so I'll toss out of
the way not much to look at so in that
case let's just get right to the meat
and potatoes the video card just pop
little strap there
and then we shall pull this thing out
all right so let's just start off on the
back of the card now personally I think
this could have been done just a little
bit better you guys I know you like it
and I like it I really love them there's
a shroud covering the back of the card
sometimes these components can cut you
or they can just you know be touched and
sort the card out I prefer when it has
that back panel down here in the bottom
we have a PCI insertion I'm gonna flip
it to the cyber you guys can see some of
the cooling we also see a single six pen
single eight pin power connector right
there I'm going to flip it over this
once again so you guys can see the side
inside also you can see all of the
copper heatpipes they're all in there
helping dissipate all that heat away
from the card we see three fans Triforce
three fans underneath that once again
you guys can see all the cooling the
nomenclature the card is clearly shown
right there flip it around to the Rio to
DVI standard DisplayPort standard HDMI
nothing too unusual there you guys can
see back of the card and that's pretty
much it folks like I said the big deal
about this card the really big deal
about this card is the aftermarket
cooling we all know the 290x has been
out we've seen the results we all agree
that hey the damn thing need to be water
cooled or have an aftermarket cooler so
hey gigabytes has taken the next step in
the evolution of the card added this
external cooling so now Thorin test
bench we'll find out how well this works
compared to the standard 290x and bring
that news to you but that's pretty much
it folks this is the card the new r9
290x win for sedition from gigabyte so
all right there you have it folks
everything that comes in the box and
this brand new gigabyte 290x overclocked
win for sedition video card now I know
people out there have been waiting for a
long time for these to come out and
right now things are a little bit trippy
with pricing from AMD do the whole
Bitcoin mining all that stuff you can
see the price of gone
up and out the roof this card's hitting
almost the seven hundred dollar mark
that's right so it is very expensive but
for those people out there who are AMD
fans and could give a shit less about
top performance this is something you're
going to want to get your hands on now
