Plus
alright glad to see you guys here once
again on tech of tomorrow so what's on
the plate today well you guys all know
that AMD has released their 290x but the
card that originally came out had their
stock cooling it was kind of iffy on
overclocking and stuff due to its heat
and how loud it was well now we're gonna
see the next generation of cards begin
to come out and we have our hands on the
latest gigabyte win forced edition
that's right so this is a windforce
edition features their triangle cooling
it's the 450 watt version this things
tricked out overclocked out of the box
and geared to be for an enthusiast who
wants performance so with that said
let's take a look at the box and what's
inside of it and see what's in store for
you with gigabytes latest entry into the
290 X market alright folks so here we
have it the Box in its normal little
square form factor here gigabyte
windforce 450 watt out OC grew to Radeon
r9 290x with 4 gigabytes of gddr5 so you
know it's gonna be really fast on the
side of the box just shows you basically
it does AMD Eyefinity 4 gigs 512 bit
memory interface DirectX 11 28 and a
Demeter process and the back of the box
were just basically tells something
about their triangle cooling so I'm just
gonna move on you guys told me you could
give a rat's ass about the box so I'm
gonna move past the box as you guys have
requested so get it out of there off to
the side I feel old gigabyte logo once
again in the little black box the Box
ception will pop the cap on that it all
peeled back see the card all nice and
sealed up actually though folks to be
honest this car probably was already
opened I believe that the entire time at
CES gigabyte had all these cards on
display so it's probably been open once
before here inside we see a little
container and absolutely positively
nothing else in the box so yeah this was
probably one of the samples that
gigabyte actually used on their tour so
I'll toss out of the way not much to
look at
so in that case let's just get right to
the meat and potatoes the video card
just pop little strap there and then we
shall pull this thing out alright so
let's just start off on the back of the
card now personally I think this could
have been done just a little bit better
you guys I know you like it and I like
it I really love them there's a shroud
covering the back of the card
sometimes these components can cut you
or they can just you know be touched and
short the card out I prefer when it has
that back panel down here in the bottom
we have a PCI insertion I'm gonna flip
it to the side where you guys can see
some of the cooling we also see a single
6 pen single 8 pin power connector right
there I'm gonna flip it over just once
again so you guys can see the side
inside also you can see all of the
copper heat pipes they're all in there
helping dissipate all that heat away
from the card we see three fans Triforce
three fans underneath that once again
you guys can see all the cooling the
nomenclature of the card is clearly
shown right there flip it around to the
ER IO to DVI standard DisplayPort
standard HDMI
nothing too unusual there you guys can
see back of the card and that's pretty
much it folks like I said the big deal
about this card
the really big deal about this card is
the aftermarket cooling we all know the
290x has been out we've seen the results
we all agreed that hey the damn thing
need to be water cooled or have an
aftermarket cooler so hey gigabytes just
taken the next step in the evolution of
the card out of this external cooling so
now thora test bench we'll find out how
well this works compared to the standard
290x and bring that news to you but
that's pretty much it folks this is the
card the new r9 290x windforce edition
from gigabyte so alright there you have
it folks everything that comes in the
box and this brand new gigabyte 290x
overclocked windforce edition video card
now i know people out there have been
waiting for a long time for these to
come out and right now things are a
little bit trippy with pricing from AMD
do the whole Bitcoin mining all that
stuff you can see the price of gone
up and out the roof discards hitting
almost the $700 mark that's right so it
is very expensive but for those people
out there who are AMD fans and you could
give a less about top performance
this is something you're gonna want to
get your hands on now before I bounce
out of here I just want to thank Ulla
