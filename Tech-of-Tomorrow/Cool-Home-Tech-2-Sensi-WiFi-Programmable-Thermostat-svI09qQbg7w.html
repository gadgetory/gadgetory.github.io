another edition of the ultimate and
smart home technology now you guys know
that over the last two months I've been
installing a lot of different smart
technology inside my home we've done
different doorbells we've done all kinds
of crazy stuff to turn this whole house
into a smart home and we're continuing
along in that same motion in today's
video is actually about that today's
video is brought to you by the people at
Emerson and it's their brand new sensi
Wi-Fi programmable thermostat now this
thing works really easy and it works off
the existing Wi-Fi inside your home so
most people have that right now anybody
who has an internet and stuff like that
I'm gonna pretty much think you're gonna
have a Wi-Fi connection that's pretty
much all you need other than a smart
phone any iOS or Android phone can use
this and it actually is easy to install
and can be done in about 15 minutes
let's check this out so the very first
step you're going to do is you're going
to install their app and as you're going
through the app it's going to tell you
in a step by step process how to do
everything which makes it really a
no-brainer for anybody and after you
install their app you're gonna want to
go outside and shut down all the
electricity your home to make sure
there's no electricity running to your
thermostat after you shut down the
electricity in your home the next step
is removing the old thermostat and
you're gonna see there's a bunch of
wires when you remove the cover now
these wires are all going to be labeled
for installing the Emerson device and
this is a really really simple thing to
do after you code them all you simply
remove the other device install the
sensi Wi-Fi programmable thermostat
attach the wires according to the
directions make sure you're hooked up to
your Wi-Fi and bam you're up and going
in less than 15 minutes I mean really
that's all there is to the installation
I know that a lot of people out there go
oh my god I'm not an electrician I can't
do this but trust me it's very easy to
do it may seem daunting to you but it's
not daunting at all it's actually a very
simple process and inside the app or a
lot of really cool things you can
actually control the weather inside your
house every day of the week that's right
for every day of the week you can
program it for a different temperature
and there are some really cool things
along with this you get heat and cooling
temperature warnings which tells you if
it's getting too hot in your house or
too cold and you can make an auto
adjustment automatically through your
phone you can also monitor local weather
information there's also a keypad
lockout feature now when you turn this
on it disables all the buttons on the
sensitive thermostat allowing only the
app to control it another cool thing is
that the thermostat comes with a three
year warranty so during that three years
if anything happens you're completely
covered by the people over at Emerson so
you know they got your back and if
you're worried about compatibility the
sensei Wi-Fi program will thermostat
works with most home HVAC systems so you
should be good to go now I know a lot of
people out there going ok you know well
Rick ok that's cool you know I got a
phone app that I can control my whether
I'm but why well there are a lot of
different reasons why a lot of people
travel they go on vacation they don't
want their house to get too hot or too
cold and so with that warning it'll tell
you if your house is getting too hot or
too cold and you can kind of like go
around and like program according to
what you see you know the weather is in
your area so if it's really really cold
but you don't want anything in your
house to freeze and you're off vacation
you can turn it on and keep your house
warm if you're away during the
summertime and it's hotter than Hades
you can actually turn it and keep it
cool sis you don't overheat your pets or
anything like that inside your home now
another aspect and this one is very very
appealing to me and I don't really see
anybody else talk about this is say a
person's handicapped honestly there are
millions of Americans and millions of
people worldwide including myself that
are handicapped if you're handicapped
and you're stuck in your bed and you're
freezing cold and you're by yourself do
you really want to have to go through
all the problems in today's modern
society of getting up out of bed getting
warm going and messing with your
thermostat in another room just to get
up and going I don't think you're going
to want to do that whatsoever so for
those type of people I think this really
has a lot of benefit now obviously they
might have to have somebody come over
and help them do the install but after
that all they need is their phone and
they're simply up and going and that's
pretty cool stuff we installed it
everything worked right off the bat I
mean we've had other stuff and honestly
I can I want to mention your names but
they gave us a serious hard time trying
to get the installation process up there
was absolutely nothing at all about this
that was negative which means that from
the time that we turned off the
electricity started running the app
installed it and did everything
everything worked absolutely perfect as
I said folks you guys can see that the
app is very intuitive it's very
it operate everything is on the screen
that you need you can turn it off you
can turn it on you can adjust your fan
you can adjust the temperature do all of
your programming all through the app on
your phone and that just makes a smart
home a simple place currently you can
pick up the sensei for about a hundred
and twenty nine bucks but it gets even
better if you want to get your hands on
one check out in the description for a
$10 off coupon code i'm Elric you guys
been watching tikka tomorrow like usual
all this information will be down there
like button hope you guys liked it
because we're gonna have more smart home
stuff as we keep going I've got lots of
cool stuff in fact uh you guys we'll see
