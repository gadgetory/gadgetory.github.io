TECA tomorrow fans what's going on you
guys I'm Eric welcome back to the
channel and today we were doing a little
rock and roll we thought we'd share that
with you a little ditty I wrote back
there and today we're going to be
bringing you guys the top 5 pros and the
top 5 cons of owning an hackintosh
because obviously a lot of guys in the
PC master-race they'll be like Apple
they just want to like you know they
want to pee on it like Apple so but
there are a lot of people out there who
still would say hey you know what though
I'd like to try it maybe you want to do
some music stuff and use logic I got to
tell you I'm loving logic it's great to
use so maybe you're a guy out there who
just wants a try but you don't got a
whole lot of money but you'd like to try
in your PC master-race guy we'll check
it out now let's talk about the top 5
pros and cons of owning and building a
hackintosh so first off let's talk about
the pros which is obviously the positive
side of things now first of all
everybody knows that a Mac Apple they're
very very expensive now for you guys out
there who want to save money obviously
the number one reason for a hackintosh
is going to be the price because you can
build a hackintosh all the way from
total low end to total high end that's
right any type of hackintosh you want to
build if you want to go over to to Tony
Mac xxx and check out his stuff Tony Mac
x86 I think is what it is actually this
guy is like the whirlwind of information
he's like the holy grail of hackintosh
so him without him I mean I personally
don't think I could have built any of
the hackintosh is that I've ever built
so I just want to send a warm welcome up
and thank him very much for that so the
first thing is obviously priced me if
you want to build a super duper ultra
double-decker you know PC that's a
hackintosh you can do that but you can
also save yourself a whole hell of a lot
of cash by building yourself one but the
second reason is well obviously this
thing is going to be built by you so you
can make it look any way that you want
you have a limited number of parts but
you can choose what parts you want to
use what case you want to use if you
want to use a space case you want to
build a Homer Simpson one you can do
whatever you want as far as that goes
and still have your hackintosh up and
running which is something you obviously
cannot do all
at Apple no way not at all you get the
little silver the black trashcan and
those are your options like them love
them I like my iMac it's simple its
elegant but you know other people have
other things they like so next up reason
number three numeral tres that's right
this thing is a PC and that said you can
make it a dual boot system you can put
an OS for a PC and an OS for a Mac or no
as for Windows if you want to be more
particular you cannot do that at all
with an apple machine you have to use
their boot camp now I don't know what
you guys think I think boot camp I think
mud push-ups people tell me that I'm an
idiot my mom sucks what kind of children
did live you know something insulting
like that and with the hackintosh
machine you can make it a dual boot
system that's right now reason number
four you've always just been leery of
Apple in general leery of Apple you're
just like huh I don't really know about
that with a hackintosh check it out if
you don't like it it's a hackintosh
turnaround wipe it out and it's your PC
boom you didn't waste any money
whatsoever
pretty good right and reason number five
reason numero Cinco is that a lot of
people out there just plain and simply
don't want anything to do with Apple
they really don't they are a leery of it
all together they don't want anything to
do with it whatsoever and I know a lot
of you PC master-race guys out there you
know you don't want to tell your friends
you on an Apple take it to PC I'm just
trying it out you know it's like some
girl that are really hot in school was
strange but you're like damn I want to
tap that so you're like all right I'll
try myself I hackintosh
now let's talk about the cons where I
consider the flipside are calling the
things that could be bad about owning
one now check it out no matter what you
want to say about Apple you pcmasterrace
guys I know you're going to be like I
hate those motherfrakkers but check it
out man Apple does have killer customer
service they really do in fact a few
years back
Jesus the Karimun here he slammed my
hand and broke my thumb with my iMac
back here me too my truck broke the
monitor broke my hand but hey Apple gave
us a new monitor so obviously their
supports pretty cool any move you guys
didn't see it but it's like over here Oh
back be on my show let's see
to a monitor in question that we're
speaking of so no customer sport all
from Apple which means no software
support no hardware support no nothing
no exchanges those are good things about
owning a true Apple machine comm number
two check it out
when you build a hackintosh you're kind
of stuck with the parts the OS that you
got because it's all been tested to work
so it like works within that function
but if you're trying to update things go
and do the Apple updates or any that
type of stuff you're totally going to
mess your system up it's not going to
work whatsoever you're going to have to
totally rely on Tony Mac x86 when a home
boy comes out with his update and then
you can go update now for a lot of
people that might not matter you're cool
you're like hey I'm just using logic or
I'm just using this and doing that not
only anything more jesus has a
hackintosh she loves the thing uses
every damn day so like you could use one
too but econo that is though is that you
can't do any updates whatsoever at all
unless it's totally been geared out by
Tony x86 the man the myth the guy in the
internet con number three when you're
building a hackintosh and I guess got to
say this right the bad interject this if
you've never built a PC ever before
hackintosh is a different breed
altogether and saying that there is a
limitation of parts you can't just go
take any parts go out and buy any
motherboard come home go hey I'm
building myself a hackintosh because I
said so friend of mine John Chambers the
other day he sent me a thing over the
messenger knees like hey dude I'm going
to send you my motherboard and I want
you to put you know all the Mac stuff on
it I was like dude it just doesn't work
that we do understand what I'm saying
and made him go to Tony x86 like just
like I do but you do have a severe
limitation of parts you can only use the
parts that are going to work with that
series and generation of the built so
that is also a limitation and a con of a
hackintosh con number four now this one
right here can be a bitch and a real
killer to your system and that is just
strange foreign errors happening weird
things is happening where it shuts down
or you get the spinning pinwheel you
know which is kind of like the blue
screen of death in PC you get a blue
screen to Mac it is spinning pin with
Lisa's prettier it's just like
but the same thing now that starts
happened with your hackintosh you knows
you were completely because
you're going to rebuild a thing and find
out what's going on I've had a couple
machines do this I've been really lucky
I got to say I follow Tony xae stuff the
T so when he says do this use this part
I do it and I usually have really good
success with it but that is another
drawback of building a hackintosh and
the fifth and final con of building a
hackintosh now the PC you put whatever
parts you want in you throw in a disk it
pretty much does it you click buttons
you install drivers you click buttons a
lot of times you get lucky everything
works hackintosh new baby in a like that
you got to go in there's all kinds of
separate drivers to be doing in the UNIX
system you got to install things do
things different with the boot it's a
much trickier trickier process in fact
if you've never built a PC I would not
suggest jumping right in saying hey my
first machine is going to be a
hackintosh I mean hey I'm sure there
people out there smart enough to do it
but if you're not that kind of person I
would probably wait and build myself
some pcs before I try building myself
Macintosh now folks before I bounce out
of here people do send me emails pretty
much every day saying hey when are you
going to do another hackintosh
okay so I will do another hackintosh for
you guys but what I want you guys to do
is leave comments down below do you guys
want me to build an affordable
hackintosh I kind of like over-the-top
type of hackintosh or a totally budget
hackintosh I'll look at the comments
down below and I'll also put a poll over
on the website where you guys can vote
and wherever votes the most that's the
kind of system I'll put a budget out
there for it you guys vote on the budget
we will get the parts and I will go
choose once again from Tony Mac x86 all
parts of the work and we will bring the
system to the table now for some reason
if you didn't gather what I said breathe
just this time there won't be any
information down below there's a like
button down there I hope you're going to
like this video but if for some reason
catch what I said just rewatch the video
just watch it
I'm Elric thanks for watching we'll
bring you guys a hackintosh make sure
you vote we'll see you guys back here
morrow
