tomorrow's resident gaming guru talking
to you from my base of operations aka my
house now as many of you are aware a
couple of games came out this morning
signaling the start of what will
eventually be the madness that is the
holiday season and one of those games in
particular is splinter cell blacklist so
I grabbed that this morning off of steam
got to play the always fun little game
of will Ubisoft let me play something in
my PC got to play it for about an hour
and now bring you guys my first our
impressions so sit back grab a snack and
enjoy today's dose of gaming goodness
so here we are with our first
impressions now to begin with I want to
give you guys a little idea about the
style of videos will be doing with these
first our impressions and full reviews
and we're going to have a much bigger
emphasis on the content of the game
itself and not so much pure performance
now those you that are fans of our more
spec related in benchmark videos we're
still going to have that content on the
channel it's just that my reviews will
be focused much more in terms of
gameplay mechanics storytelling music
and art style and presentation now of
course we still realize that what we're
running game on is really important
information to you guys so you can check
out the links in the description to see
what I'm playing on and if you haven't
seen it yet you can check out part one
of our ultimate game capture pc build
project right here so getting back to
what this particular video is about my
first our impressions of splinter cell
blacklist now right off the bat that
game shows that definitely has a much
heavier emphasis on combat than just
pure stealth players are given the
option between suits that specialize in
gadgets and increasing enemy AI is
ability to notice you and those that
focus on increasing your toughness or
web and handling instead in other words
traditional stealth man's still have the
option to play the way they're used to
but those you lacking skills for
subtlety can build up Sam for running
and gunning if you wish now several the
mechanics introduced in conviction have
made their return including the ability
to mark and quickly take down multiple
targets and the seeing of a ghostly
outline of your last known position two
enemies allowing you to strategize your
escape overall the stealth gameplay is
smooth with my only complaint so far
being that the game literally throws
ammo and gadget resupplies at you at
every other hallway though of course
I've only played a bit over an hour so
this could just be a symptom of early
levels one particular feature I really
like is that this game rewards you based
on three separate XP tracks for
different playstyles ghosts for those of
you that like using non-lethal takedown
just completely avoiding combat panther
for those still rely on stealth but also
make use of more lethal means of
removing threats and lastly assault for
those you that want to treat this like a
third-person shooter or just have a bad
habit of getting caught every five
seconds while I'm happy with the games
overall approach to combat I do have a
few issues with this presentation so far
specifically the change of and in all
honesty completely out of place voice
acting for Sam Fisher and the strangest
stealth mechanic in which hiding in
shadows causes your gear to light up as
though that were some kind of useful
feature for keeping you hidden I get
that it's meant to be a signal for
players to know when they're in cover
and have darkness but it's just
counterintuitive and kind of
movie when you think about it in setting
this game is also taking a much more
specified mission approach where you
actually have a home base of operations
or you can talk to all your people
upgrade your gear get a little more
character of lament out of each person
talk to and then go to each mission
separately as well as engaging co-op
missions and online ones giving a little
more of an episodic feel rather than
just one continuous story line now of
course all of this is just from my first
hour of gameplay really only played like
the opening bit of the campaign I've
done one mission after the tutorial so
there's still a lot left for me to
experience I've yet to do any of the
multiplayer where there's the co-op side
missions or the online mercenaries vs
spy mode and once I get chance to play
those more as well as finish the
campaign I can bring you guys the full
review so this was our first of a series
of brand new gaming vids we're going to
be bringing you guys for tech of
tomorrow if you guys enjoyed the content
or looking forward to more of it make
sure to let us know if I going to town
on the like button as we really
appreciate it and if you have yet to do
so also make sure to subscribe to so you
can stay up stay and all the other stuff
will be doing including my floor reviews
splinter cell and all the other games
will be getting during the holiday
season and if what little bit you
already saw today makes you really want
