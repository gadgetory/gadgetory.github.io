back once again to Tekken tomorrow where
we finally get a chance to actually do
the testing with the Vulcan AP I just
want to address a couple of things
though you crazy ass AMD fans out there
who say that I'm paid by Nvidia to make
AMD look bad are you crazy why the hell
would I ever do that I've never taken a
penny from anybody and if I did it says
sponsored video and in fact in my entire
history I've only gotten a wee bit of
money from Nvidia and that was for a
shield video has nothing do with video
cards I've never taken a penny from the
PC industry that's not my style so
without that said though I will explain
we just didn't have time to do the
Vulcan API because we were moving so we
got our scores and moved and finally got
to film but we didn't have that but
today we've got it in-house and you guys
will see if at an Open GL the GTX 1060
wins against the 480 the 480 however
does pull ahead when you use the Vulcan
API by a few frames per second maybe
seven to ten so with that said though
let's check out some footage in 1080p
and both OpenGL and the Vulcan API
let's rock out and let's check this shit
out and real quick for you folks who
follow the channel you probably remember
the Icarus system it was a system that
we built we made actually two versions
of it and if you guys want to check that
out we'll have a link down below to all
the parts for that system it's
completely AMD based basically folks
it's a 970 chipset with an FX 8350 with
that said though let's check out the
footage and see what's up so first up
let's check out doom and OpenGL on the
GTX 1060
the facility will not allow you access
to the turbine room unless the demonic
threat level is brought down inside the
foundry
and now let's check out the Vulcan API
on the gtx 1060 the facility will not
allow you access to the turbine room
unless the demonic threat level is
brought down inside the foundry
Wow Kocher
stay stay
demonic threat reduced by 25% here's the
andr X 480 doom OpenGL overwritten
Wow core temperature rising
and now here's the AMD R X 480
using the Vulcan API
the facility will not allow you access
to the turbine room unless the demonic
threat level is brought down inside the
foundry
Wow core temperature
so like I blame lease at the beginning
of the video obviously new right at the
get-go that the Vulcan API was scoring
better on the 480 than it is on the
1080p so as far as future proofing goes
okay right at this moment you can see
that there is a difference but as far as
being completely future proof I just
think that you have to take into your
mind that if all of a sudden you know a
Cygnus computing becomes the number one
thing then obviously in video is
probably gonna come up with a hardware
solution so for right now sure if there
were 20 games out there right now or
even 10 games I would definitely say hey
wow this is a big thing with only one
game though I have to stress this I mean
obviously yeah in the future it's going
to show that AMD is gonna have great
strengths using the Vulcan API that's
obviously a fact but you can't say that
from a year from now that Nvidia is just
gonna sit back and be like they're gonna
come up with a solution that's just how
the game is played and if you've been in
this game at all I don't know if you're
five years old twelve you still know
what's up this is how the game is
constantly played one guy comes up with
the card they come up with technology
boom they're in the head the next guy I
did that they jump ahead it's a leapfrog
back and forth back and forth some
companies are just that way and these
two are some of the biggest companies in
the rival it used to be pretty much no
Intel AMD but then AMD went the video
cart business and all of a sudden became
invidia and AMD used to be an ati world
for those people out there who know it
so I'm Mel Eric you guys can see right
now yeah the Vulcan API definitely shows
serious frak and promise on the AMD side
of things and that's great and I'm
completely happy about that because at
the end of the day I'm a tech fan just
like you and I want to buy what's best
for my money and like I said if I would
have tested this and there were ten
games right now that we're all the
newest games at every single one of them
ran better with the Vulcan API
I would definitely say that overall the
480 is a better card but at the moment
there's only one game so peace out the
links will be down there below for arrow
the information for the test system as
well as for links for both the 480 and
the gtx 1060 in fact we have more stuff
coming more gtx 1060 stuff and more 480
see here on the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
