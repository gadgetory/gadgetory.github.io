thank you unboxing today from my staff
it's a very good product we're going to
unbox today hey that's my black blade
we're unboxing that this thing is very
cool let it go brother it who test bench
and the case oh and one if you know that
name your not have enthusiast hundred
dollar for case it comes with two or two
to five and a quarter days to three and
a half days and six that's right six two
and a half days two of which were on the
banks that's right
they call it the x8 point to the
kilogram that's right two kilogram
eighteen pounds seven expansion Bay's
pop very good product for the ninja with
the traveling thing no falling out here
I have a throwing knife - 3 9 if you go
I think box for throwing knife kill your
opponent you have multiple doing nice
cute on the opponent and now we shall
move on to the hurry oh unboxing and see
what comes in the box
hello alright everybody so just joke him
with the intro there but check it out
here's the box now this is an early
engineering sample that for some reason
got buried back there cuz usually it
people tell me it's under NDA and I
gotta hold on to it that's kind of bad
because we like to get our products and
move and rock and roll them so you know
how we do it around here but here's the
box
I'm sure the ones you get to the store
won't have these little things saying
you know sample not for sale there you
go
and so there's that so now let's begin
the actual unboxing partner my turn this
thing sideways got these trusses little
throwing knives and all those nice and
systems with a lovely throw nice we're
going to throw them at the camera and
then with that said now we'll go ahead
and we shall unbox this bad boy I will
go ahead and take my old trusty
tormentor in the back you don't need
them anymore we'll take the black sword
inside you can see it's all nice and
stacked and packed already then to put
the box I'll take the big box you here
thrown across the room and oh oh poor
cat do we squash her Oh bummer
hello time we have a new cat I'm just
kidding g5 joke here we go cardboard
coming off one piece Oh catch there all
right so I'm gonna have the cam and
refocus alright folks and I will unpack
it and take it and bring it up here
well now I will spin around the other
side right here alright folks so now
let's take a look at the front of case
right here to my left you can see the
Coolermaster logo behind this we have
220 millimeter fans they're back behind
here then coming over here we have two
USB 3.0 microphone headphone restart
power then over here we'll start at the
bottom we have our two Porter
Bay's down here here we have two
removable it's like pretty much
everything in the front right there now
the thing that's interesting about this
though is I'm actually looking at this
thing totally wrong you could use it
this way but actually the entire unit
goes like this I want to see if any bi
out there actually caught on to that and
saw that but they didn't so now I'm
going to spin it this is actually how
the unit really does go and like they
said before this thing is very easily
detachable and stuff and take it apart
that you can use it for either a test
bench or a case so let's go ahead and
let's start taking this thing apart and
looking at it we'll flip it around
through the sides here's a side right
here you can see there's a handle and
everything else easy grip and take bring
it around the back more areas for
mounting fans power supplies new matter
down here seven expansion slots we spoke
up before right here let's go ahead and
we're gonna go ahead and show you guys
the top now on top it says it takes a
single 200 millimeter fan that's gonna
be for the top let's continue to dissect
go ahead and hopefully these things
aren't too tightly on alright folks so I
try to do these by hand and they would
not work so let me just set it off the
bat don't try to them by hand
and get a screwdriver just break that
initial seal because they're all very
very tight in here could not do it by
hand at all so make it nice and simple
just get a Phillips head screwdriver
make a quick easy first turn and then
after that you're good to go and you can
go ahead and take them all out so I'll
give them all the nice little turn then
after that it's pretty much just take
them all out like normal thumb screws
but like I said the initial needs to
actually have a tool it's not to us
you're gonna have to use it I could just
fast-forward the video and take all
those out folks but I figured you folks
who want to see it done so I will do it
and make it so you guys can see it all
that's way it's real time so okay now
I'm gonna begin I'll turn it put the
move this side first here you can see
the side this is the part of the handle
that you grip the plastic mold pretty
solidly may go ahead and set that off
the side let you guys take a look
through the inside right there you can
see the wiring harness and everything
for all your drives everything up here
the front connections these other parts
are gonna plug into your motherboard and
so forth inside of here also we have the
accessories package I'll go ahead and
remove accessory package get it out of
there let's turn it around to the other
side and we shall repeat the same thing
pull off the case citing same thing once
again I'll go ahead and step it up to
the side as well so again you guys can
see in here now I'm gonna try to adjust
this and get the camera in a second to
the just inside inside on the top there
are two 120 millimeter fans like we said
before you can see inside there right
now you can actually see both of those
in there on the bottom down here below
you can see are all the connections for
all of your drives all of your SATA
connections everything are all right
there
this thing will use standard ATX mini
ATX 4 micro ATX motherboards nothing
larger than that go ahead and set it
down no let's see here I'm trying to
give you guys an angle at the top it's
pretty hard to do so I'm going to set it
up like this another thing to take note
of as you can see right here that's your
lock and unlock the drive bays it's got
a simple little mechanism right here so
that's all you're gonna do
pop your drives in pop these back in and
voila away you go so that's gonna be
pretty easy stuff I'll go ahead and
leave it up for now let's go ahead and
take them both up just so you guys can
see that but that's how your drives lock
in show you guys three bottom since we
have a better hitter than nothing
screwed over now we see the very bottom
right down here in the very bottom we
have a removable little air duct right
there
so it's cleanable very easy you just
wash it out clean it and then just
simply put it back in place no problem
whatsoever now last but not least folks
we told you this thing can be used as
basically a test station or as a case
well pop the top off here you guys can
see room for the single fan we talked
about and then talks about the side
voila you've got yourself instant test
station so there you can see all the way
through into the system
I'm just having fun guys you know me I
like to have fun I did get this for an
early Christmas presents we get out with
the unboxing this is called the Black
Knight sword they sell it at a place
inside those little Golmaal so this has
been it man this is the half x be with
the you know the fun little sword thing
we're doing here you know like I said
that thing comes to market at a hundred
bucks so good price can also be used for
different type of situations I think
it's kind of neat because its square and
everything and the price is actually
pretty low and if you want something
that you'd be like builds your computer
inside a modern or actually for many
different type of mods this will be a
pretty cool little thing to have so
