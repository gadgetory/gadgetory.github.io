here once again on the channel you're
watching tech of tomorrow and a lot of
times people send me email in there like
hey dude what is on your desk what are
you used to game and basically a man do
a desktop to her now I would do
basically a whole office tour in here
but there's just a ton of shifting in ER
because not only do I game this room I
do all my testing I mean it's right over
here I got a couple test stations over
here i got all my parts posters but you
guys always want to know about my gaming
rig ok so the gaming we have I had back
behind me boot literally at the game is
my head back behind me my friend Jerry
Chang one he will miss an event up at
that big old giant boat when in video
was doing this huge thing on that
aircraft carrier you guys all remember
that anyone the system it's got lga775
board high in Intel thing and had some
Mars cards in it but to be honest with
you it's been kind of fledging I've
changed some parts around in and I was
actually been using a nvidia 690 for the
longest time but now I decided you know
what since we're going to the desktop
tour let's talk about my upgrade at the
same time because this weekend I'm
greater to upgrade my computer so first
off I'm going to take you guys on a
little tour about all the new parts that
are going into the system because I
think it's what you guys really want to
know what I'm using and so is what I'm
going to be using in a week for the
other system if you guys want to know
what that is and a lot of other videos
all have a link down below we've listed
all the specs of this system completely
many times now the Falcon Northwest case
I really like it it's pretty badass I
don't plan on changing it out at all all
I plan on doing is basically gutting it
and replacing them at the parts so with
that said before we actually do the
desktop torn talk about all my
peripherals and all that stuff let's
first talk about the new parts and I
must switch out to upgrade my system so
let's first start off with the new
motherboard it's going to be the asus
rampage for extreme a very powerful
board for the LG a socket 2011 and it's
going to be awesome next up I've got my
cpu that i got from intel it's actually
until confidential but it's the I 749
60x extreme edition at 3.6 gigahertz
right out of
the box yummy yummy yummy so next up is
the cpu core now we're going to go with
the Salman rezar eight ER three max dual
now this things are really killer when
it's brand new on the market and I
figured hey what better way to test it
then to put it in my own personal system
now as far as memory goes i'm using the
corsair dominator platinum 16 gigabyte
kit now this is PC 3 1500 desktop memory
and it should kick some severe booty in
my system for the graphics card I'm
going with the MSI 780ti gaming card now
I'm also going to be using a reference
card and I'll have you using those an
sli I'm also going to be changing out my
SSDs to two brand new ones from a data
one is it 256 gigabyte and the other is
a 512 so i'll use the 256 gigabyte for
my OS and for my origin games and the
other one for all my Steam games so
obviously with all these parts I'm going
to need a very adequate power supply to
power them and I wanted one that I could
actually do all the adjustments of my
fans off the front of the case something
I can't currently do with my system so
I'll with the cooler master silent pro
hybrid now this thing's at 1300 watt 80
plus gold power supply with modular
cables and fan speed controller all the
things that I'm looking for in a power
supply alright folks so that's
everything that's actually going to be
going inside of my Falcon Northwest
green machine case back here by the way
the colorants camaro great if any you
guys were wondering you can look at
clock up on line it actually matches
that but that said there now let's jump
in and let's start talking about all the
things i use on my desktop let's go
first off let's talk about my mousepad
some everybody uses now i use the CM
storm speed RX large you can see this
thing off over here to the right but use
this thing for quite a long time now
you'll notice everything in my room is
actually quite dusty though because i
like live by the desert when you live in
the desert hey hit it just gets dusty
now as far as my mouse goes i use the CM
storm sentinel advanced to with a 20 DPI
with a biosensor 128 kilobytes of memory
not only using those features but i do
use a shit up for gaming and it works
really really well I haven't really
programmed it much I keep the DPI much
lower
that if I had set the DPI HR DPI be
going so fast I probably wouldn't even
see it now my keyboard it's also a CM
storm trigger follow on the line of
everything I have everything on my
desktop I try to keep in the CM storm
theme this is the trigger it's a
mechanical gaming keyboard with cherry
MX blue switches and I fully led-backlit
you guys have seen this before I think
it's really cool everything on it lights
up in red lighting and it looks really
really nice now another thing that
people ask me about all the time is my
speaker system I came in one of those
speakers and hey I tell you guys I
really like these things some people in
the past have talk some shit about it
but you guys can see when you guys take
a look at omit the reviews and these
things are really quite awesome I'm very
satisfied these are the altec lansing MX
602 12.1 expressionist ultra speaker
system in black I like these things
quite a bit they sound bitchin they look
bitchin and they have this total little
control thing here we can control the
volume up and down you're going to
headphones up to it everything right
this little thing you can sit on your
desk now my monitor is the del u 3014
ultrasharp 30-inch premier color monitor
now this thing's amazing 2560 by 1600
resolution I've been gaming on this for
like the past year and a half and this
thing kicks ass if you're looking for
ultra ultra high resolution this thing
seriously is an ass kicker and last up
the 3m adjustable gel wrist pad now I've
gotten more emails about this particular
product probably about than any other
product I'd have whenever I've shown my
desktop alright folks so there you guys
have a what elric use it is daily gaming
system this is my system right back
there now one of the main things I got
to just reiterate one more time is this
thing I don't know why but so many
people ask me a kazillion emails about
this 3m gel pad for my wrist now this
thing's really cool and you guys seem
the list but this thing is also a bit
pricey you're going to come in a little
bit shocked it's like 54 bucks right
kind of an expensive ass thing but i
gotta admit to you it's very comfortable
I am fighting people with my house they
move it or do anything with it because I
really like this thing so I hope you
guys enjoyed this will be building my
whole news
system will come back with video about
that a little bit later but you guys
have been asking for a long time what's
on my desktop what do i use to game and
so there you guys have it for those who
like the video hey the like buttons down
there and below be the description will
have all the parts of the new system and
the existing system down there below if
you choose to buy it and make it your
own system I will go with the newer
parts though the other ones work okay
but hey newer ones are much better so
I'm Elric thanks for watching tech in
tomorrow i'm off to do some gaming and
having some fun tonight thanks guys
