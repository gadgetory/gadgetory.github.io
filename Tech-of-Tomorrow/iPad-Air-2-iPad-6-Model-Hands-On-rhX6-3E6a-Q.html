hello everybody welcome back once again
to another edition of tech o tomorrow
I'm Eric your host with buddy the
co-host is feeling a little under the
weather portal tell me is bothering a
little guy but that's not why we're here
we're here to take a look at the dummy
model of the new iPad air 2 sixth
generation product now this thing's
gonna be hitting the market this fall
but we were able to get our hands in the
dummy model so let's now jump in and
let's see what this thing is gonna be
bringing to the table for you
the first off you guys can see we're out
the bad it's not that much different
than the previous generation product
still has the same nine point seven inch
Retina display and you guys can see it's
a little bit thinner the current product
actually measures in at seven point five
millimeters and we're looking at the new
one it seems like it's about six point
five millimeters so there is some
significant difference as far as how
thin it is you guys can all hear the
puppies stomach going off that's gonna
be our background music but as we jump
down and we take a look at the bottom we
can see that there is a difference as
far as the speaker grills go on the new
iPad air 2 we see a single row of
speaker grille on the previous
generation we see two rows of holes
instead of one now this next feature is
something that I'm gonna say you must
take with a grain of salt on the
proposed new one that we have the dummy
model you can see that the volume
control is a lot more recessed inside of
it than the generation that's out right
now now with this is gonna be what we
see when it hits the product in the fall
well that's something to be discovered
but for now on the unit that we have you
can see that the volume control is a lot
more recessed in the current model now
those are some of the small differences
one of the biggest difference however is
the home button which hopefully will
have the fingerprint ID reader on it now
you can see on the current generation
that doesn't feature that but on the
dome model that we have you can see that
it clearly has the ring for reading that
fingerprint ID so alright folks for you
Apple fans out there this is some pretty
good news for you PC folks out there I
know like usually you're not gonna give
a crap but please don't dislike the
video just because you don't like the
Apple product that really sucks because
like a good time do the videos and so I
hope that those folks out who are
actually interested in this kind of
stuff will do the time and hit that like
button down below there now obviously
you're gonna see a faster process so
you're gonna see a better camera all
those features always come when you see
next-gen products the price should
remain about the same and so those folks
looking for it check it out this fall
when it's going to hit the market so all
those people out there have been waiting
hate your times will arrive i'm el Rikin
for those folks out they want to get
more information we're gonna have
pictures on all the stuff over on our
website so you guys can see the link
once again down below in the description
so peace out mister buddy the dog
hopefully will feel better though I'm
Adam
need some brass and hope that'll make
his little tummy they're really way
better
we love him we'll see you guys back
around TECA tomorrow for more tech very
soon
let's go puppies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
