has finally looking arrived where I have
rx Vega in house in my hands and ready
to test and bring you guys all the
scoring and I want to say off the bat I
think you guys will be pretty impressed
when you guys see the full review and
this thing comes out on Monday for today
though all I can do is unbox the brand
new rx 64 Vega which I've got right here
inside this box I don't know which one
it is I'm really praying it's the
water-cooled version but I probably
won't get that lucky now the Vega 56 it
only came in at ecstatic bags so no real
unboxing for that and for you folks out
there just going oh my god why isn't
there your scores
be patient they're right around the
corner but for now let's see what's in
the box of the RX Vega 64 so I've got it
right here in front of me not a whole
lot to the box it doesn't even say
anything on it it just has this on the
front you spin it around it's just got a
little bit more nomenclature not very
much whatsoever you're not going to
really whirring you don't see anything
like that I think it's kind of
interesting though we've got a little
slide little thing here check it out
little side little thing Kyle bloom
bloom bloom pops off the side with me
I'm going to go ahead and get this out
of the box first so we'll get this out
of the box kaboom take it like that
though with the cameraman now we'll
spare him
he's been a good kid lately all right so
now the whole block is falling apart
it's kind of good so we can avail it so
here it goes check it out maybe we can
like slo-mo this
oh holy
all right folks now check this out I've
never gotten any review samples from
anybody before that came with a cool
little thing like this it's almost like
an award cube with the nice Bigelow get
inside there got to say it looks pretty
badass and it's going to look pretty
badass on my desk in my shelf all in all
it's very solidly made has nice little
feet on the bottom to set it on there
and if you guys can see closely it does
say write on it radeon vega something
very interesting a talked piece at the
very least and what's really cool is i'm
looking through it as i'm looking down
it actually magnifies everything so you
can use it as a magnifying glass as well
so it's got two uses then after that
we've got a little booklet right here
let me open it up right here now inside
this booklet it's got just a lot of
different facts about vega just all
kinds of different facts and for you and
for you folks out there keep asking
about BA why I'm shaking I've explained
it before I have permanent nerve damage
from getting a PICC line stuck into my
heart and killing me in the hospital and
that's why I shake so much so please no
mean comments but check it out all kinds
of information on this just just more
cool stuff in the box now over to the
other side and the far left-hand side I
have one more thing I'll put up here the
camera quick so you guys can see it but
there's little thing right here I'm
going to pop the top here and we'll see
what actually it comes inside of this as
well ooh oh cool alright so check
this out
oh this is this stuff's cool dude okay
so we've got basically the GP wafer
right here this is this is actually
 really cool you get a blank GPU
wafer I got to say I'm really impressed
with the inside this box design
just cool stuff got ourselves a nice
bracelet so let's just go ahead and
let's put that motherfrakker on right
now so I'll go to the gym and somebody
asked a little be like backup Punk it's
my Vega bracelet biatch so there you go
also lots of other cool stuff man
stickers up the yem yem so if you folks
out there who totally dig stickers and
all that stuff well guess what inside
the box maybe some stickers now there's
most likely not going to be any driver
whatsoever inside this box because the
drivers are going to be under NDA and
off the DMV website we'll have all those
soon so we got another
inside of a box you'll box ception going
on I'm going to go ahead and pop the cap
on this pop a cap in your ass now hope
it's the air-cooled version but I'm not
going to whine it's still cool it's also
quite a bit heavy feels pretty gnarly
too so check it out
black and red design so when the card
actually comes out I guess we're not
going to see that great design that
we've been seeing everything before it's
kind of funny because even those picture
books that we were looking at this
little pin right here it showed the card
in grey as you guys can see single fan
design this is the reference model I
have talked to a few of their companies
gigabyte in a Zeus and they all do have
like their own models of these coming
out as well so that will be very
interesting but for right now we have a
single fan on top the cards about nine
and a half inches long to two slot
design typical like carpet you see on
most the cards on the market we have two
eight pin power connectors right here
we'll talk about all the specs and
everything like I said when the MDA
lifts on Monday for now I'm kind of
limited to what I can show you what I
can tell you I'm trying to tell you as
much as I can
you guys will notice that the cards
completely sealed though two in the
front and all around the card is
completely sealed I mean all the way
around the card now what's also cool is
you have a bio switch that's right here
up on top I try to get a little close-up
of that shot but there's a little switch
right up here for your BIOS and stuff
and what this actually does I believe is
it will allow you to turn it on to a
mode that actually runs like much cool
we'll talk about all these things like I
said with the nd a list but it's going
to be a pretty interesting fact and also
now in the back of the card now they
don't have a totally outrageous rear
shield but it's still nice and what's
also really nice is over here there's a
little button that allows you to
actually change the color of the card so
you can change the color on the card
from red to blue and I think that's
pretty sporting of the folks over at AMD
to allow blue color because if somebody
does have an Intel based system and they
want to match the color up tall blue
they'll still be able to do it and use
an AMD card so I give a thumbs up to
that and the Rio is also something a
little different that we normally see
it's three display ports and a single
HDMI port and gone is the DVI totally
gone it's no longer there what so
so all right Tech fans so there you have
it the RX Vegas 64 and all of its glory
stick around to the channel because
we'll have the full review coming this
Monday for all you happy campers out
there and like I said I think you're
going to be pretty happy with what you
see I'm Miller you've been watching
taken tomorrow we'll see you guys for
more tech tomorrow and we'll see you
back from the channel for the full
review next week peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
