your favorite tech show tectum tomorrow
with your favorite host me Elric of
Technodrome ro
all right maybe I'm fooling myself but
anyways welcome back TECA tomorrow
bringing you all attack all the time
that's for damn sure
so what do we got on the tech plate
today well today we've got something
brand new from the people over at
Corsair this is their new CS 650 M power
supply now this thing's supposed to have
a hundred and fifty thousand hours of
mean time between failures so this will
last a long time got all kinds of
protective stuff to keep it going -
latest EPS devices it's backwards
compatible supposed to be for multi GPUs
also has totally flat cables so for
those people who like that kind of stuff
you're going to be liking it so that any
more ado let's jump in let's check out
what this thing has to offer you the end
user and why the hell do you want to put
it in your system let's go all right
folks so like any good unboxing well hey
check it out we're obviously going to
have what Oh a box yeah so here we have
it of course they're CS series modular
power supply erp three year warranty
80 plus gold CS 650 M is the
nomenclature modular ATX power supply
block the element ation modular 650
watts and when we've got some low energy
use quiet operation and we got that once
again right here and fable consummation
the energy function it silent sucks I
hope I said that right
this almost sounds like silence sucks
and I'm like what I know silence can be
gold and what are you talking about man
all right side of the box not a damn
thing there other side not a damn thing
there alright but here in the back of
the box folks we actually do have some
stuff to talk about we have a right here
that is the ATX 24 pin next up we have B
that is your EPS 12 volt 8 pin number C
we have four PCIe six pin eight pin D it
says SATA II these are peripherals and
we have the floppy and that's pretty
much all that stuff just shows you the
little power wave right there you guys
don't really care too much about that
let's jump in and let's actually see
what's in the box and other power supply
looks because that's what counts a lot
to builders these days they want to see
what it looks like so go ahead and
didn't it didn't have a trusty knife
with me today so I had to resort to a
pair of little scissors here and trust
me these scissors are not as workable as
my knife dang it all right there we go
usually using a PopCap so like usually
got a little pop cap here in the end
here
- voila you said there is the power
supply huh all right up here on top
important safety information from
Corsair please do not let your children
eat this at least not without milk
because it's hard to swallow
this thing get your warranty guide set
this stuff aside power here though are
all of the cables we get to those let's
take a look real quick at the power
block this little thing out of here -
doo doo doo doo doo
all right it blocks out of there so it's
black it's beautiful it's actually very
compact and it is a very nice-looking
power supply it's black it's simple
it'll go in pretty much any build one
thing about the color scheme but I want
to say though it is kind of more based
towards the vidi you can see that the CS
and the M are all in green same kind of
colors and in video uses in theirs as
well back side right here you can see
the power plug on an off switch inside
you can see a lot of the electronics
will flip it around to the back will
zoom pin to that you guys are looking
for the model number anything it's all
right there on the lovely power supply
flip it around just show the other side
same type thing again that we saw before
just the name then we have the fan with
once again the Corsair name
and then last but not least before we
move on and take a look at the cables
let's look at where all the cables plug
in at so this one's pretty basic it's
simple you can see there's not a lot to
it you got your peripheral or SATA your
PCIe your power and that's pretty much
it all the rest your power cable is all
right here your 24 EPS all right here
now let's actually take a look though at
the cables that come inside of there I
know people like CDs you guys all know
what the arm we talked about how many
there were but let's take a quick look
this is will actually come in handy for
Jacques in the background so let's just
take a look at the tables now like I
said before some people will like these
cables other people will hate them I
think they're actually quite nice
they're very easy to use in builds if
you don't have enough money to do a
custom sleeving and all that then these
will actually be pretty nice for you so
here we go right here molex molex molex
molex all the way around and the next
step we have the SATA guys can see these
are all to plug into your SATA devices
good to go
more SATA floppy in case for some reason
you have one and some molex to floppy
hopefully don't have a floppy and then
right here we have our six eight pin for
our video cards and things like that so
that's pretty much it folks all this
stuff right here and then the unit
itself that's everything in the box of
the cs6 50m from Corsair alright folks
so there you have it everything that
comes in the box and the first look of
the new Corsair cm 650 M power supply
now you guys are always wanting to know
hey how much this thing is this thing's
coming to market about 117 dollars which
might be a little pricey but still it
has a lot of nice features it's gold
certified has a long life inside your
computer it's going to be quiet if you
know it's guaranteed pretty much for
good long
time these guys have a good warranty
program good RMA programs so those are
kind of like your safety net underneath
your buy you know when you know a
company and a company strong has a lot
to do it that these guys are known to be
a strong company so that's pretty much
it hope you guys like this video if so
