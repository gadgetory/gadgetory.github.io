once again to the channel now the gtx
1060 is made its launch day and we
tested it using a pretty high-end system
at the highest end system but not the
lowest end now we're going to take you
guys on a tour showing that same card
though on an AMD based system featuring
the FX 8350 and the 970 chipset so you
people out there who have this your guys
are going to be happy now I know some
people are going oh my god that CPUs
like a few years old but hey it doesn't
matter there are millions of consumers
around the world using in 8350 and 83-70
CTU along with the 6100 and all those
other AMD CPUs there's a ton of
people using those type of CPUs so let's
check out the icarus system and check
out those scores and check out six games
and see is the ten sixty actually being
bottlenecked or is it doing just fine
you'll see
and for those of you for some reason
don't follow the channel and you want to
know what the icarus system actual parts
aw you guys can see a link down below
there will have the link down below like
but where you guys can see all these
parts and purchase the system or change
it around to your liking so that's the
system it's time to rock
okay so you guys can clearly see that
honestly the 10 60 is not being bottled
next really at all using the FX 8350 in
fact it's doing really really great so
if anybody has an older system you guys
are wondering hey man is this car going
to work in my system yes obviously it is
now there may be a tiny bit of bottle
necking going on but it's nothing
obvious with a card of this caliber at
this level so if you have some super
duper high-end card like you have a 1080
or something like that you may want to
reconsider using an older system but if
cards like this entry level cards or the
480 this card they work absolutely
beautiful inside the icarus if you guys
have seen in the previous videos that we
made by the way I'll have the links to
all those videos down below so well via
our sticker is to the testing with the
480 all that stuff down below so thanks
for watching the channel and as you guys
can see Hey 10 6 eat just just fine in
an older AMD based system peace out
we'll see you back here on the channel
hey what's up everybody welcome back
once again to the channel so this week
we're gonna be doing a bunch of testing
with various video cards to justify AMD
fans and we're paid by Nvidia to make
Andy look bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
