almost two and a half years before we
finally saw a new video card release
from Nvidia our TX is here and the
results have been kind of mixed but
Before we jump in today's video let's
here award from today's sponsor Corsair
the strafe mark 2 features 100% Cherry
MX RGB key switches providing a smooth
and linear response with precise
accuracy these switches deliver flawless
key presses and have a lifespan of up to
50 million activations so you know
you're getting the durability you'll
need there's also a convenient USB
pass-through port for any additional USB
device you might want to use it also
includes a volume wheel so you can
adjust the audio on the fly without
interrupting your game at all the strafe
mark 2 is also compatible with the IQ
software so you can customize the RGB to
however you want it to look looking for
a tool to take on your PC opponents give
the strafe mark to RGB a mechanical
gaming keyboard a look today alright so
if you're looking for a new keyboard
check out the strafe so like I said in
the very beginning all the RT X cards
have now been released as far as the
high end goes we're still waiting for
the 2070 cards to hit the market
hopefully they'll be priced a little
better and have good performance I know
that many people out there right now
though owned a 1080 card and probably
the biggest question and most of those
people's mind is is it worth my time to
upgrade to a 2080 cards we decided ok
well let's make a battle completely just
dedicated to that we're using the very
latest 411 driver on this if you guys
happen to miss a video that we did we
did a video you know comparing the
latest driver to the previous 399 driver
and the results were kind of a mixed bag
some people said that they felt oh you
know these games are being gimped a
little bit a bit other people said no
because the results were mixed if you
guys missed that you might want to check
that out but today's video is just a
straight up head to head battle between
the founders edition cards the 1080
versus the 28th it's straight ahead it's
pure let's talk about our test system
out to the new benchmark song from my
new band and then at the end of the day
let's talk about it and see really
should you upgrade from your 1080 or
should you just wait for you folks to
follow the challenge you probably know
our test systems a pretty nice system I
780 700 K we just leave it at stock
speeds but we keep it always learning at
a boosts clock we've got 16 gigabytes of
RAM inside of this baby we've got nice
drives for all our storage all in all a
very nice system we're using Windows 10
with all the latest patches installed
and like I said we're using the latest
411 driver and with that said let's rock
out to a brand new song for my Benz 7
Deadly Sins called arc of angels let's
rock
you
all right what do you guys think of that
song I really like it a lot thanks Sean
did a great job in writing this tune
also we'll have our stuff all up in a
little while so if you guys are
interested in seeing the stuff about my
new band were called seven deadly sins
we're just building up our retinue
getting our solid members in we'll have
both versions of instrumental and vocals
of these songs so you complain to your
heart's content with that said though
you guys can see at the best you're
getting 30 frames per second better
gaming performance with the 2080 on some
games now that's a lot of performance
gain on other games not so much the only
thing is the price difference between
the two you could probably if you look
around probably spend about 280 dollars
to $300 in the differences between a
1080 founders Edition and a 2080
founders Edition now the only real
difference is that you're probably going
to see is obviously the new cart is
going to have r-tx all the DSL excuse me
DL SS features and as we see time go by
like Nvidia says there's all kinds of
patches that are going to be coming out
to support new stuff on the card so
pretty much even though the 20/80 came
out the drivers are still kind of
immature and some of the technology in
the card isn't fully being utilized as
of yet so if you want to be completely
future-proof maybe spending that extra
money is worth it for you if you're
totally satisfied with your 1080 and
it's not giving you any problems I would
suggest not upgrading at all but if you
feel you just want a little bit more
performance wanted to squeeze that
little bit more performance out of your
system then yeah I think I would say go
ahead and upgrade and get yourself a 20
80 founders Edition art TX card because
as time goes by and you guys have seen
this as well when the 1080 first came
out its performance was is cool but as a
few years go by you can see that the
driver performance from the very first
driver to the very last driver is a
pretty good margin you're gonna see the
same thing with the RT X cards
so I had a better request from a guy out
there if you have any watching this
video you wanted me to compare certain
drivers also on the Vegas 64 card and
see how it has been comparing his
drivers from the beginning to now if you
guys would also like to see a video like
that
let me know we'll go ahead and make it
give me your opinions down below so at
the end of the day if you have a few
hundred extra bucks and you really want
the absolute best gaming performance and
you want to be future proof then yes
upgrade to the RT X 28 it would
definitely be a good thing for you to do
if you're completely satisfied though
with your 1080 you're having no problems
and you really don't feel like you know
you don't you know there's nothing for
you to complain about so I'm saying if
you're satisfied your content why even
waste your time there's an old saying
and it's always true if it's not broke
don't fix it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
