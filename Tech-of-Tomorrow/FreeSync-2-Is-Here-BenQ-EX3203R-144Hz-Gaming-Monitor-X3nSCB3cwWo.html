back after that long holiday weekend I
know a few guys outside the United
States you guys probably had the exact
same holidays as we do but we just had
our nice Labor Day three-day weekend and
it was nice to take some time off and
just chill out and catch up on the
expanse yes the expanse season three
rocks really liking that quite a bit
right now digging if you dig it let me
know as well now if you guys follow the
channel you know that I've really been
kind of testing out and reviewing quite
a few monitors lately most of them have
been from actually from Bank you and I
finally found a monitor that I really
really dig for doing what I want to do
do you guys been following China I've
been talking about putting three
monitors together making myself a really
SuperDuper awesome surround gaming
environment I would have really liked to
be able to do it with that two thousand
dollar monitor that we got from Nvidia
that had the G sync and all that but
even at $2,000 believe it or not that
monitor won't do surround say what I
know right makes no sense to me
whatsoever I would have liked to use
that one I probably could have made you
know and then deal with those guys at a
marketing trade deal and probably got
some of those and had it but they don't
work so I reached out to B&amp;amp;Q company
been working with quite a bit lately
these guys have a lot of products and
they had a monitor that just came out
and I think it's honestly one of the
very latest that feature free sync to it
maybe one of the very first free sync
two monitors actually hit the market now
this is the brand-new ex3 203 r that's
right features free sync to as I said
just a second ago and lots of other
great stuff this particular monitor also
it's only $700 I'm gonna go oh my god
dude it's only $700 but believe me when
you're getting a monitor that's 32
inches big that has tons of features
lots of connections and everything and
it's under that price point that is a
really good deal and one of the features
before you even jump into everything and
talk about is the bezel size the bezel
size on this is almost non-existent
which is perfect for putting three
monitors together in surround and since
it features free sync - I'm hoping
that's going to look really great with
my AMD 64 card now
there's also been a couple of things
that have come out that says that you
know and now Nvidia cards they've found
a workaround so you could use an Nvidia
card with the free sync monitors now I'm
gonna try that and see if I can get that
to work as well because I think that'd
be pretty cool and plus I wouldn't be
limited in what so ever fashioned and
putting it into my gaming environment so
if I wanted to test the system with an
Nvidia card I could do that and I could
do it with an AMD system and still get
free sync right yes that sounds awesome
I'm liking that so first off let's talk
about the design of this particular
monitor this monitor has an 1800 R
curvature to the screen so you know it's
a nice curved screen the base is very
nice and well built on the front of the
monitor you can see like I said before
almost no bezel whatsoever the OSD
controls are Oakley excuse me the OSD
controls are located on the right hand
side you just put your hand on it under
the front you click a few buttons and
right there is all your OS Steve stuff
you can scroll through all that and all
that good stuff
as we've turned them rounded around the
back you're gonna see something very
interesting that you haven't seen also
USB type-c so in the back as far as the
controls go you get two HDMI ports a
display port you also get two USB 3.1
ports and what's best of all though you
get a USB type-c connection which I
haven't really seen on any other monitor
yet and although there are no speakers
built in this particular monitor there
is a pass-through headphone jacks you
can plug your headphones directly into
the monitor the design of this is pretty
nice in another way as well as far as
your height adjustment you can do it
from 60 millimeters up and down and as
far as your tilt goes you can tilt it
from 5 to 20 degrees depending on what
you like overall the design of the x3
203 R is very nice and it's also pretty
simplistic but now let's talk a little
bit about the panel now I did a video
before discussing the different merits
between an IPS panel between a TN panel
and a VA panel another particular panel
on this monitor is a VA panel which is
right in the middle of everything you
get a 90 percent color gamut so if
you're an arse or something out there
and you're not like you know completely
dedicated that you can still do some art
and some video stuff on it editing and
stuff of that it'll be pretty good not
as good like I said as the
IPS monitor but still much better than a
VA panel now you get 2560 by 1440 which
is UHD so you have a nice widescreen
display to look at everything the only
thing is it's only in 16:9 I kind of
wish it had a little bit more options
other than that but 16:9 is still cool
for most of stuff that you're doing out
there for millisecond response time from
greater gray so you know you're gonna
Canadian any type of lag no eye fatigue
nothing like that with the screen now as
far as the brightness goes it's for turd
CD it also has the native contrast ratio
of 3,000 to one a viewing angle of 170
degrees so no matter where you're
looking at the monitor whether you're
looking at it straight on or off to the
side you're still gonna be able to see
the monitor no problem whatsoever but
honestly it gets even better check this
out a hundred and forty-four Hertz
refresh rate that's right we're not
talking 75 or not talking 100 we're
talking about a hundred and forty-four
Hertz of refresh right now this refresh
rate will work on no matter what type of
video card you use now obviously if
you're gonna use an AMD card you're
gonna get all that free sync technology
built inside of which can eliminate
screen ripping and all the other stuff
and real quick why we're talking about
the screen people gonna ask what it's
doing between freesync 1 and freesync
two well they're really the main
difference between free sync 1 and free
sync to is HDR that's really the main
difference now instead of having some of
the color mapping and all that stuff
done on the monitor they've switched all
that back on to the GPU so the power of
the GPU will be doing all that now the
only question I have out this right now
it'd all be Chism testing on its since
it's being moved off of the monitor and
onto the video card will the video card
suffer any kind of a performance hit
with that I'm hoping that it doesn't but
it is a question that's inside of my
mind right now one thing that artists
might find to be a caveat about this
particular manohar is it only has an 8
bit color depth so it doesn't have true
10-bit color so if you're an artist and
you've got to have the absolute exact
matching to photoshop or whatever then
this might not be the monitor for you
but honestly it's in the series for
gamers and people who watch movies and
in those particular areas it really does
exceed and if it was a TN panel I would
you know avoid it for all kinds of
artwork don't do anything like that
because the color just gonna be crap but
since this is 90% I think that you're
gonna be pretty much okay for doing
generalized stuff obviously if you're a
pro and you're getting paid by a
magazine or by a professional
publication place you're gonna want
something that matches their color
scheme exactly but for those who are
doing it for a hobby and just for fun I
think you're gonna be right on inside of
this monitor are also three technologies
that allow you to stare at this monitor
for hours on in without getting any type
of headache this is flicker free
technology low blue light and brightness
intelligence Plus now what brightness
intelligence Plus and what I think is a
really good feature is no matter what
kind of lighting you're in whether
you're in nighttime lighting you're in
house lighting you've got sunshine
shining in the monitor will change and
make it so it's optimal for you to watch
it so when you're looking at the monitor
have to be a lawyer - oh my god that's
way to brighter oh my god that's way too
dark it's gonna have that perfect
combination for you to look at the
monitor and not get a fatigue and being
flicker free like I told you guys before
I actually played on a 60 Hertz monitor
that was split or free technology and I
didn't get a headache so that flicker
free technology really does have an
impact on you looking at the monitor for
hours on and and let's just face it if
you're a gamer or somebody who just
watches a ton of movies you're gonna be
in front of that monitor for hours and
hours on end and one thing you
definitely don't want to get while
you're playing your games or enjoying
your movies it's sitting there rubbing
your eyes going damn why am I getting
fatigued it's an important feature to me
often very looked over but very
important nonetheless if you're someone
who surfs the net and is honestly just
staring at your monitor all day long one
thing that's gonna become very important
to you is how well the text looks when
you're looking at it right I mean who
wants to look at a bunch of blurry text
in their monitor when they're trying to
see things all the text this particular
monitor is very very nice and even
though the monitor only really has about
93 pixels per inch as far as the density
goes you guys can see that everything
looks really really nice the text is
well drawn out the colors everything are
really really nice so even just looking
at webpages and doing stuff like that
it's really nice there's also a lot of
different brightness controls so if
you're going to be right
a letter working in Photoshop and stuff
like that you can adjust it to however
you're comfortable whatever it is that
you feel good with you can adjust the
monitor at that point so that it'll be
perfect for your viewing experience a
lot of times some of the monitors that I
get the text looks wacky I go on and I
play a monitor you know I go in and play
a game excuse me and everything looks
great but when I go to look at text it
lags this particular monitor doesn't lag
in the text Department whatsoever so for
general usage and for web surfing
obviously this monitor has you covered
but where does display HDR 400 come into
play well that comes into play inside of
the gaming environment now this
particular monitor has the latest
HDR on and it's certified but not all
games currently support this particular
feature so to really test it out you
know completely have to find different
games out there for yourself and test
those trying it but with that said
though let's jump in let's check out
some footage of games with HDR on and
hjr off and see what a difference
HDR really makes and for some reason if
you're a person out there you don't know
what HDR is whatsoever HDR is high
dynamic range and what it basically does
and what it really does is it makes sure
that all the light is as close to
natural as close to what the real
representative would be in real time so
if you're looking at grass or you're
looking at a scene outside all of the
areas are gonna be lit as close to
possible as what it's really supposed to
be like in real life so no dark areas
colors are much nicer colors and more
vibrant it basically just looks more
realistic than other things previously
and as we advanced two more different
HDR it's eventually I imagine that will
have HDR that looks pretty much exactly
like real life which will really help
with future and vr but with that said
though let's check out some gameplay so
switching between HDR on and HDR off
when it works you can see that it really
works and it works wells now not every
game out there is gonna totally work the
same way but in the games that it really
does work well in you can see a big
difference and in movies and stuff like
that HDR really comes across much more
vibrant than your standard formats the
monitor just looks
absolutely gorgeous I don't even notice
the difference between 8 and 10 bit
color especially in gaming all I know is
that when I'm gaming on this monitor
everything looks absolutely beautiful
and when I'm using my AMD card games are
being played
I see no screen tearing no ripping just
total gaming enjoyment without any eye
fatigue and I played games a little rate
for 6 or 7 hours as last Saturday and
the only thing that got tired in me was
my hand from scrolling back and forth
and trying to do all those damn
headshots but beyond that everything
looked awesome the X 3:23 are also
features super resolution now what this
means that when you're watching a movie
all of the detail is being pushed out to
its maximum performance levels it's
almost like upscaling not exactly the
same but very very close and everything
just looks nice
HDR just seems to make the colors pop
from your monitor and brings things just
a little bit closer to reality than they
were before if you're a person who is
really really picky about their gaming
monitor I mean you're the person who
likes all the best specs you can get but
you don't want to pay a bunch of money
out of your pocket to get the monitor
then honestly this monitor is probably
something you definitely want to check
out I plan on getting three these
monitors like I said putting them
together for surround vision and the
price is only 699 dollars a piece I'd be
going oh my god are only six hundred
ninety-nine dollars but check this out
we looked at that monitor from g-sync
right the one that was from Acer the
predator $2,000 you can pretty much get
three of these monitors for like $100
more and have surround vision free sync
to that's a really nice feature on this
monitor for you AMD fans out there or
looking for a great new monitor put to
your system this is definitely worth
checking out everything across the board
is really really nice it would have
probably been cool to have some speakers
put into it but that's really not a bank
breaker you know in any way to me a
deal-breaker rather um you can always
just use your headphones or speakers on
your desk having them inside the
monetarist it's kind of nice if you
don't want to use any speaker and just
you know play some generalized games
it's cool but not having in there like
this said not the end of the world 16 -
9 aspect ratio 2560 by 1440 for the
resolu
I mean honestly 144 Hertz just
everything about this motor is really
nice and if you don't really want to use
in your desktop you can use the basin
map that's built into it and you can
hook it up and put it onto a wall but me
personally that's not my not what I'm
wanting to do whatsoever this monitor is
definitely an editor's choice monitor
that is a fact
the ex3 203 is a really nice monitor I
just got to say that if you don't have a
lot of money but you want the highest
quality monitor out there this is
something to seriously check out yes
there are cheaper monitors on the market
they really are but they're probably
going to have a TN panel in them TN
panel is like the lowest panels like
this before that contrast ratio bad
viewing angles they're just not the
greatest monitors in the world for
gaming sure they'll get away with it but
having a panel that's in between I think
is the perfect spot like I said before
it's like the three bears thing you know
the bed over here is too hard this one's
too soft this one's right in the middle
and perfect and that's right where I
think this monitor fits right in so if
you guys want to get more information
about this monitor we'll have a link
down below you guys can purchase one or
just find more information about this
monitor on their side I think I coverage
somebody everything that there is but
hey who knows I'm human
sometimes I err I may have forgotten
something I don't think I did but hey
that's life so I know you guys been
watching techie tomorrow I'm off to play
some more games this monitor and even
just sitting back here behind me look at
this thing's beautiful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
