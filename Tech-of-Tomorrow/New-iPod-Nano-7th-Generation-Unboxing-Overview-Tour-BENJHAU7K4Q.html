youtube channel now today I'm bringing
you guys the unboxing and first look of
the new 16 gigabyte iPod Nano
now this little bad boy I have here is
the red one I bought this one to support
the people in Africa and the cause of
AIDS to help cure it I think that's a
pretty good cause there are other ones
out that you can get but this is the one
that I chose now this model comes with
everything inside of it so let's go
ahead and let's jump inside and start
checking this out so should be a little
sticker over here go ahead just pull
this little sticker off you can see will
be devirginizing the seal here she's a
no longer a virgin
gonna pop the cap off now this thing has
no external speakers whatsoever let me
get this little thing off here
wow those little trip it up pop it off
this all right so now before we actually
jump in and take a look at the device
let's do the power on button up here on
top a little of this you guys can see
that and there's a sticker here on the
front which actually shows us some of
things on I'm gonna go ahead and just
remove the sticker alright folks so now
that we've hit the power button we've
turned on you guys can see it as a 2.5
inch screen go ahead and hit the done
button
now we get to the main screen here where
it shows some of the features I'll start
at the bottom down here it has a radio
button now the headphones that are
inside of here they actually work as the
antenna for this there's no built-in
antenna and there's actually no built-in
speakers everything's from the
headphones right next to that we have
the photos button obviously this where
you gonna store your photos and those
type of things now there's no Wi-Fi but
there is Bluetooth 4.0 there is your
fitness button which actually calculates
your steps and stuff you're out running
and jogging you have your videos button
and obviously your music button so we'll
just go ahead and click and there's
absolutely nothing in here right now but
that's where you go to do it now that
we've seen the first page let's go ahead
and swipe over to the second page where
we can see the clock
we can also see the settings we can see
of your Bluetooth your general settings
your music settings video settings radio
settings all your settings all the way
down you can reset them with a button
right there and go back to the home
button again scroll back to our original
screen now down here on the bottom is
where you see the Lightning port just
like we saw in the iPhone 5 and the iPod
Touch and last but not least they had
phone port right here let me spin the
device around here the volume rockers up
and down as you can see on the screen it
gives you on-screen display shows you
what you're doing flip it around at the
top on the top all there is the power
button then last but not least we see
the back the back looks very nice it's
not gonna get all finger printing or
anything so it's a pretty nice unit I
think actually this thing's really nice
and its really small so let's move on
let's continue taking the rest of stuff
out of the box this is a some little
hello stuff not Hello Kitty but Hello
now this little thing right here this is
your product red card does this showing
you what you've got the cause you've
supported so let me set that down right
here is the Lightning charger as you can
see this little part right here is going
to insert into the unit and then this is
going to go into USB port easy money now
let's move on let's check out the
headphones now you guys know that Apple
sells headphones for $30 and they have a
mic in up now the only difference
between these headphones and those
headphones is that these do not have the
microphone now if you guys missed it
before I actually unboxed and test these
things in my iPod Touch video I put them
in my ear and listen to them and they
actually sound pretty good they also
have separate ports for both the bass
and the treble if you guys happen to
miss that unboxing video make sure you
check that out in the link in the
description below so that's pretty much
it folks you get this the little unit
you can choose your color and the
you support all $449 and if you guys
want to check out all the different
colors and availability make sure once
again that you check out the link in the
description below we'll see you guys
