what's going on deckers welcome back to
another edition of tech o tomorrow we've
got something really cool that just came
off of NDA as you're seeing it this
morning at 9:00 a.m. this is the new
Corsair 250 d now with those 250 people
basically this is a very small case you
can take anywhere you want takes mini
ITX motherboards it'll even fit two
full-sized video cards inside of it you
can put a 220 millimeter rad mounted
sideways inside of it it comes with two
fans 120 140 millimeter fan there's
options for all kinds of other fans
there's a window on top I mean this
thing's just really cool it's all matte
black finish well you guys will see us
me unbox this thing it's basically 89
bucks I think it's going to become a
very serious contender for those people
looking to make a little land boxes
steam machines whatever you want so with
that said let's go ahead and try to get
this thing out of the box it's actually
a pretty big box so let's go ahead make
a few little slices here and there I
don't want to see this box by the way
folks either
there's the bunch of sides with all the
specs in a bunch of different languages
so I'm that kind really wasted your eyes
this time with that and basically is
gonna carve this thing out like a sundae
pumpkin and hopefully does don't smack
too many times the system behind me
there and then get this thing out of the
box for you guys move out to the side
so inside I'll show you guys them you
guys can see it's all very well packed
so you're not too worried about in
shipping about it getting broke or
anything like that it'll come solid to
you guys so I'll just go ahead and take
it up like that set it on the table and
then do what you guys love for the box
to the bracket government we go
I had fun did you alright so check it
out they got more and more stuff to
unbox here put more little flying things
at the cabinet Oh landed on his head hit
the mic wait I got an idea
let me see you know I even you guys go
to like you know that's very far more
Disneyland and you guys throw stuff like
to get around the commune oh the corner
do you know to get like this on top the
guy's head so let me see moved I would
have alright so comes the manual
obsidian series 250d right here
construction with all that stuff I think
most of you guys out there watch the
challenge you guys they probably built
the system until you guys know your way
around a case so let's go ahead and spin
this thing around so alright folks you
guys can see little front panel here
it's removable there's a couple pieces
of tape right here I'll just jerk those
off there get the tape completely off
and in fact this looks all scratched up
on here but it's not you guys can see I
have to pull this film off so the stills
keeping the thing completely nice and
fresh I'm just gonna leave that on there
we're at the bat you guys can see one of
the fans right there let's see how take
apart about this thing is now remember
folks I just saw this thing like right
now with you so if I'm not all familiar
with how to totally disassemble it don't
be too angry with me but I'll figure it
out
everything just pops out you guys see
that screen comes out nice giant fan
right there in the foot so up here on
top we've got three different things on
this side we have your headphone your
microphone two USB 3.0 a big for your CD
drive or whatever you want got a little
power light right here down below that
is the whole fan of still but everything
we showed you guys a second ago so I'm
gonna go ahead check the guide on the
side right here there's an additional
fan right here but also you guys can
mount a sideways red inside the system
so that's gonna be pretty awesome I'll
start just taking this thing apart you
have to sign
on the very back we have thumbs Fuhrer's
so alright folks I couldn't totally get
it out with my hand so I got a little
tiny screwdriver to make it easier be
honest with you guys I mean I don't have
the most powerful hands in the world so
I mean somebody out there who's young
and stronger can probably pop this damn
thing off with a lot more simplicity hey
I admit it I'm getting a little bit
older Shh now I've got all these thumb
screws to be removed so I can take them
all off and we can see this thing as it
gets disassembled so pull these top two
off right here top piece now comes off
as you guys can see there's a window on
the top awesome for showing off the
inside of the system now I'm just gonna
flip this up right here here's that Bay
I showed you guys before you guys can
put a CD player or whatever the hell you
want there and you know blu-ray or
whatever it's your choice
inside all the case why our name is
gonna go ahead and turn up like this you
guys can all see it here is the other
fan right here so you have a hundred and
twenty millimeter 140 millimeter fan in
the front optional fans in the back
another side panel over here and these
are also removable grills I don't want
to totally pull them out but you can
blow them clean keep them clean
full-size power supply right here let me
get that again as well keep
disassembling this little bad boy as we
go another screw under the screw oh yes
sir I like it a day where I get screwed
yeah so alright let's go ahead and pop
this little bad boy out here as well
take these screws out remove them all
all right this comes off you can fit a
full-size power supply in there so
you'll have really no limitation on your
power there'll be two expansion slots
once you get inside there so you can put
two video cards axes right the system
I'm going to keep this disassembling it
because uh I know you guys like that so
let's just keep taking this thing apart
all the way down to as far as we can
pretty much get it I guess so take out
some more screws here inside of here I
believe we're all the accessories so in
a second when I get to the room you can
see the accessories
let's keep knocking these little things
out one by one
flying around here we go
more disassembly so their time now check
this out behind here we got the five and
a quarter base we have all the
accessories good black make it these out
of here so let's pull up so you can see
this right here all the bays excellent
require no tools you just pop your five
and a quarter in there kaboom
away you go up here on top two SSD
caddies where your two point five pull
those out very excellent very ergonomic
to get to so cut you guys see y'all deep
inside of there so also this other side
completely comes off so we're just gonna
keep going here we're just going to keep
taking this at them apart all the way so
more screws coming out and more petals
are coming off so you guys see this
another removable washable little grill
here's a side view with the side panel
off flip it around one more time
let's go ahead and remove the other side
panel completely off so you guys can see
in that as well there are a lot of
screws on the table now people I am
Telling You but the good thing about
that is you want to be able to get
inside your case so it's a really good
thing that courses like this because now
you can just totally get inside there
access everything don't have to worry
about crap do your modifications now I
think this thing is pretty badass
why well a lot of people make small
cases but a lot of them truthfully are
too damn small they're so smaller that
they become ineffective you know I mean
kind of like a small wanky it's just an
ineffective wanky you know just can't do
anything with it this thing however it
has play room on the inside
full-size power supply full-size video
cards I think this is going to be a
great thing the front it's simple easy
that's your power button right there I
think earlier I thought that was a light
residue but there's actually the power
button zone that's the power button and
that's pretty much it folks
all right folks so there you have it the
new Corsair 250 B pretty much broken
down and stripped down if I Whitney
further I'd have to tear it apart pull
in a pile and make it scrap metal and
that would just be going a little bit
too far yeah anyways I think this
thing's gonna be awesome if you guys
want more information about this down a
bit of life but in the description we
have all the details where you can
purchase this 89 bucks
free shipping pretty much the only thing
this thing doesn't have is a giant
handle but beyond that it's very very
portable I'm thinking we're gonna build
a system in this show it up and see what
all we can do I think since it can take
all the full-size parts we want to sit
there and go what will fit what will fit
it's gonna be pretty dynamic so do you
guys understand that makes you guys
