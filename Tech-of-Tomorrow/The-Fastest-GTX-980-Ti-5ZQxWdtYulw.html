980ti that's extremely overclocked with
a shit ton of features then let's check
out gigabytes TV and 98 t extreme dash 6
GD video card
so as we take a look at the front of the
card you guys can see there are three
fans but the really interesting thing is
that this middle fan actually spins in
the reverse direction of these fans and
gigabyte says that this actually helps
dissipate the heat more evenly and
better than a standard design which you
guys will actually see mmm works and few
folks out there who aren't familiar with
gigabyte cards they call this their wind
force cooling design this is actually
the third iteration of it and it works
damn well they also have another feature
on the card called a fan stop this is
part of their 3d cooling solution and
what it does that basically if your card
doesn't need the cooling the fans will
stop functioning and there's a little
button right up here that says fan stop
if this is lit that means you don't have
to freak out your cards not broken or
anything else it's just that it doesn't
need the cooling right now so the fans
they're not a-movin and while we're
still on basically the front side of the
card there's something really awesome
about this card that people out there
doing custom builds are going to totally
dig and this is the ability to do
sixteen point eight million different
color variations via the lights that are
back behind the car they're kind of hard
to see but there are a bunch of LED
lights back behind each fan and these
can all be set up to your own custom
color which is really cool so if you
have a theme in your system that has a
certain color you're gonna be able to
set your car to match that which i think
is a really really awesome feature and
just to be matchy-matchy and
color-coordinated the wind force logo
lights up in that same color as well now
I know just through video footage you
guys can't actually totally clearly see
the cooling system that's underneath the
card but this card is really fleshed out
it comes to the core base clock of
twelve hundred and sixteen megahertz and
a boost clock of thirteen hundred and
seventeen megahertz the standard clock
speeds are a thousand for the base and a
thousand seventy-five for the boost so
this is a massively overclocked card
right out of the box the card has a
memory clock speed of seventy two
hundred megahertz six gigabytes of gddr5
memory and a 384 bit memory
the card has a digital maximum
resolution of 4096 by 2160 which is
totally 4k capable and an analog max
resolution of 2048 by 1536 and real
quick as we look at the bottom of card
you guys can see more of the cooling
solution you guys can see those aluminum
heat fins and you can also see those
copper heat pipes and one of my personal
favorite features on any video card is a
killer backplate just like this one
totally solid protects your hand
protects your card now gigabytes
actually made the PCB to be much more
user-friendly than previous generation
so even if this wasn't on here the PCB
wouldn't cut your hand up at all it's
actually very user friendly and another
thing is is the whole PCB board is
covered in this whole new aircraft type
style coating that makes it so it'll
last much longer
this new aerospace PCB coating shields
the circuit board from things like dust
insects drop screws drill shavings and
abrasion the PCB is also moisture
resistant and it prevents unwanted
conduction pass and board damage this
should actually expand the lifetime of
your card as well because the card and
the PCB itself will stay pristine for a
much longer time and real quick before
we talk about the power requirements
let's take a look at the output on the
rear of the card this card features
three display ports a single HDMI and a
single DVI port as far as power
requirements go gigabyte recommends a
600 watt power supply to give this baby
enough juice to keep going and right
here on top you guys can see there are 2
8 pin power connectors but what's really
cool are these two little lights right
above the power connectors now when
these lights are staying solid that
means the cards getting the perfect
amount of electricity to it and
everything's gonna be a-okay but if you
see these lights blinking that means the
cards having trouble with its power you
should definitely be looking into what's
going on but one of the most absolutely
crazy features about this card is its L
and 2 function and all you got to do to
enable that is push this little button
on the end here now it also has though
an additional 6 pin power connector
which means a cards gonna get even more
power now me
you we're probably not going to go out
and get all this L into a cool we're not
going to pour liquid nitrogen into our
card but for those people out there who
do this this is a really extremely
awesome feature but even out of the box
with the cooling that's on it this card
does great overclocking like I said
right out of the box man the base clock
in this thing is 12 16 and the
overclocked boost is 13 17 that's just
right out of the box and that's almost
2,000 points above the standard
reference clock speed and this card
stays cool so huh shit works and last
but not least also in the back of the
car do you guys can see there are two
SLI fingers and yes this bad boy can be
done in quad at SSI now before we jump
into the benches though I have to
mention that there are a few features
about this car that are actually under
the hood and you can't see with the neck
and eye and these are all part of the
ultra durable series which means they
use the absolute best parts that they
can find they have two extra rounds of
copper they have the best MOSFETs the
best chokes just absolutely the best
parts they call this gauntlet picking
which means they hand pick and
cherry-pick all the parts of these cards
to make sure that they're the absolute
best that they can be and another thing
that helps with the extreme overclocking
is the 12 plus 2 power phases and unlike
the reference design the 12 plus to
power phase actually keeps the MOSFET
running at a much lower temperature
which ensures stability throughout the
card all of gigabytes extreme gaming
graphics cards are engineered to the
same quality as a Titan X which means
they use the highest grade capacitors
and chokes which should mean higher
performance and a longer lifespan of
your card
all right Tucker so there you have it
the aesthetics of the card it speeds and
feeds its special features but now let's
jump into the benchmark song and see how
this card does against the competition
in Windows 10 it's time to run
all right you're back so there you guys
have it folks now you guys concede that
this card right now is the fastest gtx
980ti we've have ever tested it actually
even inches ahead if not just by a wee
bit then that so Tech 98 Ti extreme that
we tested a long time ago now that car
was the fastest card for the longest
time but this card is just like I said a
wee bit faster and it's just a wee bit
cooler as well and that's going to help
in using that boost now these guys have
their own OC Gru's software for
overclocking honestly I don't really
like that I prefer afterburner or
something from EVGA either one of those
works to me a lot better I didn't really
even do too much overclocking at all I
played around too but for me honestly
these clock speeds are perfect for me I
don't want my card to burn out I like
buying the highest end card that's
already overclocked so that when you get
it you can just keep it that way in your
car to run for a really long time now if
I was out there trying to you know get
some a high number out there in 3dmark
or something like that
then maybe I go ahead and screw around
with that and do it but really I like
the card I like it the way it is and I'd
like to keep those you know fans running
for me as you know low as possible does
not create a huge noise disturbance now
before in the last video we talked about
something in that system you guys said
oh my god I work you know you guys
played the music and how do we know if
this system well that same system and
it'll actually have to break the mood
here but it's in the background or not
you guys can't hear it the tea buyer
system is very very quite fun to throw
that out there sorry to interrupt the
flow now this card though does a few
caveats it's almost seven or bucks it's
like you know teetering between the six
and seven hundred dollar mark depending
on where you get it at we'll have a link
below where you guys can check out more
information about the card or if you
guys want to purchase one it'll be there
as well
but overall I gotta say that this card
is pretty damn badass it's obviously a
very very long card though it's gonna
take up a lot of space in a case so make
sure that you have the right case of
things not doing that saggy thing that
people complain about you want to have
the you know proper support for your
card but other than that you guys can
see this thing's fast it runs really
cool and like I said there's plenty of
headroom in there within those
temperatures to do even more dish
overclocking so if you love doing that
kind of stuff then this card might be
the one that you are looking for now I
haven't actually got a hold of any of
the EVGA stuff lately I'd like to get
one of their cards in and try their
precision software and see if it's any
faster I guess I'll have to contact
Jacob over there and see what's up but
for me personally right now this
particular version the GB long
nomenclature - NV u X extreme - 6g D is
the fastest card we've seen yet I want
to see your guys's comments down below
and also before you guys say why aren't
are using a bunch of more new games man
I just barely got stuff set up in the
Windows 10 and got it going we'll bring
more stuff as we do it I'll get more
cards and increase the testing but for
now this is what I got at least I got
the you know the new OS and everything
upgraded a new test system so just bear
with me so peace out we'll see you guys
background checking tomorrow where we
got even more systems coming and
obviously more giveaways see you next
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
