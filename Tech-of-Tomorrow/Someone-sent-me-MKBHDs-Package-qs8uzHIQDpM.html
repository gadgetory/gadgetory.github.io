in a shiny little silver box and is
actually addressed to marques Brownlee
say what that's right this little thing
came in the mail and as you can see it
came due marques Brownlee a tech of
tomorrow now I looked on the Employee
List and I didn't see you know marques
listed as an employee and I checked my
PayPal account there wasn't fifty bucks
in there so he didn't buy the business
so I'm just wondering you know why this
was sent to marques but in any case what
actually comes inside of this little
silver case is the t9 transformer now
run up the bat I'm going to say this
thing is 400 frickin dollars and
honestly right now I don't even think
it's really fully functional I could not
get the app to work whatsoever but
what's inside of this little case go
ahead and just pop open these little
clicky taboos over here and bring it out
is a robot so I may go ahead and just
for you folks do this sort of unboxing
I'll go ahead and pull the top off over
here we've got all the lovely charging
cables more charging cables this is all
stuff that came in the box we've even
got keys to startups like it's some
automobile mobiling you know I'm saying
so you get all this lovely packing
material absolutely no additional charge
that's right for free at the caravan
yeah take that cameraman what we're
missing one okay there we go we get that
out of the way then inside inside to see
inside this little thing here the dogs
riding around trying to play that and so
is the cat so we're gonna pull it out
and then here we go check this little
bad boy out oh boy it's a thrilling
little guy right here now the build
quality on this thing is okay it's not
like super duper tough or anything like
that it's actually kind of just okay so
the robot looks pretty cool and it's
made and not so great not so cheap but
let's turn on and let's see what it
actually does a little button under here
so I got a turn hold it on
hello humanity I'm interstellar region
t9 interstellar agent t 9 t 9t 9 t9 yo
t9 and transform
are you deaf dumb and blind t 9 like I
said very buggy product you could see up
so you're trying to get it to go t 9 t9
robot very buggy let's see if Jesus can
get to go to Cameron he got to go
yesterday see if it'll recognize your
voice now t 9 now probably we can get
him to do that facing the camera
t 9t 9 transform Wow unbelievable 4
bucks for this piece of crap
$400 none of those are addressed to
Marquez anyone to drive him crazy not me
t9 yo t9 yo Tina
transform
let's see if we get this on camera now
t9 I wanna kill it you try it again
t9 troubles fell off the damn table t 9
t9 for these lecture voice what's the
deal try it again geez t9 crap robot
table twice
alright so that's really all right now
it does after all that hassle all the
killer robot everything else all it'll
do right now is transform it charges up
pretty simply by the little charging
cable here has a keys you can lock
people out so they can't use it but
right now at 400 bucks come on seriously
folks it's a pretty badass idea I give
it that the idea around this is totally
solid and it could be a really good
product but right now this product sucks
it is definitely not worth 400 bucks in
any way shape or form no app out I'm
kind of confused as why they're even
sitting this robot out when there's no
app yet I don't know kind of tripping on
that but as you see right now really
doesn't like the sound of my voice very
much I'll try it you know one more time
just for Evo shots and Google's but p9 t
9 t9 t9
hello benign benign benign mmm 89 T 1999
what t9 I give up on this thing what the
link down below but for bucks save your
money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
