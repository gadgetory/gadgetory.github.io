once back again got the dog in my lap
because he just won't leave me alone he
refuses to not be on camera but that
said we're going to go ahead and bring
you the unboxing age with me and buddy
the dog our mascot what are we going to
unbox today over my shoulder here you
guys can see I've got a thermaltake 730
watt power supply this is their new
smart series of power supplies it
features a five year warranty and it's
80 plus certified so that said let's
actually see what actually comes in this
little box
okay here we go it's the next part of
the unboxing the actual unboxing itself
the actual wham bam thank you ma'am or
the entire thing start off with a little
knife cut right here gently slice it
there schenley make another incision
there I'm like a doctor I make an
incision I just can't prescribe you
anything that's all I can prescribe your
happiness please have a happy day that's
what I'm prescribing I'm prescribing a
happiness let's go ahead and remove this
utter plastic and see this get that all
out of there like usual I'm going to go
ahead and just to bring the box up
towards the camera lens so you guys get
a better look at the box now this is not
so much glare you guys see smartseries
no gimmicks built to work five-year
green 80 plus 730 wats good stuff poop
it around show you guys the back and
actually you know what folks who tells
you everything it's right here so I'm
just going to come over here and read to
you as far as the connections go it has
one main power connector a 22 24 pin it
has 180 x 12 volt for your motherboard
it has four of the PCI six plus two
connectors for stated connectors it has
eight for peripherals for and for a
floppy disk it actually has one which is
kind of funny must be one of a floppy
disk but it's got it all in there so
this was basically all the cable so you
guys know what they are let's actually
go in and see what comes in the box so
go ahead just pop the top here once
again you see it's all nice and packaged
got the thermal tape cool your life got
the English manual here and the cool
your life things going to tell you all
the different stuff once again it
actually shows us all the different
connectors and what they're for go ahead
and move out of the way that's the box
empty now so i'll give her the box off
the side here's the power cable you guys
all know that your normal standard power
cable it's in there and actually some
screws are in there to mount the power
supply to your case if you so choose do
so all right move along go over here we
talked about all those different
connections that were on there a minute
ago i'll go ahead and try to get these
out of here so you guys can take a look
at them all all stretched out
alright so now we got that tricky bugger
off let's just start breaking it all
down piece by piece got the 24-pin power
here nice and good to go there may break
these other ones out of here they're all
actually designated by different colors
too as you'll see here the different
ones i'm using have different colors
these cables right here which I'm trying
to get entangled and successfully these
cables right here are all your VGA
cables you can see there's three of
these on here got those each one can be
changed into either a 6 or an 8 then we
have all of the SATA connections right
here I'm trying to look for that one
little islands edit new and it said
there was one single cable in here for
your old floppy drives and I'm trying to
see that up just right here and here's a
single floppy connector you'll probably
never use it but they're going to just
take the thing out of total package
package alright so here's the actual
unit itself I'm gonna try to get this up
by the Cameron so you can get a nice
good shot of it you guys can one see
it's the smart series 731 just want to
emphasize once again in this unboxing
video like you did the other that these
power supplies are geared to work
they're not meant for high end they're
not killed for fancy frills they're just
built for a guy who just wants to build
a system and get it up and going I think
that's a good motivation you guys can
see on the thing flip it around they
want you to really know about the
five-year warranty the 80-plus and the
green these are all important things
that people are pushing these days
flipper on the back you guys can
actually see in there and sell a nice
copper and everything on an off switch
right there show you guys the bottom of
the fans at give you guys a 360 look oh
my god it's 360 oh my god what's he
doing it's a 360 view of the thing oh my
god what's he doing it's the new kind of
unboxing it's to make you dizzy unboxing
you are getting sleepy no I'm just
kidding anyways guys thanks for watching
