I don't know about you but I could
definitely use some management in my
life we do does this although a sleek
fun and intuitive interface and best of
all it's a totally free app take Vance
whatsup glad to see you guys back from
the channel now today we have something
really really nice going on 29 total
test of the RX Vegas 64 liquid-cooled
Edition this is the gigabyte version of
the card which honestly looks quite a
bit like the reference model so we have
27 games to synthetic test will tell you
what test isn't we tested it on how we
got to our results the temps and
everything else and at the end of the
day you guys can tell me and tell
yourself as well whether you think this
card is worth your hard in cash so with
that said let's jump in let's check out
the card the test system and then let's
check out those performance numbers the
gigabyte rx Vegas 64 liquid cool edition
looks exactly like the reference cards
that you saw on launched I only it has a
liquid cooler now there are however a
couple of differences between the liquid
cooled version and the air cooled
version and they are these now you're
going from 295 Watts up to 345 watts on
the liquid cooled version and we also
see that the base and boost clock speeds
are also increased the liquid cooled
version also has a 120 millimeter fan
and radiator so it should have fit in
just about any system alright tech fan
so here you guys can see the system that
we use for all the testing in today's
video it contains an Intel Core i7 now
this thing is run at 4.6 gigahertz with
turbo boost constantly on and the
motherboard using this test system was
the asrock z170 em and it was flashed
the latest bios before testing 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory from kingston
running at 3333 megahertz and also as
well as the gigabyte RX vega 64 liquid
cool addition we also tested two
different founders edition cards the 8
gigabyte gtx 1080 and the 11 gigabyte
gtx ten atti now as far as the test
configuration software goes we use the
latest version of Windows 10 with all
the patches and we use three different
drivers for the video card testing for
the GTX 1080
we use the 384 0.94 driver for the gtx
1080i we use the 3/8 5.2 8 driver and
for the Vega we use the
latest driver which is a 17-point 30
alright folks so there you have it the
test system the card itself and its
features but now real quick before we
jump into the benchmarks let's hear a

check out we do but with that said let's
rock out to the benchmark song and let's
check out those benches
all right Tech fans so there you have it
now you guys can see that no word in any
of the scores does this card actually
beat a GTX 10 atti
now that said a gtx 1080i liquid-cooled
and this card liquid-cooled
are pretty much identical in price so as
far as me like saying hey man go out and
buy this card I honestly can't do that
the fact that it only beats a 1080 in
some places and because you guys can see
in the testing market switches back and
forth between beating it and cost the
same as a car that actually runs faster
I just can't logically do that like I
told you guys many times before I go for
the best performance for my dollar and
the best performance mine for my dollar
at this time is still a GTX 10 atti so
even after all this waiting and all the
talking and hype the card is pretty much
equal to a 1080 and a 1080 is a lot less
money like I said before then trying to
get one of these liquid cooled cards so
my opinion on that is the cards nice you
know it ran at 65 Celsius throughout the
testing even a pretty hot area so that's
a really nice thing about the card but
the thing is with all the money that's
going on the price increases and all the
things are just going on around that and
I just want to clarify one time guys I
don't blame AMD for the price gouging at
any of these stores but they did raise
the prices by $100 on the RX Vega cards
that it's a fact it's undisputed that is
a known thing I'm not hating on them for
that but they're still the thing is
those 399 s what I told you know was
what I was told it was what a card would
be for the rx 56 version and it's
nowhere near that and we see the rx 64
is way higher than that so unless you're
just a person who's gonna buy a car
because they want to have a name or I
guess if you're a Meier who does mining
then this might be the card for you but
I have to say as far as gaming goes and
stuff like that if I was going to go out
right now and I was gonna buy a Vega
card I would buy into 56 honestly I said
it before it's right in that sweet spot
it's almost as fast as the 64 I mean
there is a little bit of difference in
it but not enough that I feel for
spending that X
your money so at the end of the day you
guys can see that hey the RX Vega even
the liquid cool edition it swaps blows
back and forth with the 1080 cannot beat
a 1080i so that's where it's at
I don't make these things up they are
just the facts folks like usual we'll
have a link down below for more
information for this and also over to
Marc's written review so if you guys
want to see a full-blown just written
review then you guys can go check out
mark site where he does all that stuff
he's also the guy who did all the
testing on this so peace out thanks mark
we appreciate your time and we'll see
you guys back here for more stuff on
Vega this time 10 games the VR and also
for those people said oh my god you guys
aren't testing in DirectX 12 oh hey
check it out
there were a bunch of DirectX 12 games
in this test so beasts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
