once again to the channel now I know
right off the bat I'm going to say that
there are so many companies out there
that make earbuds that it is
mind-boggling
and honestly sound is probably one of
the most subjective subjects out there
because me trying to relate what these
things sound like to you through a video
is very very hard and what I'm gonna
think sounds golden you might not like
as well you might prefer more base you
might prefer more of a clarity type
thing so sound is a very subjective
thing and everyone has their own type of
sound that they like and kind of the
reason for today's video is a friend of
mine he had a brand new I you know
iPhone 7 well that's not new now since
the iPhone ain't came out but he totally
screwed up his his his air pod things
you know the Apple ones and they're like
a hundred and fifty freaking bucks to
buy a pair and honestly only real
differences between these ones I'm going
to show you today and those are about
two hours of listening time that's
really it and that the ones from Apple
are a little bit more high clarity
they're a little bit more bosey so we
did a video a little while back for this
company called Benny
they're like true Wireless you know
earphones earbuds whatever you want to
call them however you like to
nomenclature them yourself so we got a
couple approximate so real quick and
we'll have a link right here if you guys
want to see the first video we had one
of their sets in a top five video but
today we're gonna be looking at a
product from Benny now these are the
Benny true Wireless in-ear earbuds
however you want to call them and
they're super light they're like 4.5
grams and the only real difference is
like I said between these and the Apple
products are very very mild now Apple
product however is a hundred and fifty
dollars these are like 34 bucks 34
dollars which means that you could buy
five pairs of these for the same thing
as buying the Apple product and what's
cool about these is they're have a lot
in common
they have a little carrying case that
you carry around them it has a 7 and 50
milliamp hour battery and what's cool
about this is that if you're out going
somewhere and you need to emergency
charge your phone hey you've got a
charger right there with you that's
taken wherever you're going where you're
taking your headphones now inside the
box you get the carrying case which it
also doubles as a charger the USB cable
the headphones themselves and two
different size of earbuds and this
why I do not know movies for your
Christmas tree using the Benny's just
like any Bluetooth device is very simple
you just pair them up with whatever
Bluetooth device that you're using and
then after that you're good to go
now controlling the Benny's is very easy
one button does it all you have
answering your phone
play and pause all in a single spot now
the Benny's offer two hours of
continuous listening time 120 hours of
standby and it takes an hour and a half
to get them fully charged and like I
said in the very beginning the video
they're very lightweight 4.5 grams
that's SuperDuper light and they come
with different earpieces so no matter
what size your ear is they're going to
fit inside them as well honestly folks
there's not a whole lot that you can say
through a video about headphones and
headphone technology out to the public I
wish I had a way haven't you guys
listened to them so you could really
hear the differences one thing I want to
say though these headphones aren't made
for working out if you put them in your
ears and you go try running or doing
stuff like that in the gym they will
fall out of your ears that's a definite
fact if you're just doing listening
walking riding a bike and stuff like
that it's total comfort the sound is
definitely right down the middle it has
enough bass to sound it really nice it's
not really SuperDuper on the high end
troubling thing like Bose I know that
some people prefer that kind of sound so
if you're a person you prefer that kind
of sound then you may want to look for
something more expensive but the great
thing about these things let's just face
this you know whether you have an Apple
device or any devices out there and you
want a pair of wireless headphones you
don't want to spend a lot of money on
them because if you break them or you
lose them or anything else you're just
gonna be totally screwed and plus I
really like the thing about the biddings
is the fact that it comes with its own
little charging thing the fact that you
can take that little charger with you
and store your headphones in it and you
can be at the gym on top of the mountain
wherever you're at and all of a sudden
you've got no signal for your phone and
your an emergency you can plug right
directly into that and you can charge
your phone now that just alone I think
is cool and that's something that I did
not believe that the Apple product has
whatsoever so between the two products
if you want to say actually something
better about the Bene than the Apple
product well that right there is
actually something better about it as
far as like I said if you're looking for
bose like stuff that's just clean and
honestly i
feel both stuff is kind of stale I've
never really liked it some people like
that kind of sound but I've never been a
bose fan I've never owned any their
speakers because all the ones I've ever
had I thought were just too clean for me
I didn't I don't like that that that
sterile feel so if you like headphones
that have nice middle ground sound with
a nice amount of bass decent listening
time absolute great price and like I
said you can charge your phone from the
same thing this might be something that
you guys want to really take a look at
and like I said man who wants to pay a
hundred and fifty dollars for
replacement headphones we'd like I said
you can buy five pairs of these for the
same thing I mean you could literally
have one for your house one for the gym
one for your motorcycle one for your
girlfriend you know and one for your
side lover you know alright folks so
here is the bottom line you're an Apple
guy your air pods break you don't want
to spend a ton of cash and you want
to get a replacement that you can afford
these will definitely fit that bill and
there's even some things about it that
are even nicer if you're just a guy out
there looking for a pair of decent you
know earbuds that won't break the bank
these Benny's will definitely fit the
bill they're lightweight they're
comfortable they sound really good and
at the end of the day like I said most
people out there don't have a whole lot
of money and that always comes into
concern so me I feel these are pretty
decent for just the guys out there
looking for a solid set of headphones
but for you Apple guys out there who
want to look for replacement for those
air pods and don't want to break the
bank it's definitely a double thumbs up
I'm Eric you guys been watching teka
tomorrow down below that like button
we'll have all the information about
these so if you want to buy a pair just
check out more information for yourself
it will be there peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
