with travis from steelseries at the 2014
CES about to take a look at another
product this time a totally wires mouth
at his own base colors up all around it
and actually the same thing I think I
think it lasts like 14 hours has about a
three and a half hour charge but let's
let Travis talk a little bit more about
this latest product from steel series
yeah sure this is our sensei wireless
it's a right yeah exactly oh I don't
have my black belt ready don't I'm sorry
than I apologizing I'm sorry on a boat
man much apologies so yeah this is our
sensei wireless it's based off with the
mouse that was launched in 2011 it's by
far and away or most popular mouse we
decided to make a wireless so he updated
a little bit original how to brush
aluminum like skin on the outside this
one's just ain anti-sway rubber coating
features aluminum though pays homage to
the original on the top right here which
is pretty light to rights TPI indicator
yeah and it's very late for a wireless
mouse obviously the weight factor is
more on the actual charging plate and
that's also the transmitter as well so
charge the mouth very simple and one
thing really cool about this folks is
that it actually has a color charge
around the side of it so what if it
lights up different colors it means it's
going out so it's let it green you know
that your product is totally good to go
start sliding up yellow it means get
your together it's about to go out
and well if it hits read than you're
dead so you know we're de view numbers
there but the so when's this thing going
to come to market this is going to be
available at the end of quarter one this
year run on you do happen to the street
price yet it's gonna be recommended
straight price yeah exactly it's gonna
be one 59 99 once 89 99 and you know
really weird there's like their hotel
room here they really want you to have a
good time in their hotel room I get I
just had to bring this up because for
$45 you know just remember this you go
to the MGM hotel for forty five dollars
you can get yourself an intimacy kit
that's right an intimacy kit I was going
to get this for the cameramen and you
know let him have it with my with mother
friend Anthony let them go at it you
know but they told me they have separate
rooms but I don't believe it neither do
you so but so this would be a good
Christmas gift for somebody the intimacy
kit you know or if you're just feeling
can get the MGM hotel that's about it
but hey stay tuned man we've got a
little bit more from steel series this
year we'll be right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
