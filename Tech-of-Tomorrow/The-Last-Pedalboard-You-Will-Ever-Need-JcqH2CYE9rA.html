guys should know that all the music that
you hear on the channel is written by me
or one of my guitar players here with
with Sean Hernandez or Jesse hunter were
the guys writing the music sometimes
it's use the Cameron once in a while we
mix things around but all the music that
you hear we write I play a lot of guitar
sing screw around the bass and stuff
like that and you guys have seen we've
started to do more music type videos and
as 20-19 progresses excuse me with the
frog in my throat we are going to
continue to do more things in this type
of nature now you guys have seen my
giant amp wall well we're gonna start
using it more recording stuff and in
that vein I really wanted to have a
pedal board that could be simply used on
the front end and have a lot of cool
stuff on it but not have to have as many
pedals as I've had in the past so the
first thing I really wanted to do is get
a pedal board that I could put all these
components on because I have all these
components over here now I've been
working with a guy named Christian he is
the guy who works over at Eventide and
he gave a lot of recommendations and
stuff so I've been following his lead in
fact one of the products that I got is
from Morningstar effects it's this
really cool I mean really super duper
and cruel cool MIDI controller we'll
look at that today but first let's start
off with this new tool Pro 1525 this is
a giant pedal board and it's by free but
if you guys don't know Friedman this is
Dave Friedman he makes all kinds of amps
all kinds of stuff and I've seen these
things in person and they're made like a
tank and it's big enough to actually
have the pedals I want and even have the
pedal for the amp on there if I want so
I just thought we'd take a quick look at
this this bad boy because this thing's
just humongous I mean I got my bat-knife
right here
that knife said uh all right here we go
good take a little slice here a little
slice I hear a little more slices over
here because there's a lot of tape on
this that bang thing and there's a lot
of tape and I'm not gonna bore you guys
with all the details of just the boxing
this particular thing because this is
just a project that I'm doing I thought
I'd share with you folks so I thought
you guys would be interested to see how
it goes along on Sunday Anthony the guy
who builds all the systems for me and
stuff he's going to come over and I will
design the layout of the system and
everything that's going to be done on
the layout and then Anthony will make
all the cabling and everything and you
know beautiful and perfect like he's
famous for so together as a team we'll
be doing that I might even be at a
camera right now as I do this but I'm
just trying to figure out where all the
cuts and everything are in this gigantic
solar box cuz man let me tell you this
thing is as you can see gigantis or it's
huge
oh that did not feel good it was not
part of the video no animals were
written in the making of this video but
I would slightly hurt innovation in this
video let's see if I can even get this
thing out man this thing is just crazy I
mean it looks like there's not gonna be
any really pretty way for me to get this
out of here I keep looking for a nice
pretty way to get it out of here but
honestly I am NOT singing oh okay wait
okay we have got maneuvering here one
end is opened up I guess I just was
looking at it long enough that way was
gonna pop over to the side but note if
pop opens there so okay excellent okay
buddy look out little poppers
look out okay there might be a the Oh
missing by that much
all right now one thing really cool and
one of the reasons I got this particular
pedal board as well is that check this
out inside of the this thing is a pick
up camera it is a giant giant giant
sized bag
like plastic and oh and distort as it
hit the cameraman alright so looks like
this is the bottom you gotta yada yada
okay so we'll take a look here
but anyways a big giant case strap
I bet inside there's probably a longer
strap for putting around and carrying
around as much you want but anyways
you've got at least a handle for it
right now it's kind of light but I
guarantee you when you put all your
petals on it it's going to wait quite a
bit more this particular one is made
like a tank like I said it's going to
come with all of these accessories and
stuff so no matter what power supply
that you're going to be using this
particular one give me one second brand
new product coming out from Eventide ooh
the power max this thing is awesome
real quick since we're doing a little
video on this I'll just let you guys see
this this is the box that it comes in
right here I'm not gonna do a bunch of
re camera refocusing and everything
because I'm just trying to like do an
overall video about this stuff but
everything in the box you get all your
instructions and all your manuals and
all that stuff but what's great about
this is this device can be set there's
plugins on the side plugins here so
you've got a total of what four five six
seven seven total plugins you've got USB
there's feet on it
which I don't really think I'm going to
be using this particular thing and every
single one of these can be set for
whatever voltage you want to be so it's
an 18 volt pedal there's some little
click buttons you just click them into
position you want 12 9 whatever you want
it's all here which i think is great
because sometimes the pedals aren't all
9 volt now with this particular product
the pro 1525 it actually has they have
like this what is it isolated power
supply and this other this other little
thing that like makes all your devices
working the same electrical current so
nothing gets you know gets weird
sounding it's Baloo I can say there's no
electronical differences so it makes it
very quiet
I wanted to use this particular power
supply so I didn't choose to get that
option but this is it and you get all
these cool connectors in here as well so
everything you want to do all your
connectors are all this type so I'm not
going to totally get into it but they're
all very easy simple to use and this
will work great for my purposes of what
I'm gonna be doing so all the material
to get it all strapped in that's all
here now let me pull this out of here
and I'll gently take the case I don't
want to thrash the case or anything I
don't think there's anything else in the
case may be there is it feels like there
might be something in here hold on okay
yes like I said shoulder strap I knew
would have this so we got to chill the
strap I'll stick that back in there and
I will try to just gently set this on
the floor over here all right there we
go
now right now this thing is pretty light
it's made like a tank though and what's
cool about it is it's two levels and
this particular product right here can
be moved to any position on it so if
you're a lefty you on the left hand side
you on the right hand side you can
actually buy extra one so if you wanted
to have actually every single one of
your pedals down here at a slant and
with something in the middle you could
do that as well
very interesting layout I like it
there's one other pedal that I have
coming it's my expression pedal it was
supposed to come today but it just
didn't get here so in essence though my
pedal board is kind of going to be
somewhat looking like this I had these
two these are two of my favorite preamps
this woman I used by itself onto a clean
channel or directly in the back this one
I can use in front of my power tubes and
it sounds just absolutely great then I'm
going to have two of the h9s boom axes
it's on two of the h9 it's probably over
here I'll figure out as I go I'll have
another one right here now Morningstar
this thing is pretty dang incredible now
online
this thing was just insanely and
credible and thanks James for shipping
this out to me now these guys said that
they would send me one of these as a
review sample but they were out of stock
so I went ahead and bought one hopefully
the guys over there will be kind enough
to send me my review sample and then if
they do I will give this one away to you
guys so let's hope they do so inside of
here you just get a hello little
Morningstar thing but this hooks up to
USB so it can hook directly to your Mac
or your PC and then it's a MIDI
controller and this MIDI controller is
very very small so I'll probably have
this probably right down here and then
we'll see what's gonna go on over here
have enough room for seven pedals in my
expression pedal so this is going to be
really nice now this thing this window
right here this thing this morning star
this particular MIDI controller is very
awesome like I said it has MIDI as your
instrument through heads or USB and this
little window lights up and if you go
online you can program all of the
different stuff to control the Eventide
pedals and if you have MIDI control in
your app you can program this pedal to
control all of that stuff and like three
or four of my amps that I have over here
especially like my high end hughes &amp;amp;
kettner all have MIDI capabilities to be
controlled and I plan on taking full
advantage of that now there is one other
product and I wish it would fit on this
pedal board and I actually whit's it was
out in the market right now and this is
this brand new boss Wazza and it's gonna
be this insane product it's going to be
insane it's an attenuator that has all
of the killer boss Oise effects built
into it so all of these amps that I have
that are super high-end that I can't
play you know in my house because I
needed to tranq them up I can now play
because this thing will take 150 watts
and it has all those effects into it so
no reverb on the amp ain't no problem
you want effects no problem and guess
what it can all be operated off this
Morningstar MIDI controller so I have a
lot of fun stuff going so I just wanted
to share this with you guys I'm like I
said on Sunday Anthony's going to be
coming over and he will be helping me
put this
together I'll also have links down below
if you guys want to check out some of
these products for yourself and by the
way there's no money being paid to me
anywhere and nobody is giving me
anything these guys happen to give me
the products everything else I bought
out of my pocket so that's pretty much
where it stands but if you guys want
more information or want to check out
some of these products we'll have links
and like I said I've got a lot of more
music stuff coming up I've got a Panama
amp review coming up this is their brand
new hot rod 18 watt and they have a
brand new speaker cabinet that has a
built in attenuator in the speaker
cabinet you can crank that baby up and
have room volume right there in your
half stack I'm mark you guys watching
ticker tomorrow we'll see you guys back
here on the channel for more rock and
more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
