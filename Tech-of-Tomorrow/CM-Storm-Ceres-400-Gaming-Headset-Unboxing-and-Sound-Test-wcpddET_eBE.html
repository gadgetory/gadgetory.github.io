workfare is here once again on the tech
of tomorrow YouTube channel bringing you
a great new product unboxing and first
look what's up today well today we have
the Coolermaster CM storm series 400
headphones now these are totally geared
for the gamer they're supposed to be
soft very comfortable they have a
microphone they're actually supposed to
be about $40 as well depending on where
you're at I've seen them anywhere from
60 to 40 depending where you buy them
now let's jump in and see what these
headphones have to offer you as a gamer
all right folks so let's start off a
little different let's start off the
side of the box and let's just take a
look at all the specifications going on
down there you can see the drivers
frequency response the impedance in 32
ohms sensitivity all the way down you
can see the microphone the microphone
supposed to have noise cancellation so
like if you're talking in it's supposed
to be the background noise and stuff
doesn't get picked up makes it clear to
talk with just a although all the way
down here the hardware requirements
pretty simple your system you're going
to need to make sure that you have
Windows 7 it says or XP or some other
stuff there also Cooper on the other
side we're a little system requirements
thing system requirements Windows 7
Vista and XP designed in Taiwan made in
China so just flip it around the back
says here the CM 4 series foreigner
delivers high quality sound in a rugged
yet comfortable and lightweight frame
high quality 40 millimeter drivers bring
out every detail in the game so you can
react quickly and hear where the action
is sound absorbing cushions sit
comfortably on your ears and help block
out distractions or shadow from other
gamers so if you're in a room and
supposed to block that stuff out into
the series 400 lets you enjoy the
comfort quality and competitive edge
recessional grade gaming headset
whenever you do so so that's pretty much
that
you guys see there from the box and see
it's basic stuff there I'm gonna hang on
to that very long and just have the
camera and just focus or so you can see
it now let's actually look at the
product so got my trusty little knife
here this is the defender knife if you
guys want to know about that that
defender knife it can defend yourself
I've got the camera wish to dad in his
hands we could slice me but nope
unfortunately I always have the knife
for Jesus hi
I know you guys see I see the comments
you guys feel sorry for the poor bastard
you guys are like poor Gabbar been
somebody he'll form a lawsuit oh go back
and collect I look at all the abuse
those guys did to me over on the channel
man so let's pull these things out ever
so slowly out of here I will set the
boxers off the side instead of throwing
at the cameramen today because he was a
good kid today so I'm just peel them out
of a little box here the cables all back
in here I'll tape in and everything you
guys have seen me do unboxings and stuff
before this now I'm actually gonna try
not to rip the box to pieces so look I'm
gonna be all mr. ginger here and no I
don't mean mr. ginger like I have red
hair
I mean ginger like is being nice and
nice and tender with it and see if I
cannot rip the box to pieces
so I'm famous for from these boxes to
pieces whenever we do these damn girls
am I going to be all succeed or will the
Box succeed against me let's see here
trying to still get it off nope I don't
think there's really any way to do it
you actually have to go ahead and do a
little tearing isn't that wonderful
so there we go after a little bit of
tearing I can get the rest of the stuff
out so here we go
and I'm obviously them after the same
thing on the top I didn't want to but
hey no choice again so you have to rip
the cardboard set it off the side all
the cabling and everything is all in
here so let's pull this out so you guys
can see that
get the camera men to zoom in on there
you can see one plug is going to go to
your headphones one plug is going to go
to your mic so it one is sound on his
voice yada-yada-yada hooter here's your
CM storm stuff that has the key features
again omnidirectional microphone
adjustable head fit for a perfect fit
adjustable headband rather
90 millimeter ear pads provide the most
outstanding comfort anyways it's the
manual got some stuff just talks about
some of their products you guys aren't
really interested in that so also inside
the box in here and phones are all wire
doing these little wires so I'm going to
have to deal wire these buggers every
single one of them twisty twisty twisty
fun fun fun I love twisty so hopefully
anyways the camera has cut past all this
crap so you don't have to suffer through
it and hopefully you did that until I've
got them all out of the box now take
them throw out the box off the side so
adjustable 90 millimeter cut pads
they're very soft
yes and see the CM storm design the
right side designated by the R
left-side designated by the left here we
have the model number series 400 here's
the microphone vocal part is here here
we have the on and off button and the
volume control might have to do with the
microphone and most likely as the
microphone turn the microphone on and
off so microphone will be on or off
alright folks so this time we'll do
something a little bit different you
guys are always asking or everything
about the way they sound like and stuff
so we're gonna try to actually show you
what they sound like it's gonna be a
little bit difficult but I've got my
system up and I've got some my heavy
metal music on the screen so what I'm
gonna do first before I even put them on
my head is I'm actually gonna start the
song up I don't let you guys hear what
they sound like as I put them up to our
microphone the camera can go up there
too to see you guys can see we actually
have changed microphones now we're using
a task cam one opinions vary between
this one in the warrior be using before
but I actually prefer this one so here
we're gonna do right now is I'm going to
click on a song and what you listen to
it
all right folks NAT you've heard it I'm
listening to him they're pretty
comfortable they're adjustable as you
guys can see I can make them tight or
down they fit my head pretty good
they're soft on my ear and the music
does sound pretty damn booming I mean
they have kind of us like a boom boom
sound I've got things turned up kind of
bassy the way I like my metal to be
played but amen
these things are $40 they're everything
you need plug them right in I put them
into my out two glancing a little
control unit she thought I was have oh I
was rocking out there but hey guys these
things are pretty damn good for 40 bucks
I gotta give him a serious editor's
choice they sound awesome
so anyways I'm gonna go rock out to
Maoist and party tonight it's
Monday night and I'll see you guys later
I'm off to rock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
