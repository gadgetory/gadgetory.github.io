of tomorrow now if you're a PC
enthusiast and you do a lot of builds
obviously you know that most cases are
just made of hard material and you get a
glass window and that's all you get to
see the components of your system but
what about if you could get a case that
wasn't completely made of glass on its
exterior and you could see all of those
parts I'm talking about the 805 from n1
let's check that out there was
really no reason for a traditional
unboxing because pretty much you just
get the case the components that you're
gonna need for installation and doing
cable management and then you get a
headphone hanger which is pretty cool
they call it the I ear the end when 805
is a very unique mid tower case
it features an aluminum frame and a
completely tempered glass outside which
makes seeing your build easier than ever
and if you're wondering if your mother
but will fit inside the case the 805
supports motherboards all the way from
the Mini ITX all the way up to ATX and
if you're wondering about exact
dimensions the 805 supports motherboards
up to 12 inches by 10.5 inches as far as
internal drive based support goes there
are six different locations for you put
your drives for 2.5 inch bays and an
additional 2 Bay's that support you the
3.5 inch or 2.5 inch device and if
you're wondering if the 805 will support
your power supply the 805 supports power
supply it's the 220 millimeters the 805
also has eight PCI expansion slots this
means it will support your video card up
to 320 millimeters in length and 164
millimeters in height so pretty much
whatever video cards you have it'll fit
in the 805 if you're looking to purchase
yourself one of the inland 805 cases
there are actually two different models
that you can purchase there's a standard
version which features no LED light and
it also features only standard USB 3.0
now they have a brand new version which
is called the type C now what type C is
it's USB 3.1 and offers 10
time's a transfer rate as USB 3.0 so
it's pretty much the fastest you can get
through a USB connection and the type C
version also has an LED logo which is
emitted on the standard version now as
far as IO connectivity goes obviously
we're gonna see a USB 3.1 type C
connection we also see a single USB 3.0
connector to USB 2.0 connectors a mic
and HD audio ports one of the most
important features though on any case is
its ability to move the earth of the
case and hey how many liquid cores can
you put in it
in the front you can fit up to a 280
millimeter radiator with a height up to
60 millimeters and on the back of the
805 you can also install an additional
120 millimeter radiator up to 35
millimeters in height and if you're
wondering hey will my block hit the
window you actually have up to 156
millimeters of space between the board
and the outside of the case when you buy
the 805 off the shelf that only comes
with a single rear 120 millimeter fan
but it has the expansion for two fans up
front either 120 or 140 millimeter
variety and at the bottom there's room
for an additional two hundred twenty
millimeter fans and last but not least
the 805 sizes in at four hundred and
seventy six millimeters by two hundred
and five millimeters by four hundred and
fifty five millimeters in inches this is
18 point seven five eight by 18 another
cool thing about the 805 its ability to
be taken completely apart with ease when
it comes to Build time you don't want
anything getting in the way of you
putting your parts in the system
and as we take the rear panel off you
guys can see there's plenty of room back
here to do all your cable management and
keep those wires out of the system for a
nice clean build so there you have it
folks the 805 by inland now this case is
definitely something different than your
average or run-of-the-mill steel or
aluminum cases this case with all that
tempered glass on the outside just looks
way way way cool I want to see your
guys's paintings down below before I
bounce out of here I want to tell you
guys a little bit about NZXT t's cam now
this is a free software the price is
right it's absolutely free and this is
software that lets you monitor
everything inside of your PC and control
it from away from home so if you're
interested in that type of software
we'll also have a link down there below
where you guys can check out NZXT scam
for yourself the 805 is gonna be coming
to market at about $200 but if you're
looking for something that's definitely
a looker and you want to show off all
the bling of your build the 805 is
definitely something you want to
consider I'm Eric you've been watching
tikka tomorrow we'll see you guys here
for tech video shown all right hold on
before I finally get out of here just
want to let you guys know like before I
want to see your guys's comments down
below about this case but I also want
you guys to name the system that we
build it in if you guys follow the
channel you guys probably saw me do the
video before that was called the racing
motherboard or what is the racing
motherboard and we had a build from
inland that bill was okay but we're
gonna bring you an awesome build by
Anthony where we'll show off all the
bling in the system so if you name it
you're gonna shout at a free prize here
