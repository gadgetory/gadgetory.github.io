me I work with cherry law from a data
here at CES 2014 and that's right
another year another show and lots of
products so what are you doing here miss
cherry yeah I mean we are doing a lot
for this year this year 2014 really
exciting you for us we have some like
new mobile accessories like new power
bank wireless charger memory colors new
memory colors and we are actually
showing off new SSD that's powered with
the FSI new controller is not not
entirely ready yet but we have one of
the fuse manufacturer does by showcasing
the working sample you guys don't know
LSI controllers basically the best
control you can get it's the fastest
most accurate so using an SSD with that
in conjunctions wouldn't make it very
fast and actually keep it accurate as
well so this is here the show will
actually take a look at this yeah
definitely alright one thing is cool
though guys I don't you guys see this
but the lighting actually right now is
being provided by a David they had this
weird new product line that's all these
lights so here's one of the lights they
got right here behind me a fold-up thing
and then it ninjas out and you get your
ninja light right here so you're the
lighting today is provided by a data and
so with that said I guess we're gonna
jump in and go see some of your new
products alright let's go all right
folks so check it out l arc here at CES
2014 at the a data booth and talked
about some of their new product lines
they got something interesting going on
my first of all the exact panel lighting
they got that little ninja thing that
looks like a star trekky or you know
star wars ii that i showed you earlier
then they got this whole really cool
board right here that has all kinds of
thing just push little buttons and if
those little things on it so it's kind
of interesting kind of a cool little
thing kind of a consumer toy but it's
cool it's got little graphic things here
showing you how much water's been used i
can turn on more things as we go along
so i got the entire thing lit up as you
guys can see so it's kind of cool what's
this is this they are going to go into
the lightning business obviously you
just can see they're going to have a lot
of new products now this product right
here this new light panel this will be
really cool for a lot of different
applications especially for people who
do a lot of art and things like
this will be very interesting also the
medical trade could probably do it
though an x-ray on there you can see it
I'll take an x-ray of myself and I'll
put it on there you guys can see it so
you can see the true inside of me there
you go but this is all new stuff i don't
know more than exactly this is going to
be coming to market we're going to be
showing you some other products that are
really cool including some SSDs that use
an lsi controller so you guys are going
to really dig that but for now this is
just some of their new lighting stuff
not a whole lot of it but they have a
lot of different stuff down here you
know all kinds of nomenclature the
downright the panel like the bulb the AR
11 mr16 t8 tube just all kinds of
different stuff hey what's up out there
YouTube it's me elric and Bob Bernick
from his own think computers do you guys
know me from taking tomorrow and we're
it suggests at a didn't are we all here
I mean ain't it has you know the xpg
line which I'm sure you probably know
about yet we said lots of it in the shop
yeah so you know they have these two
colors that are already available they
have this sort of gunmetal and they have
the gold but they're thinking about
putting out other colors here so which
one you like l word you know me like
well I would honestly if I'm gonna have
a limited amount of choices I'm
definitely going to go with white
because anthea rounds my tech he was
building stuff and white so I definitely
go with the white I'd probably go white
gunmetal and red because those to me
would be like the three prime colors for
doing custom built what about you say
well yeah I don't have to agree with you
I do like the white but look at the
matte black you don't like a matte black
i do but it's got the gold in it so it's
got your dad had the gold and that bill
so it kind of limits
golden black bill that shows reason why
I mean I like this to you but then we'd
have to be like goods of principle I
mean this is yeah i mean i think the
white and the matte black are my
favorite but you know ate it it once
your feedback they want to know what
they want to do what you want yeah what
you guys want so they like our opinion
but you buy it so make sure you comment
on the video and tell them what color
that you guys want yeah so in fact go
ahead in our comment section in both my
video and Bob's video leave a comment
down below in our video telling us what
you guys think and what you would want
inside of your system that way a data
can get a handle on what it is and get
this stuff out on the market to you
folks right Bob exactly all right bro
often see you here did you perfect
and be with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
