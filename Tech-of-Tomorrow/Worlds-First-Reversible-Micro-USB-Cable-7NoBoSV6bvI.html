on the most highly standardized cable
for Android devices in all smartphone
accessories lighters cable brings the
convenience of Apple's lightning cable
to anyone that uses an Android device
and everyone that uses any type of
mobile accessory
all right folks so what is this
mysterious lighter cable well I've got
it right here in my hands the biggest
thing about it is that it's completely
reversible which means that no matter
how you try to plug it in you're gonna
be able to do it so if it's dark you
can't see or whatever you're don't have
to worry about turning that cable upside
down to make it fit this is the world's
first cable that's totally reversible
and it also offers faster transfer rates
than any current USB device that's out
there which is really cool
it's also one meter or 3.3 feet in
length hexagonal in shape as far as the
design goes inside and it has Braille so
if you're a blind person you'll be able
to touch this cable and know exactly
where it needs to plug in there are also
some other cool things about this right
now if you get involved these guys have
a Kickstarter program and when that's
all over they're gonna give 5% of their
money to people that are working on
visions so that's pretty awesome so not
only can be involved with getting
something really cool and the first of
its kind you can help someone get help
with their vision which is always cool
because we all want to see cool stuff so
I'm Mel work you guys been watching tech
of tomorrow this here is a really really
nifty product it's very very simple but
think about it how many times have you
gone to plug in that USB cable and tried
