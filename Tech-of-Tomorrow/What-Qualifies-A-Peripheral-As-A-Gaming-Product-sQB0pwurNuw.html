the world who's got two thumbs and is
ready to film a ticket amaro video I'll
tell you this guy so what's going on
today one the last few video segments
we've talked a lot about gaming and
gaming industry all the high prices
video card prizes Ram prices
everything's SuperDuper expensive plus
the very fact that as soon as someone
puts the name gaming on it most the time
the price goes up quite a bit and it's
not always the case but many times a
product will say hey I'm a gaming
product but you get it and you're like
okay well why is this even called a
gaming product now so I made a comment
my last video sin that you know they've
never seen a monitor that was called a
gaming monitor that wasn't a gaming
monitor really okay I see it all the
time on all kinds of products so I'm
gonna talk about four categories I was
going to make separate videos but I
figured I just talked about this all in
one video in this video is interaction
between me and you I want to hear you
guys's comments hear what you have to
say whoever actually leaves the best
comments for all four categories I will
pin their comment to the top for
everybody to stay and see so let's start
off with monitors I'll tell you guys
what I think now if a product is going
to be a gaming monitor the first thing
off the bat that it has to have is a
higher refresh rate than 60 Hertz I mean
this face it's 75 Hertz at minimum if
you're gonna call yourself a gaming
monitor also if it's going to be a very
fast monitor and you want the fastest
actually refresh rates the fastest
everything the fastest response times
you would probably preferably have a TN
panel you'd really wouldn't want an IPS
panel IPS pounds a little bit slower
they look great for text but for playing
games they're not the absolute fastest
another factor the ability to hook up
multiple connections you should be able
to hook up with the DisplayPort your
HDMI and even have a DVI cable option
you know if somebody wants that
connection still I don't know why they
would but some people still out there
and then last but not least I feel for a
gaming monitor it has to at least be
g-sync or free sync compatible it has to
have super fast response times super
fast refresh rates it's just got to be
an all in all super
superfast monitor for playing games it
can't just be a monitor that's at 60
Hertz doesn't really feature or anything
a lot of people put this new technology
they call it flicker free
well the flicker free is more for when
you're viewing text and stuff on the
internet so flicker free moves and
you're sitting there just surfing the
net and doing all that different type of
stuff that your monitors not flicking
and making your eyes hear now this is
great for checking email great for doing
everything on the internet but it's not
great for gaming not at all in my
opinion now like usual I want to hear
your guys comments on the subject number
one what do you guys feel qualifies for
a gaming monitor and would make you
spend that extra dollar to get it for
your PC system so you can have the best
gaming environment that you can get
yourself into so that's number one
number two gaming mice now I know a lot
of people out there just use a standard
Mouse that doesn't even say it's you
know for gaming or anything else and
they do just absolutely fine but
nowadays they have you know all of these
mice that say they're a gaming mice now
in my opinion if you're gonna be a
gaming mice there are certain things
that definitely should be in there first
of all you should have the absolute best
type of tracking that you can get and it
should be able to pretty much track on
any service delicious face of gamers go
all over the doggone place to play their
games a lot of times it's not always
just in the comfort of their home and
they change mouse pads or they're on
their desk so that's definitely
something that needs to qualify also an
adjustable dpi rate that adjusts from
low to high depending other people's
skill rate and the way that they you
know use their mouse some people pick up
the mouse and skip around do all kinds
of crazy things with it and the other
thing is is it's gotta have programmable
buttons for a fact I mean what's the
point in having a gaming mouse if you
can't even program the buttons you know
I'm saying it just makes no sense
especially you know if we want to push
another category over kind of like rock
and roll is like you know punk rock
classic rock death metal you know it's
kind of same thing with with my static
slash some of these categories you know
so a gaming mice in my opinion has to
have those things it's got to be
programmable got to have great tracking
should be able to track on any type of
surface whatsoever and it should also I
feel have weight adjustment me
personally I like a really SuperDuper
heavy Mouse when I'm playing she's like
I like a really heavy guitar I'm playing
guitar because it's just to me feels you
know it's more solid more grounded so I
know some people prefer a lighter Mouse
because their game style is they're
playing they picked the mouse up and
they Bop back down they do kinds of
stuff that that's not me I just play
flat you know and I prefer a mouse that
has the weight adjustment on it so
that's kind of a rune - what do you guys
think what in your opinion qualifies as
a gaming mouse that would make you go
out once again and spend that extra
money on a mouse that has the word
gaming attached okay
now number three a gaming keyboard now I
know a lot of people think okay man a
gaming keyboard you know that's a
mechanical keyboard a lot of people
don't like mechanical keyboards and all
asti they're not my absolute favorite
keyboard whatsoever
my favorite keyboard of all time is
actually a SciTech keyboard an old
SciTech cyborg everything on there was
awesome for playing games it was super
duper spongy it felt like one of the
original IBM typewriters that were just
so smooth and beautiful to play on and
that is my favorite and it's not at all
a mechanical keyboard but for a gaming
keyboard I definitely think there has to
be some things in a gaming keyboard that
make it a gaming keyboard first of all I
know a lot of these gaming keyboards
come as minis and they don't even have a
numpad on the side so no numpad
whatsoever they've got a smaller
keyboard I mean that's okay but that's
not really my favorite thing whatsoever
let me know what you guys think now on a
gaming keyboard I think the very most
important things on the gaming keyboard
are the Pauling rate you should be able
to hit all of the keys there should be
no in here over whatsoever so if you're
playing games you're getting all crazy
in there you shouldn't be able to hit
those keys and frees up your system now
that's something that you know that's
actually a good thing about the
mechanical keyboards now RGB honestly
the RGB lights on a keyboard drive me
freaking nuts they actually almost give
me a headache I'm sitting there saying
it's like I'm at like some 60s acid trip
and all these colors just keep flying at
me I prefer just a solid color on my
keyboard now I do like lighted key caps
I'm not going to deny that I think those
look really great but
to me all those flashing lights is
distracting solid white solid blue solid
red that's what I like and you should be
able to once again program all of the
keys and do a bunch of different macros
and all that type of stuff on your
keyboard I didn't mention that in the
mouse but you should be able to map all
your macros and stuff like I said
especially if you go MMO that's what it
starting to get when I got I forgot my
point but there's so many different
things for MMO mice I meant you know
there's lots of programmable buttons but
on a keyboard you should also have all
of your sound control as well everything
to do with your sound and everything
should be right there on the keyboard so
you can adjust everything to what you
want it to be to me those are really
important factors and plus you want keys
on a keyboard that are very easily
accessible some people even make a WASD
key that's a little bit different than
others for playing games now for playing
games
I'll admit a couple of Corsair keyboards
I have it's really awesome for playing
games up but when you go to type it's
kind of weird when you got it you know
some keys that are kind of like off at
an angle so you're whoa it's like
falling off the side of a mountain
you're trying to type so for typing it
kind of sucks but if you're only gonna
be in a gaming environment that's kind
of cool so to me for a gaming keyboard
it's got to last a long time can it all
the keys know and key rollover to be
programmable it's got to have options
for all of the audio and everything like
that and I even think having a headphone
jack in it would be awesome as well now
be really cool even is if you could
somehow get ooh nice idea I thought of
as your sound card inside your keyboard
so check through that you could have the
USB cable coming out that could be your
sound and you could have sound you know
from your keyboard even maybe they can
make even way make crazy wait crazy
excuse me and make it Wireless you could
have wireless speakers and wires
everything right out of your keyboard
now that would be truly badass right all
right so last but not least gaming
headphones
there are zillion headphones on the
market what do you think qualifies for a
gaming headphone for me here's where I
think a gaming headphones should be it
should really first of all definitely
have a really good clean adjustable
gooseneck mouse not a mouse excuse me
mouthpiece microphone so that you can
talk into it that's really important
because when you're in game you're
playing with all your buddies and stuff
you want
be able to talk into that talk your
smack-talk all your crap you know and
harass people do all that in games that
everybody does they just mess with each
other and talk a bunch of crazy crap so
you want to have a really good
microphone next some people for prefer
open ear headphones that's their
preference
some people prefer close to your
headphones so as far as that goes I'm
not gonna say that either one of those
actually qualifies or disqualifies it as
a gaming headphone it just depends on
your taste but it should definitely have
some kind of surround sound technology I
think if it's going to be a gaming
headphone 7.1 would actually be best my
son Aaron he loves his 7.1 headphones
like once he started using those in
gaming he never ever wanted to go back
whatsoever also the drivers and
everything should be geared to the
explosions and all that stuff don't over
power at all the driver so you know when
something explodes and blowing up you
don't get it just clearly sounds good so
somebody just says hey I'm a set of
gaming headphones I don't have a mic I
don't have this and I'm just calling
itself a gaming headphone I don't think
that that qualifies whatsoever and why
even spend your money on it
so for me good gaming headphones nice
gooseneck mouse nice drivers I'm also
comfort level gaming headphones are
gonna have to sit on your head for a
super long time so having a nice comfort
pad pad excuse me and really nice ear
muffs and stuff to me also will qualify
for a really nice set of gaming
headphones so what do you guys think
we've talked about four different things
and we know out there if you go to buy
this stuff that each one of these things
if you put the name gaming on it is
usually gonna cost you a lot more money
but is it worth your money and is it an
actual gaming product let me hear your
thoughts and your comments down below I
want to know what you guys think for all
four categories what qualifies for a
gaming product what would make you spend
your hard-earned cash on it and then not
have buyers regret afterwards I'm Miller
you've been watching Tekken tomorrow
we'll see you guys back here next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
