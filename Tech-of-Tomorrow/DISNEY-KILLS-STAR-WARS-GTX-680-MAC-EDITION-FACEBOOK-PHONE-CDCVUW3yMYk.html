guys have heard or not but Facebook has
released a brand that's right this
thing's geared for the consumer and it

lucasarts no more lightsabers no more
wands maybe no more Yoda cuz God dang it
boy lucasarts has been shut down today
even though Disney just five months ago
even millions of dollars to integrate it
they said it's cheaper to license them
out like hookers than to actually do any
in game development with Star Wars now
y'all know there was two games coming
out Star Wars 1313 you know there's a
game where you were gonna be kind of a
bad guy about on the planet you know
hunting around on level 13 13 to the
underground you know looking for some
stuff to kill him now we don't even know
what that games going to come out that's
a sad sad sad thing because i really
like lucasarts because i feel that those

cuz Star Wars you know i love the
lightsaber although the little furry
guys you know I just don't like that
long eared some bitch you know you guys
know I'm talking about this job job
rings and rings now that's song bitch I
don't like him his character is kind of
whack and he don't need to be anything
from the future if they are doing
anything with games or anything else I
hope they just omit that guy and never
bring him back because he's a bad
character but hopefully will
some third people will third person
people third person third party their
third parties the word I'm looking for
son third party companies will pick this
up and continue to develop these games

out here in the middle of redneck in the
Ozarks we got our sales of computer we
can get on the puter there and he'll

lucasarts has finally become a skeleton
in the closet and no longer in business
