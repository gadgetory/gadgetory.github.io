tech of tomorrow I'm Network your host
we've got some exciting stuff going on
today so what do we got going on today
well you guys all know that AMD has
finally released their official version
of the HD 7990 and that said it was
geared to be the fastest card in the
world that's what they've been claiming
well we're here to set those claims too
right and we're going to show you a
total bunch of benchmarks and stuff
regarding the HD 7990 versus the
top-of-the-line card from Nvidia their
GTX GeForce 690 now both of these cards
feature dual GPU technology on one piece
of silicon and they're both considered
the top of the line card from both
companies so with that said let's jump
in let's check out some comparisons and
see who at the end of the day who really
is the king of the frackin ring so let's
start off folks with the GPU code name
now the HD 7990 is the Malta it's based
on the 20 an ohmmeter process and the
GTX 690 is based on the GK 104 also
again on the 28 nanometer process now
let's talk about core clocks the HD 7990
is a core clock of a thousand megahertz
the GTX 690 has a core clock of 950
megahertz but it boost to 1020 megahertz
in its boost technology now let's move
on to memory clocks the HD 7990 has a
1500 megahertz memory clock the GTX 690
has 1500 and to makers a slight little
bump there to megahertz the HD 7990 has
4096 stream processors the GTX 690 has
3,000 72 CUDA cores now a lot of people
ask this question over and over and over
again I'm going to tell you straight up
but I'm not the super most technical
genius in the world but I can tell you
this CUDA cores and stream processors
are essentially the same type of things
but basically CUDA cores are geared a
lot more to run Adobe type program so if
you're running things like Photoshop and
stuff like that the CUDA cores are going
to work better now anything with OpenCL
on the other hand though you're going to
get better perform
it's off the stream processors so they
are essentially the same thing just as
some slight differences in the
background architecture and how they
work now let's talk about the memory
interface now you have to remember that
these cards are both like having a
crossfire card or an SLI card on a
single piece of silicon so they're both
times two now the HD 7990 it has a
384-bit times two interface and the gtx
690 has a 256 times two memory interface
now the HD 7990 it has a memory
bandwidth of 288 gigabytes per second
times to the gtx 690 of their hand has
192 point 3 gigabytes per second times 2
now I want to just mention something
right off the bat a lot of people talk
about micro stuttering and all that kind
of stuff and you know that if you take
you know just 2 2 gigabyte cards and you
slept in the system you're not accessing
the total 4 gigabytes of available
memory but with these 2 cards you get
the maximum amount of memory and you get
to access at all so the GTX 690 it has 2
gigabytes of gddr5 memory times 2 but
you can access all of that at the same
time which is one of the more superior
things about the designs of both the
7990 and the GTX 690 now the HD 7990 it
has 3 gigabytes of gddr5 memory times 2
for a total available memory of 6
gigabytes now let's talk about TDP and
the difference between the GTX 690 and
the HD 7990 now the HD 7990 it requires
375 watts where the GTX 690 only
requires 300 so hats off to the GTX they
win this particular category
now that we've compared the card spec to
spec let's jump in and let's check out
the benchmarks and see how the cards do
in gaming
whoo all right so you guys have seen it
we've given you specs head-to-head and
now we've given you performance
head-to-head now you guys can see that
the HD 7990 wins out in almost every
test across the board there are a few
they're different we'll get to that one
thing you want to take note of though
anything with OpenCL performance the HD
7990 just totally smokes and kicks ass
now there are a few places where the GTX
690 actually wins in the heaven
benchmark they win there that's very
DirectX 11 heavy also in Batman which is
a game geared you know for in video it
actually shows better scores and that as
well but overall you guys can see that
the HD 7990 is actually a faster card
and one thing it's kind of noteworthy is
that the card actually does run a little
bit cooler which is kind of strange you
guys saw previously that the TDP value
was less on the GTX 690 but in
real-world heating we see the GTX 690 is
about three degrees hotter than the 7990
running all the same tests in the same
type of environment so you guys all know
that these cards are both very very
frakkin expensive and the differences
between the two aren't backed
significant yeah of course the HD 7990
ones and a few things and well it really
should Nvidia kind of kick back on their
laurels and they reached out in two
different divisions of technology and
kind of kind of just really sat back and
wait to see what AMD has done okay AMD
has come back to the table now and they
have the faster car but the thing is you
know as well as I do if you're an Nvidia
fan damn do you're going to be going out
and buying yourself in HD 7990 you're
not going to give a if it has a few
screens more for this that's not even
going to matter to you but if you're
just somebody who doesn't care it all
about who makes the card you have no fan
attachment whatsoever then you can see
the 7990 might be a really good choice
for you you just got to really take into
consideration how much our advanced
physics important to you how much is it
because you're not going to get advanced
physics using the HD 7990 yes you can
install the driver
something that gets touchy a lot of
people still think that you cannot use
physics on an AMD card well that's
entirely not true what you do is you
just go install the driver off the
Nvidia site and you run it off of your
CPU not your GPU that's the only real
difference so if you're somebody though
you think hey advanced physics is my cup
of tea then you're really going to want
me looking heavier at the GTX 690 now
before we wrap this up all the
information will be down there below the
like button which I know you hit since
you're there and we also have something
really cool for you guys as well I've
got this set of flux in your headphones
over here from the people over at
SteelSeries and we're going to be giving
this away to one lucky person now how do
you got to do that well all you got to
do is share this video right down there
once again buy that like button which I
know you're going to be hitting and
you'll get a chance to win these
headphones and lastly let me just hear
your guys opinions if you guys had all
the money in the world and it didn't
matter which card you guys would prefer
to buy and why try to keep it simple and
praise guys keep the fan blade comments
out of there just leaving a comment that
says oh and video wins by default
AMD wins by default that's kind of
really a quick attitude out
take the time to actually think about it
if you have the money and you could buy
whatever you wanted what would you buy
and why I'll pick a random winner out
there and kick them down a schwag pack
just for being involved with it so I'm
Mel Rock this is buddy the dog we're
going to head to the park and go to our
you know dog thing and I'll see you guys
back here on teka tomorrow where if
you're not subscribed you're missing out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
