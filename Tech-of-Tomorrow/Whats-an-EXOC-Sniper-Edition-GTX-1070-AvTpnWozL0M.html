we take a look at the Galax gtx 1070
x-axis 9 4 edition so let's see what's
in the box
our folks so when you good boxing let's
first check out the top of the box we
stood there nice design the sniper thing
going for the head shot all good for
that
you see the Galax logo kind of
interesting Galax ok on the back not
much there this is pretty just the
standard stuff just telling you what's
in a gtx 1070 you guys all know that you
guys have been around and seen a lot of
cards here on the channel so let's go
ahead and let's just pull that box out
out of there
but boom baboom a box with the box
exception flip that bad boy over pop the
cap inside the cap you know we got the
usual nice protective stuff some
paperwork inside here what we got going
on here alright we've got the user's
manual right hey let me spin the round
few folks the user's manual that's right
the old users manual then we have the
galaxy driver's seat I mean the Galax
driver CB Galax and just say that again
Galax and then last but not least we get
some more information from these guys at
a post or anything interesting nope it's
just installation instructions and if
you have to read this then you're a noob
alright out of the way as far as
accessories go and alright we've got two
molex one to an 8 pin 1 to a 6 pin so I
imagine is gonna be a single 8 pen in a
single 6 pin power connector on the card
you can place your money on that we'll
set that off to the side anything else
in there nope nothing else except for
the card itself we'll go ahead and pack
this box up and we will throw that box
at the freaking camera
ouch that's gonna leave a mark alright
and that the card itself that's a nice
anti-static bag all nice and closed up
go ahead and pop this out boom pull the
card out of the bag so right off the bat
we can see that this card has a very
nice backplate has a little open space
right here and I think that's okay
because that can help dissipate some of
the heat from the card I don't think if
there is any type of cut in the back of
the card that's gonna do the card any
well for cooling there's long as you've
got something to help dissipate the heat
away from the card I think that's a good
design something unique here to around
the very edge of the card you can see
they've got this like little plastic
thing right here and this card has some
pretty cool options that we'll get to as
far as the fans of the stuff go and as
far as the size of the card goes the
card size is in it 296 millimeters by
144 millimetres and also features a dual
slot design like most of the cards on
the market today take a look at the
front of the card we can see that there
are 200 millimeter fans in the front and
now these fans light up in red they
don't change color but the cool thing is
though is that the geforce gtx logo on
the top of the card it does light up and
changes into a few different colors
pretty much the RGB spectrum i believe
you get green as well though so that's
pretty cool although it's not totally
clear to see underneath both of these
hundred millimeter fans you guys can see
all of the aluminum heat fins they're
also copper heat pipes in there
now let's slip the card around up to the
top on the top you can see the couple
different options here you have the six
pen da pin power connector now on their
website it says that it's a hundred and
fifty watts is what the power
requirement is but i don't think that's
really gonna be true because it's
usually 150 watts for the 8 pin and 75
for the 6 pin so i don't know maybe
that's correct but i don't believe it to
be true footer on the top we can see
there are two sli fingers so obviously
this car will work in sli unlike the gtx
1060 which is just a little bit kind of
crazy on that spectrum but hey it's a
lower price of card now the back plate
like i said it's very nice a lot of
things about me these cards will flip it
on the back right here are just so much
the same if you take a look at all of
the cards in the market they're all
gonna have a very very similar design
once someone comes up with a great
design for all the cooling and stuff
everybody else tries to emulate it and
they kind of stick around the same
design i mean it's like the wheel you
know the wheel works good you don't have
to completely reinvent
but different tires are and stuff same
thing with card designs so and as we
flip the card around the back and we
check out the connections we see there's
a single DVI connection three display
ports and an HDMI 2.0 port the cards
overclocked out of the box and has a
base clock of fifteen hundred and
ninety-four megahertz and a boost clock
of 1784 but hopefully we'll see better
than that all right so there you have it
there's what's in the box of the Galax
which used to actually be the company
galaxy now it just sounds like the name
of somebody in like guardians of the
galaxy galaxy versus Dex in a battle to
the death man but for want more
information about this well I'm gonna
purchase one of these things for
yourself
we'll have the information down below
that like button you know what to do as
soon as we get it tested we'll bring you
the full review 25 games something like
that and so uh I'm Alec we'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
