it's me l arc your host here on the
Tekken tomorrow youtube channel bringing
you guys an unboxing and first look for
us as something new for the people over
at danger dan what is this this is one
of their latest water-cooling heat
blocks for the new LGA 2011 platform
it's pretty cool it's solid copper
features a nickel top come to the market
about eighty dollars and this is what
the bad boy looks like in the box you
guys take a little close look at that
not too much to it it's actually a box
there are two components to this when
you order it you get the box and you get
all these components so that said let's
shift over the table now and let's show
you actually what comes in the box
alright guys so here we have it this is
the DD m6 cpu cooler from the great
folks over at danger den so i want to
thank you guys for shipping this out to
me like usual i got my trusty knife
you'll punish your knife wait that's
right i'm going to make an incision here
never try this at home folks now I'm
just kidding speak careful do you try to
know so we'll go ahead we'll pop it up
here right at the top we have the danger
den it's good open it up this is there
an instruction manual I've heard good
things about this company i'm really
looking forward to working with them
this is going to be the replacement
actually for one of the things we're
using the test lab hour 2011 we have the
basic intel retail one that came with it
we want to move past that and try some
others and the first come we thought it
right now is danger den so this is the
danger den m6 cpu block installation
guide has a lot of different images
shows you how to do it looks pretty
straightforward
then we have the danger den overclocking
water cooling case mods gives you even
more information on how to change stuff
this is part of the mounting hardware
right here but then there's some awesome
additional fitting so I'm going to bring
those into the light right here these
are the DD m6 performance-enhancing
shims the different colors meet at
different thicknesses here are where you
connect your hoses and everything on to
these and then we have an additional one
right here so there's different stuff
right here he'll move on it's the block
it's really cool that they give you all
the compression fittings and everything
in the box I think it's really great of
these guys some people don't put and set
these down right here here's the block
as we said before its nickel plated on
top you have an inlet here the out here
and so you're going to be using these
for this depending on which way you want
to go so now let's look at the base as
we said before it's going to have a
solid copper in may right there you can
see that very nice looking
this should be a very excellent product
I'm really hoping that when I order
their dual rad which I'm going to
beginning in a few days we're going to
go ahead and use this now let me get the
cameras to move back over here real
quick follow me if you would mr.
chairman Sir this is our lga2011
platform currently right now we have the
Intel standard that came with it but now
we're going to start testing a bunch of
water blocks starting out with danger
den we're also going to be working with
EK and swift tech and we're going to be
doing just a lot of different testing so
we're going to do is we're going to
remove this completely we're going to
put a dual radiator back here in the
back and then we're going to set up
different blocks on here starting off
look like i said the danger den DD m6 so
here i have it folks here's everything
that comes in the box of danger dens
latest DD m6 cpu cooler built for the
LGA 2011 platform featuring a solid
copper bottom and a nickel-plated tongue
but today we just brought you the
unboxing so thanks for being with us
