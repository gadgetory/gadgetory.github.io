back here in the ticket amaro channel
here on YouTube I'm mark your host and
we're here once again with our special
guest Leon from gigabyte who's gonna be
showing us some pretty cool stuff about
the brand-new z97 series motherboards
that they're releasing to the market so
you guys see my funny mug every day so
I'm gonna hand the microphone over what
I really had over sera are chess today
this is what I hand it over to Leon and
let him tell you about this brand new
awesome gaming motherboard these guys
have from gigabyte and hey only one way
to say it oh yeah exactly no confusion
so what's going on man how you doing
since last time we saw you good good you
know just keep him busy we do have new
motherboards for you guys and your
viewers today we want to show you guys
the one we have in front of us here is
our z97
X gaming g1 Wi-Fi black edition now that
is a mouthful yeah and no more and no
more weird green colors no I mean we got
a lot of feedback from viewers
Kermit we're very sorry we apologize on
behalf of all frogs out there definitely
we got a lot of feedback from viewers
from gamers when we go to events videos
that we do like videos we do with you
guys and everyone says they want to see
red red is I guess the gaming color this
year so if you guys do feel otherwise
comment yeah you guys can always leave a
comment down below gigabyte once through
the codes you guys want to see so if you
guys are like oh whoa we really don't
like red hey leave a comment down below
and we'll be happy to listen to you
definitely so um to move on with the
boards this year with our z97
motherboards our 9 Series we've actually
separated into 4 different segments so
last year we had 3 we had the gaming
performance and overclocking and this
year we've added another one which is
this one right here the black edition so
we do still have the three that we
focused on previously and now with the
black edition we're providing a 168 our
server grade testing so if you guys can
see on the box right here it lists that
as well so basically what you're getting
in the box is a server grade tested
motherboard before sending it out to the
different regions we actually test it in
the factories that's really good
so a lot of testing goes in before it
even gets out a lot of testing 168 hours
comes out to be about 7 days now they do
this on every single board Leon that
goes out every single black edition the
board for the US region we're gonna be
carrying three models which is the Z Z
97x ud3 h UD v H as well as the jus own
Wi-Fi black edition right on and this is
the top of the bad boys right right so
this is the top of the bad boys and when
we're looking at this board this board
you do see it in red we actually it
comes with the nifty box now very
luxurious as you can see I know I'm not
as sexy is gonna wipe it that's exactly
what I was thinking with what I was an
excessive animal that you were gonna
vent oh I was gonna say that dong no but
as you can see this board is actually
using red heatsinks but with some of our
black edition motherboards they actually
have different heat seems different
colors Oh she'll be able to option eyes
out those colors it's actually dependent
on if you get a black Edition it just
shows that you have a performance and
server grade level tested okay so that's
the only difference
um if you guys want we should get right
into it all right let's do it so I guess
folks what we're gonna do is we're gonna
go ahead and do the unboxing and we'll
talk about the features as we go along
and these they have nothing to do with
the testing videos and everything those
will all be coming out of the NDA list
next week on May 11th but for now we
want to show you guys the great product
so real quick anyways I'm just going to
show you guys the back of the box
anyways just for those people who are
curious as I know some people like it
they'll go ahead and show us the back of
the box we want to be thorough and
complete so we have showed you every
inch of the box you have been de box of
5 on tech of tomorrow alright so you can
see it's a really luxury box we've made
a very classy this time around sleeve we
pull it out very high-grade cardboard
high grade cardboard very clear
see-through plastic usually it's kind of
foggy you know very clear I think it's a
high grade plastic right so right here
we get straight into the motherboard
let's just set this right down here
buddy it sure is looking party so let's
first off though let's talk about all
the accessories then bounce back to the
board we're just little teasers here or
house aren't we so let's talk to you
guys first though about all the stuff in
there so
so first you're gonna notice you see
this certificate with every black
edition motherboard you're gonna get a
certificate and this is coming from our
factory manager they'll sign off on it
saying that hey you know this board has
passed server grade testing we've
certified it's a black edition
motherboard and not only that black
edition comes with a lot of other perks
if you register your board online we
actually allow for two additional years
of warranty oh so what's the standard
warranty standard warranty for all
gigabyte motherboards are three years
and if you do it online you get six
years to it additionally you live in the
damn five years whew that's a long time
yes I don't think many of my viewers
actually keep a PC for about five years
well I mean it's good to have especially
if you're giving it away to a friend I
mean oh what's this this is just a
holder for you oh so we can show all the
viewers a motherboard how rock on yeah
it's not something new right here for
you guys okay look at how sexy alright
so in addition to that you're gonna get
your crossfire sli cards and cables it
comes with three SOI cards and cables
you rock on and you're gonna get sleeved
SATA cables this is sleep not no no
let's go ahead open one of these up
caveman style
yes definitely alright folks so check it
out I'm gonna toss it over the Camerons
and you can show it to you closer so
those are sleeve SATA cables before you
were looking at just regular plastic now
we've added a little bit more premium
feel to it no sleeve as much nicer users
appreciate that especially the guys
doing custom builds right and it's
probably easier to go through when
you're running it through the cases as
well it won't get caught on like the
plastic you know it gets caught of stuff
no actually you know these feels
actually pretty good these are probably
some of the best SATA cable I've seen
come in any box they're very very nice
definitely and again you know you get
your cushion padding for your back aisle
your rear i/o more cushion for the
pushin you get a case badge and also one
for Black Edition
you get your multilingual see users man
habla espanol yes espanol
chinese-japanese
bah bah goody to you honey well there
you go that's the one you're looking for
all right and with the g1 Wi-Fi BK
you're gonna definitely get a wireless
card and the wireless card is actually a
wireless AC so you're looking at 867
megabits per and megabits per second
pretty much almost as fast as you can
get right there the boxer folks flips
you guys throw that and you guys can't
really see in the packaging but two you
guys ago and this card also actually
doubles up as a Bluetooth wireless 4.0
up so can you run like your phone
bluetooth phone through it that you you
mean like if I have my bluetooth phone
can I use the boots of connectivity and
that to route like my music through my
phone actually through that that's
actually a really great question let me
touch on that right after we finish this
because I want to touch on some of the
features that the board does come with
on the software side already all right
you also get a front panel so you point
out this box right and then two more
sleeves SATA cables lots of sleeves that
okay let's get this premium box out of
the way and let's circle back to the
Bluetooth so I'm room bluetooth so with
the bowtie I think I said that means
you're like tooth is writing you see a
dentist yeah you need my you know a few
people have to if you have a bluetooth
please see your dentist taga tomorrow
wants you to be healthy
we love you alright so with that it
comes with bluetooth and we're looking
at Bluetooth 4.0 week we include a
software suite if you guys haven't used
our App Center before you should
definitely try it out what what I'm
talking about this time around we have
something called cloud station so in our
software suite App Center we have
different apps like app files to flash
your BIOS we have systems information
viewer so you can actually set fan
curves to presets or manually set fan
curves to how you want it and you can
also see your systems information just
just like CPU Z and for overclocking so
if you guys do have all of your own
rehabbing solution we have
we have you know easy start we have
fastboot all of these are all of these
are different features that we've
included with our software suite that
it's meant to benefit users it's like
having frosting on your frosting and not
only that um I want to just point out a
lot of people might see it as bloatware
but our software suite is actually
incorporated into one system so you're
not installing multiple systems to get
your once off different software's and
it's one software one update button
it'll update everything all at once
there's features no more clicking going
next right right and it's all in the
clouds so earlier when you said when you
asked about if you can actually link
your Bluetooth phone up you can actually
do something with cloud station cloud
station there's an app on Android as
well as iOS with Android Android there
there you go Android and iOS and you can
actually sync it with a QR code and
Royden is that what's happening so you
can actually sync it with a QR code you
can actually link to your computer you
can use your phone as an input device or
you can use it to grab files or you can
also use your computer as a hotspot and
also remote overclocking a remote
overclock it so I could be like I've
mentioned I could be at the gym and get
on my phone and do some overclocking
right so let's say I'm somebody else is
using your system they're wondering why
it's so slow you can get hey I can just
you know tune it a little bit well
that's really cool then yeah so that's a
really neat feature there's definitely a
lot of features in our app center so if
you haven't used it or if you do get one
of these boards definitely check it out
Hallam answer questions so we're on the
future stuff how like you guys's remote
desktop like how powerful would you say
that was software does it allow you to
like really just like virtually like be
in front of your computer even though
you're somewhere else is it that strong
now at this point well I mean with
remote desktop it really depends on
every users preference some people are
accustomed to TeamViewer some people are
accustomed to Splashtop but for our
remote desktop it only allows you to do
remote control because we're not
harnessing the whole network bandwidth
we want to keep it so you still have
your bandwidth intact
okay but basically to look like you're
still moving the mouse and everything
though right so definitely check out our
remote OC software cloud
station it allows you to use your phone
as an input and you can do some remote
now since it's also a cloud station do
you guys have any options for people to
like have their like own on board type
of gigabyte storage solution you know
kind of like Google maybe people do to
you guys at this point have like the
your own gigabyte like cloud place where
like people store like information on
their own gigabyte system right now
that's probably still under discussion
if you guys want to see it let us know
we can we're always able to develop new
and exciting technologies all right well
now folks let's move on we've got the
board it's looking pretty badass but
let's find out what's underneath the
beauty and see the beast alright so on
this board guys you guys can start out
the first thing you guys must notice is
this amazing it's heavy it is definitely
heavy what we've done this time around
again through feedback we've had people
say hey you know we wanted to use our
own water Barb's our water Barb's are
now threaded and interchangeable oh
that's pretty awesome so you can take
that out right there oh yeah that is
pretty cool almost indubitably like that
so we have the heat sink which we've
actually redesigned it has the heat pipe
over to right here the PCH and not only
that you can also see that you know we
have a lot some colors going for us
right now we have the red from the heat
sink we have the green from our
capacitors and these are actually high
in audio capacitors their niche icon
Japanese capacitors electrolytic and
we've actually done the separation for
our digital side and our analog side so
this is similar to what you've seen in
our eight series board but we've carried
it over to a lot more boards this time
around now some people out there will
cover this again I've said it before but
separating all of your audio and
everything away from the Board makes the
electronic noise virtually go away now
some of you guys just use like older
chipsets and stuff that don't have this
you'll hear sometimes you're clicking
your mouse or stuff you'll hear that
actually near headphones segregating the
audio and does this makes not only your
signal and noise ratio much better but
it's also completely clean right that's
definitely the case and not only that we
actually have an awesome sound chip you
can see right here it says sound cor 3d
this is actually using creatives quad
core audio chip so it's a quad core it's
a quad core chip and
this is actually the first time that any
motherboard manufacturer has actually
implemented it onto the board for is
more for is more ask the fantastic four
yeah definitely not only that's
fantastic it's fantastic we also have op
amps as well as game switches now is
this op amp also removable like previous
series boards op amp is definitely
removable if you do find any other op
amps online or if you actually have a
high end receiver that dies on you but
you can take that op amp out you can try
it out there yeah I'm not touching this
tubular although so the op amp is
basically allows you to change your
sound from hard to soft to more bass to
more treble and by changing out the op
amp you can actually change the dynamics
of your sound it's something really
incredible now I know a lot of people
out there aren't gonna have a golden ear
we're not gonna hear this but the people
who do will appreciate this more than
you could imagine
alright yeah definitely and not only
that for those like you said if they
can't hear there's one thing that they
can hear if you do have any rusted
rusted jacks or anything when you stick
in that microphone you hear that that's
screeching that's annoying if you hear
that
that's because you have some rusts or
it's tarnished inside with gold we've
actually gold-plated all of our back io
signa so maybe even more of it you won't
hear that noise so that's why all of
these are actually gold-plated same as
the DVI and HDMI and as well as our CPU
Samba removes ass and sell the gold yeah
you can definitely do that if you want
to burn down one of these not only that
we also have some cool features like the
USB DAC so if you're actually of the USB
DAC yeah we have a DAC for it so this
DAC actually allows you to enable or
disable the power coming from it and it
also has its own separate power source
Oh excellent so if you're into audio if
you're into gaming this is definitely a
great board for you to get it has a
killer killer network as well as an
Intel NIC and then it also has USB DAC
and the audio separation here and
complete USB 3.0 on the i/o notice that
as well no more of the old ones no one
no two just strictly USB a three across
the board now I know this might matter
to some people but
I have a couple older keyboards
especially like my Coolermaster trigger
when you try plugging that into an older
USB port it doesn't even provide enough
power for and the keyboard just kind of
tweaks around with something like this
no matter what periphery you're using
you're not gonna have a problem okay
next thing everyone's probably wondering
what's new with 9 series so with let's
do with 9 series well what's new with 9
series on this 9 series board we have
SATA Express so SATA Express you're able
to hit 10 gigabits per second and that
roughly accounts to about a thousand
makes it's fast it's fast it's not quite
on the market yet but it's coming very
soon you won't have to wait like I don't
if you notice Lee I'm you're pretty
young guy but when the first time when
they had USB ports and a board they
weren't even used for honestly like the
first 5 years on her motherboard that's
right the port was there and there
wasn't even a product for it I think
everyone was still using ps2 at the time
yeah and I mean it's just really weird
they put this stuff on the board but
this you're not gonna see that there's
one thing I've noticed about the newer
in boards that are coming out the
technology is not taking so long to
catch up like even though this isn't
available now by the time the next
series boards come out this will all be
all over the place you don't be waiting
years right and it's fast it's super
fast so definitely when you do check out
check out this board it's the g1 Wi-Fi
BK from gigabyte the Burger King Edition
and it's an awesome board it looks
really nice have any other questions for
us I don't know when was this called the
board you guys can see right here your
PCI expansion is all the way across town
to support quad quad graphics okay so oh
my god SLI quad crossfire whatever your
choice is you've got ample room around
the ZIF socket this is still 1150 by the
way no change there which is kind of
cool
now there's one thing I do want touch
upon there you're gonna get this little
tricky thing here right now all the CPUs
that are on the market will fit on this
motherboard and the previous eight
series but when the new serious chips
come out from Intel only these
motherboards will support those new
chips and that's one of the key features
about the nine Series is that it's only
going to support these latest Reif rich
in Intel CPUs that's right pretty
interesting now as far as the memory I
still take it it's still 32 gigabytes
max yeah these are three gigabytes now
um what is it up to three thousand
certified
2800 3000 pretty good you got your first
USB 3.0 breaker right there so that's
gonna be for that front hair that we saw
there earlier you got a little port
right here now this particular part
right here is this for the external now
this is actually what we call OC peg
this is actually an auxilary power for
to make stabilize your PCI power so
basically when you actually put on
multiple cards you might find some what
is that it the wave might be off from
it's not as stable as a separate power
source because you have so many cards
plugged in it's supplying power to those
different PCI lanes your power is gonna
wave more so this is for using multiple
lane configuration right for SLI
facilitating more power it'll stabilize
the power overall it's it's basically
like giving the board of grounding oh
wow
and like how much does external part
cost it's just a SATA connector it's a
SATA connector so if you do have it up
an additional SATA plug you can just
power that SATA power right there right
on and then what are the controllers
that are on board right here so right
now we have a SATA here and I believe
these are the native Intel's
and then we have marvels bar goes okay
you guys can see down at the bottom all
the wiring very easily I believe there
are seven fan headers on this board
altogether right there are quite a few
we can actually count them down there's
one here one two these are both for the
CPU here there's one two three four so
that's a total of six right now six
seven seven yes I believe there's seven
total in sports so that's quite a bit of
span sport now on your guys's fan
support are you able to go in on each
one of your fans and individually tune
it and time and make it work exactly I
thought to be just like our App Center
just like I said earlier on our App
Center we do have systems information
viewer which will allow you to actually
control your fans and as you can notice
all these fan headers are four pins so
they support both PWM and three pins oh
okay excellent and then these two little
switches that we see down here in the
bottom of the board this is actually for
our bio switch so you can actually
switch between your two biases as well
as enable or disable your BIOS
oh so you can actually disable the BIOS
altogether tool
okay now you switch and keep only one
BIOS alive at that time now this is for
folks some people do a lot of
overclocking and stuff and they'll try
to take a BIOS and do some weird stuff
with it that BIOS actually happens to go
bad
you can switch and the other one still
be up and running and then reflash the
other one back to where it's actually
workable correct and and the reason for
that single bow switch is actually
because some people mess with that
primary BIOS and they don't want the
secondary BIOS overriding it so they
want to disable that secondary BIOS so
just keep it straight up and straight
out and so will real quick to show you
folks the very back of the motherboard
you guys can see the PCB is all black
matte black on both sides of the board
and if you actually look right here you
can actually see the cutout through the
board where yeah that's pretty
interesting you can see the audio cutout
that's kind of hard to see we'll try to
get that in thing which you can see that
here and you can see it also on the back
of the board here with these clear lines
totally separating the audio from the
motherboard so that's pretty much it
folks this is pretty much showing you
guys the unboxing talking about the
features and what the motherboard is
when all the NDA's lift next week we'll
be able to bring you guys the full
review and show you the performance
about this thing and how it does work
another thing that is the one of the big
features about this though is the new
MDOT 2 standard what this is basically
doing is replacing em SATA you're not
gonna have em sated anymore
unfortunately those people out there
invest in it like I did invested a bunch
of them you're kind of Sol but they've
moved it forward and this is gonna be a
much faster technology so I'm our
protector tomorrow this is Leon from
gigabyte we thank you very much for
being here and we've got more for you so
stay tuned detective tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
