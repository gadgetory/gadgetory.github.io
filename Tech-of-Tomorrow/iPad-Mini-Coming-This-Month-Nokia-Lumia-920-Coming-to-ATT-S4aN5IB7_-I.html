over at amazon have their 7-inch market
apples going to jump into the market and
the fray but there's will be a little
bit more costly instead of the two
hundred dollar price mark that we see in
the Nexus 7 and we see on the kindle

three-hundred-dollar price tag on the
new apple ipad mini now at this point in
time that's all currently speculation if

new phones and the rumor to hit the
market in November now if you walk into
the store you're going to be able to get
