brand-new shiny skylake Intel CPU and
you're looking for a home for it but you
don't have a whole lot of money well I
think BIOS art just may have a board
that will fit your build this is their
brand new z170 gt7 motherboard it's
considered a racing Edition has a lot of
features and the best thing of all it's
really very very budget priced let's
check it out
now first off I know a lot of you fans
out there always want to see an unboxing
of the product so why don't we just give
you a traditional unboxing first before
we talk about the specs so right here I
have the Box in my hand you guys can see
it
it's a box has the nomenclature and
everything on it now you guys love that
word nomenclature on the back we see
just a lot more of the same now some of
the stuff though I want to talk to you
guys about going through is this board
has a lot of different features for it
like I said for board that comes into
market or $200 this thing has a ton
of features now inside the box you guys
right on the packaging can see the
motherboard and it closes up but the
real thing about this motherboard though
is this amazing lighting system that it
has and all of their features for their
audio some of the best things about
these hi-fi motherboards from Biostar
are definitely their audio and we'll get
into the more of that later but some of
the great things about it is it offers
you great surround sound completely
segregated audio just like higher and
motherboards by a Zeus and for those
people out there who love a high-end
audio it also has great stuff for your
headphone amplifier and just everything
built in the board really is featured
towards sound it also has a lot of
things for overclocking not like the
extreme boards you're going to see but
still for like I said a bordering $200 a
lot of features so it's real quick here
I'm just gonna pop this out here you
guys will see there's a little cap right
here little cap of the Box just pops up
kaboom then we have the motherboard on
here you'll notice though that there's
no anti-static bag I hope you were gonna
freak out like they do that video cause
you like Alaric why is a no anti-static
bag but honestly with the way they have
it set up you don't really need an
anti-static bag all you got to do is
reach myself up here and grab myself out
I'm completely ground out now so we'll
we'll go ahead and first we'll just take
out the motherboard and I will drop this
down here
and then we will show you guys the
motherboard so why got it out though
let's talk about the layout you guys can
see that everything on this board is
pretty far apart that means when you're
putting your video cards in putting your
memory and all that stuff inside the
board it's not going to be too much of a
hassle to install the stuff I really
hate it when I get some other boards and
everything's so close together you're
like man I can't put anything else in
but this thing being a full-size ATX
motherboard it has plenty of room on it
we'll get into more the features later
here's the rest of the stuff in here now
this right here is something very very
cool you guys are gonna like this it's
back behind me as well
this is actually like a type of lighting
strip like hue lighting from Philips but
it's included in the case sorry
it's included in the packaging rather
and it lights up it can be fully
controlled full be controlled that's
right changed unique whole you want
through there onboard software we're
gonna get to that you guys sit behind me
as well so we got the cable I'm going to
just drop that down here moriah
protection panel next up we have four
SATA cables that's right there's four
these little bad boys they're all black
so pretty much match anything in your
system we've got the racing driver CD we
have the racing manual that's right I'm
trying to go through this as fast as
possible and then last but not least you
get what's called the vivid LED DJ
that's right so these lights back here
have a lot of features and with that
said though now let's pop out and talk
about more actual features of the
motherboard let's go so starting at the
top of the board
we'll see wrap the bat there's an 8 pin
power connector then you're gonna see
there's a wire going between both of the
headers and the board and actually those
two white things that you see both light
up when you turn the board on which is
really cool and down below that you guys
can see there are a bunch of capacitors
and chokes all around there these are
all made of high quality components none
of this is junk whatsoever then we see
the ZIF socket like I said before this
is the Intel z170 chipset and to the
right of the CPU we see the four dimm
slots for the memory now you can use up
to 64 gigabytes of 32 hundred megahertz
ddr4 memory on this board so this board
definitely has some room for
clocking and up here in the corner we'll
have a close-up shot - you guys can see
this this is actually the Ln - button so
if you guys are going to go extremely
crazy you're overclocking it actually
has a button on ER to turn it so that it
when it gets so SuperDuper cold the
motherboard doesn't freak out and right
below the memory we see something that's
very interesting on this motherboard
this is called their GT touch you guys
can see there are four different
controls here the Eco the sport the
reset and the power if you hit the sport
button it automatically boosts the
system's performance and when you enable
the Eco mode the system optimizes energy
consumption which means my friends is
earth friendly and that's always good we
also see the 24 pin power connector and
next up is the Omni Miceli D warming
indicator so depending on what number
comes up on this if your motherboards
not starting you can look in your manual
see what the number is and determine
what's wrong that you can fix it and get
your board up and going next up we see
the SATA connectivity there are a total
of nine connections here six are stated
3 &amp;amp; 3 are SATA Express and as we move to
the center of the board you guys can see
there are four PCIe 16x lanes and three
PCIe 1x lanes and you guys can see that
in between the last two PCIe 16x lanes
that we have an m2 SATA connection
personally if you can afford one using
an m2 as your boot device is pretty much
the fastest way you can go the board
also features a total of five fan
headers three of them are for your
system and two of them for your CPU two
of them are located down here at the
bottom of the board another one up here
near the top and your CPU fans are
obviously located right here by the CPU
as we look at the very bottom of the
board you guys can see there are a lot
of different connections as well as the
BIOS and above the BIOS is a BIOS switch
the dual BIOS which comes in very handy
for those people doing overclocking if
you fry one BIOS you can simply switch
to other BIOS until you repair the other
one to get up and going next up is the
audio chipset now you can't really see
it because it's covered up by this
little racing button right here but this
is the realtek ALC 898 chipset provides
8.1 audio and like I said before you
guys can see that all of the audio stuff
is completely separate from the mother
bored itself this keeps all the
electrical noise of the motherboard
completely out of your audio which means
it's gonna be quiet and not get none of
that stuff in the board and in fact
their entire motherboard design is
they're saying hey we want there to be
absolutely no electrical noise anywhere
so even the features in the basic makeup
of the board are all made for that
complete silent running sound which is
really good
other motherboards like a Zeus and
higher end people they've been doing
this for a while but honestly the HiFi
series from Biostar they've been doing
it for just as long and like I said
audio is one of the most excellent
features of this motherboard you can
also see above the chipset the four
little blue capacitors those are also
part of your audio system before we
bounce out and take a look at the rear
i/o let's take a look at the back of the
motherboard itself you guys can see it's
pretty plain nothing really there to
talk about but still some people like to
see it the rear i/o is pretty decked out
it features a single ps2 connection a
single USB 3.1 type C port 5 USB 3.0
ports 2 HDMI connectors a single DVID
connector a single VGA port a single
rj45 LAN port and last but not least
your 6 gold-plated audio connectors you
guys can also see that around the rear
i/o there's a nice little shroud that
looks more like little racing stuff in
fact the entire motherboard color scheme
looks like one of those flags they wave
like near the end of the race so when
you get this board you know you've
almost won your race so those are the
specs the layout what the board looks
like but like I said one of the really
cool features about this motherboard is
its ability to do crazy lighting inside
the system now you get a cable that's
similar to the Titans you get from the
people over it Philips hue it's a little
bit thinner but the cool thing about
this motherboard is that you can go over
to Home Depot or any other place and buy
a much longer cable connected to the
system then you can have your entire
system light it up with this and you can
control it all through your Windows
desktop which is pretty cool so right
behind me I have the system so let's
check out this lighting system and some
of the ways you can change it through
the software it's pretty nifty now to
control the LED vivid DJ need to be
booted up into your Windows environment
and then once you've installed the
racing GT software you can simply click
on it and access all the features
now on the top you guys can see they of
the same features you had on the
motherboard you can have normal mode Eco
mode or sport mode which like I said
automatically pretty much overclocks
your system and then down below that you
can see both the color and sparkle
settings you actually get four different
modes permanent which leaves the lights
the way they are
then there's breathe mode which is
pretty much just a very slight pulsing
kind of like when you're breathing then
next up you have the shine feature which
is pretty much just the blinking feature
and then last but not least you get
shine plus music and what this means
that whatever song you're playing the
lights will pulsate to the beat of your
music
you can also change the color of the
light to pretty much anything you can
imagine so that's the layout the
features all the different components on
the board but what if you want to
control your PC world completely NZXT
scam offers you a whole new level of
control than ever before for serious and
novice gamers alike there's no more
powerful companion to your PC than
cam-cam features a sleek user-friendly
interface and offers real-time component
monitoring to ensure your rig is doing
exactly what it should be when it should
be and if it isn't cam will let you know
plus the best thing is this software is
free it was designed to develop by NZXT
and allows you to control your cam
enabled hardware from just about
anywhere and last but not least folks
let's real quick take a look at the
racing BIOS that's included with this
Biostar motherboard the z170 GT 7
features a complete UEFI BIOS there are
five screens you can navigate from and
it's all easily done with just the click
of a mouse all the various control
features of your motherboard are located
here including control for overclocking
memory speed and anything else you need
to set up before you boot into your
system ok Tech fans so that pretty much
wraps up today's video everything you
need to know about the brand new biostar
z170 GT 7 like I said this thing's
geared for doing mild overclocking
really geared for those people who like
audio and hey it's only a hundred and
forty nine dollars so it's definitely a
motherboard that's not going to break
the bank I know there could be some
people out there that like me like oh my
god it's a biostar motherboard but trust
me I guarantee if you get this board
you're not gonna complain about it it's
not going to be the greatest board in
the world like Aizaz but those boards
are also you know three and four hundred
dollars you're only playing 149 dollars
for this board and you get all those
features and that lighting feature is
pretty much a lot like philips hue only
it's built into the system when you
build it which is really cool like you
like I said you guys can go to Home
Depot buy an existing cable that they
have make it long it can go throughout
your entire system and you control it
all through that simple GT software so
it's really really easy also you guys
can see we have the motherboard inside
of a case we're going to build a
complete system inside this case and
this is the n1 805 it's completely made
of glass
all the way around so it's pretty badass
this system right here you guys see this
was actually just built over a Biostar
so we could use it and show you guys
lighting stuff but now we're gonna take
that case gut it out put them on but we
have in it and make it really really
nice
so before we bounce out of here down
below like button I'll have all the
information on this motherboard plus if
you want more information about NZXT
scam it'll be down there as well and
remember this software is completely
free for you to install on your computer
and try to do it and if you're into that
total thing of knowing what's going on
with your system wherever you're at and
having just that ultimate control it
might be something you definitely want
to check out i'm Elric you've been
watching techni tomorrow we'll see you
back Barrett for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
