are doing good out there in YouTube land
I work here once again on TECA tomorrow
so right now we've got something cool
going on for you folks we've got five
cool tech products for under fifty bucks
that's right without finding five would
be cool too the nifty little devices all
for under fifty bucks so that you can
afford them in your little wallet so
with that said though let's jump in and
let's check out the top five for April
2017 all right so first up in April
folks we have the Belkin bsv 3000 TTC w3
outlet wall mount cradle surge protector
with dual USB charging points 2.4 amp
total but what this little Belkin
bad-boy is is it's pretty much just a
charger and a wall mount but what's
really cool about it is has two USB
charges on the top then you have three
plugins on the bottom but the nifty
thing is that the set you can actually
cradle your phone on top of this little
Belkin so we have to worry about it
sitting on the floor getting dirty
you can even vacuum around it and do
everything else so if you're looking for
something that's pretty convenient that
won't break the bank I mean this thing's
really like twenty-two bucks on sale
right now it's a pretty nifty little
product who's looking for something
that's really cool and it seems like
kind of the theme this month is pretty
much a lot of chargers so the first one
we got is this Belkin if you're looking
for something that's pretty powerful
very very inconspicuous and you can
cradle your phone on it then hey this
Belkin little bad boy you might be the
charger and plug you've been looking for
now for those of you who are always in
the go and are looking for a charger to
charge up your laptop of your phone this
next one might be for you the product
I'm talking about folks is the EZ ACC
13,000 milliamp hour power bank it's a
portable charger for smartphones tablets
pretty much anything you need to charge
it's black and it's armed so if you're
into that theme kind of Halloweeny for
me and this might be your thing it
features dual inputs to recharge itself
to full is about 3.5 hours which is
about 2.5 times faster than a regular
portable charger it features a very
powerful 4.8 output and achieves a
powerful charge up to 4.8 through both
ports at the same time which means it
can charge two high-end inputs at the
same time at full speed this device also
features smart technology now this auto
detects and outputs the exact current
your device needs delivering a fast and
universal charging all around
this little bad boy though can provide
for charges to an iPhone 7 2.5 charges
to a galaxy s7 or one charge to an iPad
air 2 and best of all it doubles as a
flashlight in case you get lost in the
dark the easy ACC features two standard
USB and two micro USB charging ports and
best of all this powerful little charger
comes to market for under 25 bucks all
right so this next item is probably
going to be kind of hit and miss with
you folks so we all know that a lot of
phones out there won't use a wireless
charger depending on how they're built
but if your phone can use a wireless
charger check out this next device
because I think you'll think it's pretty
damn cool so what am i rambling on about
I'm talking about the s'ti Qi fast
wireless charger and this device can
charge any phone out there that features
the key technology it'll work with your
Samsung Galaxy s7 the x6
your active your edge your edge plus
your note 5 and pretty much any key
enabled device that you can find out
there and once again
this handy little device is under 25
bucks ok so so far we've seen a charger
for your portability a wireless charger
a wall charger but hey how about a
charger for your headphones so check
this folks the morphe power capsule what
exactly is this thing well like it says
it's something to charge up all of your
headphones it has a rechargeable 1400
milliamp Universal battery which
provides wireless earbuds with up to 60
hours of audio playback it also features
a soft touch interior which protects
your device and prevents scratches so
that means when you put your headphones
and to charge them even if you're
running around bouncing around doing
stuff you're not have to worry about
damaging your headphones whatsoever and
like some of the cool advice that we've
seen before you can actually charge up
the power bank and your headphones at
the same time and if you're wondering
yourself hey Laura how do I know when my
Morphy power bank is fully charged where
there's an LED light on the bottom that
lets you know when your power bank is
fully charged
now even though Mophie claims is the
power bank for charging up your
headphones there's actually a USB
charging port inside so you can pretty
much charge anything you want all right
folks this last item it's not a charging
port whatsoever it's actually a sandman
clock that's right now this is a very
new product that just actually came out
of the mark
about a week ago I contact the company
up and I said hey man this thing looks
like it will fit perfectly inside of our
top five video so they sent it along
let's check it out
now the Sandman it's actually something
pretty cool no it's not as cool as the
Metallica song but still it is a four
port USB charging alarm clock now the
one that we got is white it also comes
in black now for you folks out there who
have a white desk you guys can see on
our white table this thing just looks
badass it's clean its elegant it's very
minimalistic as well now with the
sandman you can eliminate fighting with
your wife over who gets to charge their
phone first because there were actually
four USB charging ports located on the
sandman so you can keep your nightstand
looking good and you also get integrated
cable management so it doesn't look
messy whatsoever and with the sandman
you never have to worry about knowing
what time it is because it has such a
large display you can see it from even
way across the room and obviously the
sandman does feature all the standard
things that a normal clock has it has
wake up all that stuff if you don't like
the lights so bright you can actually
dim them but all in all it's pretty much
just a fancy clock with four USB ports
and if that alarm clock just bothers the
crap out of you simply hit that snooze
button on top and click more Z's but you
have to admit this thing sure does look
nice alright folks so hopefully with
this video you folks are all charged up
anyways like usual all these items will
be down the like button hopefully you
guys know what to do by now if you're
not subscribed please subscribe the
channel and also if you don't have your
notifications on please I hate to keep
you know saying this over and over again
but make sure you turn them on so that
you can see the video in your video feed

that's going on here on TECA tomorrow so
with that said though folks it's the
weekend so I hope you guys enjoy your
