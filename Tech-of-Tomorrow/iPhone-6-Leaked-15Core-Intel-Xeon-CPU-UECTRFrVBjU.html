new motherboard that can take eight of
these CPUs at a time so 240 threads all
at one time on the LGA 2011 platform now
that's going to be pretty crazy stuff
now rumors have when the cpu comes out
it's going to be quite costly but it's
also going to be the fastest thing on
the planet now they're going to have a
whole bunch of new skus when this comes
out and they'll have a lot of new models

working their way down now we have the

me out because it was kind of like a
girl who you go out with and she looks
like she has big old boobs and you get
her back home you take up for broad and
they're like those are balloons so what
store am I talking about we'll check it
out supposedly the iphone you know the
iphone 6 supposing rumors came out with
a bigger screen and all this stuff well
become to find out that the images were
actually rendered by some dude and not
really anything really true but there
still is you know some chance that this
phone might come out but the images and
stuff that we got weren't the actual one
it was just kind of a BS story but if

in the news AMD fans you guys are going
to be utterly stoked why are you going
to be stoked because men am

prices on the mid-range market they're
geared right now to release a brand new
r7 265 car which is going to come to the
market at a hundred and fifty dollars
now this is going to put some other
cards down the lineup and you can see
now that AMD is actually squeezing a lot
of their cards together trying to
reposition themselves now this is the
very first of the price you know drops
that we're seeing but there's going to
be many more according to the roadmap
that we were able to get a hold of so
and these totally totally cutting prices
on this market make it so that you can
get a very very affordable card the
thing is though with all this going on
what is nvidia have up their sleeve to
counter because you know and videos
always going to count or anything AMD's
it's like checkers you know you jump me
i jump you you jump me i jump you it's
all over the place but this is really
incredible stuff so for AMD fans out
there you guys are going to totally be
stoked because when these guys go into
price wars it only benefits you guys the
