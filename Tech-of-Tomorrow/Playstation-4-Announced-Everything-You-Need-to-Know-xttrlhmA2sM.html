februari 20th we're in New York Sony had
a meeting and at this meeting they
showed the brand new Playstation 4 that
you guys can see right here you guys can
see it as a clear design all new
controller supposed to be really cool so
you know right here you guys can see the
design of it and everything you know I'm
thinking you know it looks pretty cool
what do you guys think huh there's
nothing there oh yeah that's right
there's nothing there because even
though Sony had this great big meeting
they actually didn't show anything at
all they came up update they came up
empty handed and just basically had a
meeting inside hey here's what we're
going to have so instead of actually
getting the playstation 4 announced
today or seeing it or anything else what
we got was a bunch of more talk now I'm
sure that the people at Sony had their
reasons for doing this but right now
there's actually no release the release
is supposed to come at the holiday
season of 2013 but with that said let's
jump in and let's see what did happen as
introduced by lead system architect mark
Cerny the ps4 is based on a supercharged
PC architecture with an x86 processor
enhanced pc-style GPU and 8 gigabytes of
gddr5 unified high speed memory the
controller is called oh boy you won't be
shocked the DualShock 4 and features the
vita style touchpad we've heard about
and a light bar on the back to identify
players as they're playing each ps4 will
contain a 3d camera track the various
controllers using the bar the ps4
contains an eight core cpu providing
almost two teraflops of computational
performance the power allows for 3,000
polygons to be rendered in real time by
way of comparison heavy rain on the ps3
utilize 15,000 overall our goal has been
to architect the system to support a
breadth of experiences said Cerny so
that's what's going on as far as aspects
go now a lot of other things were talked
about as well
now since this things can be based on PC
type architecture boot up times and
waiting is going to be out the window
you're basically have a little button
you'll hit will go right into wake up
mode you'll also be able to play games
as they're downloading so as you're
downloading games and streaming them
you'll be able to actually play that
game and a lot of the titles you'll be
able to stream right over to your ps4
that's right now I'm wondering why sony
has waited like this and done this but
it kind of makes some sense because the
holiday seasons well you guys all know
that's when everybody buys anything
during the summer time that could be
pretty cool too but during the holiday
season that's when people buy the most
so that kind of makes sense and also if
prices change and hardware changes they
can also change things around to suit
that market so that's why I think
they've done that they didn't talk about
price whatsoever so no prices were
mentioned at all but we do know is what
we said before eight core cpu 8
gigabytes of gddr5 memory so pretty much
is what I think you guys all know
mid-level gaming CPUs they usually have
an AMD apu NM they play pretty decent
games at moderate frames per second so
what's going to happen is you're
basically going to get is a mid-ranged
pc inside of a box but i'll have all
kinds of their kinds of cool features
that'll make it stand out from being
different than a pc you now I know a lot
of people say dude why don't I just go
out and buy a PC and build it well I
thought about this to today and my first
initial reaction was man sony that's
kind of crazy but nice art thing about
okay we'll take over the new design it's
got some cool stuff you can work with
with the Vita and you can play the games
as you're downloading I guess there you
know could be some really cool things
about it depending on the price so if
you guys would like to check out a
full-blown article on this where I
discuss all the different things that
came out in today's meeting in New York
please check out the link in the details
below where you guys can check that out
over in ww tech of tomorrow my website
where I appreciate your guys's sport
anyways I hope you guys liked this video
that's what we've got for now about the
ps4 if you guys aren't subscribed please
do so because we're always bringing new
tech here on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
