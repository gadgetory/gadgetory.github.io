tomorrow how are you guys doing it's
Monday obviously and I want to send a
shout out to all my blue-collar friends
out there get into you yeah I think kid
do so check it out you guys all know the
r9 290x some scores have been now
approved by a and B for release now this
is Bioshock and tomb raider now the
funny thing kind of about this is both
those games are optimized for AMD stuff
so obviously they're going to send those
out now and D fans don't take this the
wrong way but AMD has been spouting the
entire time that this is the Titan
killer you're shocked well I'm gonna
tell you you're about to be disappointed
it's like going out with a girl who
looks like she has boobs you get her
home she would had her bra stuff that
ain't there it's only being compared
right now to the 780 now we'll be up in
another store in a minute but for the
780 you can see that in those two games
yes it's slightly Vidya and that's
really cool for the price point I think
that's excellent
but as far as being the giant slayer you
know you know David and Goliath nah that
shit ain't happenin this card is not
going to blow away the Titan but for the
price point it's going to be a very very
good card I'm really looking forward to
seeing it when they get this new
technology and everything out there and
their drives are up to date
I think the r9 290x is gonna be a pretty
solid card it's just not the Titan
killer now Nvidia not want to just sit
on their ass and pick their nose they
see this and all of a sudden you see
Jensen himself the big guy announcing a
card up in Canada
Jensen walks on stage and he's like oh
yeah well check it out AMD you whip
yours out but I'm gonna whip mine out
and his is gonna be the new 780ti now we
wrote about this before if you guys want
to check the article we'll have it down
there in the description below
we had some spec leaks before about that
if you guys want to check that out but
now they've Oh
Shoei said hey the 780ti it's a common
baby it's coming and you guys know it's
coming now will it be able to beat the
r9 290x I'm thinking the answer is going
to be yes I just think so I don't think
that Jenson himself when you see the
president accompanying came out on stage
with a big smile on his face like he's
got a 10-inch and he's just like ready
to show it off to the world I think that
these guys have their card and like I
said when I was on Linus's show these
guys have kind of been on vacation and
just relaxing for a long time now
there's gonna pull something out of
their ass bring it out and it's gonna be
solid because right now believe me I
know and be fed you're gonna hate to
hear this but Nvidia's ahead of the game
they have books and books of money now
if mantle happens to work out for AMD
and they block and Vidia out that can be
a solid score for Andy where AMD can
move up and in some ways I kind of hope
that happens no offense to you people at
Nvidia but the better that AMD is that
competing the better it is for all of us
me included you included now you guys
can see right behind me we've got this
really killer system that's right it's
the Tron now we did film a video about
this but if you guys want to see some
close-up shots of the interior and the
outside and some of the specs and all
