and around the world welcome back once
again to the town now for you guys who
were looking for a video that was going
to be about PC related stuff or
something like that this video is not
about this this is actually about my
health and kind of an update on my
health and how when I went to the
certain doctor's office they really
hooked me up because of my health just
isn't doing very well at all a lot
actually worse than I even thought it
was so let's just get around it
yesterday
the morning I started feeling really bad
my chest was hurting my back was hurting
my head was hurting and literally felt
like my chest was going to blow up so I
went down to the doctor's office now
this place I went to is called Moreno
Valley family health center it's really
nice place they treat you good and they
don't charge an arm and leg there I mean
that's we'll get to that a little bit
later but I show up for my appointment
and right now I have a big giant cut on
the bottom of my foot and it's kind of
turning in an ulcer so anybody out there
who's diabetic you know how dangerous
this is this can lead to me getting
another amputation and well since I had
this infection even though I've been
taking my diabetes medicine and trying
to take care of myself
my health was not good at all so I get
there and they take my blood and then
after that they do the you know the
blood pressure test on me to see where
my blood pressures at and my blood
pressure it's at 205 over a hundred and
four and the lady kind of just looks at
me and told me that essentially I should
be dead and how am I feeling and at that
point I really wasn't feeling that bad I
was just kind of nervous about the
needles and all that stuff cuz needles
freaked me the heck out man so I was
just totally like almost in fear being
in the doctor's office plus I don't know
why that would ski this place is
freaking cold probably not just you know
spread disease but my god they're cold
so I'm just sitting there like shivering
so they instantly tell me okay either I
have to go to the hospital or I have
another choice I can go to the hospital
or I can take these pills and wait
around and see if my blood pressure
drops at all otherwise it's ladies mate
basically tell me hey you are going to
die so we get the blood test results
back my blood sugar is almost 400 I've
been taking my medication religiously
doing it and I don't know what the heck
is going on but because of the infection
in my foot they told me my medication
everything is not
being as effective as it is which is
keeping my foot to heel so this means
that now I can really not eat anything
at all so like as of today like my
life's not gonna be that fun I'm just
gonna be honest with you because anybody
have to enjoy food and likes food those
are all what I'm talking about I mean
every so often you want sugar well I
can't have sugar at all my my diabetes
even though it's type-2 I guess is so
bad that I'm no longer able to any sugar
whatsoever unless it comes like a form
of an apple and orange or something like
that so any kind of drink anything
whatsoever I can't ever even have even
as a once in a while now you know and if
you're a diabetic person out there you
know how pain the acid is to stick to
the diet because a diet involves nothing
why you can't have rice you can if for
composite you can't have bread you can't
really have anything that that's really
taste good
pretty much the diabetic diet is pretty
much green vegetables vegetables some
more freakin vegetables chicken lean
meat and really not even pork even
though I'm sure pork is okay they don't
like that for some reason pork wasn't
even discussed I don't know you know but
I'm sure pork is okay so your diet is
very very limited now if you're a person
out that you don't care about food or
whatever you only just strictly just eat
just to get by probably wouldn't matter
to you but I don't per something a big
guy I like food I enjoy food a good
cooked home meal it's like one of the
best things you guys can ever get well
through all this stuff you know they're
looking at they're looking at my
medications they're just like wow like
this medication you're using is like an
outdated type thing why is it being
prescribed to you this right here is it
isn't as an old type of insulin I don't
know why you're taking this like so
basically all the medications that I was
taking there doctor just was like no no
no so they repay all different
medication for all the different stuff
so I got heart medicine now I've got
medicine for like an emergency like fer
from my heart you know like if my blood
purge into a certain thing there's other
pill I take to do it I got really strong
levaquin now which is like the most
expensive crazy and into excuse me anti
infection medicine that you can get so I
have that from my foot I got all brand
new needles I got all different types of
medications for my diabetes but really
what really blew my mind more than
anything else is at the end of this they
only charge me $25
can you believe that $25 what they
charge me for all this I guess the
doctors felt bad for me and we're just
like here we're just gonna give you like
the lowest we can go so that means all
these people they dragged they took my
blood they gave me medicine they took
care of even rebandage my foot they did
all of these nice things for me all to
help my health and they did it for only
$25 not to me that's almost like free so
I made an appointment them again on
Monday they're gonna redraw all of them
some more some poor blood samples and a
bunch of different tests and give me
some more tests for my heart and see
where I'm at but that doctor's
appointment is actually gonna be a
little bit more expensive because it
involves a lot more blood tests and
stuff so I guess every blood test when
you start adding him up those start cost
you the money for some reason this my
lives that I just went to they didn't
even charge me for testing because I
guess all they did was just test my
blood sugar levels they didn't put me in
side up some kind of testing machine so
honestly I mean I know this video isn't
about PC out there it's about me
personally whatever I don't know but
honestly my health has been crap and it
just seems like I can't get a frickin
break anywhere no matter what I do it
just seems like my house just keeps
crashing and crashing crashing I don't
know if God's got it out for me or Satan
wants a roommate I don't know what's
going on but one way or another my help
just keeps getting worse and I really
appreciate these people so I know you
guys probably already gonna watch this
video hey my security guard friend I
know you're watching it so thank you to
you and to all the people there for
honestly that was the best 25 dollars
I've ever spent in my life honestly 25
bucks to take care of my life I love you
