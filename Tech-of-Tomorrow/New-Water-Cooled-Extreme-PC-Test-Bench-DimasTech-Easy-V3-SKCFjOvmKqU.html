audible.com audible.com is the leading
provider of audiobooks with more than
150,000 downloadable titles across all
types of literature including fiction
nonfiction and periodicals hey people
out there on the Internet welcome back
once again to take it Ammar we're
bringing you all the tech all the time
now today we're doing something kind of
interesting we have a couple different
places that we do testing down of the
teams that a little bit larger now we
have the original test station that we
brought you with captain heavy they have
that everything over to the location but
I needed a test bed here at my location
so I could do some of the testing and
emulate what's going on so I decided hey
man why not go out and get a really
gnarly test station so I got a Dimas
tech-easy v3 now this thing is just huge
it'll store any type of motherboard that
there is all kinds of periphery is up
the ying-yang water cooling power
supplies you name it this thing will
take it all so I start out though using
an asus z87 deluxe motherboard this is a
really fine blue the board has lots of
features on it for doing the testing
didn't really figured I need a quad
testing motherboard right at this time
this thing will do up to three cards and
I think that's pretty much within my
limits at the moment as far as the CPU
goes we're using the latest Intel i7
4770k CPU now this thing's gonna be
overclocked to about 4.2 4.3 because we
are using liquid cooling we're using a
hybrid swift X slash monsoon system all
of the major components that matter
pretty much are all by Swift tech the
block the radiator all the tubes the
only thing different is the reservoir
the reservoir is my monsoon it's nice
and long it's all cold and red and it
looks really really cool memory 32
gigabytes of Patriot VIPRE this is
they're really fast 2133 stuff I'm gonna
have that overclock as well on the board
now you guys can see there's plenty of
room around the area in the test station
building pretty much whatever you want
you can even set cards on the station
you can set parts around it's very easy
interchange and due to the size any
mother working
it doesn't matter what motherboard you
even have a server motherboard and it
will fit on top of this bad boy
now right now on the test ation I
currently have the latest - ATX from
sapphire on there because that's gonna
be the latest thing that we're testing
but this is the new test station I think
it's really cool it's very very easy to
work with I really want to stress that a
lot very easy to work with now as far as
storage goes we have two types of
storage we have the SSD brought to you
this is the latest Neutron 240 gigabyte
SSD from the people over at Corsair
thank you once again mr. Rickster
appreciate that
and we also have a Western Digital 2
terabyte black drive for our major media
drive so that's pretty much it we use a
lot of different custom cabling and type
of stuff all around the build you guys
can see that
and also the really the main thing about
this test station is the room you have
so much room in this taste station to
work with you can put any kind of video
cards on there any type of motherboard
you guys can see there is just over
adequate room now mind you real estate
yeah this sucker does take up some real
estate and it is pretty heavy but to me
the dmoz tech test station so far has
been the best one that I think we've
brought in the lab we've had the danger
den ones we've had ones from all kinds
of name brands we even had a giant huge
thing from in when I know a lot of
people like that one to me that was just
too damn big this one to me is like
right in that perfect spot it's big
enough to be adequate to use everything
I want to use but not so big that it's
like hauling a truck around like when I
worked at Newegg i remember that paul
got this giant went in like i thought
about should i get this thing then I saw
them basically like looking around your
backpack and I went I didn't want that
thing so this one I have to say I'm
pretty happy with but hey before I go I
want to talk to you guys just a little
bit more about this audible.com thing
because it's actually really pretty cool
I actually got turned on this a while
back from a friend of mine Adrian before
we even got contacted by these guys
because this guy works all the time it
has like eight kids I'm not even joking
the Stewart has eight kids and the only
time he could enjoy books is driving
pretty much back and forth to work
so I remember last year he told me his
big solution was going to this thing
going audible.com I just download my
books
I listen to him going back and forth so
I thought you know what I'll try this as
well to see what it's like and so I got
Ender's Game Orson Scott Card thing I'm
totally familiar with this thing cuz
like I read it years ago but reading it
is a lot different than having somebody
narrate it and talk it out to you
this book happens to be a book though
that I can wholeheartedly recommend I
like it a lot if you guys want to read
it to check it out you guys can now get
it for free audible.com forward slash
tomorrow you guys can download the app
it works with your Android device it
works with your Apple device so if you'd
like to download a free book and support
techni tomorrow all in the single slice
then go to audible.com forward slash
tomorrow and you can do that we also
want to give a big thanks out to
audible.com for making this happen
so before I'm out of here once again all
that information will be down there
below the like button down the
description tab where you guys can check
out everything for yourself I'm mark
we'll see you guys background check in
tomorrow for more tech action
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
