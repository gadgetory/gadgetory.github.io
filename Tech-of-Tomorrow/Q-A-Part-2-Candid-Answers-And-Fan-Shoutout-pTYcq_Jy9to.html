so we had the QA sorry I said I bring it
last Saturday we just had a bunch of
stuff with that LG TV in the last day
that giveaway didn't want to miss that
for you guys we did that video but now
we're here for the Q&amp;amp;A to answer your
guys questions and give you guys a shout
out so first of all we'll answer
question by this guy anal Devastator
what a pain in the ass this guy is and
actually there's many of you out there
west this question so for all of you
guys to ask how it is buddy the dog well
this little dude over here is like 13
years old he's very old the story on him
and if you guys don't know it but a few
years ago means use the Cameron we went
to starbucks and i was in starbucks they
told me about budding they said hey
there's this dog just wandering on the
parking lot would you want it and like i
was hesitant because i didn't want to
steal someone's dog I've never had a dog
before but even then I thought like you
know it would be family and not to take
it so i asked geum he was like basically
a man the dog jumps in the truck on his
own accord then he's your dog so i hope
my truck door he jumped in I posted
Flyers all over the place ask questions
nobody ever came forward and that's how
we got buddy the dog and he's honestly
been the best thing in my life changed
my life in many many many ways I mean
you guys have been fans you guys known
for a long time I was really angry and
and like having the dog really did a lot
to like curtail my anger I'm just
telling you that right now having him
and loving him unconditionally is it's
been an awesome experience so the next
question we're going to move on to we
have a guy named big squad mi jeezy see
you ad enhance what is our main camera
and lens so we use the Lumix gh4 that's
our camera we have a lumex panasonic
lenses to 12 35 and then for the
microphone we have the zoom h1 so that's
the microphone used to record and that's
pretty much all of our stuff we use a
Mac to do most of reading and are no my
god why don't use a PC we just we always
have like we've been using Final Cut
forever but everybody's comfortable
around here so that's what we use for
those type of tools so also i'm just
going to ask another guy this guy down
here he asked me a question about his
name is x step x and he asked me if I'm
an animal friend and if I'm against
animal abuse and absolutely I would
never abuse any animal whatsoever i have
my cat my dog i think that they have
equal rights to people and that anybody
who have used animals and treats them
that bad really has no play
owning one or having one if you're a
person who wants to choose to abuse
somebody and get a white and then get
her to sue you don't do it to a poor dog
or a cat or an animal that has
absolutely no defense against you it's
not fair it's wrong and it's really sad
think about it those animals have every
right to this planet just as much as we
do if not more so you know we're
actually people destroying the planet
cutting up the rain forest doing bad
stuff to the oceans killing the planet I
don't think there's any animal cat dog
out there who's out polluting and
destroying the planet so yeah I
definitely love animals I'm definitely
against people who abuse them so let's
scroll down here so here's the next one
this one is from Archer grim mail these
bike elric I've been a fan for a long
time now I think you're very charisma
guy funny humble and spontaneous so tell
us more about your personal life what
amath motherboards org how is my
everyday life pretty long one type of
workouts I do I was a really long
questionable I'll get a couple of them
motherboards either was based we had a
bad business partner he tried taking
money from us we fought back we won the
battle we moved on to TECA tomorrow it's
all I'm going to touch upon that one
struggles I face every day why me for
most of you guys you guys know I mean I
ain't got no toes no toes on this foot
and once again no toes on this foot for
anybody who's actually interested in
back here for all you guys have ever
answering I don't my manager does not
want to do this but I have a G just one
time zoom in on my foot because you guys
have asked this you guys want to know my
struggle this right here is my struggle
I can barely walk I can't lip things
good anymore and I have to take so much
pain medication just to not be in pay it
makes me woozy sometimes so it actually
has affected the quality of my videos
sometimes I haven't been myself and I
asked you guys you know forgiveness on
that but it's been very hard dealing
with all the stuff that's been done to
me I cancer my feet cut off they stuck a
PICC line into me and stopped my heart
and killed me in the hospital soul it's
been you know a rough ordeal so as far
as workouts go um I don't work out
anymore at the gym I had to stop that's
actually kind of how I hurt myself I was
just over exerting myself in the gym
I've gained a little bit of weight but
I'm just trying to balance out my diet
and then he asked me why I don't do
vlogs and you Beyonce I don't have an
answer cuz I don't know why I don't do
blogs probably just cuz we're busy
trying to do so much other stuff I'm
heavy into music and we're working with
music stuff and this stuff that just a
me so many hours in the day so let's
just keep moving on because there's lots
of questions here okay here's one this
guy's name is Zimbabwe and he asked me
all right why do you beat up all your
graphics cards it hurts me haha the back
of those cards are meant for protection
and I knock on those things honestly
just to get the guff of guys like you
because if people get mad about it so
it's actually when I met that back of
that card I'm trolling you because I
know you're going to say something so I
smack them hard it never affects the
card believe me if a card you get
affected by you smacking the back of it
it would be a cheap-ass card so on that
one will move past it but that's the
reason why so let's just keep scrolling
keep scrolling keep scrolling ha here we
go this guy named elric claudio just
kind of weird I've never met anybody
else is my name he asked me that when a
lot of people out there when they mess
my name up what do they call me and like
I get Albert and Howard all the time and
be like hey my name is Ellie Howard
Albert that's what I get all the time
and yes people mispronounce my first
name people really mispronounce my last
name it's PA chariots it's pronounced
for a people call me ferris fairies like
I've dealt with every abuse of names you
could ever imagine my name's been made
of fun of in every way you can think of
in school believe me I got the shits
very Ferris believe me there's been a
bunch of them so the answers that
question will keep moving on more
questions for you guys Duncan tun tun
tun tun tun don't uh this is kind of a
weird questions from a guy named Randy
Savage maybe the wrestler guy maybe not
and he asked me he goes I seem to be
between the low and a high end of
youtube subscriber numbers is it
possible to live a comfortable life with
the numbers you have if so was there a
specific time that has happened to you
alright for you guys who don't know me
I've been the tech industry honestly
since day one when all these companies
formed it became actually a PC company
my dad was the lawyer that helped
actually gather all this stuff together
its corporate attorney so since day one
I've been doing this I was an
interesting magazine for a long time and
it had a bunch of other magazines I did
this in time but Jonathan Morrison from
tldtoday we were working to go and
Johnson said hey man
why don't you do some like YouTube stuff
so I kind of switched from riding over
to youtube then we built the
motherboards out of channel and this
channel now I'm not the youngest
demographic out there a lot of people
out there like a much younger person I
just know the other industries different
driven by young people and so I'm kind
of like stuck in between that and plus
I've been sick and you guys who followed
me know I've actually done some stupid
 to step on my dick like getting mad
at people and setting them hassling
emails and like that so in that
sense in a lot of ways i myself
but my anger but I'll apologize to every
we've moved past that and I'm okay right
now I'm by no means getting rich like
that's not it I don't have like hardly
any money my bills are get paid I mean
you can eke out a modest living at the
numbers i have i plan on revamping the
channel finding out more what you guys
want and concentrate on better videos
next year as my health gets better i'm
getting slowly better and as i get
better you guys can see the videos are
starting to get back up sorry I knew you
guys want pc stuff i've had to do ads
but if you guys understand anything i
have to make a living obviously the
person who asked this question knows
there's some money to be made so yes I
mean all of you guys go to work how
would you feel if I came to your job and
ask you just to work for free because if
you want me to bring you guys good
content but you don't me to make any
money you're kind of putting me in a
catch-22 if I don't have money to pay
Jesus the Cameron so we can't pay his
bills and feed his family I can't bring
money into here how can we even bring
this YouTube channel to you whatsoever
so I know some people got mad called me
a sellout and all that if you want to
call me a sell it just because I've sold
some ads it's cool but I don't really
feel that way at all I feel that for all
the stuff i give you guys and all the
stuff I wrote planning giving you guys
in doing that it's fair for me to get a
standard income like I'm not a
millionaire like I don't live in the
Grand Place I don't drive a fancy car
like you guys know I get review samples
and that's cool that's like the whole
fringe Benny of this entire thing is
getting to keep really cool review
samples that's the biggest thing about
this that I like as far as you know
getting rich or anything like no I'm
surviving so long-winded answer but
that's where it's at so let's just keep
moving along moving along due to do I
went through all these but then you guys
actually uh I was surprised that you
guys actually shot through so many
questions you guys shut through a maze
amazing amount of questions okay Bruno
Amaro this guy is always on the channel
brews like puts comments in all of our
videos he basically asked about our move
and stuff like that Bruno we actually
got a respite and got really lucky my
new place won't be ready till June first
of next year and like I was honest in
the verge of like getting kicked out of
my place and having nowhere to go
because that's just how things the
cookie crumbled but luckily God
intervened to the powers to be whatever
you believe in powers of good stepped in
and my landlord made another agreement
with me to let me stay here until my
house becomes available on june first so
i don't have to move but on june first i
will be moving out to know ways out kind
of towards the desert and that you guys
will see a whole new setup place whole
new everything whole new footman so
that's that let's move on to another
question oh alright here's a guy named
ritz camera sushi can me shiro what was
your job prior to youtube well I think I
kind of already covered that question
earlier when I talked about things I've
done but basically I started out as a
writer moved on to youtube and I do what
I do now so my job before I had any of
this kind of stuff before this though I
was always in sales selling computer
stuff selling something doing something
with sales went from sales to writing to
youtube to answer your guys's questions
so let's keep scrolling along country
road so pax pax racks rack packs he asks
what's the dog's name I think most
people know that though so his name's
buddy because he's a buddy that's a real
quick easy one tenten tenten to another
guy Michael Williams asked my question
is what inspired you to start and
maintain your channels I enjoy tech and
I really at the end of the day wanted to
always bring you guys great content and
information contact that was fair I've
never taken money and told anybody's
product and said oh hey this guy's
products good for money no matter what
you guys think of me I've never taken a
bribe which is like a lot of times the
videos you won't see me I won't beat
things up if someone's doing video I
keep it very very fair I don't cut them
deep I don't pop them up I just stick to
the facts so my inspiration really was
to bring you guys the best news and
stuff truthfully without being spiced up
with any influence whatsoever other than
which my own opinions how I naturally
about something so okay gamma gave me he
said just give me a reason not to give
me a shout out there we gave you a shout
out okay dollars my toilet some of you
guys questions are really really funny
men and okay here's one staff subzi said
when did I become instrument technology
I became instant technology the very
first time that I heard music in
someone's home and I was like where is
that coming from and they took me and
they had this cheap old plastic
turntable with plastic speakers that
basically folded up like a lunch box you
open it up it had two speakers that
popped out and had a record player into
well this thing broke stop working one
day and so Iowa and I asked my mom hates
giving tools and she was like for what
and so we wouldn't got some crazy tools
just cheap old tools and I took the
thing apart I changed the belt and fixed
it and from that day forward I was into
what makes technology run what it does
and it's just been a whole life's
journey like you guys know follow
channel I'm really into guitars and
guitar technology like I'm getting to
the point now right we know more about
guitars then I even do about computers
i'm just so unto that so I've been in
technology literally since i was about
12 years old this it hit me like a brick
and bottom with it ever since so that
answers that one let's just keep going
here we got lots of them in here Oh wax
wax says what is my google password just
joking but hey come on let's see here
what else we got going on let me flip
through these things right here don't
mean to stall here but just a little bit
naturally as I go through here okay
here's one the todds gives he said a
lark I have a question for you tell us
your three of your favorite YouTube
channels favorite YouTube channels
philly d was really like the first guy
who I really liked on YouTube he's not
really a tech guy but I just totally
loved his style and thought it was
awesome I really like the people at
hardware canucks they might not get a
lot of hits but I worshipped those guys
in their case reviews they do a
fantastic job and even though I business
partner John at TLD doesn't know what I
respect him and have a lot of respect
for the videos he does he does a
fantastic job on stuff i'm actually an
envy of him now he was my protege for
years so i can
that I'm also proud of him because he
came more what I'm doing and completely
surpassed what I'm doing as one of the
absolute best tech channels on the
internet so i guess if you want to say
my favorite one now would probably be
TLD I mean he does a really damn good
job and believe it or not I strive to be
like my business partner is so those
three that i really like there are a lot
that I view out there like I check out
Paul's hardware I check out a lot of
places um all of them I mean unbox
therapy like um I don't really check out
soldierknowsbest that much an MK BDI
sometimes I check out his channel those
get those guys are okay too and they're
really cool um I just I don't know I
like more of a solid Slyke funny like
Logan from tech syndicate like he's
really a funny guy like when I watch his
videos I usually laugh and I
administrate about different subjects
and I'm not really into but when he
talked about stuff I do like I really
like watching his videos there's just
really so many people out there excuse
me I notice diction like a mother that I
really have a lot of respect for and I
consider all day and give you but the
top three are those ones that I just
named off to you so let's go here dun
dun dun dun dun dun dun how would I find
buddy Jack ray 99 we gave you a story
already ha this guy says sorry but the
dog with my face is disgusting I suppose
you might think that but he's my best
friend I here's one Alexander Kenton
says hey Eric I realize you don't have a
ring on your finger have you not found
the right person where your watch
married you ever plan on getting married
you're just not wear a ring can I
explain why all right well you guys know
I have two kids and with those two kids
i have like most guys 2x freaking wife's
you know that's just how it is so my
daughter is from my first wife and aaron
is from my second wife and so I'm just
divorced him those two and and now that
i have tekken tomorrow my music and my
dog I'm afraid just you know dating once
in a while but I don't know I'm 50 years
old now I've got other interest right
now I played that you know let's put it
this way i'll just put you basically
it's like the way i feel i feel like i
honestly retired from marriage that's
the way it is I was married for so long
that should return for my job i retired
from marriage I'm a happy bachelor I
wouldn't change a damn thing about
that aspect of it so there's your answer
let's scroll down some order now okay
you guys asked what kind of editing
software we use told you guys answers is
fan of tech the road to 100 subscribers
and like I said then we use a Mac but
you can get a hackintosh and we use
final cut there are plenty of things on
a piece that you can use well but we
were all just trained and that's what we
know so that's what we use because we're
comfortable it plus we do all of our
music and logic so those two just kind
of go hand in hand and that's the reason
why we do it it's not that we don't like
PC we're anti pc or anything like that
that's just what we use so that's that
so let's keep going answer a few more
here don't want to keep you guys on here
for hours on end doing this stuff cuz
I'm sure next time you guys want to do
it live I saw most you guys coming so
next time we will do it live we'll do a
live on Twitter how it's going to do you
guys smash the questions live Colin and
I will answer them live just like Elias
knows other guys do so we will doing
that all right ah did Obama care okay
this is from nimrod RT did Obamacare
affect your medical things in any way oh
you've touched a touchy subject with me
dude I don't like Obamacare it's
 as far as I'm concerned
everything to do with my health went up
extraordinarily high all these people go
oh yeah they can't refuse you for
anything doesn't matter they just raised
the price on everything and for those
few people out there who benefited from
it Hey Wow hats off to you cool
bells but for me no way I can no longer
afford my health insurance it went from
being one hundred ninety dollars a month
to being almost four hundred and ninety
dollars a month so I know and yeah there
are some really cheesy programs you can
get there like three hundred dollars a
month but who wants to pay an eight
thousand dollar deductible I don't even
spend eight thousand dollars right now
so I'd pay this health insurance pay 300
dollars a month and spend twice as much
money on health care that I'm doing now
makes no sense so no Obamacare screwed
me I don't know I have mixed feelings
about Obama like I don't know some
things maybe for a socialistic country
he's done good but for other things as
far as our military disrespect never
saluting people in our military I am a
vet you Obama for not respecting
the bets and the people who take care of
this country like we volunteered go out
and do which ends up to us having
bad help and you don't even give us
salute to know not a fan of Obama not a
fan of Obamacare I don't like politics
so let's move on don't fit in turn turn
turn turn turn okay here's a good one
David the music guy says what is your
biggest dream you've having your child
but still didn't achieve it music I've
always wanted to sing it like a big band
like disturb to get that break and just
be able to go sing with a big bad and
like sing in front of a kazillion bunch
of people like that's my dream that
hasn't been totally achieved positive
one of my dreams it would be to do that
another dream always has i really like i
really like architecture because
architecture is basically art that you
live in and I think that's really cool
I'd love to like design houses and stuff
like that that all blended with nature
in the surrounding areas i think that
would be bows yeah so basically
architecture and being a rock star those
are two things i wish i could do but we
all have dreams and i try to choose them
they're just baby steps so let's check
out some more questions through here
tenten tenten okay some guy's head linux
2 3 5 6 7 9 basically asked what is
motherboards org well motherboards
daughter was my business for about 25
years I started that company found it
round it had lots of followers from
around the world lots of support it is
now at the funk to business there's a
youtube channel a website but it's no
longer anything but basically a portal
for from Michael siggins in his
company so that's all that it is they're
gone it was a great site now it's a
nothing site don't play with fire moving
on I they say who is the youtuber who
inspired me the most um I really wasn't
inspired by any particular youtuber at
all when I was a child I did a lot of
acting and stuff so when Jonathan said
hey we should do the video thing I
didn't really know what it was I kind of
fought it at first but once we started
doing it I just kind of just developed
my own style being myself I mean we used
to do a lot of funny and do weird
endings and we're beginnings but as we
got different management companies they
kind of curtail what we do and try to
control we do and you know it'd be like
be focused on what you're doing so
there's absolutely no fluff or cheese in
your videos though like any of the fat
flavoring that was in my hamburgers been
kind of taken out just to be a leaner
burger now I know the
burgers probably healthier for you but I
like the fattier burgers you guys can
cut through that and what you want to
but I think you know what I mean so
let's keep going keep going my birthday
is December 24th got a present I'm just
glad to be your friend all right well
mr. PS k lot 71 we're glad you're here
as well let's say you're daunted into
some guy named saliste ECG see who goes
do I know a guy named say Tama and numb
have no idea that is I knew Satan is but
not say Thomas that is crazy cousin
maybe they hang I don't know alright so
let's see here attempted and tenten
tenten how we already answered some was
looking for tech stuff we talked about
that I was in the sales and all kinds of
their stuff tenten tenten too ok this
guy asked at from Zachary I work what
are some of your favorite books and how
birth of why wow man if you guys follow
channel before my bookshelves were
filled with science fiction books I've
read got so many authors that book
excuse me I could understand here for
days um arthur c clarke big fan of his
work um michael moorcock love him man um
there's just too many books to even
touch that one dude I love to read I'm
reading books right now I'm reading this
guy named Michael ericsson he like does
like this like space battle drama type
stuff it's kind of cool it's fake
basically about these people who form
this new space alliance and they have
like all kinds of different mixed people
that they're getting to be in the
military it's just a really cool read
and stuff um in fact you know what I'll
have G throwing a link down at the
bottom to somebody's latest books
embrace if you guys one know exactly
what i'm reading all you guys can check
them out for yourself off a link down
below so we'll move on from that bigoted
says where'd I go to college and if so
what did I study time I went to cerritos
college and I went to long beach state
and at first I studied music but then I
got into computers and so I kind of like
kind of dabble them that stuff I never
actually totally completed a degree I
kind of got bored with doing the school
thing and I was studying computer
science and I was really close it's like
having enough units to get a degree but
I was just like wow and honestly no job
ever worked at has ever asked me for a
degree they always ask me like what do
you know how to do and so it's I have a
long history of what I know how to do
I don't think a degrees really gonna
make you know it's just like you know a
paint job with like adding a stripe
maybe paint jobs cool but I'm degree put
a stripe on how much that stripe really
matter for me it hasn't mattered
whatsoever so there's that lexicon devil
ass do I listen to punk I dig
punk music I like any type of music man
i don't really like like too much of the
country there's some country like
country rock would like the old like
moellering country I don't really like
that stuff very much but everything else
beyond that I'm a fan of so let's see
your rolling down okay here guy says a
curious fear what breed is your dog hell
if I know we found them in the street
like we said earlier okay let's hear
what is the best way of fusion Apotex is
what is the best way to start a tech
channel the best way to start a check
channel first of all is get yourself a
good camera and a good microphone a
couple of decent lights and a white
balance thing draw an expensive those
are the first things you want to get
yourself and then what you want to do is
you want to start reviewing and talking
about the stuff that you own or friend
zone so my advice if you're inspiring
youtuber you don't have a lot of money
get with your friends do the business
acts with your friends because your
friends will have parts some guy might
say hey dude you know what man there's
the game coming on i bought this latest
card convince your friend to let you
borrow that card to review in your
channel and work with your friend that's
the absolute best advice I can give any
aspiring YouTube is to really work with
others don't make yourself an island
whatsoever I've sometimes done that it's
been a mistake on my end don't ever
alienate yourself or make yourself an
island from people out there be open be
willing to intermingle with them and be
willing to work with them and share
stuff and if you do that you'll have the
first steps to make a great YouTube
channel because it's all about
cooperation and intermingling between
the different people that's what makes
you successful on YouTube so let's see
here um another guy just asked Matt a la
Tour d asked what injuries are talking
about we kind of already answered that I
went over all my injuries and all that
stuff that's happened so here i'm mr.
meeseeks how often do you clip your
nails honestly man I try to clip my
nails all the time a lot of people ask
me this pinky finger go do you cook
that's not what it is whatsoever when I
play guitar and some thai like that for
slide guitar I just
you taking my pic so i can be picking
and just sliding but general i try to
cut my nails like every other day
because they're not cut I can't properly
you know poured all my strings so a lot
so we'll move on I think I'm probably
going to wrap it up here in just a
minute as we've answered a lot of your
guys's questions in here all right here
we go here's some passive weird one job
job van Dyke would you live your whole
life with pop come between your teeth or
sleeping and foot and how do you know
your dog is a dog what it would also be
a big cat that can bark okay listen
mister slow down on smoking that wacky
tabacky stuff because your questions
really weird I guess I'd rather live
though with popcorn in my teeth in a
sleeping hand or folks that's really
uncomfortable you know popcorn thing at
least I could eat it later you know
saved food and I know my dog's a dog
because he told me so dog straight up so
there you go alright let's see here
we're almost down through all these ones
right here try to answer me I want to
keep you guys are all day long I know
you guys want to answer these these
questions um oh here guy said ghosty 81
where do I want to live but you're not
American which year do you want to live
in the past in the future and who is my
favorite Marvel DC character I've ever
traveled to another country so I'll
start from the bottom yeah I've traveled
to a whole bunch of different countries
I was in the military I've traveled all
of the place but New Mexico whole whole
lot of times with different people so
yes who is my favorite Marvel or DC
character well my favorite DC character
is probably going to be the Batman for
the flash and my favorite Marvel
character that's really a hard one but
tub I really like Doctor Strange a lot
you guys are going to meet him he's
awesome like he's this magic do simple
guy you know Nalls and it gets these
arcane powers and he's like super power
point he's really cool so he's one of my
favorite characters and if I had a
choice to live in the past or the future
ah-me I think I'd want to live in the
future the past seems cool but I'm in a
technology so going back in the past
isn't so much my technical you know
stuff so learning the future because it
because they get to see all that
technology
the plants probably be put to
because of us but that's just the way it
is and where I want to live if I didn't
live in America um probably Sweden or
Canada both those places are kind of the
same they're both kind of cool kind of
semi socialistic but not totally their
democratic socialistic the right in
between and if i was going to move I'd
probably move to one of those two places
so that's pretty much that okay um
here's one full war thugs TV are the 4k
tvs value for the money if their use is
like a TV and not a 4k game monitor for
gaming well some 4k tvs out there will
totally be for gaming they're going to
have the right fruit fresh rates they're
going to have all that stuff other stuff
they're not going to app and you're
going to get a 4k TV and even though it
looks good you know it's not going to be
totally geared like that and some of the
video cards out there if they don't have
the proper HDMI support are only going
to give you 30 frames per second so if
you have like hdmi 1.3 or anything old
like that you're not going to get the
full benefits of that so make sure you
get a TV and you want a game on it make
sure you get one that has the proper
refresh rate and the proper HDMI support
you want at least two point oh so that
answers that the tip too dude but the
third lament I gotta say you guys really
that's right here we go all asses who
know Louise look Lois muscle 1134 what
happened with pain cylinder okay pain
sorrow was my metal band and we tried
for years to make it we got great gigs
we opened up for great bands everything
but honestly as the years went by I was
just starting to see that financially
Pain Center was a losing entity we were
a great band we were great friends
Jesse's still my guitar player we still
work together he's just touring with
their bands right now so like me and him
or fine Criss the drummer like it's his
brother were all friends but pain zone
just got to a point to me where I felt I
was honestly putting out so much money
just to keep the band going there every
time I looked at my checkbook I was like
 man pain someone just cost me this
much money this month so it just got to
the point where it honestly it was just
too much money we weren't making any
money was costing me money as soon as I
switched and just start doing my own
singles of my own solo stuff holliston I
started making my
music doing a lot better with my music
career so I just did showers sorry I
just chose to go solo and even my
bandmates agree that was probably the
best decision for me because it balanced
out so that's a lot of questions folks
that's all any answer for today i feel
it's quite a bit of questions we've been
here for quite a while I want to bore
you guys it's the holidays I just want
to tell you guys that you guys are an
awesome audience and I love you guys and
I will bring a live Q&amp;amp;A next weekend we
have lots of cool killer ship coming out

monitors in an x 34 and then a brand new
one that's a 2 k for k badass monitor
with chee seng so lots of stuffs coming
up we got system's coming up we give
aways coming up believe me I'm trying to
find out what you guys want and get back
in the groove to make all you fans hat
because at the end of the day I'm here
really to make you guys happy life is
