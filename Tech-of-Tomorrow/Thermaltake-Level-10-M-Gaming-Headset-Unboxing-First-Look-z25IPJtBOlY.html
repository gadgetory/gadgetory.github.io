welcome to tech tomorrow we're bringing
you all the tech all the time now I know
everybody's always looking for a really
good set of headphones at a really good
price well now thermal takes TT esports
has come out with their brand new level
10 and the headphones that's right now
you guys have all seen all the other
stuff that's come out from this line
looks really really cool you guys have
all seen their stuff for the people who
follow the line well now they've got
these things now Shannon came over day
from thermaltake and gave me kind of
this spiel on what these headphones are
all about so they're 99 bucks have a
folding portable upright microphone 40
millimeter drivers and gold-plated
hardware and with that said though let's
jump in check out the box and take a
closer look at these new headphones
alright folks so here we have the box
looks pretty cool you guys can see the
level 10 M gaming headset reinvent the
unexpected kind of like reinventing the
wheel I guess you know need to do it
what what the hell down here we have
some of their features aluminum base
Mike access designed by lateral
connectivity what that means you can
connect the cable to either side we'll
get to that a minute but it's actually
pretty interesting on the side they
bassist have the story about it talks
about how they designed it and all that
stuff if you guys are interested in
reading that I mean I'll place it up as
you can see and have him zoom in on it
but I think it's kind of irrelevant most
people aren't going to care but once
again in the back of the box just got
their stuff once again that we just
talked about in the aluminum base the
mic X designed the bilateral USB
connectivity so that said let's just go
ahead and take them out of the box
young the young nice little box right
alrighty then there's a little tab over
here pop the tab and then boom voil√† we
open up the box now first off here the
accessories now inside the accessories
box I understand there's two different
types of setups so there's this setup
right here which I will just go ahead
take out this is all for like your
camera your laptop your phone and you
that type of stuff this is the connector
for that now you can see they use a USB
style connector for plugging into the
headphones down you know sometimes you
got to twist the plug around to get the
plug to go right you know you hear that
with this you eliminate that all
together pretty cool design I like that
set that out of the way we got a little
book here with this little book about
math Yeti out it's a little book alright
this stuff all right here is for your pc
now this has stuff which includes for
your microphone has the cancellation
volume and all that stuff and this is
for your pc total control right here
very very nice actually looks pretty
cool as well you can see we've got the
plugs for both the microphone and the
headphones right here and then still
another USB style connector right there
so we'll get back to that in just a
second let's go ahead and get sounds
late pull these out a blink a bling now
I know these things are going to be a
bitch to get out of here oh also there's
this too so check this out they've got
this really cool like waterproof like
bag it's actually quite cool it's very
soft neoprene it's kind of made almost
the same stuff as the headphones so it's
pretty interesting pretty waterproof too
could I also use it you know as a heads
max do you like for Halloween you know
oh by the North 10 anyways moving
on here's the headphones they're all
kind of locked inside of here so I'm
either going to have to grab a knife or
wipe mine looks back here in the back I
can do some untwist e little things here
no need to break out the power tools go
ahead and pop that out of there here's
another one over here yadda yadda yadda
twisty twisty twisty have fun fun fun
fun fun nerve-wracking all right there
we go voila the headphones up now have
been removed so let's start off 40
millimeter drivers very soft in between
foam and rubber these are supposed to be
very very comfortable on your ears I'll
put them in my head after we talked
about this but you guys can see that
there's one side there's the other
they're also very very flexible as you
can see they twist around now one thing
it's really cool to is these things move
up and down but you can also lock them
there's this little red button right
here you guys can see this will actually
lock your headset in place so you can
adjust it lock it unlock it however you
want to use it now I thank you unlock it
that I don't know but hey I locked it
anyways and it works so I'll to figure
out the next part as we go but slides
around very very easily locked
microphone you can see how it folds up
completely out of the way so if you're
using it somewhere like a gym or
somewhere you know you could fold up all
the way out or if not pull it out fold
it out and voila there you go there's a
little arrow pointing right there here's
a little talky part
so that's all that now check it out
another cool thing is connect on either
side right or left so if you feel
comfortable with connecting on one side
of the other you totally get that option
I think it's really cool you don't see
that very much now these things like
they said are made of aluminum base
they're very very light I think it's set
on the box like put it say there and
head it on there 300 grams so these
things weigh 300 grams that's what they
way so that's pretty damn light so let
me go ahead and put them in my head
Shannon said that they're on my head for
a long time they'll be nice and
comfortable so make you a little test
here okay and actually by golly they
actually are pretty comfortable they're
very light I don't see them giving me
any head fatigue if I wear them for
quite a while I think they'll do quite
nicely actually now as far as the sound
goes like I said these guys have
engineered him though even though their
gaming headphones they've geared them so
that they do sound good with music and
gaming I specifically asked Shannon Rob
about this and he said no they're made
as a gaming headset but they're
engineered so they sound good in both
gaming and music I've specified this
before that some of the headsets it's a
you know we're designated for gaming you
play games like oh wow cool do you play
reason you're like oh what happened
well supposedly these are going to sound
good in both ways what you know in the
