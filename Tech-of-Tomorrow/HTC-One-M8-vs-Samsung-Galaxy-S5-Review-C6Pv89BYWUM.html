welcome to tech of tomorrow I millwork
your host and today we've got something
really interesting now you guys know I
started doing all this stuff by myself
and I solely built up a really awesome
team raw there were bad boys now you
guys all gave Kevin and awesome welcome
to my channel he feels really
comfortable you guys like his work well
now we're gonna step it up a notch even
more now you guys know I'm a consumer
like I'm not the most intricate phone
guy in the world but I know that a lot
of people out there want those very very
intricate phone videos so now I want you
to welcome the latest member of my team
now this is Marco he also works at a
company called phone dog woof woof and I
want you guys to welcome Marco here to
tech of tomorrow so without any further
ado without seeing my funny face anymore
let's check out Marco and his first
video on phone technology here on tech
Oh tomorrow welcome Marco my name is
Marco henna from tech of tomorrow it's
for samsung galaxy s5 vs HTC One m8 the
samsung galaxy s5 retains all of that
Samsung build quality or lack of the
only main difference is the new backing
that sort of reminds me of the Moto X
but it doesn't feel quite the same the
phone has grown a little one size for
display now measuring it 5.1 inches a
point 1 inches from the samsung galaxy
s4 yet the resolution stays the same at
1920 x 1080 but that keeps its pixels
per inch well north of 400 ppi you also
notice the bezels a little longer on the
s5 in the s4 plus we have a new flap
covering the micro USB charging port
this is all to make the s5 more durable
in case you drop it plus it gives vs 5
an ip67 rating with that the s5 can
withstand up to one meter of water for
30 minutes with no problem just be sure
to close all the seals and apart from
those changes the s5 just looks like any
other samsung galaxy model the HTC One
m8 takes for design and the build
quality of the original one and makes it
even better it's now made mostly from a
blend of aluminum and polycarbonate it
also grew to five inches up from 4.7
inches overall the phone feels much of
the same than the original HTC One but
since it has more metal on it it feels
much more slippery
in the hand the old HTC one was built
out of seventy percent aluminum and had
polycarbonate on the sides which made
the HTC One something you can grip on
the new HTC One is now made of ninety
percent aluminium and uses metal on the
sides the result is a very slippery
device since HTC has effectively gotten
rid of the edge that the old HTC One had
also I do like the ergonomics of the s5
a lot better than the HTC One not build
quality that's very important it's just
the ergonomics and how it sits in your
hand for example the m8 has a lock
switch on the top right hand side it's a
little bit better than the old HTC One
but now it's way too big for my finger
to reach up the s5 has its power lock
switch on the right hand side which is
the exact place where my finger will
rest but if you're that kind of person
who Lots build quality dictate what you
buy the HTC One is top trump next is
storage and pricing of these two the s5
and HTC One our flagships and they cost
flagship money the s5 comes in at 199
for the 16 gigabyte model and 299 for 32
gigabyte model while the HTC one only
comes in at 32 gigabytes through the
same 199 price tag on the s5 you can
bump up that storage by 128 gigabytes
thanks to a microSD card slot next to
the SIM slot and now for the first time
the HTC One m8 adds a microSD card slot
on the opposite side of the sem tray it
too will support a 128 gigabyte microSD
card but the only trouble is you need a
paper clip to swap it out but displays
on both of these are 1080p the one on
the s5 is 5.1 inches in uses Samsung
Super AMOLED technology which just pops
it may over saturate the hell out of
everything but it looks darn good in
some places the screen makes the video
look terrible especially when you watch
cinema or short films but intentionally
have a flat image to them the s5 just
adds unnecessary saturation that the
video doesn't need the HTC One has a 5
inch LCD panel which brings more
true-to-life colors it's the more
natural of the two color reproduction is
spot-on on the HTC One it's probably the
best one I've seen coming very close or
even beating the iphone 5s which has had
a good track record for being one of the
best
displays and mobile if you're going to
pick the best display I would take the
HTC one but i wish i can add the same
pop factor yet retain all the great
color reproduction from the HTC one on
the inside you'll find much of the same
story starting with the HTC One it has a
two point three gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 801 processor 2 gigabytes of
RAM and the Adreno 330 graphics chip the
s5 uses a slightly faster 2.5 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 801 a chip the same
two gigabytes of RAM and this same
adreno 330 chip running Geekbench 3 will
show you that the s5 will have slightly
higher scores in both single and multi
core tests thanks to the faster clock
speed but we'll have to see how this
correlates with real-life usage so let's
do some simple application open times on
both of these devices first we'll kill
off all the other applications and open
Google Chrome so we're going to see
pretty similar open time as perhaps vs 5
will consistently give you a faster
response time thanks to the faster clock
speed but it's not that big of deal
opening Twitter open a little faster on
the s5 but YouTube will surprisingly
open faster on the HTC One the other
part to this test is just the overall
speed and performance through the
phone's core menus the home screens and
menu should be the easiest finger phone
should run and the HTC one with sent six
of all my content runs really well not a
single act through the menu settings and
even in blinkfeed it's all buttery
smooth the s5 has pretty much the same
experience with this new lightweight
version of TouchWiz the only trouble but
I found is in my magazine it was trouble
on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and it's
still trouble for vs 5 I think Flipboard
and Samsung should really rethink how
this feature works next up is the main
star features of both of these devices
starting off with the s5 the first one
is the fingerprint scanner that lives
under the home button very similar to
the iphone 5s but there's a fundamental
difference since Samsung's home buttons
are very narrow you actually have to
swipe your finger on the home button the
setup process is pretty weird too
comparing TV iPhones process of just
repeatedly tapping the home button the
s5 wants you to swipe your finger over
the home button eight times to register
your fingerprint then after all about
swiping the slightest off angle swipe
will render it bad and it doesn't pick
up your fingerprint at all
all when you do swipe your finger
perfectly down the home button it gives
you a green light I like the idea but it
really needs to be foolproof and disc
clearly isn't next is the heart rate
monitor on the back yes it's a heart
rate monitor and it works with samsung's
s health application so basically you
just place your finger on the back this
little red light will shine and in just
a few seconds it will tell you what your
heart rate is but then with a simple
search on the google play store you'll
find that there's plenty of application
that will give you your heart rate they
just use the flash instead this is a
real gimmick of a feature in my opinion
the only product that would make sense
or smartwatches but actually samsung has
three new gear watches with a heart rate
monitor so if you'd like to see about in
a future video make sure to give this
video a thumbs up now on to the HTC One
m8 it doesn't have a fingerprint reader
or a heart rate monitor but it does have
amazing kick-ass build quality I already
talked about how good yet slip ring this
phone feels it's so good i'm actually
going to say it again this is one badass
phone in all departments to the human
senses it looks good and it feels even
better the next feature is to help
people will have smaller hands it's
called motion launcher which uses not
only your hands but also of a gyroscope
inside the m8 to unlock your phone go to
the camera launched google now or go
into blinkfeed the one I use the most is
simply sliding from the right hand side
to unlock the device and go to your home
screen you can also double tap the
display to turn it on next and the best
feature of them all is the boom sound
speaker the original HTC one was the
best sounding phone ever the new HTC One
has boom sound 2 point 0 vr twenty
percent were loud and have a wider range
of audio frequencies so now this is the
best speaker on any phone ever why has
it taken it so long for people to put
speakers on the front every single phone
should have this when now happens is a
stereo effect or basically when
something moves across the screen the
audio will follow it for example so when
you're watching a car race the car audio
will actually move from the left or
right and vice versa it's made my
YouTube viewing experience absolutely
epic
hey guys john here with TLD hope you
guys doing well now on to the software
both of these run the latest versions of
android 4.4 point2 KitKat at the time of
recording then they go their separate
ways Samsung adds their new lighter fare
TouchWiz an HTC with Sun six-point Oh
Samsung has toned back the look and feel
of TouchWiz this year but don't mistake
in vanilla Android you can clearly see
the DNA of this guy it is more
responsive from older versions of touch
with and I do dig the redesign of the
menus you still have those gimmicky
features like motion wave and I tracking
from the s4 but that's all old news what
is new for vs 5 is my magazine which is
a feature lifted off the Samsung Galaxy
Note 3 and all the new samsung tab pro
series it's basically a built-in
Flipboard application to the s5 you can
access your streams of info social media
and all the other stuff in one central
hub it does lag quite a bit especially
when you refresh your content plus it's
not as organized as blink fee which is
HTC's variant of the same idea the m8
has sent six point 0 which is more of a
compliment to android rather than a skin
but again don't mistake in this for
vanilla android i actually prefer sense
over stock android now since six point 0
is relatively fast it's very smooth and
it has these amazing additions to make
android look and feel better for example
the notification bar will actually
change colors depending on what
application you're in like this grace
transparent color for the home screens
and this green color for blinkfeed
blinkfeed 2 point 0 is even better from
the original blinkfeed it's not any
quicker since it was already fast but
you can now add all the content you want
we've also streamlined the menus to make
it a two second job for you to switch
sources of content next is the cameras
the s5 has a new 16 megapixel camera
sensor making them ever so closer to
becoming the next sony and nokia with 20
megapixel plus sensors vm 8 has one
fourth of a number of megapixels that
means it still has the same for ultra
pixel megapixel camera but the kicker
here is the one has not one but two
cameras well sort of the main camera is
still the same for alter pixel camera
with a new sensor behind it and the
camera on top actually acts as a depth
sensor for focus the result there's a
camera that can adjust focus after
taking the photograph and this feature
is called the duo camera it works very
similar to electro camera and if you put
it in the right conditions someone can
really produce some nice bokeh the
problem of details still persists ville
the images are not enough of resolution
to really capture any detail so if you
pixel peep or even think about printing
these photos off you may want to
reconsider buying the HTC One m8 the s5
on the other hand takes super
high-resolution photos of tons of detail
it looks just as good as the iphone 5s
in some cases video is also very
impressive with uhg at 30 frames per
second the 4k video isn't going to
compete with proper 4k cameras but the
detail is much greater than 1080p so
that's a win and this will help push us
into the 4k age of four key on our
phones so you'll be seeing a lot more 4k
on YouTube pretty soon I generally like
to end my videos with battery life since
it sort of fits the end of everything
yet it's one of the most important
features of any cell phone today the HTC
One m8 comes with a non-removable 2600
milliamp hour battery 200 milliamps up
from the old HTC One and on an everyday
usage test I've always come home with
around twenty to thirty percent of juice
left after 9 10 or 11 hours of complete
usage but it gets better the HTC One has
two power saver modes a normal power
saver mode which limits things like data
transfers while your phone is off screen
brightness and application updates will
get you almost two days off a single
charge the ultra or extreme power saving
mode will completely shut off almost
everything on the HTC One other than the
radios for data and calling it even
shuts off the color pixels on the
display so gives you amazing battery
life but this has not been approved by
any of the US carriers so I can't tell
you how well this feature works vs 5 has
a 2800 million power removable battery
which again will deliver all day
performance i usually get twenty to
thirty percent of battery left after the
end of my day but this too has an ultra
power saving mode which is active on all
the US models this will effectively turn
off everything you can choose what
applications you want to run but that's
about it but color pixels are also
turned off and you get this retro style
smartphone this will almost give you two
weeks of full standby off of
charge which is unbelievable and this
will be a great help on trips that you
forget your charger so to close out this
video it's always going to be a hard
decision these are two great flagship
devices that run Android one is already
the superstar giant in the Android space
while the other is fighting to the bone
to be recognized in this large pool of
those superstars the HTC One has become
one of my most favorite devices of all
time it combines power beauty and build
quality but the s5 has also shown me how
much I like kick-ass power and also a
lightweight device plus it doesn't hurt
having an awesome camera if you can't
make your mind up between these two
consider what you value most do you
value build quality or a lightweight
phone do you take a lot of photos how
much content do you watch on your phone
on a daily basis these are all good
questions to help you figure out which
one you want to decide if you were up to
me I would go for the HTC One m8 but you
could have different needs so make sure
to leave a comment below and what you
would pick between these two and
remember different people have different
needs so play nice in those comments
section well I hope you enjoyed my first
ever attack of tomorrow video if you
