is my first video since I'm back at my
house out of the doubt gone hospital and
you know what I gotta be honest with you
even though like I went to the hospital
and that was really scary for me to go
in there they treated me really good and
inside there I actually felt pretty
comfortable everybody took care of me
really it really well but now I'm back
home and some weird thing called home
health home health which basically means
that here I sit at home and take care of
myself which is really crazy because
they have a PICC line in here in my arm
and I actually have an IV in my room and
I have to hook this IV up to myself
everyday to run all the antibiotics to
it so I mean it's like really crazy
stuff because I'm not a doctor I'm gonna
nurse earning thing else and Here I am
doing all this medical crazy stuff and
last night was the first time that I
ever did it and I can get the damn thing
unhooked and I'm calling the phone
trying to talk to the nurse dude they
assigned you me and he's like oh it's
simple simple simple simple simple well
actually it wasn't simple at all the
people who sent me my v-line sent me
this weird stuff that was like really
like World War one man they're all hey
it works off gravity man and there was
no dial at all to you know to dial how
many drops per minute that you get you
know to get to get the IV in your arm
and I couldn't get the thing out at all
and it come to find out that yeah this
equipment nobody even really has seen
and so long as they sent me the wrong
stuff and it was really weird because
normally you had this little screw thing
you unscrew it and it just pops right
out well with this one you did that but
then there was an extra step you
actually had to take the thing pull it
to the end and then twist it again to
unlock it crazy stuff took me about an
hour to figure that out because I've
never seen this before and really
honestly it stressed me out my first day
back out of a hospital is probably like
one of the most stressful days in my
entire life because everybody here is
stressed because of all this I mean
think about I've been the hospital
nobody knew I was gonna lived I get my
leg cut off which luckily I did not get
my leg cut off they have operated on my
foot they took out all of the bad stuff
and all the crazy infection and
everything out of my foot
and I'm on a really strict diet now miss
stricter than I've ever been in my
entire life pretty much based off just
trying to be as vegetarian as possible
although you know when I have a salad I
do I like to have a little bacon bit and
avocado and a little stuff inside of
there but I don't get it all too crazy
but when I'm eating the salad it's got
to be good but I'm eating a lot of
vegetables healthy stuff really
monitoring my blood a lot more than I
ever did before and awful I'll fully
fully admit it I did not take care of
myself as well as I really should have I
mean there's a lot of things on my plate
all the time to do pay the bills keep
the stuff get the Cameron paid him
here's why does you you know excuse me a
lot of stuff going on around here you
know that stresses me out a lot of times
I just really just was like okay here
I'll take my pills I'm good to go I'll
try to just eat you know semi good food
and not bring too many sodas and I'll be
ok but no I was totally totally wrong
way wrong is obviously you see the
infection got my foot and kaboom you
know they cut it all out but they're
saying though that everything is
actually looking good and that I'm
healing well and hopefully if I maintain
everything do everything right in about
six weeks from now they'll have to take
a skin graft and put a skin graft on my
foot and then after that I should be you
know hopefully healed so that's like six
weeks to eight weeks healing from this
operation then after that skin graft and
then six to eight weeks which means that
entire time I'm going to be coming to
you guys from this wheelchair which is
not really uh you know my favorite thing
to do it's not bad it's not that bad
though I just to you know wish I had an
engine on so I could just crank this
thing up and you whoa but no bun
fortunately it's only Elric powered
which means my two arms and trust me I
don't if you guys don't know this but I
live upstairs me personally my room and
everything is upstairs with him in a two
bedroom house and getting up those
stairs it took me a long time to figure
out what was the easiest way just to get
myself up the stairs so hey if you've
actually been injured and you can't walk
and we're now how do you get the stairs
hobble on your butt works really good
just Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo
Pablo Pablo up spin grab the rails
Walker two bedroom two bed I mean that's
pretty much it at least though at least
on the good side though I have
energy and enough strength to be able to
do that it's really a blessing because I
know a lot of people probably couldn't
even do that especially in my state like
you know when my nurse came over he was
just like okay because they weren't
really expecting me to move I think they
expected me just to sit in my bed for
the next six to eight weeks and I just
cannot do that I'm just new wick and
sitting my bend go like this it'll be
the end of days man cuz I will simply
freak out being stuck in my bed
especially because my lg nano TV it just
completely took a dump the other day I
turn it on there's all these lines and
banding and then it's like no damage the
TV but yet it does not work anymore so
like even my TV that I had I'm like okay
well cool so I could just sit up there
really and go here I guess I could read
a lot of books and adjudicate myself
some more but I've read a lot of books I
don't want to do that so anyways I can
get up and down the stairs so I should
be able to keep you know keep up with
the videos as long as I keep my
medications up keep doing my these stuff
making sure I stay on the diet hopefully
this will all heal up and they've said
it's okay as long as I don't put any
weight on this foot to damage my foot
I'm good to go
so everything for me right now is pretty
much on slow-mo slow-mo John
yeah just trust me as soon as I got back
from the hospital hopped out of my
friend's van tried to use the crutches
and you know I don't even eat oh so what
do you think happened he was like Mitch
yeah PAP and I really thought I hurt my
foot and I was crying I was upset I was
like oh my god I just got released but
luckily didn't hurt my foot at all
didn't do any damage hurt my shoulder
quite a dam because smacking the damn
concrete didn't feel really good but
beyond that everything was copacetic so
I'm home
I got to do a lot of medical stuff I'm
gonna try my best to heal keep things
going at least I can do the videos and
keep bringing stuff to the channel which
is which i think is great because I was
like really afraid that we were like
gonna not be able to keep doing stuff
whatsoever but I'm a fighter I really
don't like to give up I really really
don't I like to fight things and I've
always been that way I'm a hard-hitter
kind of guy you know and I'm gonna fight
this and do my absolute absolute best
for all the people who have watched me
you know with a member wished me well
wishes thank you very much it's greatly
appreciated it makes me feel really
really good inside a lot of people out
there sent me letters and how my videos
inspired them and stuff like that and
like you know pretty much they say that
in life you've even inspired one person
you've done a good job and I mean
obviously from all the emails I've got
I've inspired a lot more so that makes
me feel really really good inside it
doesn't matter whether I'm the biggest
tech channel in the world the smallest
tech channel in the world it really
matters to me as I did this because I
like bringing information to people I
really wanted to be a teacher you know
but I'm just kind of a little bit kind
of - wild child if he's right thing but
that on YouTube a guess what you can you
can try your luck and do your best to do
it and I've been lucky that I've been
able to do it so there it is
I'm home and we got a lot more stuff
coming your way so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
