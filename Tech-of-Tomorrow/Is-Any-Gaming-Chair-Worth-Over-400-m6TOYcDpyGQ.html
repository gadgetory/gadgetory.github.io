in today's video I want to state for the
record that I've said it many times that
a lot of people use the word gaming on
things that aren't really you know
supposedly gaming you know it's kind of
one of those words they throw out and
say gaming and all of a sudden becomes a
more valuable item now I think there are
some items in the market that are more
geared towards gamers for certain
reasons now when it comes to chairs I
know that most people out there I go
dude there is no such thing as that
gamers chair well okay there are a few
things that are kind of for a gamers
chair a normal standard chair that you
sit in is just gonna be a chair you're
gonna plop your normal set the board
you're gonna pop your booty down on into
that and you're gonna sit in it and
there's not going to be much adjustments
on most things unless you go out and buy
one of those recliner things that you
know they're the biggest giant leather
chair like dad used to sit in and chill
out in that thing most chairs you buy
are just gonna be a chair no adjustments
no nothing now gaming chairs are
different because they're made to have a
lot of different custom adjustments for
your comfort because you're gonna be
sitting in a gaming chair presumably for
a lot longer then you're going to be
sitting in a normal chair so right off
the bat I want to say that a gaming
chair has to have certain type of
features for me to qualify for a gaming
chair and there are a few out there that
do and the particular one that we're
going to be looking at today
it's from dxracer noises from their King
series and this chair comes to market a
little bit over $400 now this is another
point I want to point out another point
I want to point out in there another
factoid I want to point out to you is
that honestly anything that costs over
$400 is kind of pushing into a luxury
item I mean it's not like you know
buying a $25,000 watch or anything but
most people out there especially kids
who are gamers aren't gonna have $400
sitting around just to buy a gaming
chair and they might feel to come their
parents gonna do it if they bug their
parents enough so I honestly think that
a lot of these chairs should be priced a
little bit lower if these chairs were
priced a little bit lower that they be
more affordable you would seem to be
giving like my ultimate like thumbs up
all these different gaming chairs and as
you've seen on a kind of all of them
I've been kind of lukewarm now this
particular chair is a really nice chair
it's very well built the stitching on it
is very very nice
it can take people from 5-9 up to six to
to sit in it can take from 195 pounds of
a 240 think of 240 pounds for people the
frame on this particular model has a
completely lifetime warranty so that
means if ever bent the frame or anything
you would be able to get a replacement
chair and it's two years on all the rest
of the parts in the chair now here's one
thing you really have to take a look at
also in looking at a chair Jia's our
cameraman he's kind of a big burly dude
and like in the past years we were
pretty much buying him a new chair every
few months all the stitching would come
out of the top of the chairs the backs
would be all ripped and we finally got
him a really nice higher-end chair which
he's been using now for about two and a
half years and it looks brand new so you
have to kind of decide when you're
buying a chair do I just want a chair
that I'm just gonna have and flop around
in and deal with or do I want something
that I want to keep around that's
comfortable and want to keep this chair
around for a long time these gaming
chairs even though a high price and
their look kind of luxury items they're
meant to last you a long time that's why
they're built and what they're geared
for now this chair has complete 4d
control over the armrests and everything
like that you can move them up and down
left to right no matter how you want
them to be for your type of comfort they
also raise pretty high so that your arms
feel very comfortable when you're
playing on a gaming table they're not
gonna go up so high that you're gonna
feel like you know you have your arms
stuck up like this or anything like that
but for playing games and everything
it's gonna be about the perfect height
for most desks out there
the dxracer XL gaming chair features a
strong mesh with PU leather and a metal
frame design PU leather ypu does it
stink no I'm just joking it's poly
urethane leather which is pretty much
faux leather it's kind of a fake leather
but it's actually very comfortable and
your skin doesn't actually stick to it
like real leather which is a good thing
is then when it gets hot you stick to it
when I get cold it's kind of
uncomfortable the PU there's actually in
reality
more comfortable than real leather let's
drop down and take a look at the base
now the base features a twenty seven
point five inch wide aluminum base it
has three inch PU casters the design of
the base is also pretty cool it has
plastic covers over a metal frame and it
just kind of looks neat now one caveat
this might not be a big deal to most
people but this chair only has 135
degree adjustable back what that means
is that you can lean back in the chair
pretty far but it doesn't go to the full
180 degrees we would be laying
completely straight back I actually sat
in the chair though watching TV and it
was late at night and I did fall asleep
in the chair so even though it doesn't
go all the way back
it does recline enough for you to get
really comfy and fall asleep it I did
the dxracer name is also custom stitched
into three parts of the chair into the
top of the back of the chair on the
headrest and into the lumbar rest
controlling the height and the tilt of
the chair is easy to do all the controls
are located right under the seat just
like most chairs if you buy this chair
online like I did it will require some
assembly but as you can see here the
assembly is actually pretty easy and it
does come with all the tools in the Box
to get you up and going so as long as
you're a little bit mechanically
inclined the instructions are pretty
easy to follow it's not rocket science
there are a lot of people out there who
have a really bad back or they suffer
back pain and honestly without lumbar
support sitting in many chairs like your
car your truck you'll notice that your
back just like ah he likes to be
cringing in pain from back stuff now
this particular chair has a really nice
lumbar support it sits right behind my
back and it's very comfortable and it
also offers a neck support as well so
when you lean back in the chair you have
a nice neck support
now some people I know they'll say that
when they have the lumbar support they
feel a little bit pushed forward but if
you don't have a back problem and you
want to actually be able to sit deeper
into the chair you can simply remove it
and be comfortable in your own way so
let's break down the King series dxracer
XL chair shall we starting off as far as
the comfort level goes this definitely
gets itself a 9 as far as the build
quality I would say the build quality on
this chair is definitely a 9.5 as far as
being able to do all the adjustments and
all that type of stuff I would give this
chair and eight so overall I would have
to say that this chair probably rounds
in at about a total of a nine score it
actually is a very nice chair and I have
to look at it from different ways yes at
four hundred and thirty dollars it is a
luxury and kind of an expensive item for
many people out there but if you want to
buy something and have it last a long
time and not just be something you
recycle through over and over and over
again that's what you have to think
about when buying a product like this
that's really what you have to think
about I know right off the bat I've said
it I could not afford to buy one of
these chairs if I had to I get very
lucky and I thank the PC industry I
thank dxracer especially shen she's one
of my best friends in the world thank
you very much for coming up with this
chair I appreciate it if you guys want
to get more information I'll have a link
down below you guys can get more
information about it at the end of the
day it's really up to you about what you
want this chair is very comfortable if I
was going to give it a couple of
cabinets I wish it did go 180 degrees
fully flat I think that's just a really
cool feature
I wish the weight capability was just a
little bit more 240 pounds I mean
there are some big guys out there but
that's why it's the excel not the triple
XL so actually this version is kind of
you know made for that wait but you can
always hope so that's pretty much it
folks if you're looking for a really
high-quality chair one that's
comfortable it has a lot of different
adjustments will last you a long time
then this might be a chair you want to
consider for your high-end gaming I'm
our cue guys been watching techni

see you back here in the channel if
you're not subbed we'd love to see you
