I'm Melek here in the second of our
YouTube channel bringing you the battle
royale of the new Samsung Galaxy Note 2
against the Apple iPhone 5 today we're
gonna show you
geek bench versus video and sound
quality and stabilization so with that
said what the battle everybody so here
we go this is part 1 this is the speed
test between the iPhone 5 and the new
Galaxy Note 2 now the iPhone 5 it has a
dual-core processor it's 1.29 almost 1.3
features 1 gigabyte of memory over here
this is the other phone and a little
tablet all-in-one this is the note 2 it
has a 1.6 gigahertz quad-core processor
and 2 gigabytes of RAM now you guys said
you wanted to see these things running
so I'm gonna try to start them both at
the same time
and there we go
but it's going the process now you can
see each one looks a little bit
different as well and I will say just
looking at the screen on the iPhone 5
overall viewing it actually is quite
different than the other one you the
viewing angle this is a lot better now
you guys can see for those people out
there who hate the iPhone 5 you guys can
see the note 2 is clearly kicking ass on
this but it actually should because it's
a quad-core so with that said now it's
jumping to the next part let's do the
camera test alright folks welcome to
part 2 of this video the first phone up
is the new Samsung Galaxy Note 2 now the
things you're really going to want to be
looking for is the quality of the video
how the audio sounds and how the
stabilization features work so the
camera can you like move it around do
some things because in some phones it
gets really blurry or the image gets all
taken out of proportion you can see the
stabilization on the Samsung is pretty
good take a look at the walls behind me
the color clarity you guys can hear my
voice we're not using anything else
other than the Samsung Note 2 no
microphones no additional anything just
this camera so that's it let's move on
now and let's look at the iPhone 5 okay
everybody so here we are on the part of
the video entitled two point one the
Apple iPhone 5 once again we're going to
be looking at the quality of the video
the stabilization features get the
camera to move around a little bit and
also the audio now we did a video before
we actually compared this against the
Samsung phone the s3
if you guys missed that check out the
link the description below also if you
guys miss the unboxing of the new note
to make sure you check out that below as
well so also tell me what you guys think
between the differences between the new
note 2 and this new obviously iPhone 5
they're both the latest and greatest
things on the market and pretty
comparable against each other like we
said before just a few differences the
iPhone 5 is a dual-core
the note2 is a quad-core one gigabyte of
ram on the iphone 5 2 gigabytes on the
samsung so that's it folks
thanks for watching and we'll see you
guys back here on tech of tomorrow you
know it tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
