and the r9 fury X has been on the market
but we just got our hands on the card
and now it's on our testbench
and we've got those results for you but
before we do let's take a look at the
card its facts and then why at the end
of the day I think you're gonna really
like the fury X from AMD it's our latest
flagship card baby let's get deeper
geared towards the enthusiast gamer
crowd the fury X is the creme de la
creme of AMD's new lineup and although
there's a bit of rebranding here and
there the end result is a new card that
offers a lot of the old and a bit of new
technology yes the fury X is based on
older generation technology but it has
new technology infused in it which makes
it an all new card now in my opinion
everybody does rebranding and yes there
is some rebranding here but as long at
the end of the day the end user is
saving money and you get new stuff and
it's faster hey what's there really to
lose just by visuals alone you can
definitely see a difference between the
295x2 or 290 X as the card is simply
smaller than the previous gen cards like
quite a bit that in itself will be
pleasing to builders as smaller cards
will fit into more cases making it more
ergonomic and easier to integrate into
many systems especially if you don't
want to have to use a giant case to fit
your video card in smaller is definitely
better smaller systems are again on the
rise and the card being smaller will
help AMD be integrated in many more
systems than they would be having a
giant size card that's for damn sure
visually speaking the reference based
cards all of the familiar black and red
designs supporting the AMD logo as well
as the cards nomenclature on the cards
top the card also comes with its own
self-contained closed-loop cooling
system just like we saw in the previous
generation 295x2 card liquid cooling is
definitely a feature that will help keep
that card running cool and definitely
help when it comes to overclocking the
shroud is made up of multiple pieces of
aluminum die cast finished in both black
nickel mayor gloss and soft touch black
and the cards components can be simply
accessed by removing four screws on the
front plate the array of the few reacts
features three display ports and a
single HDMI port this allows for multi
monitor technology free sync and all
that good stuff that you love about a
d the fury X features a couple of LEDs
that illuminate during Operation which
is quite similar to the AMD r9 295x2 the
first these LEDs can be seen in the
Radeon logo now this thing will glow red
when the card is in operation the next
of these LEDs are located by the 2:8 pin
power connectors there are eight of
these LEDs now in a normal operating
mode all eight lights are lit up when
the cards in standby mode only a single
green light is lit up something pretty
cool not that great but hey cool lights
are cool lights also located on top the
card is a dual BIOS switch now if you
don't know what that is
a dual BIOS which is something that if
you like crank your car up and
overclocking and one of the BIOS is gets
messed up and you can't use it you can
just switch to the other BIOS and you're
up and running you can also flash up
their BIOS making it usable again while
you're in the other one so having a dual
BIOS which is pretty cool it means for
those people out there who want to have
two biases maybe you have one that you
want to set this totally overclock you
only use once in a while and when it's
set in standard with dual biases you
have that option it's so overall
visually speaking the r9 fury X is
pretty cool looking it's pretty simple
yet still elegant not too gaudy but yet
not ugly either but hey look there only
one thing now let's see what's inside
the card powering your games based on
the now aging 28 nanometer process the
fury X features 4096 stream processors
with a maximum engine clock of a
thousand 50 megahertz and a compute
performance of 8.6 teraflops
there are also 256 texture units with a
fill rate of 260 8.8 giga texels a
second as well as 64 drops running at 60
7.2 gigapixels a second the fury X is
also the very first card from AMD to
feature
HBM high bandwidth memory this is gonna
really make games faster and real quick
let's just talk about that for people
who don't know what it is
HBM is a new type of CPU GPU memory that
vertically stacks memory chips like
floors in a skyscraper in doing so it
shortens your information commute those
powers connect to the CPU or GPU through
an ultra-fast interconnect called the
interposer several stacks of HBM are
plugging the interposer alongside a CPU
or GPU and that assembled module
connects to a
circuit board the really cool thing
about HBM even though it's not on chip
integrated memory it still runs so fast
due to the inner poseur that it's
indistinguishable from being that type
of memory which is really cool
the memory interface is also something
not to scoff at no longer do we see a
256 bit a 512 bit now we see a 4096 bit
memory interface which is simply
incredible and should do all kinds of
things that make the card run faster all
around the memory bandwidth is at 512
gigabytes a second and the memory speed
is at 500 megahertz Andy's fury ax is a
power requirement of 275 watts and uses
a pair of eight pin power connectors to
provide the juice of the card these are
also located in the top of the card
along with the glowing name and the bios
which sounds good so far right the r9
fury x is also the first card from AMD
to support frame rate target control as
well as virtual super resolution frame
rate target control is a new feature
which allows you to set a target maximum
frame rate when playing a game in
full-screen mode F RTC is for those
times in your graphics card is actually
providing more frame rates per second
than the actual refresh rate of your
monitor so that's what you can lock it
and when you lock it it actually allows
the GPU to run much cooler and much more
efficient because obviously there's less
taxing on the GPU now this is a really
cool feature where people don't have a
really SuperDuper high end monitor but
have a SuperDuper high end video card
your card can not only run smoother
it'll run cooler quieter and therefore
longer and also better overclocking
virtual super resolution is another
method of anti-aliasing that allows for
smoother textures and less jagged
polygons and games and applications that
support it but the really cool thing
about virtual super resolution is its
ability to downscale
or rescale 4k down to a native
resolution of a lower kind this means
that you can take a 4k video rescale it
down to 1080p and it's still gonna have
that awesome look so you're gonna get
almost the quality of 4k at 1080p and
met something really cool there's also
support for DirectX 12
Volken and mental technologies in the
past there's always been problems with
multi GPUs in one card or just using
multi GPUs in a system like I said
earlier DirectX 12 is fully supported by
the fury X which means that when you're
gonna use this in the future you're
going to be able to use those crossfire
systems and then eliminate a lot of the
problems you've seen in the past
hopefully everything will just be
perfect and multi GPU technology will
now be buddy so we've seen what the card
looks like we've seen its specs we've
seen its new features now let's see how
it test before we do that let's real
quick take a look at the test system and
now let's walk out to the benchmark song
and see how the fury X does against the
competition let's rock
all right you caught me I was rocking
out again
guilty as charged it's alright there you
guys have it
everything about Andy's latest flagship
card the fury X and you guys can see hey
it's a pretty cool running car I mean
that in many ways not just as a pun the
card ran on full bore at 58 Celsius now
that's not hot at all
compared to their previous generation
295x2 which ran much much hotter all
things and all that's actually running
pretty cool and it actually runs cooler
than a 980ti so that's thumbs up for AMD
on that side now the price in this thing
is going to be about six hundred and
forty five dollars you guys Vincent but
yeah not expensive but also it's their
flagship card comes water cool comes
ready to overclock I like those things
those were all really good aspects about
the car also just as far as sheer
performance goes you guys can see that
it keeps up with a 980ti reference model
so that's pretty cool I will admit I
have seen some cards that have come out
and afterwards non-reference cool cards
that are really super fast but as far as
just the reference 980ti goes the fury x
keeps up neck-and-neck
and that's solid overall neither it's
gonna be some people out there just like
the Haight they're gonna say all your
sister rebranding screw them I hate them
everybody does rebranding I'm tired of
hearing about it at the end of the day
this card runs cooler quieter it's
smaller cheaper faster
I mean honestly when at the end of the
day the end users getting a better price
for a better card
who cares if there's a little bit of old
technology thrown in honestly do you
have to reinvent the wheel every time
you make it it's still a round wheel so
every time somebody comes out the new
tire there's this reaction right yeah
think so so all in all kind of the day I
think that says the totally loop point
means nothing the feel reacts is a very
very solid car now few people out there
looking to buy one download like button
we will have all the information
hopefully you guys like this video if so
you know what to do so at the end of the
day the fury X Ed's here sorry is a few
days late
took me a couple days extra just to get
my car and I'm just the way the tumbling
thing wet
overall I think this thing's a serious
winner Andy hey you've made a comeback
to yourself I'm sure your fans will be
happy we're pretty happy here at TECA
tomorrow
peace out we'll see you guys all back
here if you're not sub hey you know what
to do now let's listen to American
beautiful and peace out
and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
