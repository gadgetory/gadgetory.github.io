freaks Elric here once again on Tekken
Omar there's always a rumor going around
that good things come in small packages
so what that said let's check out the
gigabyte gaz 170 n gaming 5 motherboard
going in our tries still our system away
we go so few diehards who want to see
the complete box before the unboxing so
let's check it out here's the top of the
box we'll spin it around real quick show
you guys the back of the box all of the
nomenclature and informations right here
on the end so if you want to get the
exact product this is what it is and
around the sides is pretty much all the
same thing just shows you where they're
at around the world and more of the
Intel logo and that type of stuff
nothing too bold
ok then with that said though let's pop
the captain tonton oh and then inside we
see the stuff so but the board all
inside of its packaging and all this
stuff I'm gonna go ahead and take that
just out of the way just so we can see
what the accessories are so inside we
have the Wi-Fi antenna motherboard
obviously has built-in Wi-Fi it also has
a pretty cool killer nic on which is
pretty awesome the e 2200 I believe it's
called so you get all kinds of options
for your internet pop that out SATA
cables very thin very crummy looking
nice and thin for those folks out there
like that rear i/o port the gigabyte
what the heck is this thing reviews
submit win ah so this is a contest tell
us what you think we're listening it's
obviously contest that gigabytes happen
if you guys want to get in on that I'll
make sure I have a link down there below
for that as well toss it off to the side
the multilingual installation guide so
no matter where you from you can know
what to do hopefully right ok we're
hoping and then last but not least we're
gonna have the user's manual and the
installation CD and that's all right
here and the Pavia CD for the Wi-Fi as
well
let's see yep utilities CD this is gonna
have all that stuff on it like all of
their easy tuner all that different type
of software that'll be on there if you
guys are into that you can use it it'll
be on there and then obviously your
driver utility the manual itself pretty
pretty thin manual a little bit of stuff
and ever pretty thin and finally at the
bottom of the box is the g1 gaming case
badge or case dickering your choice now
let's check out the motherboard so here
we have the completely unfolded bag so
go ahead and break that seal right there
get that off of there pop out the
motherboard itself now this is a very
small mini ITX motherboard you guys all
know we have that tri stellar we're
gonna be building on that and this is
the board that we have chose now a lot
of times people don't like really small
motherboard so they think they're
featureless but now this g1 gaming 5 has
a lot of features on it so looking at
the motherboard itself we can see
located over in the right-hand side is a
single 24-bit power connector at the top
the additional 8 pin power connector as
far as bang connectors go there are two
located up here at the top of the
motherboard you guys can see they're
using all solid black caps all around
here these are the best you can get and
make sure your motherboard lasts as long
as possible
in the center of a lap we see the ZIF
socket 1151 intel is where you're gonna
place your CPU if you don't know that
hopefully you do if you're watching this
video over the right we see two slots
with the ddr4 memory
this is ddr4 memory that's up to 32
gigabytes and the board features
overclocked memory frequencies up to
3333 megahertz and that's quite a bit
right down in the bottom we're gonna see
that the chipset it's cooled by a single
copper heat pipe going around there we
also see a USB 3.0 header now at the
bottom you guys are gonna see the single
PCIe slot it has a metal side binding
all around it this makes it actually
three times stronger than any other type
of motherboards out there and this is
really good if you're building a system
that might have a little bit of sag the
protection offer with this metal siding
will actually help in case you get
sagging in and eliminate that hopefully
altogether there are also two SATA 3
connectors right here and on the header
there are four more state of six
connectors and to say the Express
connectors located next to the PCI slot
are all of the caps for your audio and
you guys can see these are all made of
gold
to the very highest in there the
Japanese branded niche akan audio
capacitors and they bring about the
highest quality sound reproduction you
can get on the market there are also two
audio chipsets onboard
there's the realtek ALC 1150 and there's
also the additional soundblaster x-fi
mb3 chipset all onboard so checking out
the rear i/o this motherboard goes
old-school all the way to new you guys
see you get a single ps2 keyboard or
mouse port here two more USB 3.0 ports
your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity
it's also bluetooth 4.1 get your single
DVI connection single HDMI connection
you can see that's once again
gold-plated and then to the right of the
HDMI port are the two USB 3.1
connections this one's Type C and this
one is type-a above that we see another
USB 3.0 connector and then right above
that we see the land now the LAN port on
here is pretty cool you guys all know
about the killer land it's been around a
long time loses their e 20 200 version
of it so you know it's gonna be some
kickass LAN connections using that you
see all the audio connections you can
see they're also gold-plated and then
last but not least is the spit of
connection for you guys out there who
want to do complete digital audio if you
guys don't know what that means that's
the Sony Philips digital interface and
that's what that means and that pretty
much wraps up the motherboard itself
alright folks so there you guys have the
unboxing and first look up this gigabyte
gaz 170 m gaming v motherboard damn
these guys have such long Kraken
nomenclature it's hard to like remember
all that in your head at one time sirrr
what's it called but if you're looking
for a motherboard that's pretty
action-packed being in such a small
package this is one of the serious
players in the game there's a few
different ones out there but we chose
them because right about the price and
the functionality and the features
they're all in a nice even pace for me
and I like this board I want to hear
what you guys have to say down below
because I know you guys always have your
comments and your opinion so let's hear
them and if you guys missed it you guys
all know we're building the Tri stellar
system so I needed a board and this one
just seems to fit this you know the
whole build since I use the Asus when
the last build so now I have this one so
if you guys are looking for pricing
availability any of that kind of stuff
you guys might want to check that out
also I don't know if you guys have
missed it but lately we been talking a
lot about cam software if you guys want
to check
helmet-cam is it's a completely soft
intuitive tool that you guys can
download for free and check out on your
system
so I'm Network you guys been watching
Tekken tomorrow look for all the links
down below and we'll see you guys here
for more stuff and obviously next week
more 1080 stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
