world on Rick Fury pyramid singer Moro
YouTube channel from coast to coast on
the host with the most and I hear I
taste groovy view spread beauty tips
what's today's video is brought to you
by the people over and Raisa
that's enough beds today we're bringing
you the unboxing looking approved let's
put on the market for a while but I and
me and all I am now a fan of Tron so
today we'll do the unboxing and probably
at first look but a freaking God dang
good look at the Tron mouse pad and
mouse I bought this little bad boy
online for under $60 on Amazon let's see
what
hiya lads and ladies so here we see the
box right here the Tron King Mouse and
Matt it's blue it lights up I hear
leaving tracks so we'll see that when we
get there full of blocks you guys have
seen it the back of mouse
well I stick with too much because
you've probably seen this broad before
but it's a cool product by Razer than
the last
I'll take a slice right here another
little slice and dice right here on the
other side and higher the little
cameraman we will simply sail the box
towards the cameraman oh my gosh shiver
me just drawn ha I like Tron mm-hmm all
right so continue down well open up the
box right here inside right the bat we
see a big shiny brilliant blue a
lighting thing it's a drone cover
creator voltar I like doing like
blasting and guaranteed for a lifetime
that's Ron doing now going once
oh sorry wrong video move on here we see
the mousepad Larian unique design thin
gripping a rubber bottom with once again
the nomenclature of true and on the back
I know what this it and the mouse we
need sayin always suppose I got all I
didn't show you the light but we'll see
that later boom boom boom drivers CD
drawings by Disney Disney strong legacy
lots of interesting stuff designed by
razor fire gamers bowler gamers more
gamers the warranty and here are the
stickers neon and why am i doing a
pirate accent for Tron hell I have no
idea just was what we were doing today
hmm
and last but not least remove
the little bugger from the package need
another little trusty knife there's more
in there with a rubber little stitch
going to take it make one more cut no me
that click in the back probably get the
little mouse out of there now you just
pull the stuff all that ire1 Botha
government yeah so I store it in the
bottom than us pull off all this stuff
don't believe there's any more so sir
from the bottom here you can see the
feet sure there was some more stuck
there defeat Laurita what you guys just
look at that close up
here on this side we can see dual
buttons the top click picnic send a
button the mass does not move left to
right it moves forward and backwards and
up and down that's all two more buttons
on the other side now let's plug this in
and see what it looks like
the mouse is a built-in speaker alright
folks my throat's hurting too much to do
that crazy accent anymore and give
myself a sore throat there so don't
those wait the accent well it's over
with haha sore throat check it out
here's the trauma and the mousepad this
thing actually tracks and you can see
the mouse glowing around it as we spin
around the mouse so let's check it out
you can see the lights here and the
lights here Center light here you guys
heard the sound that it makes me to try
sound when it starts up or shuts down
that's actually like built into the
mouse it's really pretty cool just spin
around you guys since there's a
backlight when you put it up or down and
moves is what actually shows your
tracking on the board side thing again
see while are we going down but the real
interesting thing is right now we're
actually filming during the daytime late
at night this would actually work better
but you guys got to see this is really
interesting by the way this thing is
actually really small for the hand so
those people at big giant hands I
probably would not suggest getting this
mouse but if you've got a really small
hand especially like girls with smaller
hands this mouse is it probably going to
rock through because it does feel heard
anomic but it's pretty small so let's
take a look at the tracking on the
mousepad now you guys are gonna trip out
on this
so we're playing the game late at night
and you'll see this very brightly all
cleaning the little lights going around
on your mousepad it's actually really
really something nifty I can't wait till
it gets darker night and really try the
thing out but we know you guys had said
before you want to see the more than
just some unboxings this way to the
unboxing we pulled it out we actually
plugged it in and you guys can see how
cool that stuff is so all the clickety
clicks in the mouse all work very very
well it's ergonomic the side buttons are
pretty easy to get to the ones on the
right side are a little bit more
difficult for me to use having two
buttons over here I'm not really used to
that the ones on the left side no
problem at all I'll program those babies
up but the ones on the right side all
probably take a while to get used to
those but this is it guys the Tron mouse
and mouse pad I got this thing for like
60 bucks on Amazon so check it out if
you might even be cheap right now with
Free Shipping under stuff for Prime
members so give it a go I like this
thing I'm gonna be custom building a
system all the way around the Tron thing
because as a kid I love Tron so that's
the kidney see you guys back your ticket
