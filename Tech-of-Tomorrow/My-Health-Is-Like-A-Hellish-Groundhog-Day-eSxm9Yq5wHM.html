live from my wheelchair yes I'm back in
a wheelchair and I'm pretty pretty angry
about it I have to admit I'm I like my
ropes end with this stuff man
I feel like honestly like I'm in some
kind of totally screwed up Groundhog Day
but the only thing is that my Groundhog
Day is every time I turn around my foots
infected again and I'm gonna need more
surgery so once again I'm in this
wheelchair so you guys know I went
through all that surgery all that stuff
last year crazy stuff almost lost my leg
they said I was good to go it was healed
I stuck on a crazy diet I wasn't even
eating anything for the longest time and
I started walking it seemed like it was
okay but then we went to CES and my foot
opened up and since then it's just
gotten continually worse and worse and
worse till now I'm back to where I can't
walk anymore at all I've got another
ulcer in my foot and once again they're
like oh you may lose your leg or you may
lose what's left of your foot you guys
have no idea how frustrating depressing
and just mind my own him I just mind you
know the word I want to use starts with
an F you know I'm you guys know the word
I want to use I feel mine straight up
like into my mind my head is just filled
was so much stressed and anguish over
this it doesn't seem like no matter what
I do I can get my foot healed like last
time went to the hospital I thought that
they were gonna amputate my leg they
gave me a prosthesis and it would be you
know be bad it was my leg but I have a
prosthesis doesn't I'd be able to get
around they convinced me you know to
fight that and not do that and try to
save my leg and I agreed to that so who
we are you know months and months down
the road where I'm almost in the exact
same situation I was in before I had to
go before to the hospital we're like
this close the nurse told me this
morning when I took off the band just
morning in my whole foot looked like I
had sat in water for a week the whole
wound was all they called it masticated
it was all pink and yellow and she took
a swab and she went into the hole and
stuck it in about this far which means
that all around that hall is dead stuff
and this is really dangerous stuff
this is when it starts getting into
amputation surgery and all the stuff
luckily though now hopefully I'll be
able to catch it and get to the doctor
and they can do the surgery again
without me I happen to get to the point
where I'm infected but I'll admit I'm
scared I'm stressed and it's been really
hard for me to keep up with the channel
you guys see the numbers just suck I
don't know what the hell that you know
YouTube is doing maybe just cuz there
are so many people but I don't really
know what's going on just seems like my
channel they've just left me in the dust
because even we do videos that are first
even we do videos that other people are
doing and we do them better we're still
not getting any views and I don't know
what to do to change that there's no
magic you know stuff like that so you
know I've been stressed for money I've
been barely able to even cover my bills
and keep keep Jesus around here to be
the Camryn thing things have gotten
really hard and now honestly with this
things have gotten worse so my house is
dirty I really have no way to clean my
house I can't walk or anything again I'm
stuck in this wheelchair like it's hard
to even get around my house need me to
get through doors and it's just really
really stressful at this point right now
I admit I'm really stressful I am at
like the end of my rope with this I just
want it to end I want this to end I want
to heal I want to move on with my life
luckily I have family coming out and
they're gonna stay with me they'll be
here next Sunday so then hopefully I can
just stay upstairs move my filming stuff
upstairs and just stay by my bed and
heal up and and hopefully it will work
but right now I guess you see I'm back
in a wheelchair again
my foots got a hole in it and it's
pretty much less like it's Groundhog Day
I went through all this and I woke up
the next day and guess what it's the
same thing again got a hole my foot good
any surgery repetitive repetitive
repetitive repetitive in my last video I
talked about AMD and how they had this
repetitive cycle and I feel like I'm in
a repetitive cycle like I said it's
Groundhog Day for my foot so I apologize
to all the people out there it's hard
for us to make as many videos and get as
many stuff up it is we're trying to keep
up trying to keep afloat but honestly my
health has gotten so bad that last week
now they have told me that I am going to
be on full-time disability I've tried
staying off that I don't ever like
taking you know free handouts every time
I've even asked you guys for help with
money and stuff it's been to pay bills
it's not for me to go out and have a
good time or anything like that and I'm
disability I'll probably watch my money
get cut more but I'm gonna keep trying
to bring the content to the channel keep
trying to do it we're doing but once
again like I said I'm in a wheelchair
my foot is messed up and the cycle
begins once again of me trying to have
an operation heal up stay off it bla bla
bla bla repetitive psychotic cycle
repetitive repetitive repetitive
honestly it's starting to wear me down
I'm not as young as I once was and
honestly this stuff is starting to kill
me both mentally and physically my blood
pressures up my heart rate is up
everything is up because I'm just so
stressed about what's going on right now
I want it to end so those guys out there
who are wondering concerned what happen
with me as far as like the rest of my
body and stuff I'm okay
like all the other stuff that was going
on before I almost died before that's
all pretty much healed up my body's
healed I'm not like sick all the time
like I was any more like that I'm able
to eat and do stuff like that but I'm
back in the same position with my foot
once again I need surgery
once again I'll be off of it it'll be
the same cycle that I've been going
through so if ya believe in things like
god I do then hey I'd appreciate if
you'd say a prayer for me because the
more prayers out there there's power and
healing that way and I would ask that
you would do that and if you don't
believe in anything then a just have
well thoughts for me I'd appreciate that
as well so this is Tekken tomorrow I
marked I thank you guys for watching
we're trying to bring you guys as many
videos as possible I just don't know
what's happening with my health so
someday you don't ever see me back here
on the channel
no the only reason I that I'm not here
is because of my health because I love
you guys and even though the numbers are
crap I know I still have a lot of still
loyal fans that have been around ever
since as motherboards not orgs days I
love and appreciate you guys and that's
why I keep doing this otherwise I would
just quit go on disability and just you
know go out to pasture and age like an
old horse so peace out I love you guys
see you guys back home the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
