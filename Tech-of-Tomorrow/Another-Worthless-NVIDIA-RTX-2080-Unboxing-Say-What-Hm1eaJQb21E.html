on our tix has finally been unleashed

so like I said we've already unboxed the
20 atti r-tx card really nice card
expensive but lots of great features
only time will tell if we do the
performance scores that's gonna be worth
all that money but now we have its
little brother the founders edition 2080
r-tx card 2944 cuda cores
now the r-tx ops in this particular card
though are lower than this card this
card has a little bit over 70 this card
has 60 of those and that really is one
of the main differences how you know
well the rate racing and stuff is going
to do because this card has just a fewer
amount of those in this particular card
how it's gonna translate and games and
stuff like I said I don't know so with
that said though let's go ahead let's
start on bucks in the card it's still 8
gigabytes gd-r 6 memory alright go ahead
let's get the cap off of here now there
are a couple little plastic tabs on the
side I'm gonna have to use my trusty
little Batman knife to go ahead and just
make a quick little incision here a
surgical slice to open that up see it's
nice and opening now hell-lo pick fans
we are here for you alright just kiddin
around
go ahead and I will slice the other side
oh that wasn't a surgical slice oh my
god I think I just cut the dudes spleen
out oh my all right just kidding around
um honestly the box is really simple if
you seize a really simple box simple
simple it's all the same pretty much
everywhere
very very simple box so not a lot to the
Vives man right here one more time for
you guys getting dizzy with all those
spins I know go ahead and pop the cap
now now just like the previous cars we
unbox it you guys can see it as a
completely different type of protective
cover I usually you see this comes in a
bag this particular one's kind of a pain
in the butt to take off without ripping
it not sure we need it and what's also
interesting is there's also a little tag
on my car what does this little tag say
dear Elric
we love you please do a good review hey
what do you know nuts not what it says
actually doesn't say jack crap on it
just some kind of little tag but it's on
my car like my card came with a white
tag man you know what I'm gonna do this
little white tag though I'm gonna take
my trusty frickin Batman knife and I'm
gonna cut it like that and remove that
shot that's right get that out of the
way all right so here is the card the
base clock causes a particular card is
fifteen hundred and fifteen megahertz
with an overclock speed of eighteen
hundred megahertz it's a really nice
overclock once again we see the new two
fan design much different than previous
generations how loud they're gonna be
how much they're gonna blow it all that
stuff and I mean blowing meaning how
much air they're gonna blow a process
and we don't exactly know yet let me
look there's a little plastic tab on
here and this little clasp I'm gonna
keep using my little trusty knife today
everywhere that's the OL knife okay now
let's see if it'll come up easy in the
previous one no now see the reason that
you really can't get the card out of the
bag without ripping is because this
thing right here there's nowhere I can
honestly just remove that so I have to
try to see if there's another piece of
tape which there is not so I will once
again just like the previous one just
lift the doggone bag off here and be
done with it
ah madmen get off of there alright there
we go boy man honestly I don't like that
particular bagging video yeah I'd rather
have an easier bag to take off so here
we go so here's the cart again looking
nice and beautiful like I said two
different types of fans on the front now
one thing also unique in this particular
design is the entire card is completely
concealed you can't see anything on the
card whatsoever all the components are
covered pretty much unlike all the
aftermarket cards you can see the
components underneath it like I said
before this card has eight gigabytes of
ddr3 256-bit memory interface four
hundred and forty eight gigabytes a
second as far as the memory bandwidth so
it's pretty damn fast on paper
okay now looking at the top of the card
you guys can see it says GeForce r-tx
there's a single six pin power connector
or single eight pin power connector it's
recommended that you have a minimum of
the 650 watt power supply and the card
draws about 225 watts from that power
supply now in the back of the card you
guys can see this is like really the
first Nvidia card from Nvidia to
actually have its own backplate on it
looks pretty nice you're also gonna see
the PCI interface down here and on top
is something really different now before
we've always seen SLI tabs now you're
going to see the envy link connection
obviously this connection is going to be
different because there's gonna be a lot
more information that's gonna have to be
transferred between two cards doing SLI
so they've reinvented it's now NV link
and you guys see it does look different
than the standard SLI bridge and it has
a nice little cool cover that goes on it
as well so if you don't want to say it
you to select the cover back on it and
you're good to go just like that now on
the rear i/o last but not least in this
card I'm one thing I mentioned on the
other card that we did the the TI
version never seen a black rear plate
before something kind of interesting
then we see three display ports single
HDMI and a USB type-c connection and you
can hook up four monitors at a time with
this card so if you're looking to do
surrounding all that stuff you can use a
single one of these cards honestly
though for surround and stuff I think
it's probably gonna be better to do SLI
okay last but not least you'll notice a
little compartment back here in the back
this usually contains an adapt
and some more nomenclature and yep it
does contain an adapter now this from
DisplayPort to DVI so if you want to use
that type of connection you you have an
adapter that comes in the box these
actually were quite pricey back in the
day so it's kind of cool that actually
comes the one now and then after that we
just have some nomenclature couple
things couple of different books just
telling you different things about the
cards how to install them so most of my
viewers I'm sure have installed a card
before and they know how to do it so
like I said we have other unboxing
videos if you guys want to check those
out and make sure you guys check those
out down below we'll also have links if
you want to purchase one of these cards
and get one for yourself if you're not
subscribed please do so and if you guys
don't know what the notifications thing
is hey check it out make sure you turn
on notifications that way you can see
the videos in your in box also if you're
looking to get a really cheap Windows 10
key hey these keys work believe me I've
used them if you guys look at the
comments of people at the videos we've
made they use them they work you can
actually trust these keys so I'm Elric
you guys been watching Tekken tomorrow
we'll see you guys back here soon
because we're gonna have all the test
scores for all these cards and find out
if they're actually worth your money at
the end of the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
