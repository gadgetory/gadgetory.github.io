once again to the channel now today
we're gonna be taking a look at
something that is very very nice a bit
on the pricey side it's a laptop that's
actually pushing the $2,000 range this
laptop right here is like seventeen
hundred dollars it's the LG gram 15.6
inch model now this thing has just a
 ton of features but the main
features right off the bat which I feel
I what really pushed this to the head of
the pack is the fact that this laptop
weighs less than 2.5 pounds it's less of
than seventh of an inch point seven of
an inch in thickness and the battery
life is up to 17 point two hours like if
you're just doing stuff like checking
your email and stuff like that and if
you're doing a lot of work it's about
twelve point five hours so those are
like very big features just think about
it you know most the time you're up
during the day time you're probably not
working a total of twelve hours you
might work eight to ten and even in
those eight to ten hour days you're
doing other stuff that's you know
constant your laptop so you have a lot
of time for doing work on this so if
you're a person who travels you're on
the go a lot and you're looking for
something that's ultra light and it
lasts a long time the LG gram is
actually pretty incredible in those two
factors now there's a lot of other
features as well so let's jump in and
let's check out all the fun facts about
the LG gram for 2017 taking a look at
the outside of the LG gram you guys can
see it's made of magnesium alloy this is
what makes this bad boy really light and
durable all at the same time you got the
LG logo right there on the top of it and
one thing you guys are gonna find very
interesting about this is you can open
the laptop with a single finger that's
right so a single finger will open up
the top fit no more of that reaching
around trying to pull your screen open a
nice simple click of your finger and
you're up and going now before we talk
about the keyboard and the monitor let's
talk about all the connections that
actually come on the LG Graham there are
quite a bit on the right hand side we
see a microSD slot next to that we see
the headphone jack now this headphone
jack is actually something pretty
special it provides DTS audio and up to
11.1 channels without using expensive
speakers all through that Jack next to
that we see the USB 3.0 port then a USB
2.0 port and then the Kingston and
locked connection in case you want to
get your laptop stolen on the left hand
side we see the power connector another
USB 3.0 port an HDMI port which means
you can actually hook this laptop up to
any other monitor that you want to
including sound and then finally we see
the USB type-c connector and if you're
worrying about hey man how am I going to
hook this thing up to my internet well
it comes with an adapter for that as
well under the hood powering the LG gram
is the Intel Core i7 7500 you know this
is a 2.7 gigahertz CPU that has a boost
speed up to 3.5 gigahertz for the memory
you've got 16 gigabytes of ddr4 and for
your hard drive it comes with a 512
gigabyte SSD drive and that's why this
thing boots so incredibly fast if you're
a person who always uses Wireless don't
worry the LG Graham has 802 11 AC dual
band wireless built-in as well as
bluetooth 4.1 connectivity although it
would have been very nice to have the LG
Graham come with its own dedicated video
solution it does have Intel's 620 HD
graphics built in and what's really
nifty about this is the more internal
memory you have the more you can share
with the 6:24 better graphics one thing
really nice about the LG Graham is it
features a backlit keyboard now the
earlier generations didn't have this and
this makes it a lot easier to use when
you're trying to work in a low lit room
and the keypad itself works very nice as
well most touch pads irritate me but
this one actually worked very well and I
didn't feel like I was straining at all
to use it and something even better if
you like using a touchscreen that 15.6
inch IPS LCD features touch screen
technologies so all you have to do is
touch any icon or drag and drop
everything with your finger on your
screen now some people may not like this
because they might feel like it's your
screen you know kind of greasy but you
can clean the screen very easily because
it's made to be used that way now here
is one I think serious caveat though
about the LG Graham the stereo speakers
that are built in are very very weak I
didn't really like them whatsoever so if
you want to have any type of decent
audio I need to travel around a couple
of real small speakers since this
thing's so light or I'd have some really
nice headphones because honestly the
headphone jack is amazing but the
speakers built into it are only a single
watt and they're kind of weak
and for you super anal tech fans who
want everything the dimension of the LG
Graham are fourteen point one inches by
9.0 inches by 0.6 inches the LG Graham
also comes with Windows 10 homes 64-bit
edition pre-installed and the actual
color of the model is called dark silver
even though to me it looks like gunmetal
gray are they the same thing if you're
one of those folks who loves doing video
chat the LG Graham also comes with a
built-in camera located at the bottom of
the monitor and last but not least if
you're wondering hey alright what
happens if something goes wrong well LG
gives you a one-year parts and labor
warranty no strings attached alright
Tech fans so there are all the specs
what the LG gram looks like all of its
features and all that good stuff but
what about raw performance numbers well
let's jump in real quick and let's check
them out you guys can see the Geekbench
scores are also pretty nice now compare
to the very latest like Apple laptops
the single threading stuff does
absolutely much better but on the
multi-core I will say if the latest
Apple laptop does beat it
you guys can see that even though the
slap tops not geared for gaming
whatsoever it actually will play some
games especially at low settings so if
you like WoW type games and those type
of things you'll have probably
absolutely no problem having a good
gaming experience now if you're looking
to play the latest quake or anything
like that no you're probably gonna need
to have something else as far as heat
and temps go I felt absolutely no heat
ever using the LG graph even after hours
of use the laptop remained cool maybe
because the way it's made obviously its
way it's made but the way that it gets
its cooling must be working pre doggone
well because it never gets hot even
under stress
all right Tech fans so there you have it
the LG gram for 2017 now I got to say
after using this thing for a couple of
weeks it's actually a very nice laptop
the fact that it's so light and easy to
take around you is just amazing cuz it
really weighs almost nothing under 2.5
pounds I mean it didn't even make
weights that low so it's really
SuperDuper lightweight now as far as the
battery life goes it definitely varies
though between like the 17.5 to 12.5 and
all that it depends on what you're doing
you got to trust me on this if you're
doing the light stuff like I said before
just checking your email and stuff like
that yeah it's gonna last a long time
but if you're doing a lot of editing and
game playing audio and all that stuff no
it's not gonna last that long at all I'd
say it's probably going to last you more
between like 8 and 10 hours if you're
doing that kind of stuff at best but I
mean that's still a lot of doggone time
for a super lightweight laptop right I
mean a 60 mil of hour battery that's a
lot of charging and it actually charges
pretty fast as well so if you plug in it
to charge it you're not gonna have to
wait for like SuperDuper long time
before you can be up and going again
that and that's pretty nice
the keyboard to me using these kind of
keyboards on any laptop not just against
the LG Graham it's just a little bit
kind of uncomfortable for me you know
but at night the backlit keyboard is
something very nice because you don't
have to worry about seeing what you're
doing if you're typing stuff and for me
I've been using this a lot in my living
room and I'm like had the TV on the
background I said I work surf the net
search and do research and that kind of
stuff all that I do in the LG Graham and
I love it so I would say for
productivity it's probably about a seven
because I mean if it had a little bit
more RAM minute and stuff and had a
little
better you know CPU and you know that
those things might happen especially a
dedicated graphics card then I could say
this things like the super duper power
beast laptop I cannot actually say that
about the og gram but for just general
work egde the general you business
person who the person who's in college
all that kind of stuff this is actually
a pretty doggone incredible laptop I
just got to say I really like it I saw
some people complain they were saying
that when they were typing on it that
the laptop was freezing up on them like
I never had any kind of issues like that
whatsoever in fact as far as the lag
goes absolutely none and this thing just
starts up so incredibly fast I mean you
literally hit the power button go I'm
not even joking it's really that fast
for booting up so snapshot booting up is
really really incredible so at the end
of the day I have to say if you're
looking for a really superior laptop
that's lightweight and like we said you
know works for lots of hours then this
is something you might want to seriously
check out now I gotta say this though
there are laptops that you can get on
Amazon and everywhere else that are like
five hundred $49 six hundred dollars and
some of those actually will work kind of
you know almost as long not as long but
think about six hours out of those but
the price difference is quite a bit this
laptops coming into market at about
$1,700 because let's just face it you're
gonna be paying for all that technology
all the way from the way it's built what
it's made out of the fact that it
doesn't get hot it's SuperDuper
lightweight has lots of great functions
the USB type-c I mean the headphones
honestly the dts headphone jack you guys
will really be you like that a lot so
actually if you're a person who's really
looking for a laptop that I was like
superior audio for listening to your
music and stuff the lg Ram is actually
really good at that as well the screens
not the most absolute best screen in the
world that's kind of because it's
touchscreen so you're not gonna get the
most you know the most vibrant super
colors but it's still totally nice
enough and most people would never even
notice the difference anyways I'm
millwork you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow let me see your comments down
below like usual we'll have a link to
this more information if you want to buy
one for yourself and get into the LG
Graham do it baby
or as that guy says just do it
do it do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
