back ticket tomorrow I'm Eric your host
so check it out
previously we showed you guys the RX 470
red devil edition from the people over
at power color and you guys saw that
cart was pretty badass in fact it's
clocks went from 1206 to 1270 on their
car which is a vast improvement over
their standard cart pushing it almost
into the spec levels of a 480 and making
it very very fast as you guys saw in
that last video now the thing is the
BIOS that we use in that video was kind
of crappy the card wasn't running at its
true potential or anything else we got
the new BIOS we updated the card now
we're things running really excellent
now a 470 it has 32 compute units and a
480 has 36 so right there there's not
too much of a difference and with the
memory on the cards AMD has pushed this
memory to its maximum they've really
pushed the memory so overclocking the
memory is pretty much a no-go whatsoever
but you guys will see in today's video
that the 470 the red devil overclock is
reaching almost the same speeds as a 40
just a wee bit of difference between the
two and the price limits between the two
is not that much whatsoever so we use
wot man with for all of our overclocking
and all that stuff but without any more
further ado let's jump in real quick
let's check out our test system which is
based off an i7 6 700 K which we keep
pretty much on turbo mode all the time
at 4.4 gigahertz you guys would see most
of the other specs before if you watched
our other videos we've got a nice
motherboard from asrock we've got some
g.skill memory Ripjaws stuff so all in
all pretty cool test system the driver
we use in all of our tests was the AMD
crimson software sixteen point eight
point one driver now as we jump in and
we check out the benchmarks you guys can
see that overclock the 470 is doing
really really amazing I mean it's
reaching clock speeds that are almost
the same as a 480 so if you're looking
for a card that's going to be
entry-level but still have a lot of
headroom this card is the one so now
let's just totally jump in and let's
check out the benches
as far as the temps go you guys can see
that with the very first BIOS we use the
car words getting about 69 Celsius but
with the new BIOS the car jumps up to 79
Celsius is running a little bit hotter
but still the card if you push the
voltage up even more
it might do better I don't know if it
might fry your system out but if you do
some crazy cooling and do some crazy
stuff you might even be able to get the
470 to go even farther as you guys can
see in these results we were able to
overclock the Red Devil 472 thirteen
hundred and thirty five megahertz which
is a whopping overclock for this card
alright so there you guys can see the
Red Devil rx 474 the price range is a
really seriously kick-ass card I give it
an editor's choice here on the channel
because this card for the price range
and video cannot touch this card at all
with that price range if it has some
cards at a higher price range but at
this price point there's nothing that
can beat AMD whatsoever they are the
king definitely right now at the
entry-level thing and this card shows to
be one serious serious competitor now we
were getting between 5 and 10 percent of
an overclock with the card you guys saw
you know the overclock on that thing was
amazing thirteen hundred and thirty-five
maker it's on the overclock come on
entry-level car that's under 250 bucks
and these great scores all the games
everything are playing really nice I
don't really know how well VR is gonna
work on this card I mean that's it's
it's you know labeled for recover but I
don't know I'm still waiting to get my
VR stuff but hey for right now if you're
looking for a really seriously kick-ass
card I mean you guys can see it's really
running close to the for a now obviously
not the Red Devil 40 which we definitely
have coming for you that'll be our next
video coming up just to let you know we
were just waiting for new BIOS and stuff
to come out to give the card its actual
best representation to you so I don't
hear any crazy hate from people going
what did you wait so at the end of the
day hey I got a say power color Red
Devil RX 470 you can see it overclock
swell for a car in this price range even
pushing up there to a 480 like usual
we'll have all the information for this
car down below that like button
hopefully you will go Jackie Chan style
on it and we'll see you guys back here
for the next video which is the Red
Devil RX 4 80
see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
