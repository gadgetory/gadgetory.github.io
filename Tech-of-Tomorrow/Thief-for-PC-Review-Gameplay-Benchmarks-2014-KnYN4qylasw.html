tomorrow bringing us more gaming
goodness and today we're talking about
thief the reboot and fourth installment
in the thief franchise now this is the
first one to be produced by Square Enix
and is the first new thief game since
2004 making this a decade-long restart
in the making the original series is
really popular dude with emphasis on
planning stealth and nonlinear map
design heavily rewarding players that
took their time to explore and find as
much things to steal as they could does
this new one live up to the legacy let's
find out today on tech of tomorrow
so to begin with let's talk about how it
looks and performs for the most part the
game is really dark and dreary and tone
which makes a lot of sense considering
of course you are a thief and visually
if the most part it looks really nice
you can tell there was a lot of really
good concept art that went into
detailing the city and some of the more
richer areas that you'll explore the
game also makes use of a lot of
different environmental special effects
including really good use of lighting
fires mists and rain which makes the
game really come to life but at the same
time also really hits your performance
now the game does have a built-in
benchmark utility that we did make use
of which features a lot of the weather
effects and has a lot of people on the
screen at once now in our system which
includes an msi gtx 780 twin frozr
edition an i7 4770k processor we saw
about 42 frames per second on average
when running on 2560 x 1440 and 62
frames per second when running on 1920 x
1080 now it is worth noting of course
that this is while a lot of things are
happening on screen during regular
gameplay you're probably going to see at
least at 10 frames per second boost if
not as high as 20 or 30 thanks to the
fact that you spend a lot of time being
crouched in doors and not actually
actively running so it's going to be a
lot better than that normally but once
you start fighting a bunch of guards or
run through the city you will notice the
frames per second take a bit of a dive
now as far as actual gameplay is
concerned thief has been somewhat of a
mixed bag for me there are some things
that are really like and there's a lot
of good groundwork to it but at the same
time there's some things that really
bother me some of which are subjective
and may not matter to you but some of
which are also really objective so to
begin with let's look at some of the
good things specifically the core
stealth elements now some of these
mechanics are returning from the
previous series but some of them are new
as well in terms of how you avoid and
distract guards for instance there's
water arrows to put out torches to
reduce visibility fire arrows that can
start fires to distract guards avoiding
stepping on things like broken glass or
water and the always-popular throwing a
glass bottle to distract guards now one
of the new mechanics is the game's focus
mode which is basically a sort of
magical power you get you can activate a
special focus mode temporarily that
slowly drains your MP and gives you a
number of bonuses that you unlock over
time initially all it'll do is highlight
things you can interact with like hidden
buttons or valuable things can steal but
over time you can also log other
abilities like increasing how fast you
can pick pocket or making shadows cling
to you while you're using stealth
overall this was actually a pretty fun a
dish
my opinion and I really like what it
does for the most part there's just one
aspect I have a bit of a problem with
and that's the fact that once your MP
runs out you can still tap the focus
button to do a little blank and it still
highlights objects you can use which
makes finding hidden switch is really
easy in the game it almost really
defeats the purpose of hidden switches
you don't have to find documents or
figure it out for yourself you can just
keep tapping the F button until
everything's highlighted that you want
to interact with now if you're like me
and that does bother you a little bit
the game does have a really awesome
customizable difficulty mode that helps
to address this basically when you start
the game you can not only pick whether
you want it to be you know normal easier
hard you can also do what are called
classic thief mods these can do things
like turning off the focus mode entirely
or even removing the reticle or
restricting what kind of equipment you
can use so those you who are fans of the
older games can make it closer to the
experience you want now as far as the
actual stealing side of things goes the
game does a really great job of making
the environment interactive you don't
just click on things and see yourself
get an item you'll actually take the
time to open drawers or feel they're
hidden switches or actually grab items
physically and look at them which just
makes the whole thing a lot more
engaging now some aspects do feel a bit
easy at first for instance lock picking
but this is mainly due to the fact that
didn't want lock-picking itself to be
hard but instead just something that
takes time so that a guard might notice
you or if you do mess up you make a loud
enough noise to attract attention
there's plenty of loop to search for on
every level there's also some special
hidden collectibles that you'll accrue
over time and money isn't just used for
score you can also use it to purchase
consumables in between missions like
getting extra arrows or getting
permanent upgrades like increasing your
armor or buying more focus powers so
when you're looking at just the core
gameplay alone there's a lot of good
going on here and a lot of potential for
a great game but there's three things
that really cause problems for me
personally going from least troubling to
most there's its storyline there's how
linear it is and most of all the fact
that enemy guards are about as
intelligent as a sack of marbles so to
begin with there's the story which isn't
terrible but it's just not very good
nothing about it is very memorable
there's a very heavy emphasis on the
supernatural and not very much
emphasizing the fact that you are a
thief the title of the game you get
wrapped up in all these crazy epic
fantasy things happening and just happen
to steal everything you can along the
way it's not enough to ruin the game but
if you're the kind of person who looks
for a good story in what he plays this
one's just not going to appeal to you
very much now second up is just how
linear it can be now the game
is divided into sections there's the
main hub city and then there's the
chapters you play to progress the story
the hub city itself is fairly open
there's lots of routes you can take from
point A to point B but this is because
it is the main hub city this is we're
going to spend time just buying items or
walking around so you get tired of it
pretty quick as far as the main missions
go they run between either being one
gigantic hallway or being nonlinear in
the sense that there are multiple paths
but it's mostly just two or three
different straight lines that all lead
to the same point usually one that's
just an obvious route to take filled
with a lot of guards and then a side
route that you're rewarded with if you
take the time to search or bought a
special item like a screwdriver now
depending on who you are this may or may
not bother you for instance if you're a
fan of the older games you're probably
going to be angry because those had a
very big emphasis on open areas whereas
this is basically just path a or path B
now while those last two may not matter
to you the last point is definitely just
one objectively bad thing about the game
that just really negatively affects it
and that's the enemy AI and the fact
that they just don't notice or care
about anything you can pretty much just
be crouching in the shadows and you're
invisible even if the guard is only four
feet away and staring right at you
doesn't matter you're in the shadows no
one can see you on top of that they just
seem to forget about your existence
really quickly and not care for instance
my favorite example of this is on a
mission where I opened a door and snuck
in left the door open guards noticed and
they were alerted which makes sense
that's how a stealth game works but then
I closed that door while they were
staring directly at it and no one cared
anymore door mysteriously opens what's
going on door mysteriously closes no
problem here this may not matter in some
other genres games like an action game
where nothing's going to live longer
than 10 seconds but this is a really key
aspect of how stealth games work and it
just brings the whole experience down
because you don't really feel like
stealth is that big of a deal since no
enemies really ever matter so as far as
my final thoughts in the game go i'm a
bit conflicted on this one on the one
hand i really like allow the core
stealth mechanics but there's a few
things that are really holding it back
for me if you're looking for a serious
and challenging stealth game this one
may not be worth full price for you just
yet on the other hand if you're just
looking for something to screw around in
and steal everything not nailed to look
around and even mess with a guard AI a
little bit you might find it worth
purchasing either way I'd recommend
waiting maybe for a price drop or two or
just catching on sale still fun to play
just not what it could have been
