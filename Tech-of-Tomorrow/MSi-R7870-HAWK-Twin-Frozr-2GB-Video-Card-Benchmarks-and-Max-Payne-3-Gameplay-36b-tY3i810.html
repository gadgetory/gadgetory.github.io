talking tomorrow mark faris your host
today we're bringing you the full review
of the msi r 7870 hawk edition video
card now right now I currently have the
card running the test station here
behind me it's running fur mark which
means BIG's of the cards being stressed
out way beyond its normal means you guys
can hear it's not even running all that
loud when I first started running the
test I don't know what's going on the
card the card kind of throttled up and
it got really loud just for a short
period of time but after a couple system
restarts the card balanced out and I've
run the test many many times and it
doesn't get any louder than this no
matter what you're doing with it so that
said let's jump in let's first look at
the features then let's do the
benchmarks and then let's talk about the
end of the day where this card is worth
your money
first off let's take a look at the
aesthetics of the card take a look at
the front we can see it as a two fan
design has a twin frozer right there on
the front the card telling you that uses
the Twin Frozr cooling solution this
features two fans heat pipes and heat
fins to help dissipate all the heat away
from the GPU the card size in it is
standard about 10 inches there's a dual
slot design like most of the other cards
that are out there now as far as power
you can first off see there are two six
pin power connectors located right here
these are right next to each other they
plug in pretty decently as well as we
take a look at the back of the card you
can see that this card has something
really kind of trippy on it not only
does it have a solid backplate on it but
it also has this little thing called the
msi reactor it also has a little warning
in the car that says don't mess with
this or you may break your card and
interesting a little thing here what it
actually really does I'm not sure but it
looks kind of cool now let's take a look
at the rear i/o we can see that through
i/o features a standard deviation Ector
an HDMI connector and two may display
ports some cards come with me
DisplayPort adapters with them I didn't
see that actually in this box but it's
really not that important
that's basing the aesthetics of the card
now let's actually talk about the
features the GPU clock on this card is
set at 1,100 megahertz
the memory clock is set at 1200
megahertz this card uses 2 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory and as a 256-bit memory
interface with a total bandwidth of 150
three point six gigabytes the second the
card also has 32 ROPS and also has 1280
unified shaders and lastly it's
obviously based on the 28 nanometer
process now those are the basic features
of the card but MSI has a lot of
different features that they consider
their own first of all the military
class three components which basically
means that these guys use the highest
components they can get their hands on
such as the copper Moss which is a
copper MOSFET the high seat cap which is
highly conductive capacitors the golden
SSC or golden solid-state choke and in
the dark solid cap which is dark solid
capacitors these are all the makeup or
the hardware the car that actually makes
the card run very well they also have
their own dust removal technology which
is basically a fan which helps actually
keep dust out of the car by blowing it
out and away from the components inside
the car obviously this card will run
with their afterburner software now if
any of you guys don't know what that is
the afterburner software is a software
that comes with all of the MSI cards
which is actually a really good tool for
doing your overclocking and everything
else on the card
hey everybody before we actually jump
into the benchmarks I got a little
secret surprise for you now I know
everybody's Gauri talking about it out
there Max Payne 3 but I've got it in the
screen behind me over here so we're
gonna show you some real quick gameplay
right now though let's check out the
screen and you guys can see how we have
everything set up on here
I've got DirectX 11 full screen on
resolution 2560 by 1600 at 60 Hertz
vsync on texture quality very high high
high high high high high high all the
way down now this part in the screen
right here you can see below changes
your memory now the car we're using
right now is a 2 gigabyte card but you
guys can see if we turn the msaa up to 8
it actually exceeds the video memory so
I'm just gonna go ahead and set it to
we've got everything else set up and
with that said we're gonna apply the
changes hop in and this is the very
beginning of the game so let's take a
look at it together so here we have a
folks you guys saw the setup screen now
we're actually gonna jump in and show
you Max Payne 3
some cloud that God puts holes and other
bad guys well that's what they had paid
for so in the end that's what they got
say what you want about Americans but we
understand capitalism you buy yourself a
product and you get what you pay for and
these chumps have paid for some angling
gringo without the sense of dollars to
know right from there all here I was
about to execute this poor bastard like
some dime-store Angel of Death and I
realized they were correct I would know
right so long as one of them was helping
the poor and the other was banging my
sister
it was neither Jews nasty fall bullet to
the head
that was the boss lady only this time
she wasn't calling for more liquor
Oh crazy oh here we go folks another
gambit in the jump mode
guys prefer running right up and shoot
him in the head right into this fools
head nope so that's it folks I'm gonna
bore you guys anymore with this but I
mean hey that's a little bit of the
gameplay Max Payne 3 it looks really
good plays good in the card but that's
about that let's actually jump in and
see some real benchmarks time to rock
okay so that about wraps it up you guys
have seen how fast the card is what the
specifications of the card is now the
cards coming in to market at about three
hundred and seventy-six dollars for a
seventy eight seventy it's a little bit
pricey but it does have superior cooling
and the superior manufacturing of the
card MSI has a pretty decent warranty
one thing to mention though drivers that
you do use from AMD do make a difference
I was using an older driver and the car
was hitting up to 82 Celsius on the same
exact test as soon as I change the
dryers up to the latest drivers
temperatures went down 55 Celsius so the
drivers do matter quite a bit on the AMD
platform especially concerning heat but
at the end of the day the car did run
very well 78 70 series actually one of
my favorite series from AMD the card
runs very fast it's very competitive
this cards not very loud still got it
running in the background you guys don't
even hear it that much the only thing I
really got about the card is the price I
do feel this card at 376 is a bit pricey
but if you're into msi products and you
like the hawk and the lightning series
of cards then you're gonna want to get
the card that you're a fan of so at the
end of the day I gotta say this car does
when a serious hitters choice here on
tech of tomorrow for being just hey a
really good all-around card with a good
warranty we'll see you guys back here in
TECO tomorrow tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
