taking tomorrow on the work Ferris your
host today we're bringing you the full
review of the MSI our 7870 hawk edition
video card now right now I currently
have the card running the test station
here behind me it's running furmark
which means basically the cards being
stressed out way beyond its normal means
you guys can hear it's not even running
all that loud when I first started
writing the test I don't know what's
going on the card the card kind of
throttled up and it got really loud just
for a short period of time but after a
couple system restarts the car balanced
out and I've run the test many many
times and it doesn't get any louder than
this no matter what you're doing with it
so that said let's jump in let's first
look at the features then let's do the
benchmarks and then let's talk about the
end of the day where this card is worth
your money
first off let's take a look at the
aesthetics of the card take a look at
the front we can see it as a to fan
design has a twin frozer right there on
the front the card telling you that uses
the twin frozr cooling solution this
features two fans heat pipes and heat
fins to help dissipate all the heat away
from the GPU the card size in it is
standard about 10 inches is a dual slot
design like most of the other cards that
are out there now as far as power you
can first off see there are two 6-pin
power connectors located right here
these are right next to each other they
plug in pretty decently as well as we
take a look at the back of the card you
can see this card has something really
kind of tripping on it not only does it
have a solid back plate on it but it
also has this little thing called the
MSI reactor it also has a little warning
in the car that says don't mess with
this or you may break your card and
interesting a little thing here what it
actually really does I'm not sure but it
looks kind of cool now let's take a look
at the rear i/o we can see that 30
features a standard DVI connector and
HDMI connector and two may display ports
some cards come with me DisplayPort
adapters with them I didn't see that
actually in this box but it's really not
that important that's basing the
aesthetics of the card now let's
actually talk about the features the GPU
clock on this card is set at 11 hundred
megahertz the memory clock is set at
twelve hundred megahertz this card uses
two gigabytes of gddr5 memory and as a
256-bit memory interface with a total
bandwidth of one hundred and fifty three
point six gigabytes the second the card
also has 32 rops and it also has 1280
unified shaders and lastly it's
obviously based on the 28 nanometer
process now those are the basic features
of the card but msi has a lot of
different features that they consider
their own first of all the military
class three components which basically
means that these guys use the highest
components they can get their hands on
such as the copper moss which is a
copper MOSFET the hi-c cap which is
highly conductive capacitors the golden
SSC or golden solid-state choke and then
the dark solid cap which is dark solid
capacitors these are all the makeup or
the hardware the car that actually makes
the card run very well they also have
their own dust removal technology which
is basically a fan which helps actually
keep dust out of the car by blowing it
out and away from the components inside
the car
obviously this card will run with their
afterburners software now if any of you
guys don't know what that is the after
burner software is a software that comes
with all of the MSI cards which is
actually a really good tool for doing
your overclocking and everything else on
the card hey everybody before we
actually jump into the benchmarks I got
a little secret surprise for you now I
know everybody's got ray talking about
it out there max payne 3 but I've got it
in the screen behind me over here so
we're just going to show you some real
quick gameplay right now though let's
check out the screen and you guys can
see how we have everything set up on
here I've got directx 11 full screen on
resolution 2560 by 1600 60 Hertz vsync
on texture quality very high
hihihihihihihi all the way down now this
part in the screen right here you can
see below changes your memory now the
car we're using right now is a 2
gigabyte card but you guys can see if we
turn the MSA a up to 8 it actually
exceeds the video memory so I'm just
going to go ahead and set it to we've
got everything else set up and with that
said we're going to apply the changes
hop in and this is the very beginning of
the game so let's take a look at it
together so here we have it folks you
guys saw the setup screen now we're
actually going to jump in and show you
max payne 3
so obvious I become what they wanted me
to be a killer
some when cloud the gun puts holes and
other bad guys well that's what they had
paid for so in the end that's what they
got say what you want about Americans
but we understand capitalism you buy
yourself a product and you get what you
pay for and these chumps had paid for
some angry gringo without the
sensibilities to know right from the
wrong here i was about to execute this
poor bastard like some dime-store angel
of death and i realized they were
correct I wouldn't know right from wrong
if one of them was helping the poor and
the other was banging my sister
there was neither choose nasty fall
bullet to the head
Oh
that was the boss lady only this time
she wasn't calling for more liquor
Oh crazy well here we go folks another
gambit in the Jump mode
guys prefer running right up and shoot
him in the head right in this fools head
nope so that's it folks like a bore you
guys anymore with this but I mean hey
that's a little bit of the gameplay max
payne 3 it looks really good plays good
on the card but that's about that let's
actually jump in and see some real
benchmarks time to rock
you
you
okay so that about wraps it up you guys
have seen how fast the card is what the
specifications of the card is now the
cards coming in to market at about three
hundred and seventy six dollars for a
7870 it's a little bit pricey but it
does have superior cooling and the
superior manufacturing of the card msi
has a pretty decent warranty one thing
to mention though drivers that you do
use from AMD do make a difference I was
using an older driver and the car was
hitting up to 82 Celsius on the same
exact test soon as I change the dryers
up the latest drivers temperatures went
down 55 Celsius so the drivers do matter
quite a bit on the AMD platform
especially concerning heat but at the
end of the day the car did run very well
7870 series actually one of my favorite
series from AMD the card runs very fast
it's very competitive this card's not
very loud still got it running in the
background you guys don't even hear it
that much the only thing I really got
about the card is the price I do feel
this car to 376 is a bit pricey but if
you're into MSI products and you like
the hawk and the Lightning series of
cards then you're going to want to get
the card that you're a fan of so at the
end of the day I got to say this car
does when a serious editors choice here
on tech of tomorrow for being just hey a
really good all-around card with a good
warranty we'll see you guys back here on
tech of tomorrow tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
