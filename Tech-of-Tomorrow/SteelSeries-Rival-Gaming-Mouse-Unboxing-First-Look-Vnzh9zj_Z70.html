guys back here on tech of tomorrow we
try to bring you guys all the tech all
the time at least is you know much as we
can today we're going to do an unboxing
and first look an overview of a brand
new Mouse and people over its
SteelSeries this is their rival optical
mouse and this thing as a kid on the
features you can dial this thing from 50
all the way up to 6500 dpi and it's got
one-to-one tracking sensibility that's
right so this thing is going to be like
the most accurate accurate Mouse you're
ever going to see it also comes in a
market about 60 bucks so with that said
let's hop in let's look at this thing
and see what all the talk is all about
alright folks let's start off with the
packaging the SteelSeries rival optical
mouse with deadly precision that's right
deadly precision still series once again
we see their name down there and this
also works on a Mac and on a Windows
computer so better way where you're
gaming or what you're doing this will be
able to work with their 3d software
let's pop the cap open first off are the
new steel series switches now these are
high performance gaming switches for
smooth and responsive gaming with 30
million click lifetime that means 30
million clicks before it breaks they
also have two different areas that light
up and you have custom color indicators
that'll actually set to your own profile
you have a custom customizable toggle
switch that'll actually change your
profiles on the fly as well and they
have this anti sweat coating now I know
a lot of people's palms sweat you get
sweaty palms a lot when you're gaming oh
this thing's supposed to like help not
do that that'll be pretty cool what to
see how that works
textured rubber provides secure grip and
the ultimate comfort now this is pretty
cool down here's this name plate
customization it comes with two
different ones but if you have a 3d
printer you can actually custom print
your own and have it totally customized
for you personally I think it's pretty
cool here's what it looks like inside of
its packaging it's going to flip over
the side here optical 6500 DPI like I
said it goes from fifty to sixty five
hundred dpi 30 million clicks one
millisecond response time 200 IPs and 50
G of force which you'll be able to
probably change out in this mouse and be
able to change the weight according to
what you want it to be now steel series
claims that the rival shape was molded
from some of the most iconic gaming mice
the past the right-handed orientation a
raised back in and sleek contour ensures
a comfortable fit also this thing has
endless customization the rival is
incredibly customizable 16.8 million
color to zone illumination a 3d
printable nameplate for individuality
and the SteelSeries Engine 3 for finely
tuned performance adjust ins now at the
heart of the rival is the Avago a DNS
3310 optical sensor the 3310 promises
zero loss hardware acceleration offering
true one-to-one tracking and precise
movements no matter how fast things get
during the heat of the battle
all right folks now we talked about some
of the features let's go ahead and take
the thing out of the box and get a
close-up look at it got a little trusty
little cutter here let's go ahead and
cut this little thing pop the top little
plastic tab out of the way pull
everything out nothing else in there
just an empty box you've now been eaten
by the SteelSeries box so what do we got
inside the box we've got the rival
optical mouse Quick Start Guide which
basically tells you hey dumbass plug it
in if you don't know that though you
shouldn't even own the mouse unless
you're feeding it to your cat just
saying then we've got a nice black
cardboard box which can actually be used
as a ramp so if you have like a car or
something or even my knife you can use
it as a ramp alright so it doesn't work
so well the ramp you need a device to
stop it and then it can be around all
right moving on more plastic packaging
which can be launched off of said ramp
the same so here we have it the mouse
itself you guys can see very very
elegant-looking
it's got two different types of black
color on the side is kind of light in
the top is kind of satin that's nice
little clicky click these thirty million
of them your profile so you can change
that on the fly nice rest of your
fingers you've got two buttons right
here on the side for you to program and
kill people with four little rubber feet
on the bottom inside there's going to be
your sensor comes of the cable and a
little thing here inside of a plastic
bag which I shall take out of the
plastic bag if I can get it out of the
plastic bag okay has a little steer
series little rubber thing here this
must be part of the 3d things they were
talking about on the back here it says
rival so basically you have to take this
pop this sucker out then you can pop
this one in that says steel series or
like I said before you can get a 3d
printer and print one out that has your
name or whatever thing you want to put
on there but Billy badass whatever you
want to put on there and you can make it
customizable for yourself I have two
lighted areas this lights up other
lights are up here and like I said
before you can change all those lights
to a bunch of different colors 18
million of them you know I don't think
you're going to run out of options there
so that's pretty much it folks you get
the mouse itself this all the drivers
everything are available online all you
do is go online go to their website and
download them and off you go alright
folks so there you guys have it
everything about this new rival Mouse
and this thing's got a lot of cool
features the anti sweat thing is really
cool the way that you can customize your
name plate if you have a 3d printer make
your own I mean just a lot of different
things there guys is engine that works
in both a Mac and a PC so no matter
where you're gaming at you can use this
thing I
for the price it's actually a very solid
product if you guys out there actually
