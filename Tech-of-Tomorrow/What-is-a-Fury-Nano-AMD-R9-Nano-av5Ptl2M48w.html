who it for years been trying to build
themselves the ultimate small computer
using mini ITX motherboard than the
smallest of you can get but you've never
been able to get a video card to power
the bad boy we'll check it out you'll
now have that card AMD is released their
brand new fury nano now I know you guys
out there familiar with their other
cards the fury and the fury ex but now
there's going to be a fury nano and I
know you guys wanted the information
about this so right off the bat one
things I want to talk about this card is
completely geared towards small systems
like there are many giant systems out
there if you want to build a giant
system then get yourself a fury ex but
if you're looking to build yourself a
really small system and have it
completely run cool and awesome then
this fury nano is what you're looking
for now this card is completely really
totally unbelievably small it's only six
inches long that's right this card is
six inches long features a single fan
and has a total customer strut unlike
anything else the people over at AMD
have ever done before in fact in our
briefing they discussed it with us how
we can actually remove that painted
ourselves and put it back on and make it
even more custom now another thing about
this car is it only requires a single 8
pin power connector to power and has 175
watt thermal threshold that's right only
175 watts now there's also the very
first reference based card that has a
heat pipe that's calling all the prm's
and a dual a heat chamber that's cooling
the GPU so this thing's totally geared
to run cool another thing I want to talk
about is specs all the specs of the r9
fury ex are still in this card same fury
chipset same everything the only thing
to do between this card and now it is
that it's air-cooled it's smaller and
it's clocked a little bit lower now
another thing out if you are going to
say is overclocking yeah AMD
specifically said in this video that
this card was really not geared for
overclocking whatsoever what it is
geared for low power is to run
completely silent they're claiming this
card is so quiet that its library quiet
like beasts whispering in a row
oh man you can't hear it so that's
really nice stuff now I know speio out
there going ah man what tag doesn't
overclock but check it out you've got
your small system like that you know
you're gonna want the airflow to be good
in it and you're going to want to stay
cool you're not going to want to create
a whole bunch of heat inside this little
tiny space when you got a giant computer
you've got lots of room for air to move
around got this little tiny system
there's not very much room for air to
move around unless you want to put it
some giant fans at having one another
which totally defeats the purpose of
having a quiet card so things you need
to know is this cards coming to market
at about six hundred and forty nine
dollars it'll be here in about three
weeks features all new custom cooling
all around same specs as the fury ex
card unbelievable stuff folks now AMD is
claiming that this car will basically
revolutionize the entire sff business
and I kind of tend to agree right now
there's nothing by Nvidia that can touch
4k at this size three i/o port features
three display ports and a single HDMI
port so you know you're going to be able
to use multi monitors and 4k in a
six-inch card right now like I said is
untouchable by anybody so that's it
folks sorry another card in hand AMD has
said they will ship us once we can give
you guys the actual scores I'm expecting
it to score though honestly just a
little bit under the fury x I mean
obviously since it's clocked a little
bit lower you know it's going to run
place it a little bit slower but for
those people out there who are looking
for the ultimate card to build
themselves a small mini ITX PC hey your
day has arrived I think AMD has done
some serious innovation in this card I
know most of time you know you guys out
there nvidia fans say oh man you know
AMD isn't that but check it out AMD this
time this is a serious winter for AMD I
got a hand then you don't have to talk
to Roy Harper these guys because no one
right now has this so the fury nanos hit
the market it's small it's powerful it's
six inches it runs cool you guys have
seen the slides you guys know what it is
I'm Eric you've been watching teka
tomorrow hey if you like what you see
underneath this like button will have
more information about this card in de
will see you guys background check in
tomorrow for more tech videos tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
