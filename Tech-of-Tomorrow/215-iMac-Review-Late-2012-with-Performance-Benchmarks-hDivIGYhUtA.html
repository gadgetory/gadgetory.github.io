tomorrow we bring you all the tech all
the time I'm your host and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the 21.5 inch
iMac you guys have all seen us do a
couple of gaming reviews on this but now
we're gonna actually bring you guys the
full-blown performance and system review
of this new product from Apple so with
that said let's jump in check out the
specs the scores and then hear my
opinion at the end of the day so I can
hear yours let's go
really the heart and soul of the new
iMac 21.5 inch is their IPS technology
display it features a backlit 1920 by
1080 resolution and these models start
out between twelve hundred and ninety
nine dollars and go all the way up to
twenty one forty nine maxed out now the
model that we're looking at today is the
$12.99 introductory model it features a
2.7 gigahertz quad core Intel Core i5
processor which features turbo boost
technology up to 3.2 gigahertz it also
has six megabytes of level 3 cache the
memory on this system is 8 gigabytes
which consists of 2 4 gigabyte sticks of
1600 megahertz ddr3 memory now the
maximum memory you can get is up to 16
gigabytes but you have to have this done
by Apple and pay their premium as far as
storage goes the one were looking at
today has a one terabyte 5400 rpm hard
drive and that right there is where I
feel that Apple has really really failed
I mean come on 100 megabytes read and
write speeds that's very very slow if
you get the maxed out version you can
get some of their newer technology as
far as fusion goes and you get better
reads but that's only through them and
you're still gonna be paying that
premium a few of the ways that having a
5400 rpm hard drive they're really gonna
become the Achilles heel inner system
our boot up times and when you're trying
to access and use your programs now
granted most people who aren't familiar
with using SSD or fusion technology
they're probably not going to notice
this but me myself and for users out
there who do notice this this is a very
laggy thing and the thing is that
Apple's already included this technology
the fusion stuff on many of the other
products so why they didn't include it
in the base line I really don't know now
as far as graphics go the unit that
we're looking at today the $12.99 it
features the GT 640 m with 512 megabytes
of gddr5 memory now in the very
expensive model you can get a 650 M but
it still only has 512 megabytes of gddr5
memory not much of a real upgrade there
whatsoever now as far as gaming goes you
guys saw that we brought you Batman and
you do get 40 frames per second so it's
not like gaming is completely out the
window and remember these are some of
the latest first-person type games if
you're playing other type games like wow
world of warcraft you're playing Diablo
command &amp;amp; Conquer I mean many many other
style games this system will play them
just fine and also keep in mind this is
at a 1920 by 1080 resolution and that's
pretty damn good for something that's
all-in-one like I've said the Intel
all-in-ones
none of them currently featured discrete
graphics all you get is the HD 4000
graphics these having discrete graphics
actually make them superior in the
all-in-one Department Plus you only need
a single plug you plug in the power plug
in the back everything else is Wireless
it's pretty much simplicity itself now
as far as the speakers go you're not
even going to have to really go out and
buy an external set of speakers with the
audio that's on board the two stereo
speakers that are built into the 21.5
inch do a really good job of bringing
audio reproduction to you
they sound much better than your common
little cheap ones so that's the
department that it's doing very well in
now as far as connectivity goes there's
dual microphone ports a headphone port
we also see an SDXC card slot for USB 3
ports two thunderbolt ports and those
Thunderbolt ports support may
DisplayPort technology as well and it's
all built into one pretty cool stuff
there's also a Kensington lock for those
that's important and you get your 10 100
1000 megabit per second Ethernet so
that's pretty cool stuff as well now one
thing to take note of though there is no
CD drive at all built into it I don't
know how many people are gonna go holy
 this matters to some people it does
to me it actually is kind of a a little
bit of a quirk of mine I would prefer to
have a CD player built in it just makes
it easier but with so many things being
offset on two USB drives it's going to
be pretty irrelevant pretty quick so
probably you know within the next half a
year CDs this will become a thing of the
past and everything's gonna be USB
driven
and if it's not on a USB stick then
obviously it's downloadable now as far
as performance goes this thing's not
quite as fast as my Mac Pro but it is
creeping up on it and I'm sure when we
see the new 27-inch iMac it's going to
really put the damper on the Mac Pro so
there you guys have it I mean this thing
is really elegant looking if you walk
into an office place and you see it
sitting there
it actually looks so nice you're just
gonna look at it and be like ah cool
it's not bulky it's very very thin there
is no heat actually whatsoever coming
off of it which i think is pretty
incredible the previous generation ones
always had heat coming out of it I never
liked that these ones run very cool very
quiet
they look nice like I said they're
coming to market about twelve hundred
ninety nine dollars yes you can get a PC
version for about eight hundred dollars
but new you're not getting those
separate graphics and you're not getting
an IPS monitor at all and those things
do matter at the end of the day quite a
bit so really at the end of the day the
only thing keeping me from giving this
thing an editor's choice is that really
shitty 5400 rpm if you're out there
looking Apple change that freaking thing
what are you doing for this price point
the piece users are gonna put their foot
right up your collective ass so change
it up anyways hope you guys like this
video folks if so hit that like button
always make sure you're subscribed and
we've got some really cool stuff coming
up with the new 27-inch iMac so stay
tuned to tech tomorrow alright folks
also you guys know that it is the 12
days of Christmas and we've got
something really cool now this is a
product from the people over at cool
master called choice now this thing is
an extended battery pack
that'll work with any phone doesn't
matter what phone you have this will
work with it so what exactly is it well
basically you have your phone you're out
and about and all of a sudden you find
you've ran a battery charge you're like
holy frak man what am I gonna do there's
not a plug any where I can't plug it in
my button get a charge so what am I
gonna do well with this you just plug
into this and you get extended battery
life
that you can make that emergency phone
call so that's about it now what I want
to do here folks is I want to hear your
comments below and just tell me what is
your favorite thing and what is your
least favorite thing about the new 21.5
inch iMac I'll pick from the comments
below because everybody has a phone and
then I'll just pick from those and then
I'll contact you and send this out to
you this is really cool thing like I
said if your phone's out of juice you're
screwed so Merry Christmas and we'll see
you back here tomorrow for more tech up
tomorrow goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
