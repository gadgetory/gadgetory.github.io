data there xpg line of SSDs brings ultra
fast performance in both 2.5 inch and M
SATA form factors to perfectly suit to
upgrade needs for more info check out
the link below what's going on Tech fans
welcome back to tech tomorrow for
another day of tech we're here at the
Sun squared media offices to film you
guys a brand new video of the ASUS
Maximus 6 formula motherboard that's
right this is all based on the new has
welled platform it's got all kinds of
killer features rog is for the gamers
and let's see what comes inside this box
i think you guys are gonna really like
this motherboard
all right folks we'll start out real
quick just taking a look at the box we
see the front cover here we got three
public of gamers then we have the
Maximus six formula motherboard designed
for gamers you can see it's the z87
chipset supports both SLI and crossfire
and the onboard graphics will do 4k not
very well but they'll do it now some of
the engines and things about this
motherboard will open it up is this
thing can use air or water cooling
depending on what you're gonna do they
feature rog armor on the back of the
motherboard to make sure that you don't
cut your hands up or cause any static
problems right here you see the cross
chill the cross chill will allow you to
use both water cooling or air cooling
depending on what you want to do if you
want to use your water cooler you can
actually hook it up directly to this
motherboard now as far as the audio this
thing has advanced supreme effects and
one thing about it is it's segregated
Audio gets a lot of noise on
motherboards because of the fact that
the sound is not segregated from
motherboard so you get electronic noise
going through with the way these guys
have segregated you get none of that
they're actually using supreme Elnett
premium audio capacitors and like I said
before the shielding which helps they
also use extremely good headphone op
amps so if you want to listen to
headphones or high-end headphones you'll
be able to do that just a lot of good
stuff on that I'm not going to reiterate
too much because we're gonna jump in
that we look at the board they also have
a new MPC I combo to it'll work with M
SATA and it'll work with the new
configuration that's coming out which is
replacements which we'll talk about when
we get into the board here you guys can
see the board inside of its nice plastic
case showing it off I'm just gonna flip
it around roll back and show you guys
the back of the box just shows the
nomenclature again the cross chill
advance supreme FX their extreme engine
digi+ - which helps teach your
motherboard running cool and quiet as
the electricity is well-conditioned
going to the motherboard and then once
again they're gonna cover the M PCI
combo - with that said though let's
actually jump in and see a look at the
board the only other thing I do want to
talk about is this right here if some
people are looking to buy the board this
is actually the product SKU for it and
so with that said let's jump in and
let's start checking out this board I'm
gonna go ahead on the bottom right here
there's a little tab right here going to
go ahead and I think I'll use the top
one actually think of a little more
flexible but the bench opened a couple
times pop the cap right there
there's two boxes that come inside of
here one is the motherboard box itself
and then the other is the accessory box
which is right here I'm gonna go ahead
and start off by doing the accessories
first just make it a lot simpler now
inside of here start off we have the
motherboard user's guide it has all the
information about the motherboard inside
of it make sure you read it if you're
unfamiliar with the board the driver CD
and all your utilities like all of the
different special features and all the
soft board that has to do with a system
of the boards will be on this so you
guys want install that stuff that'll be
there
you also have SATA cable labels so
sometimes in your hooking up your SATA
connection and stuff it gets confusing
where your hard drives and stuff are you
can mark them with this that way if you
want to do any hot plug-and-play stuff
you can know where it's at don't get
confused you let's go hey that's my
drive pull it and replace it I've got a
little door hanger right here
do not disturb champion in action I put
this on my door whenever I'm making
clothes champion and actually just
saying so you know and right here it
says enter and champion to break so what
I'm taking a break I'll put that on
there next up we have this little
combination thing right here this is
both your Wi-Fi your M SATA and your new
n GFF I'm gonna try to get this up close
to the camera now ng FF is going to
replace M say to next year and so this
will become widely available so this is
three things and one it's that V M SATA
and it's the Wi-Fi all-in-one little
accessory just plugs right and your
board simply enough and you get all that
stuff on it go ahead and just move past
that set that off to the side we have
the rear shielded i/o it actually has
like little foamy stuff inside of here
to protect from electrostatic discharge
and everything's clearly marked in it so
when you put in the back of your
motherboard you'll be able to clearly
see where everything goes and how you
can access it no problem at all next up
is the a Zeus two and one Quick Connect
those are these right here don't need to
take them out of the bag I'm not gonna
use those quite yet then we have what
they call the dual band Wi-Fi moving in
ten I'll go ahead and just take this out
so you guys can check this
and see it rip the plastic on that
particular ones you guys can see that
it's this little antenna plugs into
those two little plugs we showed you
earlier on this so once it's installed
they connect to this and you got a
little external antenna that you can use
right here which pops open you can see a
little tab but it's a got some plastic
stuff on here so but this is basically
it it's your antenna you have different
ways you can do it it'll lay flat stand
up sideways or stand straight up
depending on how you want it to be see
you move it around do different things
with it just depending on what you want
to do that goes with that then we have
the SLI connector right there a little
nvidia logo on the inside of there then
last but not least we have four of the
SATA 6 gigabits per second cables and
that's pretty much it as far as the
accessories go alright folks so here you
guys can see the Maximus 6 formula
motherboard now this thing is even more
badass than I even thought it was going
to be this thing has the same kind of
bitchin armor that we've seen on their
saber tooth boards but now we're seeing
it move over to the ROG now some of the
main things about the board are that you
have eight separate fan connectors on
the board starting up on top moving all
the way around there's eight separate
fan connectors also on the top of the
board right here you can see this
connection right here this is for your
combo M SATA and Wireless next to that
you see the first of the easy connect
ports there's the eight pin and the four
pin and then all the way down at the
bottom the board I'm going to swing down
you see the last of the easy connects
this one on the bottom is actually a
molex one now right across the top up
here
we're gonna see the mem okay button now
the mem okay button is when you put
extremely high in memory in your system
and it won't boot you hold the memo k
button down and it'll allow the system
to boot finding the correct settings
that will allow that memory to post in
your system as we roll down along the
board we see all these hot spots right
here these are hooking up for your
multimeter and stuff so that you can
check out all the power points on your
motherboard here we have the Q LED code
this will show you different codes on
the motherboard upon your boot telling
if there's any type of problems in the
manual
give a series of numbers that Co relate
to this which will tell you what the
problem is next that we have the start
button then the reset button and an
another chassis fan then down below that
we have the 24 pin power connector now
here's the LGA 1155 socket now in this
little socket area it is kind of smaller
than some I've seen but obviously a Zeus
has done their homework because they're
not going to make a board that you're
not going to be able to use aftermarket
cooling on now the wrong cooling let's
actually talk about that right here you
guys can see if I pull these off are two
areas to connect a water cooler to your
system so you don't have to do this but
if you want a water cooler system you
can actually integrate this board into
it all of your high-quality components
in everything are actually covered by
the tough cover so you can't really see
them very well on the motherboard here
to the right is the memory now this is
pretty incredible you can use 32
gigabytes of ddr3 up to 3,000 megahertz
that's right 3,000 megahertz is what
they're trying to push right now I know
what XMP profiles that 2800 megahertz is
posting but I have not yet to get my
hands on her try memory of extraordinary
speeds like that coming down the board
right here we see the USB 3.0 connector
then we have our little hazers thing
down here covering some other components
as we go up here right on e through CPU
goes you guys can see we have the Asus
Republic of gamers now this is gonna
light up and Allred making your
motherboard look even more bitchin now
we're going to flip over here here are
two more of the fan connectors then we
have one two three PCI 1x connectors PCI
one is 16 8 PCI 2 is 8 4 and PCI 3 is
just 4 I'm gonna flip the motherboard
around we're gonna take a look right
here here all the SATA connectors now
this is why I do actually have a problem
with this so JJ if you listen to this
video dude I'm going to tell you I think
this is quack these controllers on here
are Intel and as media but they're all
colored the same now I know you guys
have included those stickers on there
but it would've been a lot nicer to
actually know which controllers are
which just by looking at it like usually
the Intel ones will be black and the as
media ones will be red now they've just
colored everything red so these six
right here are Intel these two right
here though are the as media I'm gonna
flip the board back around again and
right here on the side right here we
have the quick boot feature and this
allows the system to boot directly into
Windows over passing a lot of the BIOS
things that get checked now as we swing
down further we see the direct key what
the direct key allows you to do is if
you hit this key your motherboard will
boot up and when it reboots back up
it'll go directly into the BIOS so if
you're sitting doing testing or whatever
and you don't want to mess with pushing
the button you just hit this button
first before you restart and then it
goes automatically into the BIOS no
problems at all now down there on the
bottom of the board these are were all
the connections from your case and
everything hook up so you take all those
wires for you know your LED hard drive
start all that they're all located right
here then we have USB 2.0 and then we
have a rogue external connector now the
rog external connector allows you to
hook up this little thing and overclock
your system without even going into the
bios whatsoever you hook up the rock
extension look at that little bad-boy
overclock and then have your system go
it's pretty cool I have them from
another motherboard maybe I'll even hook
it up and I do my overclocking but for
what we do it at my house we don't get
into ln2 so we don't get too crazy so we
go down here we have the I our header
chassis x' fan like I said before this
is the easy plug down here on the bottom
this is a molex easy plug you want to
probably just go ahead and plug that in
if you want to have extremely powerful
to your motherboard if you want extra
power and all that stuff you can go
ahead and hook that up and it's post a
lot of the motherboard to run a little
bit better down next to that we have the
s/pdif out now on the rear i/o you're
going to have the Philips s/pdif but
this is actually for a coax connector so
if you want to use a coax connector
you'd hook that up and put it to the
back of your system now before the row
though I want to turn this board over to
the back I really like this a lot I know
all of you guys really like this a lot
on this part is
you guys are doing a badass thing here
mixing the sabre-tooth boards features
onto this board I really got to say I'm
impressed
I love this I love this I love this I
just do and I know you will too now
let's flip it around let's take a look
at through our i/o we have CMOS reset
rog connect then we have three USB 2.0
connectors and on the bottom of that we
have the rod connect next to that we
have four USB 3.0 Philips s/pdif out
hdmi displayport LAN two more USB 3.0
ports and then we have audio now this
audio can be flavored in two four six or
eight channel depending on how you want
to do it and you can Duke it up either
digitally or analogue depending on your
choice so there you guys have it you
guys can see that this new rog
motherboard has all kinds of features on
it whether you're looking for extensive
audio overclocking water cooling it's
all covered on the Maximus six formula
motherboard like usual if you guys are
looking to purchase this board down to
the like button the description will be
all the information about that stuff and
if you're not subscribed to the channel
hey make sure you hit that button back
over here this next week I'm going to
throw this motherboard in the test
station run all the tests and then I'll
bring you guys the full review next week
of this great product keep evil over it
