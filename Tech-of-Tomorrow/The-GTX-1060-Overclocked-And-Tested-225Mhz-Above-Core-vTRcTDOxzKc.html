back once again to the channel now
GP 104 came out we saw the 1018 in 1070
and a lot of people speculate you know
that they weren't getting the best
overclocking results in the world for
the founders edition cards but then this
new Beauty GP 106 came out and the 1060
is showing amazing overclocking results
I think you guys are going to be very
very impressed now we also hang out this
guy mark he's from this site called
Babel Tech and he's insane like tester
and stuff we've been working with him on
and off and like he was able to get some
massive massive results from the
founders edition card and I think you
guys are going to be pretty impressed so
with that said well let's check out how
killer the gtx 1060 founders Edition
overclocks
right out of the damn box okay so the
number one questions you're probably
asking is well what did you use to do
this overclocking with well EBG has a
tool called precision X it's their
overclocking utility we use the latest
version it's publicly released at six
point zero point three the original
tests that were actually run we're
running on the beta version that was
only available to reviewers but now
that's not in the public so you can get
your hands on it now how we did this is
once we install this we basically took
the voltage and put it all the way up to
its maximum set the power and temp
targets to their maximums and cranked up
the fan speeds to 100% this edit 225
megahertz to the core and 700 megahertz
to the memory clock which is quite
incredible then after that we just put a
fan inside of the coolest room we get
the house and to get the results that we
got and I think that they're pretty
substantial now we use a skylake CPU
this is an i7 6700 K and we keep this
thing in turbo mode all the time so
turning at 4.4 gigahertz that's pretty
incredible we're also using an asrock
motherboard and this test system is
pretty much unless you want to jump into
xd9 I think is high-end desktop you can
get unless you're working for like
workstation type stuff so you guys can
see the rest of the components that we
used here but after that though let's
rock out to the benchmark song though
and let's check out how well these
results
alright so there you guys have it the
overclocking results are in almost 10
frames per second all the games across
the board in 1080 and 1440 piece that's
really really incredible stuff GP 104
wasn't showing the greatest overclocking
results so far but GP 106 founders
Edition you guys can see it's definitely
doing great
225 megahertz 10 frames per second it's
almost like jumping in to the next card
like I said before my friend Mark from
babble tech reviews he is a crazy guy
with doing testing we'll have a link
down below to his site where you guys
can read his full review and how all the
results that he got as well
I'm Network you guys been watching Tecna
tomorrow if you want any more of
information as well that'll also be down
there bullet like button which by now I
hope you know what to do with if you're
subscribed hey we'll see you back here
