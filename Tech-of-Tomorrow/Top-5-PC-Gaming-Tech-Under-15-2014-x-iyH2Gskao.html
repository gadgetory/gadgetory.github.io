usually you'll see me over on
youtube.com slash TLD but Elric who was
a close friend of mine and would
normally be bringing you this video
unfortunately had a trip back to the
emergency room this week as many of you
are aware he's been battling diabetes
for the past few years he actually got a
surgery a little while back and
unfortunately had to go back underneath
the operating table this week but the
good news is he's out he's doing pretty
positive and he should be updating you
guys very soon now Elric the crazy guy
he is was really wanting to bring this
video to you guys in fact he was like
bring the camera over I'll do it on my
hospital bed but I told him to chill out
get better the fans will be here when he
comes back so I will take over and bring
the video up for him so today we are
covering the top 5 PC and tech gadgets
under 15 bucks so first up is the tech
net high precision gaming mouse so for
under 15 bucks this mouse features six
buttons a clickable scroll wheel a pair
of side buttons and a single dpi
adjustment button which lets you switch
between 1,000 to 2,000 dpi for the price
it actually does feel pretty solid and
it has a blue LED which gives you just a
little bit more style and kind of gives
it a little bit of a futuristic look now
this of course is wired but if wires
aren't your thing and you want the
wireless version it's only a dollar more
I'll have both of them linked down below
so now you got a gaming mouse but you
can't leave that guy hanging by himself
so now we're taking a look at the
SteelSeries quick and it's so quick they
forgot the UI gaming mouse pad so not
only is this managed em'ly durable but
its base is also made out of material
that makes it really hard to slide
around this size is in a nearly 13 by 11
inches so it's not huge but it's also
not small so you're going to get an
adequate amount of room so you can move
your mouse around now the best part
about this mouse pad is not only is it
under 15 bucks but it's under 10 bucks
as well so if you've been looking for an
inexpensive but solid mousepad you guys
probably want to check this out now if
you're watching this video right now on
stock desktop computer speakers and just
stop right now because we're going to
upgrade those we're taking a look at the
amazonbasics USB powered desktop
speakers and again these are under 15
bucks these are very compact so I'm not
going to take up a whole lot of space on
your desk you're getting a total of 3
watts at 1.5 per speaker what I like
about these is the volume control and
power actually is right there on the
front of the speaker so it makes it
super easy to access and while these
things aren't going to be the loudest
speakers in the world
we're not going to get the cops called
on you they make a huge upgrade over
built-in computer speakers and your ears
will be happy you pick these up now
Amazon is on the budget camp again and
these aren't necessarily gaming
headphones but in case you don't have
any these are a solid good-looking set
for under 15 bucks now really the only
thing separating these from a gaming
headset is the fact that doesn't have a
microphone but it doesn't mean you can't
use them while playing games it's got an
on-air design so that means it's not
going to cover your entire ear they're
going to be fairly comfortable for its
price tag what I really like about these
is the flexibility and portability of
mind so you can move these around and
put them in the included carrying case
which come with the headphones it's also
got a fairly long cable as well so
whether you plug it into your smartphone
tablet or your computer you're going to
be covered with that as well so last up
is the Seba USB stereo audio adapter and
this is something I think could be
really useful especially for the price
it's under ten bucks and what this is
going to do is add class 10 USB audio to
either your laptop or desktop as you
guys can see this thing is tiny so it's
definitely not going to take up a whole
lot of space right there of course on
the front is the headphone output but if
you wanted to can even add a microphone
if you chose to do so another thing you
guys might find useful is having access
to your audio on the front of your
computer rather than having to reach
around so that about wraps up this video
again all the products will be linked
down in the description hopefully you
guys enjoyed the video if you did give
this video a huge thumbs up for Elric
and show them some support now our work
has no idea I'm doing this but in case
you guys want to help support them we'll
have a link down below of how you can do
that I know he's going to be
concentrating on how he can get back to
work and so that way you can make his
living but I really want them to focus
on getting better so if you guys want to
help them out that way check out the
link below and you guys can help him out
through not only one of the biggest
physical challenges of his life but also
mentally as well so I know you guys care
about Elric here on technic tomorrow

can support him and I'm sure you guys
will hear from him very soon aside from
that this is Jonathan and I'll see you
