rock in your diet
so Tech fans what's up welcome to the
rockin edition of the EVGA overclocked
edition of the 1060 card we're also
going to check out it's a little brother
to standard edition so now let's jump in
let's check out what comes in the box
and then see what this card is all about
so first up folks you guys remember the
founders addition the 1016 this car was
pretty good it overclocked okay but with
the fan turned to full blasts and the
electricity turned up to maximum this
card you know was running a little bit
loud making a lot of noise now this card
is a card from EVGA that's Jacek Liege
asically asically it's a brand new web
created basically it's like basically
but only jeweler cooler nunna anyways
this card right here is basically a
little bit lower than a founders Edition
this is really the total entry-level
card from EVGA on the 1060 series so if
you're looking for card though that
you're going to slap in your system
you're not going to worry about
overclocking it you just want to save
the cash this is the card you might want
to check out but for day we're actually
here to check out the a CX 2.0 version
of the gtx 1060 and this thing has some
pretty amazing numbers now inside the
box probably going to see you'll see
your standard stuff in here your cables
cables are here one cable room with
cables let's here get the card itself
though so cut the card out the box
there's not really much too much for the
voxi unboxing fans out there looking for
a grand unboxing there's just not too
much in the box
blocks from the box back in the box side
of the box other side of the box and
then the key box at the frickin camera
man missed him by that much
but anyways okay so then what we got
here for the accessories and inside the
bag a dual molex to 6-pin power
connector that's in there we do have
another poster again once again which is
always cool we're getting ready to build
our new test area so we will have lots
of room for cool posters like this one
let me try to open it up so you folks
can check it out let me open it up ever
so sawyers you don't rip it or break it
open this bad boy up and slow my hair
not to mess it up ten tenten tenten try
to do this right here
hopefully I'm getting most of this out
here hope you go folks can see this so
hunters like bring it up and out well
crazy poster but anyways art you get
this crazy biggle gigantis or poster for
your wall so if you do that type of shiz
Nick and you want cool for your
wall then okay Evie J's got you covered
on that one also come with some stickers
bunch of different types for your
overclocking all that good stuff few
people out there who like stickers
you've got your basically cue your
what's this uh
just a manual by how to plug it in
basically nobody really needs that I
don't think any my audience anyways the
EVGA look case emblem for sticking your
case if you're down with that and then
last but not least another little users
guide yeah and then last but not least
will take the card out of its
anti-static little bag right there and
then we can start checking out the card
itself and as you guys can see there's
just the EVGA logo and a single fan on
the front now as far as the card sizing
in the length of the card is six point
eight inches in the height of the card
is four point three seven six inches and
like most cards in the market it also
features a dual slot design as we turn
the card to the side you guys can see it
says the EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 it says
SC right there and lighting on the right
and also above that is a single six pin
power connector and on the back of the
card I'm a little bummed because I can't
hit cuz there's no backplate mmm-hmm
what's not BBJ no pack wait how I love
all right moving on anyways though um
that's pretty much it I mean on the rear
i/o you guys can see there's a single
DVI connector a lot of people like that
you also see a single HDMI port and
three display ports around the side of
the card you guys can see the heat fins
permeating it around the edge and
there's also a few heat pipes underneath
there as well to keep the card running
nice and cool so that's what the card
looks like now let's check out the
speeds and feeds inside the superclocked
gtx 1060 we see 1280 pixel pipelines we
also see a base clock of sixteen hundred
and seven megahertz and a boost clock
speed of eighteen hundred and thirty
five megahertz the card also features
six gigabytes of gddr5 memory with 192
bit memory interface and the memory
speed is eight thousand and eight
megahertz which equates to 192 gigabytes
a second of total
bandwidth it's also recommended that you
use a minimum of a for the watt power
supply to power up this superclocked bad
boy all right
so that's what the card looks like it's
speeds and feeds now we test the card at
its standard clock speeds and then we
also overclocked this car to 2100
megahertz and we have both those scores
along with others you can see how this
card performs so with that said let's
jump in
check out the test system and the rock
out to the benchmark song and see how
the superclocked Edition rocks for you
our test is inconsistency 700k that we
keep always running in turbo mode at 4.4
gigahertz we're also using an AZ rock
motherboard and a bit of rip job memory
also folks before we bounce out of here
wanna once again send a special thank
you out to Tao clean for bringing this
video possible and like usual out a link
down below to that 50% off coupon I
folks old there you have it the super
clock edition by e VJ of the GPX 1060
now this thing performs really well and
runs really cool you guys can see that
even overclocked to 2100 megahertz
this thing never got over 65 Celsius and
that's running this in the desert where
it's very very very hot now as far as
the fan speeds go we at the fan speeds
at aggressive and we also had the
voltage set at the high settings to
achieve this nothing else was done this
is pretty much just rather box a couple
clicks on a screen and boom that instant
awesome overclock so this thing totally
kicks ass on the founders edition I mean
it's pretty much like a founders edition
totally done right at the end of the day
I got to say this card is a serious
serious editor's choice if you're
looking for an enjoyable car that's

bank and you want something awesome this
is the cards you're gonna want to check
