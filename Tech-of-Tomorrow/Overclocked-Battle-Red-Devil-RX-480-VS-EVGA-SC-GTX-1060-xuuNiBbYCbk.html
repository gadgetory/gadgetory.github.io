Braintree world youtube glad to see you
guys back here once again on teka
tomorrow
and now the overclocking gloves are
coming off and we're going to do a
totally battle of the overclocking
Giants now on one side we have AMD's our
X 480 red double and on the other side
we have EVGA super o'clock GTX 1060 now
these cards are very close in price with
the AMD one shockingly
that's right a little higher price the
AMD version that's right the red devil
is two hundred and seventy nine dollars
why EVGA is ten sixty is two hundred and
fifty nine dollars so right off the bat
you can see the EVGA is a little lower
priced also the EVGA comes with six
gigabytes of gddr5 and the other card
comes with eight gigabytes of gddr5 so
you can see right off the bat
these cards are you know looking pretty
even little things different but they're
pretty even so we took these cards we
overclocked them to their maximum values
and now we're going to bring you those
results and we'll see who actually is
the overclocking King of the Ring in the
entry-level cards so let's first take a
look at our test system talk a little
bit what we did and how we got our
results and then we'll check out those
bitches we're using the Intel i7 6700
kcp u now we keep this learning at turbo
mode at 4.4 gigahertz we're also using
an adze ROK z170 motherboard this is
their overclocked edition we're also
using 16 gigabytes of rip job memory
from the people over at g.skill we use
Windows 10 exclusively for all of our
testing and we use the latest drivers
available at the time of the testing as
far as power requirements go the power
color red devil has a single 8 pin power
connector that requires 150 watts of
power to keep it going the EVGA
superclocked gtx 1060 has a single 6 pin
power connector and only requires 120
watts of power now as far as
temperatures go the Red Devil got as
high as 68 Celsius and as long as it
stayed below 72 Celsius the card ran
fine the ebj super clock however it ran
a little bit lower and showed a temp in
the low 60s when it was
clocked and even with the voltage and
the fan speeds set to their maximum
values the fan noise still wasn't so
loud you want to cover your ears and
with that said let's jump in and let's
check out the benches and let's see who
wins when the gloves come off in the
overclocking ring
real quick before we get to the
conclusion I just want to give a special
thanks and a shout out to our friends
over at Braintree even the best mobile
app will not work unless you have the
proper payment API and that's where
these folks come in to solve all your
problems this is where brain trees V
zero SDK comes in one amazingly simple
integration gives you every way to pay
it supports Android iOS and JavaScript
clients and it offers a simple
integration that you can do in minutes
if this sounds good to you try it out
for yourself in the sandbox all you
gotta do is go WWE bring three payments
comm /t o t so when the overclocking
gloves come off and they jump in the
arena we can see that the Nvidia card is
still winning by a slight margin AMD did
win in four or five games so if you're
an AMD diehard fan we know that you're
going to go out and get yourself an Rx
480 and you're going to be doing it Red
Devil style but if you're a fan of
Nvidia then you guys know the super
clock edition of the GTX 1060 is a
serious ass-kicker as well now the only
caveat I see here is like I said before
for the first time the AMD card is
actually the higher price card and
usually the biggest thing that I hear
from AMD fans in general is that hey
they have better pricing so here you
guys can see though at this time it's
not really true because their card even
though it does have two more gigabytes
of RAM it runs a little bit hotter you
guys saw that does run a little bit
hotter and that has something to do with
overclocking and there still is a little
bit of headroom that you might be able
to push out of that 1060 so at the end
of the day I mean if you're just looking
at raw numbers and performance I think
it's a no-brainer I think the Nvidia
card actually is doing a little bit
better but obviously if you're an AMD
loyal fan you're not going to turn your
back on the red guy so you're going to
go with them but you guys see the
numbers and hey honestly the RX 40 red
devil when it's overclocked it does
really well I mean it's really only like
you know I mean such a wee margin behind
that I don't think it's really going to
matter so if you don't mind spend that
20 extra bucks and your an AMD fan hey
then I guess via the choice is clear my
name is Eric you guys been watching teka
tomorrow like usual we'll have all the
information
this video of all the information about
these cards so if you want to check one
out and buy for yourself that'll all be
down to that luck button you guys know
what to do peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
