tomorrow I'm here once again is your
host and you guys all know that
everything out there in the internet now
is what you're watching everything
you're doing is downloading pretty much
the Internet rules are life and I've
been trying to use my playstation 3
lately and it's just totally not working
for me I don't know what's going on with
it but I'm not able to watch my TV shows
and stuff on it so I decided well I used
to really like the old first generation
Apple TV I really like this thing a lot
it has great interface options it's
small it offers the perfect connectivity
now the only problem is though this
thing only does 720 so I was just like
you know what man the PlayStation isn't
working I'm going to go out and I'm just
gonna go ahead and dig in and get the
second generation new Apple 1080p TV so
I've got this little bad boy here and
I'm gonna do the unboxing and if
anything folks out there have ever used
this before them really the greatest
thing about this I feel it's a dinner
face I mean it's just so easy to use
everything's laid out very nicely the
remotes simple and it's not very big
either it'll sit on top of any other
thing you've got out there so here's a
part of the box show you guys just a
quick back of the box your connectivity
go ahead and pop this out put it on the
box nothing there so here we go
so here's the remote it's the exact same
thing as the first-generation remote I
don't think there's any difference in it
whatsoever looks identical maybe a
little longer though I'm thinking it
does look a little longer so that's
really about all there is with that so
move that up here's the little
accessories package all that comes in is
the set-up guide and we can decide the
bottom down here so we have the set-up
guide the power cable the unit itself on
the front let me go ahead just remove
all this stuff off of it so here on the
front we can see the little bit an out
piece of the Apple there's a little tab
here I'm gonna go ahead and remove this
tab as well I don't know why there's a
big black tab around the entire thing
but there is some totally take that off
there what the heck I'll tape the
cameraman up with it there he goes he
really loves this shit let me tell you
alright so here's the back power HDMI
audio s pitov and you get up to the
Internet right there pretty simple stuff
folks that's everything that comes in
the box like I said if anybody out there
has ever used one of those let me hear
your opinions in the section below in
the comments if you haven't already
