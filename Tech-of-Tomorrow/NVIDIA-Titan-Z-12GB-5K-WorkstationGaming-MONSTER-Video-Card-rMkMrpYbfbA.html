edition of tech devoir and this week has
been one hell of a week in tech of
announcements
lots of stuff has been going on now
NVIDIA they had their technology
conference last week and Jensen hung
their president had a release talking
about a brand new card for those people
out there who make games make movies and
actually use their video card to make
money this is the brand new Titan Z now
this thing's supposed to be the zombie
killer but probably not it may not kill
a zombie maybe you picked the damn card
up in you smack a zombie enough times in
his frakkin head
I suppose he died and I don't know if
I'd recommend that to Rick over on The
Walking Dead but you know possibly they
can kick him a card and he can see how
many smacks it takes to kill a zombie
now this thing is going to be the
top-of-the-line workstation graphics
card that you can get your hands on from
Nvidia twelve gigabytes of dedicated
memory this thing can power five K
multiple monitors all on a single card
featuring dual Kepler GPUs now the only
back side is it's gonna be about $3,000
so those people in the professional
position will actually you know use the
card in professional level they'll be
the people who are gonna buy this for
gamers and people like that you probably
be out of your mind to buy this card
unless you just want to have bragging
rights and just be the biggest swingin
thing in town but other than that you
probably wasting your money so can this
thing to use though to actually kill a
zombie I don't know we'd have to ask
Rick from The Walking Dead to get one
and actually smack is on me in the head
a bunch of times and Sarah many times it
takes to kill him now bbl result you
know over there Nvidia this is a thought
can you get your card on the show and
then get him to smack a zombie with it
and see how many times it takes a zombie
to die I think it's a pretty cool thing
but at the end of the day this is gonna
be the hottest card from Nvidia 3000
bucks you guys want more details we'll
have that all of that over on the
website so make sure you guys check out
that link down below next up in tech
news now I don't know if any people out
there happen to catch this over on eBay
but one of the guys who works at
Microsoft in the development team he was
given a gift of a totally white xbox one
and he sold this thing on eBay and he
was asking about $1,800 for this now
this thing is probably a pretty
one-of-a-kind thing but the price is a
little bit high I guess this guy need I
need to pay his rent or something I
don't know if I was given a gift like
that from the dev team it meant a lot to
me I probably would have kept it but I
guess if you're a collector and you're
looking for something that's totally
different this might be something that
you're looking for now I don't know if
this thing is actually sold yet but if
you're in the Xbox one your collection
you want to get a one a kind thing that
was actually given from Microsoft to
this dude you guys should check this out
down below we got a full story all the
pics on this so if you guys are just in
this kind of thing either way whether
you're negative or positive leave your
comment down below and let me hear what
you have to say now me personally I had
1,800 bucks I built me one badass gaming
PC thumbs up if you agree with me if
that like button let me know you agree
now last but not least in the news this
week
oculus been purchased by all the people
over on Facebook now thing came out got
sold tens was like holy macaroni these
guys bought it next day public reaction
was a little bit different because I
guess most people don't want to play you
know farmville you know on the oculus
rift now this can you know be good for
them but is it going to be bad for the
public I mean is this project now just
going to become some little like little
weird thing like the rest of stuff in
Facebook me personally I'm kind of
disappointed in Facebook I know it's a
free service and everything but we kind
of like built our business we wrapped
our arms around them acted like family
and they're kind of like you know I'm
not helping us out anymore so it's like
now they've bought this oculus now are
these guys gonna kill it and screw it up
like they've done everything else so far
or will they leave it alone now one dude
who was at Vail burr for oculus rift who
was doing the minecraft stuff he's
actually pulled out of the development
so obviously he doesn't think it's a
good idea now we want to hear what you
guys think do you guys think it's a good
idea or do you guys think it's a bad
idea just let us know your opinions why
if and how you think it's going to
affect everybody by them buying the
oculus rift I'm sure there'll be lots of
other products that come out now that
I'll have a lot more pacing but this one
now is in the hands of the Facebook
folks so we will see where that goes so
