here on the channel once again now
before we get started today's video is
brought to you guys and sponsored by
Remote Plus and today we are going to be
taking a look at the Remo Belle s now
you're probably wondering Elric what the
heck is a Remo Belle s well it's pretty
much a very entry-level smart-home
product yeah it's a smart doorbell it's
very fast reacting really good points
about this particular product as it
works a night or day so whether you're
you know seeing people coming to your
house during the daytime or the night
you can still see what's going on it has
automatic motion censoring stuff so if
you're not there and there's somebody on
your front porch that alerts you it'll
let you know that they're on your front
porch it has an interactive doorbell
somebody can ring it you can speak to
them and no matter where you're at it
doesn't matter
you'll be able to talk to them through
your smart device doesn't matter with
you have an iPhone or Android none of
that type of stuff matters and also
another really cool point about this
particular product is even if you have a
doorbell already installed in your house
you can actually replace it with this
particular product or if you don't want
to keep it at your house permanently you
can mount it so that it can be removed
and taken anywhere that you want so all
in all this product is only $100 and for
all the features and everything that it
has inside of it I think you guys will
probably like it so let's jump right in
and check out the Remo Bell s now inside
the box you get the Remo Bell s along
with a few different sized mounting
wedges which is cool because some
companies sell these wedges as separate
accessories but with the Remo Bell LS
you get them for free they're ready to
use and they're included in the box you
also get all the screws and accessories
you need to mount the doorbell to your
existing doorbell and since it will be
outside it is weather resistant so you
don't have to worry about the elements
damaging the Remo Bell S at all but for
today's video we weren't really able to
do this but I did get an adapter from
Amazon that allowed me to take it
anywhere inside my house and also easily
mount it to the wall by my front door or
I can see everything
now the Remo Plus app is free and it's
available like I said on Android and the
iPhone the app itself has a simple and
basic layout and for me setting up the
Wi-Fi on the Remo Belle S was super
easy and as long as you have a 2.4
gigahertz Wi-Fi you shouldn't have a
problem either once I added my Remo Bell
s in the app it was up and ready to go
and absolutely no time and on the home
page it shows your recent activity as
well as live view options so you can
start streaming from the Remo Bell s
anytime anywhere
whenever you want
now the remove LS has 1080p HD video
with 180 degree field of view so you can
see your entire front yard
it also has 2-way talk functionality
which you can turn off and on in the app
as so desired
also in the app you can delete recent
activity videos on the home page to free
up storage if you need it and on the
left hand side you can pull up a tab
with extra options and settings there's
even a support option that takes you to
the Help section or their website when
you click on it and from the tab you can
also change some of the devices settings
you can choose the video quality best
average or low and you can also have
motion sensor settings such as options
to save videos to cloud instant push
notifications sensitivity and even
customizable motion zones you can also
set the motion sensitivity from low to
high for daytime and nighttime as well
and you can set the night start and end
times to whatever you choose
there are also five motion zones that
you can set the Remo Bell s to
left-center right as well as in front or
further away and you can hit all five
from maximum security or you can set it
for just one when you're chilling out at
home you can also set your in-home chime
type so that the Remo Bell s can work
properly and with the Remo bells
infrared night vision you can turn on
night mode for a 24-hour watch on your
home
it's like having your own 24-hour
security guard hello who is it the Remo
Plus app also lets you know who has
access to your doorbell with the viewers
option on the left hand side tab you can
have up to five viewers per account now
starting off you also get three days of
free cloud storage with an extra 30 days
when you get the standard plan now plan
started three dollars a month or $30 per
year and like I said the Remo Belle S
comes to market at a mere 99 dollars
alright tech fans so there you have it
the Remo Belle s and honestly at $99
it's very well priced like I said you
can either hard install it into your
home or you can set it up so it can be
taken anywhere that you want and it's
like having a 24 hour security guard at
your front door because no matter where
you're at in the world it'll alert you
it'll let you know what's going on if
someone has a delivery you can talk to
them you can say things like hey you
know leave it with my neighbor or other
such things like that you also know
exactly what's going on at your house
and the nighttime vision is also pretty
cool because someone's like coming
around and creeping around your porch at
night it'll actually have them on film
so you can capture that and turn to the
police if you need to be you can have
access to your records 24 hours a day um
you guys can see the storage plans are
really low priced I mean three dollars a
month or thirty dollars a year you can
have all that cloud storage and
constantly monitor what's going on at
your house I think it's a pretty cool
product like usual I want to see your
guys's comments down below what you guys
think about this and if you want to buy
one or get one for yourselves we'll have
a link down below where you can do that
as well
overall the Remo doorbell s for a
hundred bucks is a really solid product
and could be the entry lap
to your smart home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
