tomorrow very very freaking exciting
news today is launch day for the new
frickin contender for the mid-level
video card King what the hell am i
talking about you folks know we're
talking about the new geforce gtx 660ti
that's right now I got my hands on the
overclocked diversion from gigabyte so
let's now do the unboxing tease you with
the card and then later today one
probably just a few minutes from after
this video you can see the full review
but for now let's jump in and let's just
do the unboxing of the new geforce gtx
660ti overclocked version from the
people at gigabyte
alright folks so here we see the box not
much to it you guys can see it's got the
wind forest anteater bones cooling are
there try on cooling OC version to get
goodbye to dr five geforce gtx 660 toi
here goes some more fun facts real quick
on the side of the box you guys can see
those kablooey KaBlam me here is the
back of the box yes can see all the fun
facts there this is just the unboxing
all the goodness will come later now
let's look at the nomenclature and he
folks looking out there to buy the card
here's the nomenclature now one thing
that these guys are pushing those that
anybody who buys this online from
certain e-tailers you're going to be
able to get a free copy of borderlands
to the game when you buy this card so
make sure you look online for the
selected people that are doing that it
would be pretty cool shiz Nick and the
game is badass so carding lots of
features there's those ago let's go
ahead and pull it out here click the box
around here take the kepi got the driver
CD has that OC grew to software all that
kind of stuff set that off the side here
is a graphics card quick installation
guide pretty easy stuff just tells you
to hook up your video card and all that
stuff at the power very easy stuff
there's that the accessories not a lot
in this one you just got your two molex
to duel 6 pin so if you've got an
old-school power supply those are right
there now let's get to the heart of the
matter the card itself winter days
waiting to see and here we have it so as
we first take a look at the card we can
see left the bat the two giant sized
fans these are part of that wind force
anti turbulent cooling system below that
we can see the aluminum heat fans and
then we can see the heat pipes with the
copper all throughout the card this is
keeping it cool the cards also made out
of very high quality Japanese components
supposed to have a very long life span
actually the cooler the card runs the
longer the lifespan of the car so here
we see the two SLI fingers now this card
only supports triple SLI does not
support quad sli I don't know why but
that's what they've said I'll go ahead
and put this little protector back on it
and slap that back on it here's the back
of the card you guys can see that the
card is a nice blue PCB some people like
that some people don't I don't really
care here is the pci interface down here
it is
new pcie 3-pointer face you guys all
know that we can see the cooling
solution very clearly all throughout
hair I'll try to get up to the Cameron
so we can get a better zoom on that so
you folks can say it guys can see all
the fins and the aluminum heatsink
copper heatpipes inside of there
dissipating all the heat away from the
GPU away from the Cardinals big acute
fans blowing against it just better heat
dissipation away from the GPU flip it
around what you guys just take a side
angle view or a long angle view if you
want to call it that let's flip it back
up on top you can skies can see right
here there's two 6-pin power connectors
here let's flip it around you guys can
see the rear io TV VI ports hdmi and
displayport my actual preference I like
this one the best I wish every card have
this Bree Rio it's my actually my
favorite rear I oh so that's it man its
launch day look for the full review
probably after you watch this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
