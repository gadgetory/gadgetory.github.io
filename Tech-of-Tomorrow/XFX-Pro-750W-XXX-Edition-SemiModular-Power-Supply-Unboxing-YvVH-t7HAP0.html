I'm Elric once again here on our Channel
and today we're bringing you something
very interesting from the people over at
X effects is their new pro 750 watt
power supply features their easy rail
technology it's Braun certified at 80
plus bronze means it's got a pretty good
power curve on it now this thing's also
coming to market though at around $100
it's semi modular and with that said
let's go ahead and let's take a look at
this thing
so another cam Andrea just over here to
the table alright folks so let's check
out the box XFX easy rail Plus
technology provides maximum power the
pro 750 watt says Radeon crossfire ready
sli ready 80 plus bronze win over this
here it is there a little true what its
guarantee so just keep flipping around
to other aspects of the boxes their box
has a lot of different stuff on there
we'll move along more stuff clean power
extreme heat tested smart sensors
flipping around show you guys the back
here you guys can see the power supply
broke all the way down including all of
its internal components it's actually
sponsored by some guy right here named
gusano Gilbert I guess he's the lead
industrial designer sorry you guys you
guys don't go and blind here but he says
good enough is never good enough you
guys know that the power supplies from
XFX are made by C Sonic they're a really
good brand so we may pop up the decent
knife here and I'll go ahead and take
your cut right here handle we to the
part you guys have all been waiting for
anyways the unboxing parts up top here
there's a box inside the box doing the
boxing inception or box inception
pick that up there set that off the side
okay flip it around figure out alright
here it is right here so take that thing
around here
KaBlam alright Tencent and uh HBC for
alive alright so here it is the pro
series PS use they have a whole bunch of
different ones you guys know this is a
750 watt one is accessories box
kinda like you see with lots of video
cards so let's set that down
here go the additional cabling so you
guys can see these are all the flat type
cables some people like them some people
don't
they're very easy to use with a case and
for braiding they're not too bad either
so if you're gonna be braiding your
cable it's not really gonna matter just
take a look at all these ones we'll pull
them out of the box you got your molex
here just hold on put them back in the
box maybe it might be easier so here you
go molex for your floppy molex again 6 &amp;amp;
8 pin 8 pin molex SATA SATA and more
save it so those are all the ones that
are modular so let's get that out of the
way here are the screws also by the way
these are going to help put it inside
your case so it'll mount it in there and
stay in place so doesn't go flying
anywhere if you're moving around I think
those be better off in that box over
there someone to move that go ahead and
take this out now so alright so you guys
can see it comes in a little Christmas
package so I'll go ahead and open it up
like it's Christmas Day my trusty knife
again for this so I gotta break it out
twice in one video again the knife
all righty then so there we go hold this
thing up we'll turn it up like Christmas
Day go ahead and pull this thing out all
right so start off with showing you guys
the fan thethe little XFX logo up then
you guys can probably hardly see that
but it's there and I'm the last see the
side the pro 750-watt flipping around
his backside XFX logo on and off button
you guys can see all the quality parts
inside there inside a little cage foot
Behrami the side so you guys can see
more of the nomenclature and stuff
now figure where you plug through the
cables in right here you guys can see
the PCI CPU peripheral IV eSATA I'll go
ahead and let you guys see these right
here you have your power here so
basically all these cables that are on
here all yours from sort of power cables
your 4 pin your 24 pin all that stuff so
you guys are gonna like it or hate it
semi modular is just fine with me you
need your power stuff anyways it does
come sleeved as you guys can see and you
can custom color the other sleeve it
anything you want so that's it folks
thanks for watching we'll see you guys

videos and more tech goodness like usual
