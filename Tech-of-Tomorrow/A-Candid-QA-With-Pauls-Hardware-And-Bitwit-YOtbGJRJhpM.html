exciting day over here hanging out with
some old friends of mine from Newegg
Paul from Paul's hardware and Kyle from
bit with hey having seen these guys in a
long time and it's a really nice time
over here and I think a homeboy here
made a Twitter thing and you guys have a
lot of questions so I'm gonna hand the
microphone over to Kyle and let him
begin today's adventure that's your
first mistake Elric is handing me any
kind of microphone I'm gonna drop it
maybe at the end of the video experience
all right that's how I roll
always leads to dangerous danger never
remember my remember my toes wrap it on
my feet all right don't me to step on
your toes over here soon oh all right so
let's uh let's just see what kind of
questions we have here
what are we got what do we got what do
we got I don't know why we're asking the
internet for this but uh Oh first up we
have Logan Logan from tech syndicate
he's a Zorgon from texting no need you
mean Logan Wolverine right uh kind of I
mean he's tall we're talking about the
facial hair they have more or less the
same thing Logan you do have the facial
hair man all right so what does Logan
gotta say thanks is a question but it's
one way mission this one's actually for
you Ellie what's Elric's favorite power
metal or regular metal band probably
disturbed just erm pretty much like my
overall favorite band I find myself
always going back to disturbed I don't
know what it's about that BAM but I just
love them so there you have it oh can I
answer this one - yeah sure what I was
gonna say Megadeth Megadeth they're not
good I don't think they're like
considered new metal or power metal is
that new or is it regular metal
regularly I let me get a decimal I
thought he meant like new new metal I do
love Megadeth I listen to a lot of
Megadeth tales not too much of a
Metallica fan since the Black Album to
me that was gonna go but I listen to a
lot of music a lot of music I'm a
musician myself I have my students here
in the house and like I like a lot of
bands but I do find myself really
listening to a lot of disturbed I do
listen to quite a bit of Megadeth and
there's a hole just so many other bands
to listen to pinning one down that would
say what might be my favorite yeah
that's kind of hard but I'd have to roll
with disturb at the end of the day still
I shall I want to point out that the
Black Album spinal tap did that first oh
really Wow
Paul you just you just took it to 11:00
or anything wow you did vinyl tap like
trolled Megadeth's when Megadeth came
out with the Black Album because they're
like actually we already did Megadeth to
a black guy Megadeth on my brain for
some reason honestly those since Ron
that honestly I think that the best
thing that Metallica could ever do for
themselves is to bring Dave Mustaine
back into the damn fold because at this
point they're really stagnant and
negative that's kind of getting steady
so getting those guys back together and
having them fucking fight with each
other I think that would be just amazing
you'd probably actually get a really
good album Internet make it happen
yeah it could happen Dave if you're out
there listening buddy you know me join
back with Metallica you know you want to
the petition goes out tomorrow okay
there we go
um all right next question here we go
let's see this is CJ caveman asks what
program did you take at college
engineering or maybe nursing lol same
question - Paul Hardware ok so I think
he means like what kind of degree did we
get I got a degree in computer science
computer science calm sigh nice long
beach date whoa mine was multimedia
production management multimedia cuz I
wasn't exactly sure what to do with my
life so I was like multimedia I'll just
explore all the things and figure it out
later
that's what you do now it was marketing
media I know and it worked out perfect
there you go I'm actually like the one
the half a percent of people in the u.s.
that actually has a job that relates to
their major so here he goes yeah I don't
do crap to do with computer science
anymore I don't do programming all that
language I learned COBOL you got the
caller side down yeah none of the
science you're halfway there it's I
technically didn't graduate but I
studied cinema television so I guess I
kind of also do something civil you know
what I went to college for it you're on
cinema you're on cinema right now yeah
you're right you're on YouTube baby in
the cinematograph
yeah eight millimeter super super super
eight yes super eight super eight baby
let's see
favorite builds from each of you this is
from Jed or anxious Jedi I don't know if
he means just ones that we've done in
the past but let's just assume that it
is Wow we've we've done so many pills
over the last couple years I can barely
even dream it wonder like stands out to
you that's like honestly my favorite
build of all is a system that I got from
main gear
the dude at man gear just hooked me up
with such a badass system it's not the
one you showed us upstairs another why
surging in the room over here oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah Systems just honestly
incredible do you guys want if you guys
want to see that system back in the
channel again let me know show it to you
guys but it is totally incredible due to
the fact that Anthony my man guy builds
my systems he works full-time it doesn't
have as much time as it used to have in
the old days we used to do all the crazy
builds like that but as water-cooling
you know completely change they got hard
and everything else we cannot have
backed away from that stuff we plan on
getting back into it and then I just
closed the deal with ek and so you'll
see a whole lot of new builds that are
different than ones that we've done in
the past and they'll all have a new
favorite build water cooling got hard I
see what you did there yep mine is still
hot line because it was my first custom
water-cooled PC and I was just so proud
of it and it was such a huge labor of
love but now it recently recently leaked
all over the place now it's been
completely disassembled so did you put a
diaper on it rest in peace
no because it's in pieces it too late it
leaked before I got the diaper on there
well rust in pieces is a Megadeth album
there you go that's true this is there's
a theme there's I'm doing now in this
Q&amp;amp;A that's right I would also do you
want to come over and do the video with
us why not hey arctic Panther for me and
my main water cooled arctic Panther
arctic Panthers is what it is called yes
as usually sounds cold them to Ramin all
at the same time yes and I don't like
this chick I used to date well I'm sure
there's a back story they got the
inspiration yeah but I also have some
upcoming stuff which I'm hoping will
eclipse it you know exactly that's
awesome well I feel I feel like this
stuff work and in the future gonna be
better than anything that we've done in
the past yeah
all right next up we've got one from
scrub killer who asks what's your
favorite game of all time favorite
that's a tough one
unreal the very first one you came a
tournament you saw that no not in a real
tournament Oh unreal we you came out and
you saw that waterfall and all the water
was falling down which is totally 3d
that to me was like really was a mercy
yeah PC games mind-boggling and then
honestly an early game that's a real
favorite of mine was a scheme called
pandemonium so that just shows my age
but panda mother's little right yeah
side scroll you hit this Joker guy you
play yeah digester exactly nice going
around that shit was just incredible I
was fun like honest we were talking
about that today to me a lot of the
games that you've seen nowadays just
seemed like a reskin version of a game
that you saw previously there's really
not too much what I feel great
imagination and going into games
everybody's so focused on trying to make
everything look pretty they forgot about
the fun content even though there are a
lot of fun games out there to me the
games in the past were a lot funner and
a lot more imaginative than they are now
so it's actually one of the reasons why
one of my favorite recent games is doom
like the you know the current do ya
because it was like no frills no
bullshit it was just fun the whole way
through they didn't try to spice it up
or dress it up as something that it
wasn't it was just like pure adrenaline
like and there was like you know it's
doom so there's hardly any storyline
it's like you wake up you're in this
weird-ass dark place and you you grab a
shotgun and you just start blasting
through hallways and stuff I think it
was just like core gaming at its finest
yes that the very first doom game was
really cool too is why I'm never meeting
John Carmack a long time ago and that
game was really cool and it was original
because I remember talking to my cousin
when I was in high school and I kept
going hey man why can't games go
straight through
instead of going side by side and then
all the sudden games came out like that
and I was like yeah baby get those get
those royalty checks I deal I'm gonna
cheat and choose to civilization as a
series that was actually a great game
yeah so much time playing so I have to
throw that out there but as far as a
game that I hadn't liked the mostest
algid for right now I'd say like World
of Warcraft actually when I was actually
playing it a lot which was like in 2006
to 2008 I think just there were a lot of
friends I played with and stuff so I I
haven't been able to recreate that
online experience with like going and
like signing in and you have a bunch of
people and you go and all do every
together or something like that so I
kind of miss it that's one game that
really never played that much I really
didn't play a lot of World of Warcraft
neither did I it's under some reason
organization though I played the shit
I love building stuff and then your
playroom kind of like the same type of
thing oh yeah yeah I mean those get I
actually loved those type of games the
games real cities and all that that's
just amazing I love that stuff
cool um all right we've got one from
Patrick roseberry
who asks if you could eat one thing for
the rest of your life what would it be
and why
oh man I can't sushi I can't answer that
she's been my favorite food for so long
I could literally eat it every single
day and never get sick of it yeah when
you go to Japan you're gonna beat a
bunch of it and kill yourself I can't
wait it's a happy way to die okay food I
like smoked food in fact today we're
gonna be later on today where me and my
roommate are gonna go buy a smoker
I loved smoked foods so smoked chickens
in fact okay smoked Cornish game hen I
could literally that everyday along with
some good sausage man that would just be
like my favor or or smoked salmon on a
sushi roll if you like sushi
I particularly like don't like sushi
nobody I actually none of my friends
actually like sushi we can't be friends
sorry I'm just gonna put invisible wall
here Kyle here he's the exception to the
rule he's the sushi man but like she did
G's the camera he don't eat sushi bill
my roommate doesn't eat and he doesn't
need it I don't need it I don't mind
California rolls but eating that raw
sashimi stuff to me is just like what
you're making me hungry stop all right
polar bear didn't you say you need to
get some good sushi ah you're talking
about to get it from the rain okay so
you're talking about smoking things
makes me think of something that I like
to make that I always enjoy so like baby
back ribs oh yeah some pork back ribs
smoked baby back rib I mean does dry rub
yeah if I got to choose something that's
probably I could go with that too I
could eat smoked pork ribs every day of
my life I'd probably blow it out like a
little piggy but I'd be a happy piggy so
good all right next up we've got one
from equina star beach this is kind of
an interesting question what's your
favorite non youtube related job maybe
he means what would you be doing if the
musician was around for me it's a
musician I think I think that's safe to
say
it's pretty evident that you're very
much into music I'm totally a my guitar
our guitars around here
exactly for me if I was doing anything
else other than this I would either be
running my recording studio which I do
now or just being a full-time musician I
loved music pretty much in fact I loved
music more than YouTube Jonathan from
TLD he's like a son to me and like he's
the one who really pushed me to do you
to bionis a first didn't even want to do
youtube I was stuck in the old days of
doing a website and Johnson said hey do
YouTube and it just kind of like fell
into my lap doing that kind of stuff but
honestly I'd rather be a musician if I
had my choice every day of my life I
would be playing my guitar singing and
dealing with something with music
because that's what I love you'd have a
much bigger female audience that way
than having a techy youtube channel it's
richer probably yeah because I could be
too sexy for my shirt too sexy
that'd be the name of your band - sexy -
sexy but like in the number two for the
number two - second right said over all
any any thoughts so I took that
literally at first which is doing a job
that I've had in the past I would fall
back to if I didn't do YouTube anymore
so no doesn't count
alright if I can't choose porno then I
guess I'd have to go with the second
option which would be I was a Hocker
uh who over at Angel Stadium bull games
yeah when you go to a baseball that's
rigo's come on no no no harder each a wk
and yeah so if you like you have to
borrow the guy throw the peanuts to you
in the stands at the base oh that's
called a hawker yes I didn't know then
that was a hot day
I've been edgy bitch over years it's a
it's a good job get to watch baseball
game make good Commission and you get
good exercise running up and down the
steps a little and you get free peanuts
and free peanuts which means you can
make friends well actually we didn't get
well sometimes we got free peanuts you
never see there's well they're pretty
strict about you never get high on your
own supply that's true
my favorite non YouTube man I don't know
what I would be doing if it wasn't for
YouTube I I don't know I feel like uh
III don't have an answer to that
I really don't really have maybe grant
oh I don't know graphic design was
always something that I was you're good
at writing scripts or you know what you
know what I'd probably do advertising a
Vietnamese tour guide probably do my
Vietnamese tour guide yeah American
accent all the way her oh I probably do
something in marketing I feel like I
know how to like make funny
sometimes and you know kind of dick
around with commercials and try to make
something that's really mundane usually
more interesting personally that's one
thing we were doing that I was really
impressed but you were always really
good at writing scripts and stuff like
that
we've never scripted a video any video
on TECA tomorrow has never been scripted
yeah I do it from the cuff every single
video I can't do the scripts anymore
because I just take way too long to
write so yeah I'll just I'll just wing
it or what else we got what else we got
we got a question here from Ezekiel uh
been bigger ah no sorry if I'm
butchering that what's your favorite
color Wow getting deep green and really
deep here I love green all kinds agree
especially like the aqua greens like I
have a couple guitar bills that we just
did that are like this really cool
aquamarine green or like de jade color
that you see the water like you see the
water in China that's like honestly my
favorite color I just think it's
beautiful does some beautiful I like I
like purple I've always been attracted
to purple what's up Prince and and I
think also when I was younger I'd always
go for like the grape flavored candies
the most because I like the color really
yeah and then I just didn't sort of
developing a taste for grape flavored
things I do like purple I actually heard
have that I've actually built a couple
of purple guitars I mean you must like a
little bit yeah it's in my look I love
fertile too it just it's not green is my
favorite color but we were starting to
develop the channel yeah like we always
like fell back to purple even long time
ago and I his site called game pyar was
based off the color purple so yeah I
guess I really do like the color purple
which probably my second favorite color
I recently did a purple build actually
it was the first purple themed system
I've ever made and I was like I really
like this case with their NZXT purple
case no it was with the UH
it was a mess if I see in white so it
was a black white and purple theme built
and it turned out really nice Oh paper
color blue Paul blue I don't have a cool
backstory just because your because
you're you're dead inside
ooh there's a blue the color of death I
don't know Oh
Blue's Clues but blue is pretty sweet
perhaps a blue gray like to see after a
storm Oh George that's not very deep
that's something only someone who's dead
inside would say that's true
have to leave any boughs out gracefully
I told you it was a deep question
alright let's see um notch or no not Tim
asks what does that mean what does that
mean is anyone here no I'm not that's an
iPhone 10 question iPhone X notch in the
top I'm a savage can screen oh wow how
did you know like you don't have an
iPhone Wow master race Hall sees every
key people complain about it on Twitter
you're like oh these because all these
other phones have been coming out that
have a notch oh right sure and following
in Apple's foots yes so I've never owned
a slippery slope neither by everybody
I'm gonna say I'm gonna say no not
because I was fine I'm fine but no not
right now
there's no notch on my yeah although
I'll go with no not if it's not broken
don't fix it these bezels you have in
the top and bottom though okay Wow
hideous let's just not to conversation
okay another day I think what you've
moved past this and this is very
personal
no touching all right favorite rapper
dreadknot 503 asks oh man they have oh
man favorite rapper that biggie guy I
honestly thought he was the best he just
did everything so smooth and so
beautiful
you know I'm if I was gonna just choose
one rapper to listen to I would probably
choose him I have to say dr. Dre Dr Dre
is just his sound never gets old to me
and I just I love his lyrics and I love
his personality he doesn't have like a
huge ego like a lot of rappers tend to
do and he's also discovered other great
rappers who I also like psych Eminem
like eminent exactly what Snoop Dogg
chip dug his new dogs actually look real
quick story Snoop Dogg's really cool guy
when I lived in Rowland Heights he
actually coached the football team at
the school right down the street from my
house at Rowland high and he was an
awesome guy meeting him I thought that
he'd be like some arrogant do but nah he
was down to earth than one just one cool
mofo it wasn't the name of that wasn't
the name of the team the Snoop Doggy
Dogg's no damn note increase we know but
he was a really cool guy got to say that
really nice guy he always does it seems
come on auntie
and stuff oh it's good thing Elric
sitting all over all the way over there
because I gotta go to pop oh shoot now
we're gonna have some rival what's up
man Biggie and Tupac here we go get my
guns you oh yeah my gun I don't know
what to do no yo do it IIIi honestly I
was gonna go with Tupac the the only
thing that I didn't like about Tupac
compared to biggie is I felt that Tupac
a lot of his stuff was just really based
on a lot of violence and Biggie didn't
always do that a lot of stuff that he
did was more like I thought it more my
real life situations but I have to say
Tupac is probably one of the greatest
rappers ever I agree with you with that
and I do like biggie to biggie I like a
story got a story to tell it's my
favorite biggie smalls song yeah it's
good to know both sides alright and hey
Wow an actual tech question thank you
very much the nuclear growing because
well nuclear brownie asks how much
longer till graphics card prices become
normal well they look like paulie's
saying early are starting to fall but
yeah they are starting to fall very
slowly in certain areas for certain
cards it's kind of sporadic right now
but this is kind of a question I feel
like we're asking as well I feel like
everybody involved is sort of in the
dark there's so many factors at play
with you know the memory shortage or not
memory shorty but just memory prices
yeah Mary prices have gone up extremely
crates and yeah hopefully hopefully you
know after Computex or something we
start to see some sort of decline to
back to normalcy personally I think it's
been disgusting that video car prices
have been this high for so long I mean
for all whole year video card prices
have just been over the top and like I
mean everybody pretty much blames minors
and maybe maybe they are they're really
the sole culprit of it but honestly I
think there's a lot more depth to it and
I'm hoping that video cards really do
drop because for all the people out
there who want to do their own personal
builds personally I think it's been a
crying shame that especially to live in
countries that don't get great prices
they can no longer even build their own
systems they're forced to do different
things and although you know buying from
a system integrator for a lot of people
kind of sucks it's been really the only
way to get your video card at a decent
price for quite a while yeah I would
I would agree most of that and then
finally we have a question from Sam
settle off' who asks has getting new
tech become different since it became
your business it's actually a pretty
good question we were just talking about
that actually earlier yeah I feel I feel
like sometimes the the excitement is
kind of dwindled down when I get a new
product because it's there's work
attached to that product right yeah it's
no wonder this is I just get a video
card to game on I have to test it and I
have to create content for it and you
know in strategize on how I'm gonna
pitch that content at the same time I
still do get excited to build systems
you know that light up effect of turning
a system on for the first time seeing
everything spin up and whatnot
is still really exciting to me and I
think the reason why my channel I think
you guys can see the same why our
channels are growing is because we
genuinely enjoy what we do yeah I still
enjoy a tech and I feel like if we
didn't if we hated our jobs then I think
that would come across on camera and oh
so not as people would would sort of
subscribe to us for that sort of thing
so now for me I mean I've been in this
game since the very beginning if you
guys follow me anybody out there knows
you know motherboards honor was the very
first you know Hardware site that ever
existed and when PC stuff first came to
market up from me it was a lot more
exciting because there were just a lot
of companies all competing that the only
problem with that is back in those days
getting different parts to work together
was really hairy nowadays parts
definitely work a lot better together
than back then but the excitement for me
even though it's still there it's not
the same as it was in the beginning in
the beginning it was truly exciting
because you know there was just white
cases and a few parts and then all of a
sudden it blew up
we had companies like creative making
these great sound cards and there was
just everything was new and so like
anything else when something's new it's
always fresh and better because for me
I've been knew this for close to thirty
years and even though the excitement's
there in the very beginning I thought it
was just a little bit more exciting than
it was now I think for me just recently
because I do feel like stuff kind of
stagnated from like maybe 2010 ish to
2015 ish but I think with with what
AMD's been doing recently kind of
getting back into the cpu market I think
it's kind of
like mix things up a little bit there
seeing a little bit more competition
you're seeing a lot of criticism towards
Intel for some of their sort of
technical slow rolling out of products
over time and that kind of thing so I I
think you know you got to maintain the
interest like like like you guys have
said and yeah I think for me I still get
excited when I have a product come in
and I know I'm like one of the one of
the first people other than the
manufacturers to like get to take it out
and try it out and communicate back to
the manufacturers let them know what I
think or just feedback - so hey how do
you like a question for you guys so like
for me the most exciting thing I've
honestly seen is when Nvidia sent me
their Star Wars video card see we didn't
I didn't even have one of those you get
any screw you man I'm sorry I'm a dick
just sorry well I mean honestly for me
and lately so what's that supposed to be
towards those lately my most exciting
thing that I received though was that
Star Wars video card that one when I got
that I was like honestly I was doing a
dance going this is freaking badass what
about you guys what's recently something
that you've got in that you get just
like oh man this is badass
I got a GS 65 stealth from MSI which is
one of their latest laptops for the gtx
1070 and Core i5 six core 8th gen
processor and it's just fully loaded and
it's just so nice I've been using my
razor blade for quite some time now but
you know it's got a a lowly gtx 970 and
not even the the 1060 loli um so I've
been sort of looking out for a new
laptop and they just sent me one for a
video and the video is awesome but I get
excited about tech that rolls in that I
can actually use on a regular basis
instead of it just staying up on the
shelf and it's gonna be there for you
know collecting dust or for regression
testing later on I like using the tech
whatever you're gonna hate me I have
that laptop just sitting in my box in
the room because I mean we have so many
pcs in this house that I rarely find
myself use you only have yourself to
hate for that oh I know
- call me yourself what about you Paul
I've had some graphics cards and cases
and stuff coming through
but actually 128 gig memory kit just
recently showed up in gold mine
I've only worth a lot of money yeah
we're the ton of money you buy yourself
a robotic arm I'm probably gonna trade
up for that it's working on it you
should do that but yeah 16 gig dims and
RGB the Corsair Kitty Vengeance right
yeah the Vengeance nice nothing new
you'll see I didn't get sampled with the
hat I had to ask them very directly
that's what like you like like give me
that biatch oh yeah yeah I didn't they
usually respond well to those I think so
haze rats you usually used they're at
powerful did you tell them I won't film
anymore your products if you don't give
me that memory kit I used a different
pet phrase then puppy give me that stuff
puppy dog I can't give away my
techniques come on I want I want to try
it next time I mean I I didn't get a kit
so I need to I knew how to work this
just have to promise that you'll give
blood to them very charity whatever
method works man yeah yeah yeah that's
your call just just don't mention my
name when you do it but Kyle said those
are pretty much all the questions that I
feel comfortable asking from the
internet right now so that's it guys
