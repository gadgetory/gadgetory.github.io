to another edition of tech o tomorrow I
am LR can I'm glad to see you guys back
here once again so check it out
are you looking for a qHD monitor hmm
yep they're looking for one well today
we're gonna take a look at one from a
company called M best now this is the M
best gaming monitor - 27 inch gaming
monitor features free sync all kinds of
nice things in fact it's got a very very
small bezel it's almost bezel asleep it
very very close so let's take a look at
this monitor that comes in the market at
$300 and let's see at the end of the day
what you guys think and what I think so
first off visually you guys can see the
monitor has a very simplistic look to it
now the bezel like I said is very very
small it's almost completely baseless
has a pretty decent plastic frame
holding everything all together now the
screen itself is a 2560 by 1440
resolution screen it's a TN panel it has
5 milliseconds as your standard response
time and one millisecond when you put it
in overdrive mode this particular screen
also features free sync and accessing
the on-screen display is really really
easy it's just right there in the front
and you can actually change the
on-screen display to anywhere you want
on the screen which is actually pretty
cool you can put it in the left-hand
corner put it out of the way so if you
want to keep it up and do all your
adjustments you can do stuff there's
also a bunch of different color things
that you can change as well so if you
like it to be like daylight you can
change it to that you want to be
brighter you can do all that it does
have all of these options inside of the
screen you guys can see right on the
very further monitor it has the M best
logo and down below that you guys can
see the little stand now there's really
not too much this stand whatsoever it is
very very basic and in fact one of the
things about this monitor that I just
found to be like kind of know is that
you can't adjust it whatsoever I mean
you can you know tilt it a little bit
forward tilt it a little bit back
whoopty-doo p you can't raise the height
adjustment so if you really have a place
where it's not fitting exactly where you
want it to be you're gonna have to mess
with it to get it that way because you
can adjust the height whatsoever now
also you cannot see it but inside this
monitor there are
- - watt speakers one on the right one
on the left you get stereo sound now as
you guys can see we tested these
speakers out in gaming sure they work I
mean they'll get you by and play games
and if you don't have any speakers or
any headphones around you'll be able to
play your games and they sound ok but
when you're trying to listen to music
wow listen to this it sounds like you're
on the moon in a tin can and I don't
mean in a good way either I don't know
what's going on with that but music just
does not sound good on these speakers so
if you have this monitor in your planet
listening to rock out and listen to all
your cool songs uh you might want to
rethink that one
now this particular monitor also
features a TN panel with a thousand to
one contrast ratio 350 CD on the
brightness 170 degree viewing angle one
point six seven million colors which i
think is pretty much everything out
there the aspect ratio in this
particular monitor is 16 to 9 now as we
spin around to the back of the m best
gaming monitor you guys can see it's
very simplistic back here you have a
place to plug in your power cable you
have an audio jack you have a DVI
connection an HDMI connection and a
display port connection very basic stuff
the monitor can also be vase amount on
your wall if you want it to be so now
inside the box you get the power cable
you get an audio cable you get a display
port cable and that is really about it
watching movies everything actually
looks totally cool even though TN panels
aren't the absolute best with color it
still looks fine for watching movies and
doing that kind of stuff
I wouldn't recommend this particular
monitor for editing videos and doing
stuff like that because the color gamut
on this just isn't that great you'd
probably want a different type of
monitor for that type of thing now
playing games though that's where this
particular product shines because TN
panels are made for gaming all the
colors are bright all the colors are
vivid they don't look washed out
whatsoever and you guys can see games
look really good on this particular
monitor and really at the end of the day
the main feature of your monitor is
obviously what you're gonna see why your
game
especially on well a gaming monitor and
you guys can see the games do look
really nice
okay so what exactly does 299 get you
well with the M best money you get a
27-inch monitor it's got a TN scream 165
Hertz refresh time you can have one
millisecond for the response time these
are really good features you do won't
have to put it in this overdrive mode
however to get that it has free sync
2560 by 1440 almost no bezel whatsoever
you can vase amount it to a wall the
pictures and everything on it they don't
look washed out for gaming it's actually
a really good solid monitor for the
price now however along with these
things there are a few little cabinets
about this particular monitor first of
all it has almost no adjustability
whatsoever adjusting the monitor is like
just simply tilting up and down which
really isn't Jack diddly doo doo in the
land of monitors we all know that you
know you should be able to raise it up
and down do some kiltie stuff maybe not
a portrait thing or anything like that
cuz that's irrelevant on a gaming
monitor but at least some height
adjustment and stuff like that
another thing the speakers ah I mean I
guess you know if you were stranded
somewhere and you just needed to hear
the game you were playing it does that
but when you're listening to music it
sounds like you're listening to music on
the moon through a tin can and that was
pretty pathetic Slyke we tried Pandora
and other services and this listen to
music I was just like ah really did not
like that whatsoever
so those are the pros those are the cons
at 299 if you look online then when you
look at other monitors that had these
same type of features this is a very
competitive product for what it is now
weird thing is though you know I don't
know if you guys probably know you got a
lot of guys whatever this goes like a
song called a horse with no name as soon
as bad America well this minor kind of
trips me up because it's the monitor
with no name it's just the M best that's
it the M best monitor the M best monitor
and that is it there's no name it's not
likely you know the M best killer
destroyer game you monitor the monitor
that it'll kick butt and make you have
multiple children with multiple pretty
women no it's not like that whatsoever
and one other point to fact out now
yep one of the back to point out point
to fact out it's same thing point to
fact out in fact to point out whatever
so check it out this thing right here is
from Leo Bogner in this particular tool
this measures the lag time of a monitor
and honestly this particular monitor was
one of the fastest that we have ever
tested here at Tech at a mod or at Seco
tomorrow I don't know what's going on
I'm I got so many thoughts in my head of
my I'm trying to go through it slow down
Zen be very number let's all take a deep
breath together okay now Zen I'm back
okay so with this particular product
that we'll have a link down below you
guys can check one out for yourself this
measures the lag time and at eight
milliseconds this is really unbelievably
fast it's a thousand milliseconds in
every second so think about it eight of
those which is really not even a 1/2 of
a breath of air is that so it's
absolutely nothing so at the end of the
day I think it's a pretty solid monitor
there are some things about it that
could be better you know it does come
with enough stuff in the box to get you
going you get your power cord you do get
a display port cable if you have an HDMI
monitor you're gonna have to buy that
cable it did not come in the box so
there you have it we'll also have a link
down below if you guys want to check out
one of these for yourself you can do so

channel I would love to have you
