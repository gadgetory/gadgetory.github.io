back to tech tomorrow I'm elric your
host and today we're going to be talking
about how to test your video card
whether it be in your laptop your low
end PC or your high end pc now for many
years there's been a company out there
called futuremark and they've had lots
and lots of iterations of their 3dmark
software they've had all kinds vonage 11
now today we're taking a look at their
latest iteration which basically cuts
all the fat off and just calls it 3d
mark now now let's talk about actual
video card testing if you're only
talking about testing your particular
unit which at your home this is very
easily done you can just download a
bunch of games and a bunch of things out
there run fraps or whatever and you can
come to your own conclusions if you are
however planning on running some kind of
test bed that's much more work you've
got to go in create a spreadsheet have
all the numbers all the drivers written
down you got to run multi iterations of
the testing at least three times you got
to balance all these scores and you
pretty much have to have a test system
dedicated to this for testing a laptops
it gets a lot more tricky than that but
if you want to test video cards like
most people do this doesn't get that
hard you just got a big sleep set up a
good test station and then use that test
station for everything that you do and
keep track of everything that you're
doing I would also if you are able to
have one both based on AMD and Intel so
you can compare the results because I
know a lot of you guys are sending me
emails going hey how do I start my own
tech channel what do I do to start my
own tech channel well to start your own
tech channel one of the very first
things you're going to have to do is
develop the way you do your testing and
then how you're going to present your
testing it's really hard to do in video
format that's why I healy they've been
trying to really just do a lot more
writing but for you guys out there who
want to do it this is the first thing
you need to do develop yourself a solid
test system keep it the same keep track
of everything that you're doing so that
you can balance all your scores out now
today we're going to be taking a look at
3d mark they have three different tests
that are on here and all these are for
different things they have a directx
11 a directx 10 and a directx 9 test so
with that said let's jump in and let's
talk about those before we get into
testing starting off for the DirectX 9
they have ice storm it's for mobile
devices at entry-level pcs basically
because it's direct next 9 which has
been out for a few years next up we see
cloud gate this is for notebook and a
home pcs meaning it's basically for the
latest notebooks and a home pcs not the
highest end stuff last up fire strike
this is the directx 11 for a
high-performance gaming pcs and this is
what we're going to be running today
there are a lot of different ways that
you can run 3dmark if you're just trying
to compare two people out there you can
go ahead and run tests and try to
maintain your scores we run a custom
test up here on top you can see we click
the custom tab then we go in here and we
create the resolution and then we run
our test three times balance those
scores out so with that said though
let's jump in and let's check out the
four different tests that they have in
fire strike directx 11 on 3d mark
you
you
alright folks so there you have it the
latest 3d mark directx11 fire strike
that's right thing looks pretty cool the
thing I kind of tripped out is usually
the roller test usually always had some
kind of an accompanying music most the
time this one's is pretty quiet
throughout the things so we added our
own little soundtrack there hope you
guys dug that so this is basically what
i would consider part 1 we're going to
show you a bunch of different tests as
we go by in the next few weeks on
running all the different tests on
testing video cards if you guys want
show me the comments below I'll even
show you how we go in and we run this
stuff and we make all our score sheets
and all that it's kind of complicated
and stuff but if you know how to run
microsoft stuff you'll be just fine just
an excel sheet you just got to bring it
all out there and keep everything
maintained so let me see your comments
below like usual I hope that you guys
like this video if so show me that video
love and hit that like button that's
right and I appreciate you guys being
here and like usual if you're not
subscribed make sure you are so so you
don't miss anything going on here at
tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
