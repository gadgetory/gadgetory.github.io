hey what's up Tech fans Elric here with
buddy the doggone tech of tomorrow mr.
Jesus is on to editing and now we have
mr. Richie behind the camera and today's
video is sponsored and brought to you by
the people over at Pacific Tech and
we're going to be checking out from
these folks is a phablet that's a
hundred and thirty nine dollars it has a
ten inch IPS screen it's not quite ten
inches it's nine point six inches so
it's almost quite ten inches
it also features one hundred and forty
nine pixels per inch which is a little
bit kind of crazy on the crazy side but
it is an IPS panel it's nine point six
inches 1280 by 800 resolution those are
some of the features inside the box
I guess we'll check that out first see
what comes in the box and talked about
those features and at the end of the
video we'll ask you guys some questions
and see what's you the fans out there
think about this tablet and would you
purchase it or were some suggestions
that you would make to the company to
make you more inclined to buy their
phablet so with that said let's jump on
in and let's check out the Pacific tech
9.6 inch fabric all right so you
diehards out there who like the unboxing
and everything here's the box pretty
exciting right
one picture another not a damn thing
else and they were really cool with us
they actually sent us this cool case as
well I don't know maybe they'll give it
to you guys I'm sure if you mention the
video or you know something to them they
might be nice and throw it in for you
because it's actually a quite a decent a
little case for the old phablet there so
but we'll get back to in a minute
ooh got him right the Chet did you hear
the smack awesome I'm getting better at
this you know let's go ahead and shake
the box
shake shake shake forget of the books oh
it also comes with two extra screen
protectors so that's pretty dang cool
cuz uh I don't know what you guys but
sometimes I'm putting those damn things
on I can't help but good frickin bubbles
and I hate that crap some dudes at the
mall though dude I swear you go there
just like we put this on like it's
nothing but I'm not one of those guys
we'll set that off to the side
we got inside the box here here okay so
we got the fat butt itself let me jump
it off the side though and see what's
underneath here are there any pennies to
be unveiled okay so the box is falling
apart as we see here so we do get a set
of nice white headphones so I got to
worry about that you'll be able to
listen to your music or talk on your
little phone whatever you're doing there
with your SIM card then we've got the
tools to go ahead and remove all your
SIM cards and in there and do that kind
of stuff so you get the little tool you
also get the little charging USB cable
they have an additional also different
type of USB charging cables will set
that stuff out of the way
that's what comes in the box for the
unboxing help me check the camera but
what the hell alright then
so now let's pull out the phablet itself
now it's pretty cool looking front like
I said 9.6 inch IPS screen the only
caveat that I feel is at 149 pixels per
inch is kind of like hey whoa and if
there's anything that I want to actually
reach at the command say I'd say man
come on Pacific tech let's put a little
bit just a little bit better screen on
there because to me screen is very
important aspect because you're staring
at it all the damn time in the back it's
all gold - Pacific tech logo and all
that stuff on the back we see a 5
megapixel little camera and on the front
we see a 2 megapixel camera this is also
kind of very little specs compared to
some of the stuff that's out there in
the market let's just face that then
right here is also where your SIM cards
go you notice that there are two
different SIM cards located on the back
and you could have one for America and
one for traveling abroad or you could
even have it for two different carriers
and for kids maybe Fedder you or for all
adults like I said I think this will be
like a perfect thing for them to do that
there's also two speakers located on the
bottom so the sound is actually not that
bad compared to living you know the
sound is actually one of the better
quality things about the Pacific tech
and located on the bottom we see the
microphone it's a pretty decent place
for it and on the right hand side we see
the headphone jack the power button and
the toggle for volume control this
Babbitt also runs on android 5.1
lollipop and as far as battery life goes
internally there's a five thousand
milliamp battery it's really kind of
weird though because it says that it
takes six hours to charge and then
offers six hours of battery life as far
as what's powering this phablet
features an a7 quad core processor -
running at 1.5 and to running at 1.2
gigahertz and these are running
simultaneously supposedly to give you
the best performance as far as personal
usage goes everything that you can do on
any other Android tablet out there you
can do on this tablet everything there
you can download all their games the
Play Store all that kind of stuff the
only thing that I saw and I think that
everybody would play around to degreed
is that it was a little bit sluggish in
some of the stuff that we were doing but
then again the price is only 139 dollars
and since we're talking about that stuff
the only thing that I think right now
that's kind of head-to-head competitor
with this is like an Amazon fire tablet
now those things run with their own type
of skin it's actually a wrapper it's not
true Android but as far as the prices go
and the way they operate I think that's
kind of running head and head now the
only thing that this is actually better
as it does run like I said pure Android
so anything that has to do with Android
like I said previously you're going to
be able to do on this phablet but
honestly the biggest feature about this
phablet all the way across the board is
that it can be used and double as your
phone by using the SIM card and that's a
pretty damn cool feature and although
the caveat here in the United States is
is not we don't use as much GSM as you
know the other rest of the world does
and so that is something for American
buyers might want to go boom but you can
still use it it just doesn't do 4G you
can do 2 G 3G it works with all the
known providers and stuff now as far as
storage goes internally there's 16
gigabytes that's non removable but
they're also really cool and they give
you a 32 gigabyte removable storage unit
which is awesome and last but not least
here's what the Pacific tech phablet
looks like inside of the providing case
I think it looks pretty cool what do you
guys think it's okay there you guys have
it the complete breakdown of what the
Pacific tech 9.6 and phablet is all
about now me personally the price at
today's market at 139 dollars it's
almost throwaway tech I mean I know it's
not quite throwaway now there's some
people that are important really like
when I do well under 30 bucks are you
out of your mind Elric but
honestly in the overall market that's a
very little price now this particular
product I think is going to be great for
those people that
older and just want something that's
very simple to use some of the things
that aren't the best for the USA is that
it uses GSM and it doesn't support 4G so
using it for your phone
specifically in the USA is a little bit
limited but if you travel a lot and
you're not worried about like you know
losing your $500 tablet on some plane
well then hey 139 you know phablet is a
pretty awesome product but like usual I
always want to hear what you guys have
to say tell me what you guys think what
things you guys would think are great
about it what do you guys think would
make you go hey hmm and what they could
do to make any changes for you guys to
purchase their fabric because like I
said today's video was sponsored by the
people over at Pacific tech so I'm our
buddy a dog like I said mr. Richie
behind the cabin er in the cabin er he's
behind the cabin er what's a Kevin er
but you see behind the camera that thing
that you're like looking through right
now so like usual all the information
will be down there below that like
button hope you guys like this video
