welcome back once again to the channel
so there have been a lot of 1060 s that
have come out you guys are some missed
the train this is Pascal tip set you
know lots of good features basically
it's the entry level right now for
Nvidia they're coming to market about
$300 some a little bit lower depending
on what you're getting now the
particular we're looking at today is
from ZOTAC now in the past we've seen
their amp Extreme Edition cards and
usually those cards are titled like the
fastest card of its class now we're
looking at their amp edition now this
isn't the fastest of the fast but this
card has a lot of nice features and it's
also pretty compact it's not quite 10
inches long like we've seen some of the
crazy other cards and it's not quite
small enough to be a mini card it's
somewhere right in between so with that
said let's real quick let's jump in
let's take a look at the card close-up
let's take a look at its features let's
see how it does in the testing how cool
it isn't at the end of the day hey is
this something you want to spend your
hard-earned cash in let's check it out
at first glance in my eyes the card
looks kind of transformer II from the
way the cooling fans and everything are
down the top you can see there are two
90 millimeter fans and the look of the
card like I said is pretty futuristic
looking now if we put the card over to
its side you guys can see there are two
distinct heat pipes these are both made
of copper and then down below that we
see the PCI strip so move the card
around to the back you guys can see
there's more of the aluminum heat fins
and as we flip the card around to the
other side first off you can see the
first button that's the end of one of
the heat pipes on the other side you see
the same thing in the center we see the
zotac logo above that we see the single
six pin power connector and it's
recommended that you have a 400 watt
power supply because there's a 120 watt
draw power through that single six pin
but a little disappointment comes as I
flip it around the back side as you guys
can see there is no backplate whatsoever
back plates are becoming the standard so
tech pay attention to this because folks
out there like back plates I like them
they keep my knuckles from getting all
roughed up a been bitten on the card
itself hitting on that car distracted
not like that but you know I'm saying
alright anyways we flip it around the
end we have a single DVID
single hdmi 2.0 and three display ports
all standard stuff and as far as how the
card size is in its length is eight
point two seven inches its height is
five inches and it also features a dual
slot design like most cards now some of
the features of the car that we don't
talk about in the actual specs are
exactly what goes the technology like
these guys called their coin solution
ice storm now the ice storm means that's
their solution for keeping this card
running cool they also have a thing
called freeze which makes the card run
in completely silent mode if you don't
need the Panza spent so at some point or
another you're running some weird game
it's not taking too much out of your
card your fans may not be spinning so
don't freak out that's just part of the
technology keeping the card running and
keeping it running smooth for you folks
now as far as the base clocks going this
card the base clock is 1556 megahertz
and the boost clock of the card is 1771
megahertz and although the card says
1771 megahertz we actually got better
boost clocks in that as you'll see on
our video also the card features 8
gigabytes of gddr5 memory 192 bit memory
interface all that good stuff so this is
pretty much a fully featured card want
to apologize once again until this folks
out there watch my three gigabyte video
I honestly thought the cards had the
same specs other than the size of the
memory I didn't really think they cut
the specs down on just don't like that
either but with that said though let's
real quick let's jump in let's check out
our test system and then rock out to the
benchmark song and see how the car does
and how hard it runs for you folks let's
go for you folks who follow the channel
we've been using the same test system
for quite a while an i7 6700 K we keep
it at turbo mode at 4.4 gigahertz we're
using an asrock motherboard we've also
got 16 gigabytes of rip Jaji skilled
memory everything was done on Windows 10
with the latest patches and the latest
drivers available for today's testing
now let's check
all right so there you have it the zotac
amp edition gtx 1060 card now we were
able to see this card running at about
close to 80 Celsius most of the time our
boost clock was between 1815 and 1820 so
it's a decent boost clock on it we
didn't really do any overclocking yet at
all that would be for another video but
if you're looking for a card that's well
priced has a good warranty has a lot of
features you know these guys put a lot
of effort into their card you know from
their ice storm cooling on it all the
nice things that they put into that
stuff from their firestorm doing for
overclocking and stuff if you guys know
about ZOTAC you know what you're looking
for a lot of people out there still go
man like is otech good but yeah Zota has
been making great cards fears so if
you've never heard of ZOTAC what's
served before trust me on this we've
been working with these guys for years
their cards are made very very well the
only thing I really like about the card
is the no backplate at all I don't know
why people can't put a backplate in the
cards Oh Tech I mean what the heck man
just a few more bucks nowadays the
backplate is good to go you guys know I
can't do my tapping knuckles thing on it
otherwise I'll have bloody knuckles look
like I just got in a fight with someone
but beyond that the cards a nice card
runs pretty cool has a lot of
overclocking potential inside of the
card I also right now write live I live
on a desert so it's pretty hot inside my
house the advent temperature my house is
usually about 80 so I mean 80 degrees
Fahrenheit not Celsius though so it's
pretty hot inside my house all the time
so that's pretty much it if you guys
want to get one these cards for yourself
we'll have information down but like
button you guys know what to do I'm
Network you guys been watching teka
tomorrow we got a lot more stuff coming
up including battles of overclocking
cards so we'll see you back here in the
channel for more action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
