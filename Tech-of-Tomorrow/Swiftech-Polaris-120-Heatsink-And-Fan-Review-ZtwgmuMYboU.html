again with TECA tomorrow here for you
we've got another review this is the
Swift tech Polaris 120 heatsink for your
CPU
well here we have for you the Swift tech
Polaris 120 it's already set up on the
test bench and we've had it running for
some time now it's been doing prime95
and we have the AMD phenom 2 1090t
processor that's a 6 core processor
running at 3.2 gigahertz and right now
it's currently running at about 38
degrees celsius and prime95 has been
running for a good half hour almost 40
minutes now so you can see that this
heat sink actually does a really good
job keeping the processor cool even when
it's running prime95 which stresses out
the processor to its full extent does
not run all that wobbly we do have
running right now at maximum it runs
anywhere from 750 to 2500 rpm depending
on how you have it set up on the
motherboard you can run it off of your
motherboard header or if you want you
can even plug it into a 12 volt molex
connector that's entirely up to you
personally if it were me I would
definitely have this running off of the
motherboard header that way you can ramp
up a ramp ramp down the speed of the fan
depending on what you're doing it does
run a lot quieter when you have it
running off the motherboard this has
been the swiftech polaris 120 heatsink
and fan one other thing that I have to
mention is that this band comes this
heatsink and fan comes in at about sixty
dollars retail which for its price is
actually really really good this is
going to give you performance in the
range of heat sinks that cost anywhere
from fifteen to twenty dollars more so
what you're getting is something that
really comes in at a good price and is
going to give you good value for your
money thank you so much for watching
