title says you guys can get the code for
Windows 10 Pro for under $15 and today's
video is sponsored and brought to you by
s CD key now these guys have a great
website with all kinds of different
games all kinds of different
applications and they have wonderful
game codes for great prices as well as
the Windows 10 Pro key that we're gonna
be bringing you guys today now for you
guys out there who for some reason don't
happen to know what Windows 10 is I you
guys are probably living on the moon I
think most people really know what it is
but the big question is most of the time
if you go over and you look at the
Microsoft website to get Windows 10 Pro
it's gonna cost you about a hundred and
thirty nine to a hundred and forty nine
dollars to buy the license and
everything from them that's very
expensive really expensive now I know
your next questions gonna be but Eric
how do we get you know Windows 10
without buying it for them well check
this out
wove link down below well you can
actually download the ISO you can make
yourself the CD buy the key for my CD
key and install it and be up and running
Windows 10 Pro on your computer for
under $15 just like the title said no
clickbait no BS whatsoever now currently
over SCB key they have the Windows 10
Pro key for $14 but what's even better
yet is that we have a 10% off code that
we'll have down below as well so you not
only to get the that $14 cheap price you
get it for even less I probably could
have titled the video get it for less
than 13 dollars and still probably been
right in the ballpark but hey let's just
keep it as real as possible now it's
very easy to purchase the code you just
hop over onto their website find the
exact product that you want click on it
going to purchase it add that 10% code
in and then voila you've got your key
and it's at such a dirt cheap price it's
almost like giving Windows 10 Pro away
and all of the game keys and stuff that
you guys see you guys know follow the
channel every week I give game codes
away all the time a lot of these keys I
get directly from them
because their keys are really good I
personally and honestly I can say this
without any money whatsoever I've been
using their keys I've bought in so many
windows keys up there it's just
mind-boggling about a lot of those from
those guys I just I discovered them
about probably about seven months ago
and ever since I discovered them I've
bought a lot of stuff from them I
haven't had any problems the knee codes
no issues I haven't to pick up my phone
or do anything now sometimes when you're
not doing a fresh install of Windows and
you're doing an upgrade you're trying to
upgrade to Windows 10 you might have to
use the phone service to call in and get
the number authenticated but for me if
you're making a system from scratch as
soon as you enter the serial number in
you're totally good to go when you boot
up the computer and windows will be
activated if you've got online service
and you'll be absolutely good to go and
yes these codes are absolutely 100%
legal legit codes these people would not
be paying video people like me and
others on the Internet to bring you guys
commercial with illicit codes that would
just be totally insane so know that when
you buy from a CD key you can buy with
confidence so honestly if you want to
get Windows 10 and real quick I'll just
tell you if you're running Windows 7
Windows 8 or those older lets's honestly
and if you have a really old video card
it might not matter to you but if you
have any of the newer video cards and
you're a hardcore gamer you want Windows
10 because it supports the latest
DirectX 12 if you use in the other row
Isis it's not fully supporting that and
in fact I think just dx11 has to support
it down below that so if you want dx12
you want to play the latest games
you're gonna need Windows 10 so like
usual I'll have a link down below to
their website we'll have a key down
there for 10% off and we even have
another video coming up with some more
stuff from these folks in a little while
so makes you guys stay tuned to the
channel but for now hey if you want
Windows 10 you don't want to pay a lot
of money get it for under 15 at SCD key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
