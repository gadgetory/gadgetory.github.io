on tech of tomorrow now I know this case
has been out for a little while I
actually totally spaced in this damn
thing was in my storage center and
totally forgot about it apologies
should've done this a long time ago but
anyways this is the half MX mid tower
case this thing's selling on the market
anywhere between one hundred and sixty
dollars and two hundred and sixty
dollars depending on where you buy it
from so what is this thing all about
well it's a mid tower fully black case
that has lots and lots of options you
can use up to triple SLI or triple
crossfire configurations inside of the
case so that said let's start looking
around the box and talking about a few
of the features that are on this box
so let's start off by talking about the
specifications we'll talk about the
materials used and how it looks it says
for appearance it has a mesh synthetic
look and its case is made of steel as
far as the dimensions of this thing go
it's 252 by five hundred thirty by five
by five hundred and seventy nine
millimeters which equals nine point nine
by twenty point nine by twenty two point
eight inches got all that good stuff the
weights in this ten point three
kilograms or twenty two point seven
pounds what's not that heavy whatsoever
as far as the motherboards it takes
micro ATX ATX and e-atx
which means it takes the big big ass
motherboards like the sniper series from
gigabyte now as far as it's five and a
quarter Bay's this thing has three of
them as far as 3.5 inch bays that says
there are eight hidden six and as X
docking by 2x docking is supposed to be
in the front of the case and allows you
for swapping out your SATA drives as far
as the 2.5 inch drive bay that says
there are nine six converted from the
3.5 inch bays and two converted from the
X docking one behind the motherboard
tray what's really weird is this case is
you can actually use an SSD and store it
behind the motherboard I don't know how
I like that idea never be like it to it
but hey maybe it'll work we'll check it
out in the build this is just the
unboxing as far as the i/o panel since
we have USB 3.0 by two USB 2.0 by two
audio in and out and says supports HD
audio and it obviously is an LED switch
for the front fan expansion slots 8 by
one we've talked about this before this
is on the rear i/o now as far as the
cooling system goes this case comes out
of the box with the front 200 millimeter
LED fan comes the top 200 millimeter fan
with options for others rear has a 140
millimeter fan it can be converted to
120 millimeter fan the side has a 200
millimeter fan and there's an HDD fan as
well power supply types says hey use the
standard ATX ps2 you guys can see the
rest of the box right there let's move
on and actually do the unboxing and take
a look at this thing sorry folks so like
usual I'm going to make a slice here
with my knife this case is actually
exactly as it came shipped so any of the
damage in the Box everything you
and thank the folks over at UPS because
that's where this came from it came from
the lovely folks over at UPS obviously
the other good folks at cooler hawkster
but do them first alright so here we go
Fuli popping up it is that nice new car
smell or that new PC smell as I like to
call it go ahead an ace the knife down
there turn this bad boy upside down and
remove it out of the case here we go all
right so I'm going to take the case box
cameraman can focus on the Box real
quick while I take it as a toss across
the room maybe you can focus on as I
toss across the room so here it goes the
beginning toss across no room there we
go I love that stuff all right taking
the little panel off right here he'll
write the cameraman right at him yeah
take that cameraman cameraman dude dude
all right put this thing out of here one
alright we have the half XM mid tower
little installation instruction guide
here it's important
hopefully you can read if not have
somebody read it for you right so did
the job being a cabman to get those well
facing man dangerous job alright this
thing looks really nice so we'll start
off over here by looking at the front of
the case two USB 3.0 headphone
microphone two USB 2.0 here are the
first five and a quarter Bay's now these
the babies we talked about before
nice little Hut's Aquabase here right in
the front not bad not bad at all
guys you see the front there so that's a
nice little things in there no colors
wasted let's move this bad boy at the
top right here we have our start restart
power all up here dirty clean you can
accidentally I like that sometimes I
have some hit cases and do it here's a
little storage space here okay so you're
gonna have two fans now also inside this
case we'll get to that mitt but you can
actually put a dual rad so you put a
dual radiator for water point or you can
put a single in it in the rear look at
that as we move on let's flip the round
before you actually take it apart take a
look back now look at the back of the
case we'll start up at the bottom where
you can see the power supply is going to
go right here at the bottom I like them
the power supply goes there then we have
all the bays right here this is where
all your cards are going to be this is
the 8.1 expansion here's actually an
extra little shield right here there's a
fan inside of here you can see there's
holes here for water cooling I just
knocked one out but they're very easily
put back in but I'll have to get to that
when I get inside the case Cameron get
in here you can see these little screws
little funky thumbs I'm going to remove
them all it's right here I'm taking
tomorrow we get down and dirty with
these cases we're gonna strip it down
negative this sounds kind of kinky
doesn't it naked even like naked juice
that's not even a prop I really do it's
good stuff
now remove the screws let's start
dissecting this thing oops didn't mean
to do that here's the back panel them
can you go ahead and use that bad boy
set it over here the other side now also
I just want to mention that you can get
this case they have it as an option of
getting it with a window I did not get
the windowed one I feel cheated I will
complain to my sales rep non-scary
filtered mystery airflow but still won't
get too dirty
ouch there was a sharp spot on there hey
hmm doctor does not like shower spots
but we'll get that out of the way also
there's an additional right here on top
I believe this is going to remove the
entire top piece
so we'll uh the top comes off plenty of
room for a dual rad or for two fans
right here on top you can see there is a
I use the word big-ass fan a bath that's
right it may not be the technical term
but it's a bath trust me it's a big-ass
fan so let's take a look at the back
here is the back the big-ass fan you're
gonna have two of those in here or you
can put a radiator in here me personally
all be going radiator that's just my
style I like everything to be liquid
cool that's right here is the
accessories kit right here he'll go
ahead and take this out of here as well
these are gonna be able to list the
parts you need zip ties screws and such
all inside of here all nice plastic
baggie don't get any funny ideas alright
so now let's take a look at the inside
of the case all your harness wiring is
located right here your power supply
will be located down here if plenty room
for support here all the bays pop open
very easily all completely tool free all
your drive bays up here simply lock
closed up open up lock makes it very
easy I'm gonna try to get this over here
so the camera can zoom in on if you can
really see this gonna be hard to see in
there but you can see inside of the case
right here are additional connectors
these are all for the powered SATA in
the front of the case that we talked
about earlier so you have with your
power and your lines all here you can
just wire them to your motherboard how
you want to be now let's talk about
cable management back here in the back I
put my entire hand back here we have
slots right here so we didn't run all
the cables back through there the fan
wire harness is here this particular
piece right here goes to actually the
top piece or the front piece right there
you can use your choice wherever you
want to use it I'm gonna do grommets is
right here spin it back around again
they also set that inside of here you
can put an SSD behind the hard drive so
I imagine it's going to go right here
I'm personally not a big fan of that
I'm sure that some people might want to
use it but I'm just not a big fan of
that so that's pretty much it folks you
guys seen us receive it take it out of
its box strip it down to its bare
essentials this is the new half XM from
the people over at Coolermaster I'm our
Farris here on TECA tomorrow look for a
full review over on ww2 tomorrow comm
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
