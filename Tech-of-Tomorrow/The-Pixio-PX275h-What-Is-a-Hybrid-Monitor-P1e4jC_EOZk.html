happening welcome to tech of tomorrow
today we've got something pretty
interesting on the table for you guys to
check out now we know that in a lot of
ways some technology is hit a brick wall
so you're gonna see technology instead
of maybe going forward you're gonna see
technology going sideways and that's
kind of what today's product is instead
of focusing on one direct area either
being gaming or productivity the monitor
that we're going to be checking out
today from pixie oh it's the px 27 5h
now this is a 27-inch monitor that's
made for productivity and gaming and it
has some pretty cool features and comes
to market for about two hundred and
fifty nine dollars so it fits really
good in the price range that it is for
the features now you guys are gonna know
this right off the bat I mean come on it
looks like any other monitor out there
when you just look at it from the
outside most of them all look the same
what really matters is the technology no
of the screen and then the features
obviously now one thing cool about this
monitor is is it features an IPS panel
2560 by 1440 P resolution it has a
hundred and seventy eight degree viewing
angle 95 Hertz on the refresh rate all
four millisecond response time and I
know some people are gonna go like oh
man it's four milliseconds that's not a
gaming monitor but you know four
milliseconds is such a short time period
that it's definitely qualifies for a
gaming monitor I mean it's a thousand
milliseconds you know to make a second
so if you think four milliseconds are
gonna affect anything in gaming now your
eyes would have to be like a computer
you'd have to be like Commander data
from Star Trek Enterprise now this
particular bad boy also has a thousand
to one contrast ratio 350 CD brightness
and it also check this out free sync
technology and you guys know now that
you can use free sync technology you can
use it with AMD cards and infuse it with
Nvidia cards so things are changing with
so it's pretty cool this monitor also
has HDR options you guys know what this
is high dynamic range it's darker darks
brighter colors all that good stuff and
it does have low
blue light settings as well there's
quite a few in there so you can adjust
it to match however you like it to be
now well I really like about this
particular monitor though is it supports
a hundred percent of the srgb color
gamut space which means that if you're
doing editing and stuff like that and
you're using Photoshop or Adobe it's
going to match exactly the colors that
you need so for doing editing and that
kind of stuff it's actually a really
solid monitor now just as far as gaming
and general colors and stuff like that
it does cover 95% of the DCI p3 spectrum
like most monitors the menu controls on
the bottom right there very easy
accessible you can just jump in there
and change all the things around to
however you want it to be I mean all you
guys know what this is it's pretty much
the same thing that every monitor has
out there you've got your on-screen
display and you change the stuff around
nothing new there now the bezel around
the front of the monitor it's not giant
size but it's not completely small
either so if you're gonna use you know
multiple monitors like you know you know
three monitor sequence you're gonna see
a little bit of a gap because you're
gonna time that little bezel times two
it's gonna get bigger it's not terrible
but it's definitely not the best that
you can get if you want to use a
multi-monitor setup now the pixie opx 27
5h also features two three watt speakers
now you're like wow three watts yeah
these aren't the absolute best speakers
in the world they are a little bit tinny
but you know you you guys know that
these type of speakers are just there
for you to use if you just want to surf
the net and do stuff like that if you're
a hardcore gamer and stuff like that
you're obviously gonna have better
speakers a really nice set of headphones
but hey sometimes if you're just a guy
who's gonna get a monitor you do light
gaming but you do a lot of editing and
stuff like that that little sound stuff
on there's really not gonna be any big
deal because like I said if you want
better audio you just grab a nice set of
headphones are some better speakers
another thing is I know a lot of gamers
are gonna be like okay dude it doesn't
have a hundred and forty-four Hertz
refresh rate so you know that that just
sucks man well a 95 Hertz refresh rate
is really nice now yes obviously it's
not as grand as having 144 Hertz refresh
rate but still it's above most of the
standard refresh rates and shouldn't
cause too many problems or strain on the
eyes now as far as the lag time goes on
this monitor we're using the Leo Bogner
tool which is a really easy tool of a
link down below for that and this
monitor features a nine point one lag
time which really isn't anything in the
whole scope of things but here is the
biggest factor of all look at this
monitor I mean it has really solid
colors whether you're surfing the net
whether you're playing a game no matter
what you're doing all the colors in this
monitor are very bright all of the
blacks are very black so with the HDR
technology you know the lighting and the
way the monitor lights up things is a
lot different there's the bulb
technology and everything is a lot
different there's a lot more control of
that so that makes your picture just
look a lot better overall and you'll
notice if you actually watch a movie or
something on Netflix and it has HDR you
know technology you'll see it on the
little block there says HDR you're gonna
definitely get a better picture with a
monitor that has that feature on it now
taking a look at the back of the monitor
one thing you guys are gonna notice
right off the bat is that the stand
doesn't do much whatsoever you can tilt
the monitor back and forth and that is
it you can't raise it up and down you
can't spin it around for portrait
nothing like that so if those particular
features are something that you're
looking for this might not be for you
but a lot of people that really doesn't
matter them they have their monitor set
on a shelf it's the perfect you know
space for them so at that point it would
be a moot point
all together now for connectivity you've
got a 24 volt DC power port USB 2.0 2
HDMI ports a 1.4 and a 2.0 you have a
DisplayPort 1.2 and you also have an
audio jack for headphones or using
external speakers now inside the box you
get the monitor you get an HDMI cable
you get some tool
to put the monitor together and you get
the instruction manual you also get the
power cord and power brick plus
obviously the stand so what do you guys
think honestly I think for the price of
being two hundred and fifty nine dollars
I went online and I checked out a bunch
of other monitors that had the features
and the price range and for this
particular price range this monitor sits
in a really nice pocket there were a
couple that we saw that were $189 but
they didn't have the exact same good
specs as this particular monitor and
when I guess I personally liked best
about this monitor is the fact that if
you really do want to do content
creation and editing you're definitely
gonna want a really good monitor to do
that on and this will do gaming just
fine I know there's gonna be some
naysayers out there gonna say oh you
know Elric it's four milliseconds dude
it sucks for gaming but you know this is
an IPS panel
everyone knows IPS panels have the
absolute best color the VA panels the TN
panels they just do not compete
whatsoever they have other things about
being faster maybe some contrast but
overall everybody really wants an IPS
monitor at the end of the day and the
fact that four milliseconds really
doesn't mean anything you get a monitor
that you can game on you get a monitor
you can do print activity on the
speakers yeah I mean they're not the
greatest thing in the world obviously
their built-in speakers they don't move
three watts you know they sound a little
tinny you know if you're gonna really
want to watch movies and enjoy the audio
quality then obviously should probably
purchase something a little bit better
to listen to but in a pinch they will
obviously work so there you have it
folks the pixie opx 27 5h coming to
market for $259 like usual we will have
a link down below for more information
so you can click on that link go check
stuff out also you guys can support the
channel in many different ways we have a
patreon account we also have a free
amazon link down below if you even try
amazon for 30 days we get credit so
there's lots of way to support the site
even without really spending any money
I'm Mel Eric thanks for watching Tecna
tomorrow we've got a lot more tech
coming up so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
