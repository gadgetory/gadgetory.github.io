tomorrow youtube channel i might in
their host today we are looking at
something very very interesting from the
people over at thermaltake people have
now made that water to point though
extremely on i mean extreme I mean
extreme we are currently using these to
power and pull our tanks in Soviet
Mother Russia let's right look on to any
of the hoods and draw a nice cool
looking thanks and we have these inside
keeping them all so the padding
pyrrolidone let's hop in and let's it
take this box the sea was inside
okay like any Google boxing or the start
of a big box and our Russian made no
never mind china made china-made
survival all right anyways with my China
made survival knife that's right you
guys can see this one I'm going to come
at you with it it's very long very
trusty slices and dices the end comes
off get that I think you guys can see
this the old end comes off right here
and then all of your survival goodies
are inside pull these little bad boys
out of the bag if I can that'll stick it
in there all kinds of stuff in their
needles thread matches you know all the
good growing boy needs to survive so
stick that back in there but i think
it's just pretty cool anyways you guys
you to you guys like nice oh and check
it out compass you have a be so no
matter where I'm lost I just look to the
north star man and get my little ass
home leg on there thermaltake water 2
point 0 extreme I know a lot of you
people out there you guys talk
about closed loop water stuff for those
people who are meek and they don't want
to get water anything won't be absolute
certain there's no problem at all at all
with using a closed-loop product because
if you're really a beginner you don't
know what you're doing but you want to
have the benefits of water cooling a
closed-loop system like this one is a
pretty good solution most people know
that this is basically an Aztec remake
but it's made directly for the people at
thermaltake now the extreme version is
made for overclocking you can see that
it's a dual rad dual fan solution flip
it around the back show you guys some
pictures back here
so what you guys see us let's see the
camera can zoom in on this this actually
shows you the specifications by a
written specs yeah you can see all that
you can always make your screen bigger
put him to 1080p boom it up you guys can
see it alrighty here is my trusty knife
box trusty knife this nice actually very
sharp indeed it's going to go ahead and
take it here just some sly seed i sees
check all the crazy plastic off all
right all the plastic comes off and it
gets thrown at what the government
hahaha that's all the camera so cool
there we go here's the box we go ahead
and unbox this thing now after a bunch
of joking and stuff then pop the unit
out get it after the table once again
the box towards the cameraman and
kabooming alright so here's everything
that comes in the water to point of
extreme by a thermaltake guys can see
everything nice and gently here packed
we'll start with the dual rad show you
guys that before we bring everything out
check that out dual red solution will
just pull this out first just given the
last one the last one I show you all the
parts and then this this time we'll just
show you this first so all the fan
connections are right here try to get
those all bunched up the power so here
go all the power and the connections you
can see those all right here together
here's the block underneath this little
plastic thing right here solid copper
base cooling stuffs already there so
putting thermal paste on it's already on
there for you so just pop the cap back
on there we'll try to get this all a
nice one camera shot so you this the top
of the unit the unit itself and all that
goody good stuff set it off to the side
we've also got obviously the manual
should open it up take a look together
real quick and just make sure it's and
uh proper stuff so it shows you all the
components
pump installation case installation
different ways to mount it inside of
your case the different options and then
it changes to another language so it's
all right there we also have the fan
control software so install us in your
computer you'll adjust your fans make
them go higher lower depending on how
you want them to run by the higher
they're going to run the cool it'll be
got two fans one for intake 14 exhaust
couple nice fans here so here you guys
can see the fan the fan nomenclature
there's two of them la de la la da dee
alrighty we know that those are going to
go mouth I'll pull this out once again
whoops the fans have different options
of how you want to mount them you can
see on each side they have holes so you
can mount the fans these are taking air
away or air putting into them depending
on what your cooling solution how you
want it to work different systems
require different needs so get that
other way last but not least here's the
mounting hardware now according to these
guys this can mount any cpu that's
currently out on the market whether it
be LGA 2011 or it be am3+ all the
mounting hardware is in here so whatever
one you want to use this battle cool
which i think is a pretty good thing so
that's about it folks this is a really
cool product you naysayers out there who
say oh closed-loop suck yeah yes
compared to some of the thrilling models
they've got out there by Swift tech and
HK and other people like that yeah this
system maybe you know a little bit more
on the lower entry level but I have to
say it's going to work better than any
air cooler out there this thing's me
about 139 dollar so i think overall this
thing is actually going to be a pretty
nifty product we're going to hook up to
a system which now how cool it actually
is at a future date so i'm eric will see
back here and take her tomorrow later
