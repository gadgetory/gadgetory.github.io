boost
don't let walls get in the way of your
calls hey what's everybody eldercare
once again on TECA tomorrow now if
you're like me and many other people
around the world
you obviously have place in your house
with a cellphone reception just is
absolutely no good in fact some people
could even call it the dead zone or what
also happens as you're walking around
your phone talking to somebody and all
of a sudden that phone call gets dropped
now this gets even worse situation if
you're doing business so you're inside
your office walking around having a
serious conversation with somebody all
of a sudden that phone calls dropped off
and you're just talking to absolute err
we'll check it out the echo from weboost
is designed to eliminate all those
problems v echo is a brand-new
entry-level product from the people over
at weboost it's designed to boost the
signal up to twelve hundred square feet
in your home or small office but what
should really interest you though is
this is that inside of that boosted area
the echo can give you up to thirty-two
times better cell coverage than outside
of that area another feature of the echo
that I know that folks are gonna like is
its simplicity of use you don't have to
have any kind of technical background
you definitely don't have to be a rocket
scientist to get the echo working it
simply plugs in and you're good to go
and what's great about this is that you
can move it to any room you want in the
house so if you're having a signal
problem the very back of your house well
than a you move the unit back there it's
in the front of the house you move it
there and regardless of the obstruction
you still get that great signal boost so
you can say sayonara to those drop calls
let's just real quick take a look at
what you get when you purchase the echo
by weboost you get the booster unit the
antenna unit the coax cable and finally
the power supply cable which is
absolutely everything you need other
than that basic outlet so like I said
earlier in the video setup is very easy
first off all you do is remove
everything from the box the next step is
to place your booster unit in a room
that has the best cell phone signal you
probably want to place it by a window
for the best performance
next you simply connect the supplied
coax cable and the power supply on the
side of the booster unit and for the
next step you simply place your antenna
or you need to boost your signal the
most make sure that the antenna is
facing the same direction as the booster
unit and it's best to have the unit
about six to eight feet away from it
next up you connect the coax cable to
the antenna and last you simply plug the
echo in now the people over at weboost
they suggest that you guys use a power
strip that has at least a thousand Joule
rating as soon as you plug in the boost
unit you should see a green light this
is letting you know the unit is up and
working perfectly and if you happen to
see a red light that means the booster
is too close to the antenna to fix this
all you have to do is increase the
distance between the booster and the
antenna and guys it's really that simple
now you guys can see right here is an
example this back from my house
previously had zero bars and I could
even make a phone call now as soon as I
hooked up the echo I'm getting three
bars of reception which is quite a bit
of improvement one last thing to mention
before I bounced out of here it doesn't
matter who your signal provider is
doesn't matter who you have for your
cell phone company means absolutely
nothing the way that the echo works it
picks up all the different echoes from
cell phone towers and boost that signal
so no matter who you guys your carrier
your signal will be improved with the
echo the bottom line here if you're
tired of losing signal or having drop
calls and you want to get rid of all
those so-called
dead zones inside your home or your
small office the echo from weboost can
be a product that can seriously fix your
problem so let's just reiterate a few
fun facts it doesn't matter who your
cell carrier is the echo will boost that
signal and we'll do it up to 32 times
better in its selected area you can also
move the unit anywhere in the house to
choose that selected area for the boost
which is also really cool so if you're
looking to get your hands on one of
these things or just find out more
information about the echo we'll have
pricing and availability down below that
like button i'm Elric you've been
