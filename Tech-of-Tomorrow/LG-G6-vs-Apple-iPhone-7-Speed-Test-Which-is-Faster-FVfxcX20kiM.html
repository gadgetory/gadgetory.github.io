once again detector tomorrow if you guys
happen to follow the channel you guys
know that yesterday we did the unboxing
of the LG g 6 featuring the Snapdragon
820 1 processor now we're going to be
taking that head-to-head with Apple's
iPhone 7 featuring their eighth infusing
chipset now in the past you guys all
know Apple's branding seems to really
kick ass when it comes to testing and
performance and all that other stuff so
let's see how does the LG G 6 compare to
Apple's iPhone 7 let's jump in and let's
check out those performance and speed
tests alright folks so first up we have
Geekbench you guys know this test every
site around the world everybody uses
this test to measure performance of
their phone you guys can see that well
the a10 fusion is kicking ass over the
Snapdragon 820 one processes this is
pretty much to be expected I was hoping
this moment do a little bit better but
nope still the a10 is kicking ass in
Geekbench and one and across the board
now check it out this next test is
slingshot by 3d mark this pretty much
tests your GPU power on your phone and I
got to say the results are pretty
surprising you guys can see that this is
the one test where the LG G 6 actually
kicks the Apple iPhone down the road so
in gaming you know that the LG G 6 is
going to be a better performer than
Apple's 8 and fusion processor this is
good news for those people out through
to play a lot of games on their phone to
a lot of multimedia stuff and it shows
that the Android world is starting to
catch up next up we have speed testing I
just want to let you folks know that we
did the testing completely separates
that the numbers were equal why do you
folks in the past the testing both at
the same time was a bad idea so we
listened to you and we test them both
separately now this is one test though
where I got to say that the LG G 6
really kind of looks kind of bad because
you guys can see that the numbers on the
Apple iPhone 7 are just incredible
they're almost double of what we're
seeing on the LG G 6 so as far as the
speed test goes damn that 18 fusion
processor is once again kicking some
serious ass over the 821 Snapdragon
alright folks so this next test it's
pretty much opening and closing ABS and
we opened up and closed 16 different
apps doing this testing
you can
you guys can see that once again the
a-10 is actually doing better than the
Snapdragon 820 1 I was hoping the test
would be a little bit more positive on
the LG side but unfortunately you guys
can still see that it's getting beat by
the a-10 processor I wish things would
change I'm sure you guys do too
hopefully in the future we'll see a
Snapdragon that can actually kick the
ass of the a-10 but for now things are
what they are
all right Tech van so I think the
results are kind of what many of us who
are expecting everybody pretty much
knows it as much as you hate Apple the
a10 fusion processor really does do a
serious job of doing processing and
kicking ass on your phone so you guys
can see that only in one test did the
Snapdragon 820 one pull ahead so out of
all the rest of testing you guys can
still see that even though the LG G 6 is
a very nice phone still pretty powerful
apples 810 still unfortunately kicking
ass on the Android world
I'm L work you guys been watching Tecna

or how to get your hands on one of these
phones we'll have a link down below like
