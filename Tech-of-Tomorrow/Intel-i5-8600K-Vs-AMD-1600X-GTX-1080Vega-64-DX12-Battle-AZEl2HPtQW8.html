again to the channel now if you guys
follow us you know just the other day we
released a video in a battle of the
brand-new I 580 600 k vs the risin 516 a
hundred X and you guys asked why we
didn't actually bring any direct x12
testing to the table and I'll tell you
why because we're trying to bring you
guys those other low numbers and in
direct x12 testing we're not able to do
that we're really only able to give you
guys just the average frames per second
the way the testing and stuff is done
that way now in the future when that
changes we'll James that as well now
obviously if you guys follow us you know
which test systems that we use and
everything else but for some reason you
don't know the test is in with our test
system right off the bat here is our
Intel based test system you guys can see
all the numbers and everything there for
that and for those guys who are
wondering hey what's your AMD system man
well here's the numbers for our AMD
system as well both the parts for these
systems I'm talking about the parts
alone not the case that we actually did
in the full system build are pretty much
equivalent to the same price range the
Intel CPU like I said before is about
$50 more expensive than the AMD thing
and I know also that people said hey we
could use a be 350 motherboard and bring
things down a little cheaper you can do
that but I think you'll be sacrificing a
wee bit of performance you kind of want
to keep things I feel especially if
you're a gamer to try to keep things as
top-end as possible unless you're
totally doing a budget build now I know
that traditionally people tend to lean
on the side saying that hey anything
that's made by AMD is going to do better
in DirectX 12 I think you guys will be
surprised it's kind of a big trade-off
between the two as far as that stuff
goes in the test systems but with that
said though let's jump in and let's
check out those benchmark scores
all right folks so there you have it the
same battle that we brought you guys in
the previous video and for some reason
if you're wondering about temps and all
that stuff please check out our previous
video that we did which was the full-on
battle this was just the directx12
battle and you guys can see that in a
lot of games hey I gotta say it the
Vegas 64 is actually winning against the
1080 and many instances especially in
like games like the division you guys
can see there's a big gap right there
regardless of which cpu that you are
using now in the previous video we also
saw though that as far as those you know
low numbers on the AMD side of thing
they were actually losing the until CPU
did a lot better and maintain higher
frame rates across the board much better
but now that we jumped into the DirectX
12 environment you can see in a lot of
cases though if you're a Vegas 64 owner
that hey these CPUs are actually close
but I gotta say it looks like AMD is
edging just a little bit ahead when it
comes to DirectX 12 gaming hopefully
Nvidia will get their act together and
bring that stuff around the corner with
more drivers and stuff but for now I'm
gonna say that AMD is probably winning
in the DirectX 12 environment plus I
think that we were all expecting that as
well I know you guys been watching Tech
demorrow like usual all of our test
systems everything that we did are all
down below obviously I know you guys are
wondering what do we use for drivers on
stuff we always use the latest drivers
that we can get our hands on ones that
are qualified and that we know are going
to work and we always use the latest
edition of Windows 10 if you guys are
wondering that as well so peace out our
next battle is the overclocking battle
so stay tuned to take a tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
