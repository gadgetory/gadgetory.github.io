know that many people out there have a
GTX 1060 card inside of their system it
was a relatively well priced card it was
well received by the market lots of
people have it so the question on their
mind is welp the brand new r-tx 2060
came out and is this card actually worth
taking the time to upgrade between these
two cards and I think at the end of the
day you'll see that I definitely do
think that it's a serious serious good
upgrade for your choice so real quick
let's take a look at this screen right
here where you guys can see the subtle
differences between these two cards not
a lot of differences here obviously
we're gonna have GDR six memory some of
the specs are gonna be the same some of
the specs are gonna be slightly
different obviously we're gonna get all
the Nuart CX and DL SS features that are
coming with the 2060 that aren't going
to be available on the 1060 card you
know those are the differences we are
going to see the TDP go up a little bit
on the RT X 2060 as well so it does take
a little bit more power than the
previous generation card but overall I
think the specs are well within range to
make it a suitable upgrade choice now
the one thing that you're gonna have to
take into consideration on the upgrade
is this is that currently there's about
$100 difference between the 10 60 and
the 2060 card they're actually priced
right in between you know the 1070 card
and the card below it so it's right
there in between a hundred dollar
difference between the two what you have
to ask yourself into the day though is
that are all the games that you're
playing right now are they all playing
to your satisfaction are you kind of
like iffy would you like to get a little
bit more performance and have a card
that's more future proof than in that
case you might want to be looking at the
RT X 2060 as an upgrade from the 1060
now real quick let's take a look at our
test station we've been using the same
one for a long time we have an ASUS
Maximus raagh motherboard we have an i7
8700 k the system is liquid cool with
the nice liquid cooler we have 32
gigabytes of memory this is ddr4 we have
two different hard drives they're both
Seagate 2 terabytes these are what we
store all the games on as far as our
boot drive goes it's a really nice SSD
for quick boot times and access and that
type of stuff
we're also running all the latest
drivers that were available the day that
we did the testing for this review plus
all the latest Windows updates so that
everything runs completely correct now
with that said though let's jump in now
and let's actually see the performance
number differences in a head-to-head
battle between the GTX 1060 and the new
RT X 2060 founders edition let's rock
all right Tech fans so check it out all
the numbers are almost double that of
the GTX 1060 which is I think is a
really good thing why I've been saying
throughout this entire video while I
think it's really a really good upgrade
choice because not only do you only pay
$100 more for the card you can actually
get almost twice the performance plus
future proof as all this new stuff comes
out not only that this card runs very
very cool it runs actually cooler than
the GTX 1060 even though it's a car that
takes more TDP this particular card you
know takes 160 Watts minimum to power it
so there's gonna be a little bit more
heat generated you think but no with the
new fan design and everything
this card runs cooler quieter it's a
hundred dollars difference from the GTX
1060 at the end of the day it totally
whips but on the previous generation
card like I said almost double the
performance I think it's a serious
upgrade choice and at the end of the day
if I was going to go out and get a card
if I had myself a GTX 1060 I would
probably sell that card and upgrade to
this or if I was just going out right
now thinking hey I want to get a brand
new video card I don't want to break the
bank and you want some that really works
hey this is definitely the choice at 349
dollars I'm networked you've been
watching techo tomorrow this was a
head-to-head battle between the previous
generation gtx 1060 founders edition
versus the brand-new RT x 2060 founders
edition and you guys all know who wins
we'll have a link down below so you want
to get one of these cards for yourself
or just check out some more information
it will be there more stuff coming up so
stay tuned to tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
