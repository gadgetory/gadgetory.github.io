back once again to techyv tomorrow for
my American viewers hey happy fourth of
July that's right it's Independence Day
here in America and we've got a nice
explosive review for you guys to check
out so what are we looking at today well
today we're going to be checking out the
new Asus GeForce GTX 760 this is their
direct cu2 version and it has a lot to
offer that's different than the
reference card
now the reference cards that come out
and all the cards are going to share
some features they're all based in the
28 nanometer process they're all based
off GK 104 they're all going to have
1152 stream processors they're all going
to have 96 Tex Units 32 ROPS they're all
going to have the two gigabytes of gddr5
memory these are things that are going
to be the same across the board some of
the differences in the cards though are
going to be in the type of cooling used
in the type of power requirements and
basically how the card looks so with
that said let's jump in now and let's
check out the a Zeus car which is a
totally non reference design of course
it does share all those same features
that I said before but it has a lot of
stuff that makes it unique so let's jump
in do the unboxing and let's see what's
different about this a Zeus card alright
folks so check it out here is the box
this is the a Zeus direct Cu 2
overclocked edition now here's basically
the front of the box I'm not going to
spend a lot of time on that you guys
know what that is I'm going to flip the
card around in the back of the box
though and here are some of the features
that actually do matter about the card
they're cooling the direct cu2 20%
cooler vastly quieter now the CU is the
reference mark for copper the heatsink
is directly connected to the GPU so that
all the heat is dissipated out to the
card and kept cool through its open-air
design these guys also use direct power
plus super alloy power so direct power
means all the power is going directly
into the card it's being conditioned and
the super alloy power is all the
components and everything that keep the
card running cool and constant at a
constant rate making the card last 2.5
times longer and then last but not least
GPU tweak this is their overclocking
software it works very very well in the
Windows environment a few clicks of a
button and your
up and going so with that said let's
check out what comes in the box top cap
right here and we'll see there's not a
lot of content in the box got the six
pin to eight pin power connector that's
one of the difference in the car as well
we'll get to that most of the cards that
you see out of the market require two
six pins or a six pin and an eight pin
this card actually only requires a
single eight pin power connector
something different there so let's go
ahead here's everything that comes in
the box there's really not a lot of
content you get the driver GPU the speed
setup you guys get the cables and now
we'll get to the card itself so I'm
going to bring this up you guys can see
right off the bat it's got the ROG color
scheme we've got the black and red going
we have two fans
hence the direct see you to the two
means there are two fans underneath that
you guys can see all the beginning of
the cooling apparatus all the aluminum
fins are underneath there as we flip to
the side you guys can see all the heat
pipes now this is an open-air design
which means that this card actually does
rely on your case having good air flow
to keep cool all the heat will be
dissipated away from your GPU but it'll
be into your system your systems air
flow will blow all that out and keep the
system running cool as well here at the
bottom we see the PCI interface flip it
around you guys can see it's a dual slot
design so it's going to take up two
slots in your computer once again we see
more of the aluminum heat fins here in
the back I'm going to flip the card
around we see the direct see you too and
here's something different right here in
the card we see the power requirements
of this card are only a single 8 pin
unlike most other cards which like I
said previously required two six pins or
a six and eight pin that's pretty
interesting in itself I'm going to flip
it around the card to the back first
first we'll take a look at the two sli
fingers here on top you can only do
3-way SLI with these cards not four-way
just want to mention that as well then
right here we see the 1 2 3 4 screws
these are used to remove the cooling
apparatus so you just remove these
screws right here and you can pull the
entire cooling apparatus off now here in
the back we
the direct power this is specific to
only a Zeus cards and it's one of the
things that actually helps the card run
a lot better last but not least I'm
going to flip it around the back let you
guys see the rear i/o to DV is standard
HDMI standard DisplayPort now before we
actually get into it and do our testing
and stuff like that I want to talk to
you guys about a couple of things that
we did with the card before we get into
the testing we actually ran the card at
standard and then we also increased the
clock speed and the memory bandwidth by
a hundred megahertz as far as our temps
went we had a minimum temperature of 29
Celsius and a maximum temperature of 60
Celsius and the overclocked max was 67
Celsius because of the cooling the
maximum GPU boost though was actually
1228 megahertz even though we said it at
1170 megahertz
due to the superior cooling and with
that said let's jump in and rock out
with our spock out
all right folks so there you guys have
it everything to do with the new Asus
GeForce GTX 760 now a lot of people are
going to say oh you know why do I really
still want to get this card well you
guys understand the cooling of the card
is what really matters now on NVIDIA
cards the way the GPU boost works it
works up how cool the card runs so the
cooler the card runs and obviously the
better the boost we were able to
increase the card by a hundred megahertz
on both the memory and the clock speed
and we got very good results
maximum temps that we got were 69
Celsius that's really awesome when
compared to the reference card which
actually ran about 18 to 20 Celsius
hotter in some instances which is
actually really quite crazy so that's
pretty much it folks you guys seen the
card you guys see what it is it's coming
to market at about 260 dollars so that's
a really good price about ten dollars
more than your standard reference
Edition card so I think at the end of
the day this is definitely an editor's
choice product I'm Miller we'll see you
guys back around techo tomorrow for more
tech goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
