welcome to TECA tomorrow we've got an
awesome system here total cost is under
thirteen hundred bucks and best of all
we're giving it to you folks
so let's jump right in and see what this
badass little baby is all about slow at
any build be without its case so we
start up with the H 440 can people over
at NZXT this thing's totally
minimalistic but it's awesome black and
red color scheme matching that AMD build
and the power button on top is so clean
right next to that little restart button
that it's kind of just the perfect case
if you want minimalistic but awesome
all-in-one okay so buddy the dog
obviously wants to be part of the videos
so we're not gonna stop him today so for
the motherboard we're supported by
gigabyte this is a really nice
motherboard it's the 990 FX au d3
motherboard nice pretty motherboard
perfect for this build only about a
hundred and twenty six bucks so it's a
really nice price motherboard as well
now the CPU its AMD baby all the way
across the board it's the ninety five
ninety now this thing is 4.7 gigahertz
liquid cooler out of the box with turbo
at five gigahertz and it's an eight core
CPU so you know it's gonna be able to
handle some business in the gaming arena
for video card once again Spanx go out
to the people over at gigabyte this is
their windforce Edition this is the are
nine to ATX a perfect card for 1080p
gaming you guys are going to love this
stuff now as far as the memory we use
sixteen gigabytes of 1866 megahertz
stuff from Kingston this is our HyperX
fury stuff plus it's red so it matches
that total AMD theme now as far as media
and storage drives go we have two
different ones for the boot up we have a
kingston SSD there's a hyper X hundred
and twenty gigabyte model very special
thanks those people and we have a
western digital one terabyte black for
the main median storage drive so all in
all this thing's pretty well rounded off
now obviously you need a power supply
right so we've got a modular XFX one
this is a 750 watt power supply and this
thing's working perfectly in fact you
guys can see in this case you can't even
really see the power supply at all it's
completely hidden underneath and some of
the cool things also about the case or
the on the side of it the NZXT lights up
in complete white lettering making it
look really cool like I said before this
is a very minimalistic design but it's
very cool like if I had it my way call
this thing like the mini Ferrari because
it's not quite as spankin as the last
Ferrari but it still gave in that same
type of realm now like I said the very
being
this video we're actually given the
system to you folks that's right in
conjunction with AMD and our lovely
sponsors who love you as much as we love
you were given this bad boy away as
exciting as that is though check this
out we've benchmarked this thing like a
regular system review because you guys
actually want to know what you're gonna
get right so with that said let's rock
out to the benchmarks and let's see how
this little Ferrari doesn't estimate
all right so another day of head banging
to the benchmark song so you guys can
see this system performs really really
well in 413 or dollar system I think
it's very very nice it's very
minimalistic there's not a bunch of wire
sticking out anywhere you guys can see
the builds totally clean before we got I
want to give a special thanks out to
Anthea Reynolds our in-house builder for
once again putting the system together
for you folks now to enter this contest
is very very easy circulates mainly
around being subscribe to the challenge
so the first thing I get to bu is be a
subscriber you're automatically in but
there are bonus ways that you guys can
in the contest and get more ways to get
your name chosen and those things will
all be like usual down below like button
and really I hope the sense you know
we're giving you guys a system you're
gonna hit the like button because if
you're hitting the hate button I'm not
really understanding that so maybe if I
was come to your house to take something
from you'd hit that hate button but mmm
I don't know we're giving you something
so think about that for a second before
you go hating out there so once again
thanks to AMD make sure you guys check
out that link down the description
because everything will be in there all
the parts all the availability so if you
guys want to build yourself a system
just like this and test it and have fun
with it you can so do nothing in here is
so off the wallet you have to go out and
do any custom mods or anything like that
all this took was a few hours of
patience and the system puts together
very nicely
water cooler comes with the CPU installs
very very simply so I'm a Larkins buddy
the dog our mascot for some reasons they
just refuse to stay out of the video my
guess he wants to see you folks and uh
we love you for being here so all I can
really say before I bounce adding your
votes is stay tuned to all of our social
media stuff our twitter or google+ all
that good stuff because we'll be
announcing this in fourteen days and one
of you guys will be the lucky winner and
I know you guys were gonna all ask is
this international yes it's
international we'll ship the system to
you one way or another if I had to put
it on my back and get a camel to bring
me to the middle of the desert I'll do
it no I'm just kidding but we'll make
sure we get it to you alright love you
folks see you guys back on tech tomorrow
