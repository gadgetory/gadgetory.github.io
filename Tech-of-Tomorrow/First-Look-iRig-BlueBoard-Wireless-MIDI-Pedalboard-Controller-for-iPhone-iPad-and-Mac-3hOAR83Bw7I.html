winning Best in Show for it there that's
the yes - so what is it it's the very
first MIDI expression pedal board that
connects wirelessly bluetooth to your
iOS devices or your or your Mac or PC so
you can just look this up Wireless so
you run it through your computer and
everything and control the effects
everything of your guitar right through
this correct

set it on the floor it'll maybe learn
pretty quickly you have the ability to
put in two expression pedals so in
theory if you're playing your guitar

song boxes and comport for whatever
you're working with whatever software

another without ever taking your hands
off your instruments that's awesome so

the street it should retail for $99 and
it should be available in q2 so there

be coming out to the market if you're a
guitar player dozen like the mess or

look at in 2013 thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
