back to tech go tomorrow we've got
something cool today the brand new LG g6
has finally dropped I got mine in the
mail yesterday this is the full retail
package now if you folks out there who
happen to miss our previous video where
I talked about all the specs and all
that
I'll have this down below you can check
that out but for today we've got the
unboxing of the brand new LG g6 unlocked
version 4 here in the USA so with that
said let's jump in and let's see what's
in the box
so like any unboxing obviously we're
going to start out by checking out hey
the box this box is pretty doggone
simple as the g6 nomenclature on top
flip it around the back just shows you a
little bit more that stuff on the side
here though here actually all the real
specs of the phone so we'll make sure we
get a nice close-up shot of that too you
guys can see that if you want to wet
nomenclature what model you're watching
to buy at your time of purchase you can
check that out there beyond that I mean
really nothing else more to the box it's
pretty much just a you know the box I
mean what can I say about it to box hey
alright cool so I was going to use this
little tape thing and undo the tape
thing but instead I'm just going to use
a trusty little knife and make it nice
and quick here so I have to sit here and
mess around with doing anything so if
that's it we'll pop it down let's pop
the cap on this bad boy
ba boom alright right there on top you
guys can see the phone now the big thing
about this phone however one of the
biggest features anyways is its huge
screen it features a 5.7 inch qHD plus
full vision display with a resolution of
28 80 by 1440 now this thing's supposed
to be pretty incredible it has 564
pixels per inch and all in all it's a
pretty damn good screen lots of viewing
room lots of pixels per inch you're
gonna know you're going to get that
killer picture when you're checking it
out so we'll go ahead and just take that
off to the side for now
studios comes in a box so we've got our
quick start up guide and all that stuff
this gives you instructions and that
kind of stuff I don't really know how
many people actually use this out there
I mean me personally I don't think I've
dug into a user's guide in years which
is something brand new that I haven't
seen by now I think we're all getting
pretty doggone familiar with phone
technology so beyond that we get the
charger we get the lovely charging cable
so the charging cable itself the wall
port charger
and down in here we have a little tool
you guys all know this tool this is for
removing your sim and all that stuff you
just pop one side and a pots everything
out we'll actually had that in the full
video and we do the you know the full
video back to the phone and as far as
stuff in the Box goes I mean that's
pretty much it it's that I mean on the
back there was a little bit of stuff I
think I showed you guys that before but
nothing really no big deal so pop that
out of the way so now let's check out
the phone comes in a nice cradle as you
guys see here back very very nice you
guys can see the dual camera but for the
touch all that like I said we're going
to get to all that stuff more in the
review on the side here here's we use
that little tool right there you pop
that open that's where your SIM card is
you see the bands for the Wi-Fi here to
the band for the Wi-Fi here two more
here on top and two more on the bottom
actually I guess it looks like there's
just one more on the bottom so those are
all your all your bands going up to
Wi-Fi and all that stuff
phones very clean design you guys can
see that features two buttons on the
left hand side these are going to be for
your volume controller for toggling
between things pretty simplistic in its
design front facing camera as well I
have to tell you guys though one of the
things I really do like about this phone
is that it fits very nicely upon my hand
I feel it the weight distribution this
particular phone is very nice if you
guys happen to catch our video this
phone is also pretty durable too
we did some severe drop testing filling
it around and everything and this thing
lasted like a frickin tank so let's go
ahead and take off screen there you guys
can see that beautiful 5.7 inch screen
all in all though I just think this is a
beautiful phone and that's pretty much
everything that comes in the box of the
brand new LG g6 alright folks so there
you have it everything that comes in the
box of the brand new LG g6 it's looking
pretty cool
we'll have our speed test and full
review coming in the days ahead so stay
tuned to Tecna morrow for more tech
