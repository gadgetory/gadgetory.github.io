I'm Miller your host here on Tech damar
we bring you all the tech all the time
today's video today's video is by a
company called IC doc now this is their
a three-in-one backplane module now
though if this thing does it takes three
of your devices and you can use them in
your system totally hot-swappable so say
that you have a motherboard that's hot
swappable this thing
it's totally sticking in your system
connect it and you can remove your
drives in and out if they go bad totally
hot swappable just like some of the more
expensive systems now I see doc they
consider their products to be very
premier high-end products the reasons
why all the products are very very well
made they have a very high standard this
products got some really cool features
like a little click button in the front
you click a little switch you can engage
or disengage the hard drive so you can
have the hard drive showing up or not
working at all depending on your choice
so today we're gonna do the unboxing and
show you this thing so let's jump in and
let's check out this new product from IC
doc alright folks so here we have it the
box
I see doc wwic calm trail is 3 and 2
SATA backplane module model number MB
973 SP - to be you guys have seen this
or Express trailer set up SATA 6 built
in USB 3.0 ports for external devices
flip the box around show you guys inside
of the box so here we go we see the back
of the box
you got that once again the icy dock the
model number user-friendly trailers
design for hot swap capability support
SATA 6 gigabits second durable aluminum
body adjustable fan speed controller USB
3.0 all the basic specs your material
the size all that's all down here as you
go down serial ata flip it around show
you guys the last side of the Box this
is the back of the unit there showing
you the type of connectors
eighty millimeter fan it's replaceable
let's bang it out now so in the top of
the box we don't need a knife or
anything for this go ahead and pop the
cap let's go ahead and remove the unit
out of the box take this stuff all out
alrighty then so you guys see the unit
all comes plastic wrapped on the
external we have all the mounting screws
and everything we can set those down we
also have some of the power get this
little sticky tape off me it's sticking
to me see molex to SATA power go ahead
and set those down one thing that these
guys also told me is that none of their
products usually require any type of
screws or anything to get their drives
to mount in the drive I have a few of
those other products and as we go
through mule see exactly what I'm
talking about
so here's the front of the unit there's
a little switch and these little things
right here you push them in and out and
as you push them in and out
they either engage or disengage the
internal drive that you have in here so
if you click the top one the drive will
be working you click the second one or
you can click them off and use them any
way you want to so they just open up you
guys can see internally all you do is
take a drive and slide it in here
alright so here we have drive Western
Digital one terabyte black you guys know
this drive it's most commonly used damn
game and drive out there so try his
insert into the end of the unit
and that's it simple that was the
installation of the drive to remove it
just pull it out and it actually ejects
the drive on its own so put the drive in
put it in close the door nothing else to
do this slides into your system so you
have to use the bays obviously in the
system you'd open those bays up to put
it in their USB 3.0 right here in the
front here's also down here it's gonna
be very hard to see something to try to
bring it up here and see if Cameron can
get it but right down here is the fan
selector switch right here high low and
medium it's gonna be very hard to see
but it's right there flip it around show
you guys the top just shows the icy dock
and basically what the stuff is on the
back it's like an instruction guy that's
on the unit flip it around show you guys
the back of the unit here is the
connection for your USB 3.0 this is
going to plug into your motherboard let
me try to get this little bad boy out of
here
so there you guys can see the USB 3.0
connectivity I'm gonna go ahead and plug
that in 80 millimeter fan removable here
are your three connectors inside of here
for connecting your SATA to different
types of Bank connectors three and two
pin connectors then you have your two
molex Joe right here and that's pretty
much it I mean this thing's like having
your own backplane in your computer a
lot of motherboards have the hot-swap
feature you guys can see they just stick
in your normal five and a quarter bays
and away you go so pretty cool so there
you guys have it if a lot of you guys
don't know what a backplane is a
backplane is like a lot of servers have
these type of things it's where you have
a drive in your system and you're going
along and all of a sudden the drive
fails and you're like holy crap I need
to replace it well in some cases you
can't shut the system down think about
if it's something that you're running
you've got a business ring you want to
screw somebody gonna have their business
down so hot-swappable
is really cool you just take the drive
out put another one in it shifts the
data around now this thing will also
work with SATA or whatever depending on
how you configure it so if
you hook to the drives have been here to
the SATA connector you can run them in
raid right from this box now check it
out you guys hit that like button and
you guys hit a thousand likes give me
4,000 likes I'll make sure that I see
doc sends is one of these units out to
some of you people for showing
appreciation so for me make sure you hit
that like button and then somebody'll
get some cool products cuz I actually
want to hear from the people I give it
to what you guys think about it
I think these products are really nifty
they want to get people to know about
them what better Boehner get people to
know about them than for you to have it
and to spread the gospel out on the
social media circuit so anyways you guys
make sure you're always subscribe so we
can see you here on the channel I love
you and we'll see you guys back here on
Tec them tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
