on the ticket amaro youtube channel
bringing you guys something really cool
what is that well today I'm going to
bring you guys this new unit called an
aio it's called an all and wonder unit
the particular one I'm looking at today
is the my tech maestro 650 comes decked
out as an i5 2405 s cpu 8 gigabytes of
ram a 75 gigabyte SSD a one terabyte
western digital hard drive complete
touch panel IPS technology screen if you
get it's got a mic in the front a camera
all kinds of connectivity HDMI this
thing's just fully decked out now what
is the whole theory behind all-in-wonder
it's basically for people out there who
don't want to mess around their
computers at all you go out you can walk
into a place have this thing custom
configured to your own video card your
own sound to whatever you want inside of
it it's a very open architecture little
thing the unit i have here behind me
this is the maestro 650 it comes
configured as it is but if you are going
to buy this you'll actually be able to
walk into the future and the places and
actually custom configure the system to
whatever you want now for big houses out
there who are looking to integrate these
products this is good for you as well
why because this thing is basically even
though it's black it's a white box item
you can have this thing totally custom
made for you have your name on it your
plastic on it make you look like it's
your product let me just give you an
example say that me and Shane and
Cameron here we decide tomorrow that we
want to make a company and our company
is going to be called dragon 5 so
tomorrow we can call up and have the
dragon 5 computer totally made for us so
we get our computer it'll say dragon 5
can figure it out we want it to bring it
to you the end user that all said I know
it all sounds good on paper but now
let's actually jump over and let's take
a look if this new maestro 650 and see
why it actually is really cool for a
thousand dollar price point
alright so let's check out the unit
itself we can see we've got a 21.5 IPS
panel fully touchscreen operated one
thing I want you guys take note of the
windows experience rating was 5.8
overall we can see that it's got the
Intel Core i5 2 405 s cpu running at 2.5
gigahertz scizzum comes with 8 gigabytes
of internal memory and we're running on
this system we're running windows 7 home
premium 64-bit I just want to click in
your let you guys see something too but
the one of those experience you guys can
see the primary hard disk was an SSD
it's actually a 75 gigabyte SSD it's
getting 7.7 the actual lowest score that
we're getting on here is the graphics is
5.8 because this particular system is
using the Intel embedded graphics that
come with it that's a 2000 graphics but
everything else on you can see 7.3 7.5
6.2 on gaming graphics and 7.7 on the
primary now even a 6.2 though on the
graphics is actually pretty good I'm
actually going to put some games on here
later and see how the thing works one
thing I just absolutely have to stress
when talking about Intel's new aio
series is the monitor this is a 21.5
inch IPS technology monitor and this
type of monitor can usually only be
found on high-end things such as a mac
cinema display or really delhi in and
this one takes it a step further because
it has touchscreen technology what that
means you just go right to the computer
just click something with your finger
you're automatically into it
it's really cool you want to watch TV or
anything you just click and scroll
through you want to go out you just
touch it let's check out angry birds a
lot of people like this game and one
thing that's really cool is say that
you've got a child and the child just
wants to play directly with the computer
with this they don't have to use the
mouse things come here hit apply hit the
poach eggs go over here get the click go
over here come on over and start playing
really obscene you stretch it out put
everything by touched I mean just think
about this if you had a kid and you
didn't want to mess around this he can
just touch this and this monitor is
totally developed so that your oil from
your skin stuff doesn't ruin it there's
actually really good technology behind
this monitor I'm really stoked with it
one last thing I just want to go with
you folks is all the connections on the
side here you have lots of connections
to use you have a DVI port you've got
HDMI you've got external esata you've
got all that stuff right here USB 3.0
you've got a card reader right here
you've got a screen dimmer switch and
everything right here where you can dim
and select the screen there's a lot of
connections on this thing being that two
mini ITX motherboard it's actually
running really cool even on my Mac
whenever I touch the sides or anything
on my Mac it's running really hot this
system is running totally cool that's
just one thing I want to talk to you
guys it's running really cool so what
you guys did basically get a system that
cost a thousand dollars it has
everything in it it has an IPS 21.5
touch panel screen that's really
incredible you get the i5 2505 s that's
a process a lot of built-in
functionality to it you get one of the
mini ITX motherboards i'm not sure the
exact one that's inside of this one I
tried looking up the model number but I
couldn't find it i'll see if i can find
it put in the details but just overall a
thousand dollars everything all in one
geared for media geared for going on the
internet geared for children any child
can sit and type things in here if you
can actually connect a microphone to
this is unit as well I haven't got that
far as I just want you guys to see it
but you can actually have a microphone
up and talk so i could go on to google
right here with my
finger touch and that i could say onto
the computer search for computer
hardware and it will actually go and
search on the internet like that so it's
not only hand touch it's actually can be
voice operated I just haven't got that
far alright guys so today I brought you
guys basically a first look at intel's
new aio line this is the maestro 650
it's coming to market at about a
thousand dollars and as you guys have
seen it has a lot of lot of features i'd
like to hear from you guys out there
what you guys think about this because
you guys all know that like imax are
like very very popular and all-in-one
pcs have really never taken off this
isn't the first time this has been tried
but here's something that's a little bit
different about this than other boxes
that you've been seeing integration of
great ability with this unit you will
actually be able to upgrade its limited
but you can upgrade to a new video card
module more memory or different hard
drive in the future if you wanted to
it's allowable those are going to be
some of the perks about buying an
all-in-one system traditionally in the
past if you bought something that's how
it was you were stuck with it and the
line with this yeah i mean the 21.5 inch
monitor you're not going to be able
change that out but some of the stuff
from the background you will be changing
out so i think this is actually one of
the coolest little all 1pcs i have ever
seen thousand bucks runs totally cool is
either voice or hand-operated has an SSD
inside of it awesome transfer rates
overall I'm pretty satisfied with this
unit hats off to Intel and thank you
guys for watching the unboxing and first
look of the maestro 650</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
