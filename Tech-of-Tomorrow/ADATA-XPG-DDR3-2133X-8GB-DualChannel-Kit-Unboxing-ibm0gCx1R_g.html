tech on tech of tomorrow Elric ferrous
here today we're going to be taking a
look at something again from the people
over at a data this is one of their
latest 8 gigabyte memory packs it runs
at 21 33 megahertz it's a dual channel
and as part of their xpg line of
products in the slamming the background
is the other cameron slamming doors so i
will have to cut him after this video
but anyway today we're gonna be unboxing
and show you guys this new memory so
first of all we'll just show you the box
you guys can see it's the xpg line so
your extreme series ddr3 dual channel
21:33
that'll be it's XMP profile and so we'll
go ahead and show you guys this and then
we'll show you guys the back not a lot
to this today and then after that the
only way to get out of the box folks
unfortunately is to scissor this so
hopefully you know I thought about it
I'm like alright clamshell bunch of
clangs oh crap what am i doing sorry
here we go take the scissors this time
doing some the scissor ring and I almost
just cut my hand in fact I did know you
guys can see it I cut my hand ever so
slightly on that Wow
cut my hand man plastic is sharp dug
already data you're gonna hear from my
lawyer no I'm just kidding alright so me
finish trying to cut this plastic off
here and not to take off my hand at the
same time it's not good keep cutting
cutting cutting I could eventually get
it open see here were you good enough to
go now alright we're good to go now so
now I will take these scissors and I
will throw them at a target off in the
distance dammit that thing hard so now
we got the packet now go ahead and open
up the packet and no animals or humans
in making this video my only hair test
spirits and aliens
get this stuff out of here now some guy
left me some comments the other day he
told me I suck because I make jokes and
stuff on my channel I guess you guys
like me to be more about it
hey Dana MOV 21:34 anyway here's the 2/6
of memory for you so pop them out a
little container now they have like
little stars on them their stars on them
there's nothing there special memory
with stars we dedicate these to the
Olympic people out there don't they get
some gold medals and bring them on back
here in America so now as you bring this
up you guys can see the nomenclature on
the back here and I'll just show you is
either stick to stories you know shots
and giggle will be just off the package
over here so get him out of my hand here
that's pretty much it guys
so it's memory you know what it does you
stick it in go into your BIOS set the
XMP profile and away you go if you try
just setting up to 2133 or overclock
your system just take that in mind make
sure you set the instant be profile I
know work and I'll see you mother's back
here on ticket Amaro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
