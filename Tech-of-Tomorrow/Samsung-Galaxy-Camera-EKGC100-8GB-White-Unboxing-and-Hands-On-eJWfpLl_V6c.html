gadget freaks elric here once again the
tech demo our youtube channel we bring
you all the tech all the time now you
guys all know there's been a tons of
stuff that's come out from samsung this
year we've had the s3 the note 2 and now
before the end of the year we see the
new galaxy camera that's right this is a
16 megapixel camera now this thing is
actually going to be pretty cool because
it's kind of like a camera and having
Photoshop all combined in one so pretty
much this is like a camera that has
built-in features for editing and all
kinds of other stuff it's also totally
geared to be based for media mean that
it's a smart camera so basically you
take pictures you have all that stuff
you can instantly share all these
pictures to your favorite places to your
Facebook your Instagram and all that
kinds of stuff now this thing features a
21 X zoom 23 millimeter wide angle lens
it's got a nice pretty good lens some of
my friends who are into cameras say
they're kind of like on a fence about
what they wrote me about the camera
quality but today we're going to bring
you the unboxing and check out this
little bad boy so let's hop over the
table and let's see what's in the box
alright folks so like usual take a look
at the box we're basically chosen the
front 16 megapixel optical 21 x 23
millimeter wide zoom lens you got all
that stuff right there in the front of
the box throw some the basic features
it's got basically a two and a half by
four and a quarter screen 1280 by 720
resolution now let's go ahead and take
this trusty knife now my son got this
for me for Christmas it's kind of like a
cool like trip you like Batman type
knife show you guys the thing there so
go ahead and take out the trusty blade
now this one's a little bit dangerous
because it offers you dual blade
protection you can use either side so
I'm just going to go ahead and make a
quick incision right here and another
one right over here
and that's it i'll go ahead and just set
the knife down we'll go ahead and pull
this thing apart now a lot of people are
going to be saying man why would i get
that i would just get a phone that has
some camera stuff on it well you're not
going to get all of the features that
you get with that so i'm just going to
go ahead and take all the stuff out of
the box first we can just check it out
so now we see the box is empty here's
all of our accessories first we'll go
over there is then we'll go to the
camera here's the battery nice little
samsung battery the strap for Kane
around look kind of like leather it's
white to match it power micro USB
standard USB your instruction guide and
then last but not least we have what
looks like a sim card thing with no sim
card so we'll go ahead and set that out
and then the charger itself plug in the
wall USB for the part into the camera
alright so to bring this thing out here
so you guys you get a little close up of
it check it out you guys can see the
lens everything right here good grip
right here on the side for gripping it
go ahead and spin it around the back go
ahead and remove this you gets in see it
as a very very large screen put them the
top you guys can see you couple controls
up here flip it around the side but you
guys see the angle over there as well
now here's where obviously where the
battery is going to go in so I'll go
ahead and just set this down real
carefully right here we'll go ahead and
remove the battery from the plastic
hopefully they'll have enough charging
it to at least start up so we can see it
the big big big thing about this folks
though is basically being able to have a
media based device because this thing
like I said you're going to be able to
use it anywhere do anything with it I
guess our little flash came up so here
we go I've now press the power button on
top and it's now starting up and so now
we're up and going and you guys can see
it it's actually very very clear I don't
think is very much of a battery charge
on it though since it died very very
quickly well I guess it and I it just
closes off very quickly if you don't use
it so there's basically features now I
don't know too much about this like I
said I just gotta but you do have a auto
smart and expert mode down here so i'll
i'll keep it to auto since I'm you know
a newbie at this take a quick picture
that's just the desktop speaker now even
though the flash came on it didn't
really change the picture now that's
going to be something interesting here's
the picture going to show it to you
right now so there's the picture i took
flash didn't change the picture all that
much at all you guys can see you as a
flash in the front of it the 21 x zoom
capabilities right here is for your
flash on and off I don't exactly know
how to totally control because like I
just said I just got it I guess you just
push it like that maybe if you push it
okay so that's how it goes so you push
it in you want it to work then you push
it out the button over here if it shuts
down re-engages the camera so you can
use it again
so let's see here here zoom so check
this out check out the zoom features I'm
going to zoom all the way into my
speaker there oh okay now it's showing
us the zoom capabilities on the screen
453 and there's the picture that we took
look at the clarity of that the flash
did you name as a picture whatsoever
okay everybody so obviously I have a lot
of homework to do to learn all the
features on this new smart camera but so
far it's been great we've been just
shooting small little videos taking
pictures and doing this kind of stuff
I've been sitting in here experimenting
with it I don't know how well it's going
to end up being overall what to bring
another video on that but let me learn
about the product so we can bring you
actually more excellent stuff on it so
far though like i said though it's been
very easy you guys saw his turn on we've
taken a few quick pics and everything
even with the flash going on the
pictures are still looking good you
because you know usually when you put
the flash on it like ruins of pictures
because a big like you know white thing
you know blasting on it this seems to
eliminate that problem which is actually
pretty cool I like that feature a lot so
anyways folks i hope you guys like this
video if so hit that like button make
sure you subscribe brawl the contest
going on we are very very close to our
70 k contest out there that's right and
we just want to say thanks to all the
people out there who participated during
our 12 days of christmas giveaway we
love you guys thank you so much when we
have lots of great stuff coming up here

buddy the dog and play with the camera
