lamar youtube channel I'm elric your
host and unless you've been somewhere
else you guys all know the new apple
iphone 5 has been released to the market
and it features its new mysterious
designed new a6 processor now the a6
processor is something totally different
that nobody else in the market is using
its basically arm on a chip but built
all the way from the ground up from the
people over at Apple now with that said
most of the phones out there that you
buy in the market either have one of two
different types of things that are in
them to power them they either feature
arms cortex a9 which is nvidia and a few
others or they use the qualcomm crate
now that means that no matter what phone
you buy out there they're going to
feature one of those two processors in
it the new apple a6 however is based on
an entire different process built from
the ground up from the people over at
Apple now today we're going to run two
different tests we're going to run
geekbench and speed tests and we're
going to show the new Apple I five
against a bunch of others on the market
including the new galaxy s3 so with that
said let's jump in and let's see how the
new apple 5 fares against the
competition geekbench is a processor
benchmark which test the basic
components of a phone system here you
can see the iphone 5 against others of
its kind next up we see speed test this
shows how fast your phone connects to
the internet and how quickly will be
working when you're downloading and
using stuff are everybody so you guys
can see from those two tests that the
new Apple I five surely seems to be the
fastest handle component you can
currently by in the USA now I know
there's a lot of different tests out
there a lot of different things out
there the screen on the galaxy s3 is a
little bit bigger it has I think like
twenty six percent more pixels on the
screen but always showing some tests of
those in the futures where it shows that
the Apple I five blazes there as well
but for now you can see in both
geekbench and speed test that the new
Apple I five really really does kick
some serious ass and the new a six
processor seems to be a solid component
for the people over apple I'm not the
smartest phone guy in the world and to
let you guys know I'm actually currently
look
to find a phone guy so if you're a guy
out there and you think that you know a
lot about phones and would like to join
the team over here at Tech go tomorrow
contact me because I'd really like to
have a phone guy who knows a lot more
about phones than me I basically just
use mine for making phone calls and a
couple different games but it'd be nice
to have somebody on the channel who
really knew their stuff really well so
with that said I'll see you guys back
here on techo tomorrow tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
