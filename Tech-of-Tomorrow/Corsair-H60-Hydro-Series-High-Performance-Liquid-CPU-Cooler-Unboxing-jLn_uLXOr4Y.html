you guys will be happy because we're
doing another unboxing of some cool PC
products what are we doing today well
today we're going to do an unboxing of a
$60 liquid cooler from the people over
at Corsair this is their H 60 now this
is pretty much kind of an entry-level
water cooler but for 60 bucks it's damn
well priced I know a lot of you guys
have out there been asking me for like a
review comparing them all but it
actually takes a lot of time I'm going
to have a full review on all of these
things but actually doing the lab and
doing the testing to make this right
takes a lot of time I'll have it for you
I promise but for today let's jump in
and let's do the unboxing and check out
what comes in this new Corsair 860 box
sorry folks before we bang into the
unboxing I just want to show something
to you guys that my tech got me this is
a little black ops thing it's black ops
Special Projects Division now this
thing's pretty cool these little flaps
right here they're made to actually
disengage so in case of like bad weather
they won't break these tabs pull off
very simply so in hot and cold weather
they won't swell or break now this
thing's cool let me open it up here you
guys can see it comes with a very cool
knife you guys will be seeing more
that's why I open it up and it comes
with a lighter this thing's like a torch
light lighter you can see where you fill
it up in there and the little torch here
on top although I haven't filled up is
brand new but with this trusty knife
today I'm going to be unboxing so let's
pop the knife out right now take a
closer look at it you guys can see us as
black ops from the side of it it's
pretty cool anodized red and black on
the other side it's got some more
nomenclature a little clippers you can
wear it on your belt now let's take a
look at the actual Corsair h-60 box
here's the front of it not too much to
it just as their hydro series this will
work on both AMD and intel series CPUs
you don't have to worry about that all
the hardware is included inside the box
so no matter what kind of thing you got
out there this is going to fit on you
don't need any other equipment here's
the back of it just show you some
thermal facts that these guys are have
on there that's about it
not really too much to this box so I'm
going to go ahead and make a couple
incisions right here I like to take the
plastic and just rip it off of here get
this thing in here again those little
two incisions right there didn't work as
well as I thought they would so I'll
make either one go ahead and rip the old
plastic off of there it's always kind of
like a Christmas day only instead of
I've been wrapping paper I get to deal
with the plastic it's like having all
your gifts but you know what they are
hmm hey I see you got me an h-60 for
Christmas so go ahead and spin that
around get all the plastic off of it pop
it down use these boxes pop open on the
end and open up so it looks like this
one's going to do the same thing so good
over here go ahead and pop that cap on
the box yeah
and here we have it so right on top it
says stop do not return this product to
the store Nepos return or say produc
Elle magazine
Diaz put all the Nick in Christian
zerkin get a conviction I'm just kidding
around trying to spin these languages
pretty funny but basically it says don't
return this to the store return it to
them I'll get that out of the way got
your little warranty against defects
cards I wish I could get one of these
for some of my friends any way I can get
one of these upfront before I get
friends and warranty against defects no
probably not
then here we go right here just some
more solutions guide 2010 this is
probably is going to be a thing talking
about all their different products which
would it is talks about their power
supplies their cases all their good
stuff these guys make a lot of good
products from memory to SSDs the cases
you guys know Corsair has a strong
strong name in the business here's the
high-performance hydro CPU cooler
there's going to be the installation
quick guide a lot of people think
there's a lot to water cooling but this
is a very closed loop system and
actually installation is very very easy
you'll be surprised installation is
actually much easier than even your
standard air cooler so that's all this
stuff in here
not too much I'm not going to bore you
guys with that stuff because you install
you're going to learn it let's take a
look at the product itself
8:60 so got one more box in here that's
really about it so let the box off the
side go ahead and remove the unit
outside of the boob box here getting cut
so much on stuff here like get that out
of there little sucker alright so what
we got here what do we got here what do
we got whatever I got what we got yeah
all right so let's get this out of the
way we have all of the mounting screws
120 millimeter fan all the different
mounting brackets for AMD Intel Motorola
no just kidding so you guys can see we
have all that so whether you have AMD or
Intel you're in business
and then last but not least let's take a
look at the unit itself now you guys can
see this unit has a very very small
radiator it'll fit in just about
anything you're going to get to the back
of your system to the top of your system
very very easy so all you're really
doing with that as you see us here
here's the block and the pump this is
actually made by a company called ass
tech they do a lot of different
marketing for people and make products
they're one of the biggest names in the
industry here we can see the copper
bottom they've already got their thermal
compound on there so you don't need to
apply any of that all you have to do is
Mount it up put it on your unit and away
you go
fan controller and that's pretty much it
folks you guys get the unit the mounting
hardware the fan the screws and that's
it it's all right there you guys have it
now check this out this thing sells for
69 bucks but we've found it on sale for
60 bucks and you guys can check out that
link in the description below now a lot
of you guys have asked me what's really
doing between the H 55 in the 860 and I
can tell you that very easily the h-60
will cool better with the fan at lower
spinning speeds the H 55 you have to
turn the fans up to a much higher
caliber to get the same results so
basically the age 55 in the h6
work pretty similar but the h-60 will be
much quieter and more efficient if you
don't care about noise or anything you
want to save a few bucks
get the age 55 crank that fan up and
deal with it but those are the basic
differences so anyways folks I hope that
you guys enjoyed this video if so make
sure you hit that like button and show
me the love and let me know that you're
