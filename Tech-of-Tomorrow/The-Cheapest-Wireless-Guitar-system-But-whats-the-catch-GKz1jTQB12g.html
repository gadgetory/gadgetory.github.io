system but you're like heck I don't have
the money to buy one of those things
they're like hundreds of dollars well
how about if one was fifty bucks or even
better how about $25 today we're gonna
be checking out the m7 buy hoisin but
Before we jump into that let's hear a

out that link below and check out the
game today
lately I've been really trying to build
the Instagram side of things for tech of
tomorrow and in doing so I've noticed
that every day on there there's just a
crazy ton of ads by art by this by beef
jerky just by all kinds of stuff and
admittedly I've got sucked into a couple
of those things now I bought those
t-shirts with the samurai guys on them I
honestly wouldn't advise those t-shirts
so that really made that well they look
cool but they're like and I bought some
beef jerky beef jerky was okay but then
I saw this wireless transmitter for $49
by this company called hoisin and I was
like hmm
all right there's company out there
they're called B II gears they sell a
bunch of different
crazy musical gear and computer stuff
and all kinds of stuff and I saw this
and I was like alright well for $49 I
thought hey
I can jump into this and check it out if
it's not absolutely totally great it's
only fifty dollars right it's only fifty
bucks but by the end of this video I
think I'm actually gonna blow you guys
away when I tell you how much you guys
can get something just like this for a
lot lot less money so first off inside
the box there's not a whole lot of stuff
inside the box what you're going to get
is you're going to get the part that
plugs into your guitar the transmitter
you're going to get the receiver you're
going to get a dual charging now this is
pretty cool because once you plug it
into USB port you can actually charge
both of these devices at the same time
now to charge these devices up fully
takes about two hours they have a 700
milliamp hour battery inside of each one
so you're gonna get about seven hours of
playtime before you need a recharge on
and you know that's not bad at all now
the particular one that I bought that
costs $49 it did come with two of these
adapters so you can go from your quarter
inch jack down to the 3.5 millimeter you
know you can hook up a radio or stuff
like that if you want to do that and
hook it up and play it through your amp
why you'd really want to do that I don't
know but if you want to guess what you
can do it and you can do it wirelessly
and so some other facts about this
particular product a lot of these
products that I looked at online had a 6
millisecond delay time even some of the
ones that were 80 90 and $100 this
particular one only has a 4 millisecond
delay so we've talked about this before
you guys all know it takes a thousand
milliseconds to make a second so you
know 4 milliseconds out of that isn't
Jack doodlee so when you're playing what
you're hearing and your guitar is
exactly what you're hearing on your amp
there's actually no delay whatsoever now
these work off of UHF technology there's
actually some newer ones that work off
you know different type of technologies
these are UHF now one thing about this
though that you're going to notice as we
get into this is since it does use that
particular type of frequency when you're
not playing guitar through it it
actually makes quite a bit of crazy
noise
as does it's really loud when you're not
playing now once you're playing you
really don't notice that we'll show you
that as we get into it but when you're
not playing it's kind of noisy and
that's the one thing about this product
if people are gonna go hmmm that is no
no about that so with that said though
let's real quick let me show you guys
how easy this is to use all you do is
you plug one end into your amp and the
other into your guitar
turn on the lights until they're green
flip on the power and voila you are up
and going and playing now another thing
I found it's pretty cool is it says that
you can go about 30 meters away and keep
playing I was walking kind of down the
street from my house and it was still
playing no problem I will say this
though there were a couple of times
where it cuts out but then it
automatically refined the signal and
does it so even if you're playing live
you'd probably like you know if you went
really far in some crazy stage it might
cut out just for a second but for pretty
long distances it works so you could be
literally across the house and wall
don't seem to affect it whatsoever in
that regard at all it sounds ok
it really does what's your hearing the
guitar is exactly what you're hearing in
the amp I don't hear really any type of
difference in sound whatsoever between
plugging my plug in and using this
wireless system so as far as the sound
quality goes I would have to say it the
sound point in this particular product
is its it's spot on
it really is spot on the main caveat
about this particular product is when
you're not playing though it is very
loud it's like you know you're have a
high gain amp and you hear that noise
well this is like having our high game
amp you know all the time on without a
noise gate on and you just hear that
loud noise but as soon as you start
playing well that particularly noise you
don't really notice that whatsoever okay
so check this out everything is plugged
in we're up and we're going but like I
said when you're using your app in high
game on you know what I mean when it's
high again I've got everything turned up
on this completely all the way up the
volumes all the way up I've got my sound
attenuator on but if I turn the
high-gain on
it actually quiets down quite a bit now
when I play it doesn't really affect the
sound but me personally I think there's
too much flub without the high gain on
this particular amp I like the high gain
so I'm gonna turn it back on but check
this once I actually start playing you
really don't hear it that much
like I said before I can actually walk
now like I said before though you can go
quite a bit of ways away from the
amplifier though and still be able to
hear everything perfectly clearly now it
says up to 30
you know meters away I was able to walk
out my door and kind of down the street
and everything worked no problem so if
you in your house you'll want to play
upstairs or somewhere else and have your
amp cranked up like this you know you're
gonna be doing just fine for jamming
like I said to run the house so let's go
out and let's see how far I can go let's
go
now I said in the very beginning of the
video this particular product was $49
right right 49 bucks so for $49 I was
like hey this is actually a pretty
decent deal for people who are broke but
I found out something check this out
this is an OEM price so if you know what
that is that's Original Equipment
Manufacturer it means that this product
is made by a bunch of different
companies under a bunch of different
names and guess what under that same
umbrella
there's also gets wood a lot of
different pricing as well so check this
out
we've found a device just like this for
you guys our fans for twenty six dollars
that's right putting twenty six lousy
dollars to get a product like this so I
have to say if you can get one of these
for twenty six dollars
it is definitely a score and fifty
dollars it's still okay but at $26 come
on man it's a no-brainer I mean if
you're in your house you're just jamming
around you don't wanna have a cable to
trip over you just want something to
play with in here your guitar this is a
perfect solution for that is it for a
professional environment come on no it's
not not no Wayne this God's green earth
is it for recording environment come on
no frickin way
but can you Jam around your house with
your guitar wirelessly and spend under
30 bucks frak yeah you can and you can
do it with this little device now like
usual I will have a link down below
where you guys can check out the product
I'll have a link to the be a Gears one
as well but I will have a link to the
$26 now the only difference between the
$26 one and this particular product is
these particular adapters right here
they are not in the box and real quick
for those people keep asking what
happened to my finger I was on my way
into my hospital on my new scooter and a
car turned around and hit me and my
finger got caught between the brake
caliper and the handlebar and literally
almost cut my finger off had have bunch
of stitches it still hurts like a mother
but it's healing and I'll be back to
normal when it's really trippy is I
actually learned how to play my guitar
and an alternate picking method without
using this finger which I was kind of
surprised so I thought well this fingers
like means everything but no I was able
to do it so at the end of the day you
want a wireless guitar system
you don't want to spend a bunch of money
on it come on 26 bucks is literally
throw away money and the product has a
halfway decent warrant they think most
of them have like you know at least a
30-day warrantee some have a year
warranty so even if it works that long
for that amount of money your wireless
ah the noise it sucks but I can deal
with it for that price I'm Miller you
guys been watching Tech tomorrow make
sure you check the links down below
we'll have links to today's sponsors
Game+ this product for like I said 26
bucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
