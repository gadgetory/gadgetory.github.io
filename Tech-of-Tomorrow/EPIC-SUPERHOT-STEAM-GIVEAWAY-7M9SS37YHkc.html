love to gain but sometimes having that
extra cash to get an extra game can be a
real frickin bitch because let's face it
if you've got no dough you can't buy
yourself a new game and always expecting
just to be able to pirate one isn't
always the best thing in the world so
here taking tomorrow we realize there's
lots of gamers out there who want to
play killer games but can't afford them
now I was just introduced to a really
crazy crazy fucking game called super
hot now this game is a $25 title on
steam but is one of the most unique and
weirdest freakin games you're ever going
to see because for one thing I just got
to say you guys can see the gameplay
look the graphics look at it in a way
almost retro I'm he call this game a
retro game man because you're basically
supposed to be playing a game but you're
inside of a game doing another game
which is kind of crazy right but that's
kind of the story of thing your insider
game playing a game and so you're in
this like weird 8-bit environment but
what the really trippy thing is is that
all the vectors and dynamics are trippy
because nothing moves unless you move so
if you're not moving the game's not
moving and the learning curve of trying
to hit these guys with bottles and guns
and stuff it's pretty damn fun just
playing on the game for a couple of
hours got me and got me going pretty
damn good and Jesus really loved the
game quite a bit as well I had to
actually pull his ass off but to film
this video because he wanted to play
more so you guys know this is a really
really freakin fun title and I'm going
to be really cool this time so this is
how it's going to go soap a fucking
attention okay lock your mind in here
I'm not giving out a bunch of other
games i'm giving away 30 codes of super
hot that's right that's a lot of money
you think about it every one of those is
two hundred and fifty dollars so that's
seven hundred and fifty dollars of the
free games so I'm going to be honest
with you if I see the negative comments
building up I'm just going to cancel the
video I'm not going to give you guys
shit because I'm tired of getting shit
on myself by people when I do giveaways
and spend money out of my pocket just to
get a fuck you from the audience so if
you want to leave a bunch of negative
comments if I see those negative
comments if they reach anywhere near
even 200 i'm going to count
this video and I'm not going to give
away anything at all so just know that
right off the bat now I'm not going to
be pulling the winners from my almost
600,000 people that subscribe to my
channel because for one thing my subs
don't count anymore and half the people
out there don't even see my videos
that's another thing you want to make
sure that you have you know everything
turned on your site to let you know
notification so that when I do film a
video that you guys will actually see
the video that's one thing so right off
the bat the only people that are going
to qualify to win the game are people
who are sub to the channel and people
who leave a comment down below now also
you can be a lazy turd and just leave a
comment and go comment but I'm gonna be
honest with you when I go through and I
go to those comments to randomly pick
them I usually pick ones that make me
laugh or something because why wouldn't
I if you took the time to leave a more
interesting comment why wouldn't I be
more inclined to be drawn towards your
comment than just comment so I'm just
being completely straight with you guys
like you guys know me I'm know if I no
bullshit attitude so this is how it is
now I'm going to be picking 10 winners
here on YouTube can once again on
Twitter and then can again once again on
Facebook that's how it's going to be so
we have multiple chances to win all over
the place you can get your titles if you
guys see I'm always giving us stuff that
I don't do bullshit I don't do run a
contest and not give anybody their stuff
you can see the thank yous on Twitter
and everything going on that I always
give the games out to you guys
regardless of what goes on so let's just
rego over this whole damn thing again
we're given some copies of superhot away
now like I told you guys this game is
really incredible I think you're really
going to like it it's fun it's intense
the learning curve is kind of crazy and
the way like i said the way that you do
things in the game is different than any
other game that you've ever seen out
there so if you want to title that is
great ratings and it doesn't want a lot
of awards and you want to get it for
free then hey take the time to be sub to
the channel and leave a comment down
below the winner will be picked from the
comments below the same thing on Twitter
the winners we picked from the comments
on Twitter and on Facebook the winners
will be picked by facebook and like I
said if I see a bunch of negative
comments when i'm trying to do you guys
a favor and give games away I'll just
cancel this thing out because it's
honestly it's rude to me why should I go
out and spend money out of my pocket
just to get shit on by the audience and
people that I'm trying to help it just
makes no sense
oh you'd be cool I'll be cool we can all
be a big love and give it to their big
virtual hundreds a big virtual hugs all
my fans all the people out there beyond
that that's it man locked the titles
super hot this shit's pretty much the
most giant steam giveaway ever peace out
like usual we'll have stuff down below
it for some freaking reason you didn't
get it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
