here with another unboxing this is going
to be the XFX Radeon HD 6870 video card
here we have the new XFX Radeon HD 6870
video card this is a 2 gigabyte card and
features PCI Express 2.0 on and as you
can see it comes in a really nice box
lots of information on the sides and on
the back and let me go ahead and open it
up and show you what we've got inside on
the top here
and like the most xox's cards it's a box
and box really nice black box here's a
little template talks about their power
supplies there's their warranty
information you've got a quick install
guide information about the drivers CD
and the install guide your software and
your driver I highly recommend you
download the drivers directly from the
website and not use the discs because
the ones on the website are probably new
or anyway here we have the card itself
in a nice anti-static bag
as you can see it's actually a rather
small card but these 68 70s are very
very nice cards turn around for you so
you take a look at it there are your two
6-pin PCI connectors to power the card
there's your i/o two DVI connectors HDMI
and two mini DisplayPort and as you can
see it's got a nice fan and heatsink
solution with a nice plastic shroud and
this has been the unboxing of the XFX
HD 6870 2 gig video card thank you so
much for watching and don't forget to
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
