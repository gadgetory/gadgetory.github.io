finally hit the shelves and for once we
are seeing our TX and DL SS actually
showing improvements in the game that's
right which i think is really pretty
cool now we're going to actually see our
TX and DL SS working together making
your games not only look more
hyper-realistic but also improving the
frames per second across the board which
is really quite insane now if you guys
don't know what Metro is metros been a
long round a quite a long time in fact a
while back we actually dedicated an
entire system around the Metro theme
which was really really cool the system
came out really nice if you guys would
like to see us maybe bring that system
back and do a revival leave a comment
down below and we'll actually get that
system out just enough and make some
changes and show you what's going on so
today we're going to be testing all of
the cards on the nvidia side of things
the 2080 TI the 2080 the 27 and the 2060
all these are the arts he x variants now
as far as our test system goes I decided
to stick with an i7 8700 K for the CPU
the reason I did this and didn't move up
to an i9 CPU is I figured there's so
many people out there right now that
have the i7 87 entertain their system
it's probably gonna be probably excuse
me the most dominant CPU that we're
going to be seeing out there so we're
sticking with that CPU in fact we have a
brand new test but as you guys can see
here it looks really really nice we've
got a nice asus motherboard we've got a
very nice liquid cooler on here we've
got 32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory just all
in all a decked out system boot-up
drives as an SSD and as far as the
storage goes we have a single 2 terabyte
Seagate Barracuda Drive and everything
runs really great now at the time of
this review we're using all the latest
drivers that are available from Nvidia
we're also using all of the latest
updates for Windows 10 so everything is
completely updated for the day with that
said though let's jump in let's listen
to the new Ben
Mark's song and let's see the
differences between RTX and DLS on and
off and see how it improves the game and
not only makes it go faster makes it
look better as well let's rock
okay so you guys can see that there are
a few missing scores currently both the
2080 Ti and the 2018 either one of those
cards is able to perform with the DL SS
and stuff on this is a temporary setback
NVIDIA has already said they're
addressing this and very soon those
issues will be over with one of the
reasons I didn't even bother testing in
4k is I'll be making video as well
because 4k gaming I think is probably
just pretty much a waste of time
it really doesn't improve your game
experience really all that much
whatsoever if you're running at 1440 and
you've got all the bells and whistles
going you're going to be playing your
game and it's going to be looking great
there's absolutely no reason for 4k but
like I said at this time you guys can
see the 28 CI and the 2080 aren't doing
the 1080p scores but that's a minor
thing that'll be adjusted now as far as
the scores go though you guys can see
though even in 1440p though we're
getting up to 10 frames per second more
in-game which is just amazing and the
whole the real thing about r-tx and DL
SS is a combination of not only making
your game Wow okay I don't if you guys
were watching the video this guy would
never answer me whatsoever transform
that's still ain't gonna listen to me
this guy never listened to me I was
pretty funny when I'm talking the video
where all of a sudden he listened to me
mom first crowd would see hi t9
transform transform t9 unbelievable
maybe he's learning my voice after all
but anyways you guys happen to miss the
video and this you guys should check it
out they've actually fixed all of the
drivers and everything for the control
panel so now this little robot guy does
completely work so I'll bring you know
guys another video and my first video
was just kind of a joke because it was
he what kind of Mark from marques
Brownlee so we made a joke of it but now
it's ready for primetime so bring you
guys another video but back to the Metro
Exodus it's actually showing Nvidia's
technology now to be working pretty much
a lot of the other games that came out
and we were doing the testing I had to
go that's kind of ho-hum it's kind of
it's okay but now I can say okay with a
thumbs
yes using the new technology the games
not only look better they play better
and that's really what everybody out
there is really looking for a balance
between having their game have all the
bells and whistles and everything on now
I know some people are maybe with a
comical I'm getting better scores than
that unless you're setting up your
system to the exact same settings that
we are matching them t40 you know you
can't really say that you're getting
better scores we turn everything up to
its absolute maximum value so that
everything set as high as it can be if
there's an ultra plus setting we'd be
using that setting and that's what it is
and so sometimes you guys might say hey
your numbers are a little lower than
ours Oh Oracle that's because we're
setting everything to its absolute
maximum settings if it's on there
whether they're tears or whatever
anything that's on there that's gonna
make the game look its best is what
we're gonna have enabled when we bring
you those scores so you guys can see
Metro Exodus the game is out it's a cool
game he's into the first-person shooter
genre you really might enjoy this game a
lot I've seen so many first-person
shooter games it's kind of a rehash in a
way to me plus I've seen so many of the
metro games but still there are a lot of
people out there that are new to gaming
jumping into gaming and they've never
really seen r-tx stuff so if you're new
to the scene you'll be a lot more
excited than people that have been
around forever like me but the
technology's there
RTX &amp;amp; DLS are now working yes we can see
it Metro Exodus is looking really really
nice now hopefully they're gonna fix
everything so we'll be able to play
those games in 1080 and get that same
great performance boost like usual we'll
have a link down below to the games if
you guys want to check out that game or
buy a copy for yourself or get one of
the video cards that we use in this
video for yourself you can do so we'll
have some links down there for you to
choose from as whoo if you're not
subscribed to channel the hey please
subscribe the channel we appreciate it
we also a patreon site where you can
help and you could actually help support
the channel for as low as two dollars a
month and last but not least hey if your
notifications aren't on you won't be
notified about the video so you won't
know what's going on here at Echo
tomorrow I'm Elric peace out everybody
we'll see you guys back on here for more
tech on techo tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
