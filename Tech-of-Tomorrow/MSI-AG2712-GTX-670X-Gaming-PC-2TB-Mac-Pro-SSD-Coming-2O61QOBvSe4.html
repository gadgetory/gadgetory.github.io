tomorrow we're always bringing you the
latest in tech goodness what's going on
today well first off me you people know
about the aio this is Intel's all-in-one
systems now these things have never
really been geared for gaming they've
been geared for multimedia use you know
watching movie stuff like that checking
your internet checking your email that
kind of gizmo but now msi has taken it a
step forward with their new agey 2712
this is a fully blown touchscreen gaming
all-in-one this thing is going to be
really cool for one thing you're going
to have a discrete video card a 670 X
which should pretty much power most
games with mega frame rates you should
have no problem playing any game on this
system now you'll be able to get this
thing in a multitude of colors the front
bezel that's going to be able to be
changed out you're going to be able to
get I five I seven different Ram
configurations you've got two USB ports
3.0 two USB ports two point oh you also
get ethernet Wi-Fi headphone jacks all
that kind of stuff and a fully blown
touch screen now the touch screens
really really cool especially people out
there use windows 8 and windows 8 is
actually included on this so if you guys
would like to see some pictures or some
more information about this make sure
you guys check out the link in the
description below I have my full blown
article written about this new product
from MSI it sure looks cool so far next
up for you guys out there who into
camera technology nikon is releasing
their brand new cool pics a now this is
a totally different move for the people
at nikon it brings them into a totally
different market most cameras have a one
inch sensor this one has a totally much
larger sensor a much much better lens
and all-around is geared to be one of
the best top cameras that are out there
that are smart cameras this thing's come
in and marketed about a thousand dollars
but it has all kinds of features that
have not been seen before on a nikon
camera
now I've also written another article on
this where you guys can check out all
those features and all those things
about this and see if you're interested
in it I think for a thousand dollars
it's a little bit pricey but if it is
the ultimate little point and shoot
little camera all in a little package I
think it's going to be something to look
into now last up rumors rumors rumors
all concerning Apple what are the rumors
about well it seems like the people over
a bright side of news of the leaked a
story saying that it's possible that
Apple is actually doing their own
development on a new two terabyte SSD
Drive now I kind of find that hard to
believe myself I think this is going to
be pretty much be a rumor because apples
never really been in the development
side of things they take other people's
products and they implement them into
their systems I can see them going and
working with another company but here's
the thing i don't know if any people out
there have ever brought a mac pro and
that's actually what this product is
geared for it's geared for the new Mac
Pro refresh that we're supposed to see
some time in 2013 but if it's a
Christmas time at 2013 it might as
well be 2014 and that's what i'm
thinking i'm also very very disappointed
in mac all together for not doing a
fresher refresh on this mac pro so what
do you guys think I mean I'm thinking
anyways if Mac does hit this product to
the market how much is it going to cost
because like I said earlier if any of
you guys have ever went and configured a
system online anything you buy from them
with us a hard drive memory video card
you miles us bend over and just you know
grab your ankles man because Apple is
going to give it to you that's a fact so
I think you're either got to sell your
arm your leg your soul to Satan but
something in order to even be able to
afford that what do you guys think I
want to hear you guys opinion and I know
it's funny I heard some of you guys say
if I wanted to read i buy a book but hey
at least I don't do like other people
and just force you to do it I give the
opportunity it's there so if you guys
want to check out any of the goodness or
more height in-depth stuff about these
articles and about these products then
check out the link in the description
below we will take you over to wwt coda
marcom where you can do some reading and
check out these articles and they're
full blown intentions with that said I
hope you guys like this video if so make
sure you hit that like button and show
me that love
we'll see you guys back around tech
