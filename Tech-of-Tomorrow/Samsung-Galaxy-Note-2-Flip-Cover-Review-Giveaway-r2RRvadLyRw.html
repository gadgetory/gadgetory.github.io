Tuesday October 30th the day before
halide now what are we doing well in
case you guys missed it last week I went
to New York and I got to be a part of
the brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 2
launch that's right it was really cool
stuff make sure you check that out and
that said they were having products
there that they were giving away for
people who actually owned the phone so
they gave us a phone therefore we own
the phone and we got some samples of
this brand new foot cover which is
really awesome for this phone so let's
check it out I got two of them all you
have to do is pop off the back of your
note 2 and you pop on the new one this
is the one that I have for mine I really
like the color this one all titanium
everything just a really nice flat cover
very easy and simple to use like I said
pop it on pop it off now with that said
I actually have an extra one I have a
white one right here in my hand inside
of it I've enjoyed brains of the camera
it's very nice and soft and smooth it
actually is like a nice felt thing so
that it keeps your screen from getting
any kind of dust or any kind of problems
on it whatsoever you guys can see the
plastics right here you just pop it on
like I said now I also want to give this
away because someone out there who owns
this phone would really like to own this
so please this giveaway is only for
someone who actually owns the phone if
you don't own the phone please don't
play game because I'm requiring one of
two ways for you to win this you either
can go over to Facebook and make a post
showing a picture of your camera and yes
I can tell whether it's some jived
picture or not and then you can either
make a video of it and between those
people I'm gonna pick one and give them
this it's worldwide I just want to make
sure that the products not wasted
because it's not worth a lot of money
but if you actually own the phone it's
actually something really cool and not
yet totally available so I thank
everybody out there to completely be
honest you guys know I love you
if you liked the video please like it
always subscribe to tech Itamar so you
make sure you don't miss any of the
exciting stuff that's going on and well
I'll see you guys tomorrow on Halloween
we're gonna have something exciting to
announce to you folks so until then mmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
