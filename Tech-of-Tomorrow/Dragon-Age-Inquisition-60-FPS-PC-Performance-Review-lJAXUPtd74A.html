to another edition of Tech Audemar we're
like we promised we brought to you all
the pieces performance of Dragon Age
Inquisition and me personally really dug
the first one second less kind of
garbage and the jury's out on how the
third one is now why do you guys are
always asking what are we testing on
what sitting with an i7 4770k 16
gigabytes of ddr3 and we got an MSI GTX
780 video card now we also test the game
on low medium high and ultra and with
that said let's jump in and let's check
out the performance what you're really
here for
now these are the only four preset
setting options available in the game
and what you're seeing here the average
frame rates during combat in non-combat
scenes you would see a 15 to 20 frames
per second increase so that's it folks
what do you guys think now right off the
bat I'd like to know from you people out
there who actually own the game what you
guys think of the game and for those out
there who don't own it but you want to
own it down below that like but in the
description we'll have all the details
where you can get yourselves a hot copy
of Dragon Age Inquisition for me and

now with that said are you guys watching
the video where you guys looking at my
cool glasses but in all seriousness
