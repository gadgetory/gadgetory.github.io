tomorrow I'm Elric your host and today
we've got something interesting on the
table now a few weeks back we all know
that the RX 40 came out from AMD and it
was touted as the budget King but like
usual there's always competition so now
in videos released their budget card the
brand-new GTX 1060 so now let's see who
really is the budget King let the battle
begin so first off folks
let's compare specs the GTX 1060 comes
with 1280 CUDA cores
however the our X 480 comes with 2,304
stream processors the RAM in the GTX
1060 is 6 gigabytes of gddr5 and on the
RX 40 the card that we tested is the 8
gigabyte model also featuring gddr5
memory and as far as the core and Boo
speeds go of the gtx 1060 has a 1,500
base clock with a boost to 1700 the RX 4
80
has 1120 base at a boost to 12 66 and
the memory speed on both is exactly the
same both cards feature 8 gigabytes per
second so they're equal in that respect
now as far as the overclocking goes
didn't get a whole lot of time to spend
on that but our preliminary results are
actually incredible without even
increasing the voltage we've been able
to get 200 megahertz over the core and
the memory 700 megahertz higher and this
is actually really great scaling for
this card and with further time I'm sure
can be pushed even farther another thing
you guys might notice is the gtx 1060
does not do sli there's no sli finger
however the RX 480
does do crossfire power requirements are
very very low on both cards now you have
a 150 watts is what they're recommending
for the RX 480
but you guys saw that we were running
that with a 500 watt power supply with
absolutely no problems at all
and now we're seeing the same thing with
the gtx 1060 it only requires a 120
watts of power draw pretty awesome and
both cards also feature a single 6 pin
power connector on their base models
depending on your system how big a card
is may come into play so let's check
that out
as well the GTX 1060 size is in at 10
inches long by 4 inches high and
features a dual slot design the RX 480
is 9.5 inches long by 4 inches high and
also features a dual slot design and
real quick before we get into the battle
let's check out the test system and for
those of you wondering which drivers do
we use we use the absolute latest
releases from both Nvidia and AMD and
now it's time to rock out to the
benchmark zone let's go
so alright there you guys have it the
numbers are out and I gotta say that I'm
pretty surprised because you guys can
see that even though the GTX 1060 is
winning it's only by a wee bit now the
price these cards will be $2.99 for the
Founders Edition and 249 for aftermarket
partner cards which we have a bunch
coming for you guys to check out in the
following week but at the end of the day
I gotta say these cards are both around
the $249 price range and although the
Nvidia card only has six gigabytes of
RAM compared to the eight gigabytes it's
on the RX 480
you guys can see these numbers are real
close so if you're an AMD fan out there
and you love Andy stuff obviously you're
going to want to stick with the rx 40
for your budget card but if you're an
Nvidia diehard fan hey you can see this
card wins by just the OE margin I'm over
you guys been watching teka tomorrow
like usual down below like button love
information all these cars feed to
purchasers check out for yourself and
follow us this week as we show you
massive gameplay on the gtx 1060 see you
