cool about the max keyboard people is
not only do they sell custom keyboards
they make a ton of products for
customizing your keyboard now not only
these guys send me their keyboard they
actually sent me two modification kits
along with the keyboard so I got this
keyboard and then to completely set up
different caps that I can put on top to
modify it and make it my own way
this thing's coming to market about a
hundred and forty nine dollars let's

as possible the keyboard is not going to
freak out illuminated characters with
four levels of brightness dimming light
50 macro keys so the guy's not through
like to program all their up to
play those games you get 15 macro keys
you also get a game and PC mode switch
which means that your viewers using your
keyboard for a standard keyboard to type
it's one way you want to game it's
another way headphone out and microphone
in jacks for those type people like that
and media keys that way if you've been
want to play your music hit a button on
the keyboard and do all that stuff to
USB port outs and gold plated connectors
that's the front of the box
I'm kind of going a little l√©na on this
folks as we've never actually seen these
products before here we're taking a look
at the back of the box to Matt the
cameramen zoom in right here so you guys
can take a look at that you guys can see

basically all this stuff here I'm not
gonna ramble on it but I'm gonna have
the cameraman zoom in there just you can
see it Cherry MX mechanical switches

all the stuff that we talked about in
the front over here we see the system
requirements it works with Windows 8
Windows 7 Windows Vista and Windows XP
takes an available USB port and 50
megabytes of hard to space for the
drivers inside the box it says we get
the keyboard the guide and a wrist pad
so with that said let's actually quit
talking and let's show the product okay
folks have you heard that that was
actually me unboxing the box in the box
smacking me in the face and hitting the
microphone fun stuff here at Echo
tomorrow that's right let's go ahead and
open this up and Wow okay like I told
you guys before these guys are really
really pushing their keyboards to have
multiple multiple caps so you can change
them out do whatever you want so now
that I've got the Box open though let's
just start taking a look at everything
now right up to bat you can see we've
got extra keys they're all customizable
they have little images on them of
different things more of them a little
dice these are all dice ones one two
three four five six all dicey looking
all kinds of little run washers they're
more customizable keys these ones all
look like little clocks very interesting
stuff there more stuff eyes your waa-waa
SD a little different there eh okay
interesting I guess that all this is
though that's a different type of way to
do your keys huh WASD in a different
type of way very interesting I even
stopped for a second here we even get to
this must be a little strapped thing
here's the thing to remove all of the
keys right there this is a beyond limits
max little strapping the five here to
keep your cabling out of the way that's
probably what that's for so go ahead and
pop that out here
the max keyboard Nighthawk backlit
mechanical keyboard this is their little
manual and everything there users guide
just tells more about their stuff how to
hook it up you guys obviously know that
you're gonna have to hook up the 3.5
millimeter headphone and microphone jack
do you want to be able to hear that and
use your microphone it also tells you
how to switching on your backlit keys
gives you instructions on how to do that
because they don't know so it gives you
instructors right there how to turn it
on that's pretty much that
keyboard nice and bunched up nicely in
there we'll go ahead and pull that out
now you guys haven't seen it a while and
since the same cameras back we're gonna
throw it at the camera again that's
right go back to the old days and
throats hit the cameraman that's right
oh wow hey folks I gotta tell you right
now I just felt that wrist pad so let me
just get this stuff out of the way here
all right so let's talk differently
folks check this out now I've gotten a
lot of questions in the past about hey
man where did you get your wrist pad
your wrist pads like so cool and I don't
even see what's that it's somewhere in
here
I hope it's somewhere in here did you go
in shuffled somewhere but check this out
totally soft I mean this is really
bitchin I'm giving you guys right now I
got to you Mac's keyboard this is
frakkin bitchin super totally frickin
soft man I'm liking this I hate those
ugly painful plastic ones this is so
soft and so nice all right so now I've
got the product completely out of the
box showed you guys the nice wrist rest
gold-plated hardware USB 3.5 milimeter
3.5 millimeter braided cable very very
long cable actually as well let me go
ahead and just get the cable out there
pulled it out I will see how good long
it is does that matter sometimes you
know where you place your keyboard there
might not be a lot of room and yeah this
looks like it's easily almost a six foot
cable so it's very very long in fact
I'll go ahead and get that out of the
way and plug it in over here
turn the computer on and we'll see when
the keyboard lights up so here we see
the keyboard itself like they said
Cherry MX switches all the way around
it's very very ergonomic looking and the
way that it's set up is kind of like an
old-school IBM keyboard I don't know if
you guys remember those now we've got it
lit up everything's very very easy
accessible across the top as you guys
can see this is actually not much
different at all from a standard IBM
keyboard which is really good IBM to me
made some of the best keyboards ever
this doesn't go too much out of the way
and really with the keyboard how crazy
do you want to get in the design you
don't want to reinvent the wheel by any
means whatsoever so my system just
booting up into Windows there we go you
guys can hear the old windows thing as
we boot in I'm not gonna install those
drivers everything on that but up here
on top you guys can see easily lit up
all your different stuff is right there
then on the back right here I've gotten
a little sticker I'm gonna go ahead and
take the sticker out it says note the
maximum current capacity of the USB port
is a hundred milliamps do not exceed or
use as a charging power supply so
they're saying that with these
particular plugs in the back here do not
plug your phone or anything like that
this is strictly for your peripherals so
we'll go ahead and pull that off there
what you guys can see we have two USB
ports the headphone and microphone 3.5
millimeter Jack are all located there as
well I'll go ahead just put the sticker
back on there now you guys can see the
keyboard it's very thin it's not big and
bulky here on the bottom we have the max
keyboard name we've got two little
pivots right here to pivot and angle
your keyboard soft rubber feet right
here and rubber on the bottom of these
as well seven you flip the keyboard back
over it's it's easy like that
and your wrist rest goes underneath
there and away you go
so can you dig it can you dig yeah 149
bucks
totally mechanical this thing's pretty
ergonomic I really do like the fact that
you're going to be able to basically
change the keys off make it any way that
you guys want to see now also for a list
of those different types of products and
stuff we'll have that down there below
the like but in the description where
you guys can see all the information
because these guys have actually a lot
of different configurations and
keyboards to look at even beyond this
one but this one was the Nighthawk I
think it's pretty badass it's right that
good price range about $149 which is
kind of where all of the higher-end ones
are some even go you know up to the two
hundred three hundred dollar range some
a little bit lower but this is right in
that kind of perfect spot or where
mechanical keyboards are at hope you
guys liked this video so you know what
to do I'm Eric we'll see you guys back
there on Tekken tomorrow don't forget to
sub if you like what you seen I'm out of
here
