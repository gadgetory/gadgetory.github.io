by Terminator Genisys future war The
Terminator he said he'll be back and now
he's back this time in an amazing mobile
game and now I'm back I'm here you're
here so it's our time I don't the
totally shitty Terminator voice I can't
really do Arnold Schwarzenegger that
well I do really well as impersonation
this do that work though freaking
awesome impersonation that dude tell me
impersonate him today so I'll be the
impersonator of Elric doing Elric yeah
okay well anyways everybody likes a
really nice set of ear buds to listen to
their music you're talking on the phone
and doing all that good stuff so today
we've brought you five different sets
for under $50 and each one has its own
unique things about them that make them
really cool you'll even notice that one
of these headphones was given to him by
a video when I went to one of their
events but I just liked them so much I
figured hey I'd share those with you as
well a couple of them we bought a couple
more cent but with that said though
let's jump in and let's check out the
top 5 ear buds in August 2017 let's go
first up we have a nice set of cherry
wood headphones made by a company called
Omar's now these are really really nice
ear buds they also feature a high
definition microphone a 3.5 millimeter
jack that can be used with any iPhone
iPad car kit you guys know what I mean
pretty much anything has a 3.5
millimeter jack now the good thing about
these headphones is they're vintage
wooden style FCS certified natural
cherrywood headphones and what
cherrywood does it gives you a very
natural sound what I mean by that is
like certain plastics or certain things
they can either dampen your sound
brighten your sound or just change your
sound a little bit but having wood is a
very very nice neutral and natural sound
the omar's are also very very
comfortable and they come with two
different sets of earbuds to fit
different sized ears the controls for
the a3 earbuds are very conveniently
located on the left hand side of your
earbuds you have a one-click control for
answering your phone play pause and your
next track the Omar's also come with a
very convenient carrying case so when
you're not using them you can put them
in the case and keep them safe from harm
and the a3 s also come with a one-year
warranty and a 30
payback money guarantee I know it's hard
on video to show you guys sonically how
these headphones sound but if you guys
like headphones that have really nice
low frequencies solid based solid mids
this might be the actually best set of
earbuds you've ever purchased next up we
have the a MIDI wireless earbuds now the
a MIDI earbuds are really made for those
people who are totally on the go I mean
they're made not to fall off yours or
also if you're jogging at the gym doing
that kind of stuff that's totally where
these headphones are geared they feature
eight hours of battery life bluetooth
4.2 connections the M&amp;amp;E headphones are
also very comfortable and one thing
unique about them is that one set can be
slave to the other set so you can use
the controls that are located
conveniently on the outside of each
earbud so it doesn't matter once you
connect them together whether you
control it from the right ear or the
left ear so if you're right-handed
person or a left-handed person you'll
easily be able to operate them and
that's pretty good you're at the gym
where you're running around you're doing
something and you don't want to reach in
your pocket Nats your phone it's a
really good thing when you can just
reach up and click a button and be able
to do that all the other controls are
there as well so you'll have your pause
play all that wrestle so if you need to
listen to your audio all located on the
outside of the ear but which is pretty
convenient and one thing it's kind of
unique is you can charge these in two
different ways you either charge them
directly through the cable and into the
headphone or you can pull this headphone
off and then plug this directly into the
charger it's kind of neat and even when
you wear these headphones for a long
period of time you really don't feel way
down they still feel pretty good even
after a couple of hours of worrying them
the only thing you might notice a little
bit is this rubbing about the back of
your ear but it's not too you know it's
not really something to oh I hate that
now inside the box you get the
headphones themselves a power cable
instruction guide and in two different
sets of earbuds to fit inside whatever
ear size you have another nice thing
about these headphones is their sweat
proof and water resistant that doesn't
mean you can jump in a pool and they're
not going to get ruined but if it's
raining you'll be just fine
now this next set of headphones I
actually received as a gift when I went
to the Nvidia vent and these are the
cronies and the ones that are really
small are both these and the omar so if
you're looking for a really really small
set of earbuds
these would be really nice now these
feature true wireless technology up to
33 feet of a wireless range up to 3
hours of audio playtime they feature a
built-in microphone and all of your
controls are inner so you have play
pause call control everything is located
very conveniently and what you get in
the box inside of the cronies is a
charging cord 3 ear tips and a carry
pouch so check it out like I said these
particular set were actually given to me
by Nvidia at event but I was actually so
impressed with the sound that I was like
heck I got to do a video and on these
things anything make sure they're
included because they're very nice and
like I said earlier you can see these
things are very very small
extremely low footprint on your ear now
I don't know if I'd really go running
down the street but if you're just at
the gym doing casual things they're
pretty good but I like a best about
these is that the highs and mids on
these are very very nice so if you're a
person who looks into more contemporary
type of music if you like especially
like classical music anything that isn't
like you know the total thumping stuff
heavy metal sounds really good on these
as well to be honest with you heavy
metal sounds really nice the guitars are
nice and clear but if you're looking for
something that's like something like
soul music or like some of the some of
the new rap and that kind of music
I don't really know things would be
actually your favorite it would buy
between between the omar's and another
one if you like those type of things but
for me I let's new a lot of metal I also
like bands like Steely Dan and I listen
to like neoclassical music with guitar
and all that type of classical music and
stuff just sounds really nice on these
headphones and so I just thought I'd
bring them to you guys if you ever get a
chance you should honestly check these
out
if you like some with a small footprint
you like more of the higher-end
frequencies and stuff and a nice clarity
these bad boys are nice so check this I
know you guys dig gaming just as much as
you dig killer headphones right so let's
check out a word from today's sponsor
that's Terminator Genisys future war
future war is the very first mobile game
where you choose to play who you want to
play you can either be human the
resistance or the machine Skynet this
game features epic battles between men
and machines every day you will
never get bored now terminator genisys
future war is not only a game you can
play by yourself it's also really cool
just to hang with your friends in-game
and just chill out and have fun and
what's best of all right now you can
download the game be in my link in the
description below and get a hundred and
fifty coins that will boost your in-game
progress by a hundred percent so get
your game on
humans need to stand together and we
plan a massive invasion on the enemy
base this week download the game now and
let's punish the enemy together okay I
hope you guys really dig that game the
fun thing about that game though is that
you can get together with a bunch of
your friends just like League of Legends
and play online and talk a mass amount
of with that said though our next
product kind of sounds Italian it's from
smartphone II I don't think they make
ice cream now the smart Tony's our
Bluetooth headphones and they actually
market their product as a sports
wireless earphone big features silicone
ear hooks they also have noise
cancellation features a built-in
microphone premium bass sounds their
sweat proof may feature 10-hour play
times so you'll run out of energy well
before the gym does inside the box of
the smart tell me you get a nice little
carry bag the headsets themselves some
different size earbuds to fit those
different sized ear canals and last but
not least the charging cable the smart
tummy headphones also feature something
like the headphones that we've seen
earlier they have these little tiny
hooks he's a silicone hooks that hook on
your ears now these particular ones are
pretty good I think that if you ran
really hard down a hill or something
they may come off but the nice thing
about this though they're very very
light weight and like I said before if
you're worried about where they're going
to fit in your ears they come with extra
ear cups they'll fit inside your ears
without a problem whatsoever
play pause answer all those controls are
conveniently located on the left ear
hook and on the bottom of the left ear
cup is where you charge the headphones
there's a microUSB port located there
the smart domains have a very long long
playtime due to their 100 milli hour amp
battery this says up to 10 hours of
constant play and it only requires an
hour and a half to fully recharge the
battery these headphones also feature a
45 day no reason return policy and a one
warranty these headphones feature the
availability to connect to device at the
same time you may listen to your music
finger tablet without missing phone
calls from your cell phone and last but
not least are the grd wireless earbuds
that come in this convenient little case
in fact of a bunch these the only ones
that actually come in a case like this
that's pretty cool now these are also
geared for people that are on the go not
necessarily so much for the gym because
I think the ones that the hooks are
actually the best ones for doing stuff
like that because if you're moving up
and down and bouncing around you want
something that's going to be you know
held in place with more than just being
inside your ear canal you know what I
mean so inside the box you get the case
itself a carrying strap two different
sizes of earbuds for different sized
ears now the gr des do come with the
type of ear hook but they're not over
the ear they're the kind of lock on your
inner ear and these don't really work
that great when you're jogging and stuff
like that but they are uber comfortable
and last but not least it comes with the
USB charging cable out of the headphones
that we looked at today I told you guys
that the cronies were the very smallest
well these are the second smallest of
the bunch they're just a little bit
bigger than the cronies but they're just
as comfortable these headphones feature
the latest addition of bluetooth 4.1 +
edr now this allows for faster pairing a
much Stabler connection and a higher
level of noise cancelling than you see
in most in ear headphones the GR DES
also feature two different listening
modes they have dual ear mode and single
ear mode the dual your pieces will work
individually or in a pair you can
actually pair two of the mini earbuds in
double or share one with your friend
these headphones also feature a variable
playback time between three and five
hours with a hundred and twenty five
hours of standby time the GR DES also
feature a single multifunction button to
control them with one push of a button
you can pair play pause answer or reject
phone calls and these headphones are
also designed to work with any Bluetooth
device and for those people who go to
the gym and sweat their ass off working
out these also feature a sweat proof
design the grd headphones are pretty
much right in the middle of everything
we talked at today to riot the mid level
of comfort to riot the mid level of
sound they don't feature too much treble
they don't feature too much
basse they're just really right down the
middle very very flat speakers they're
also pretty doggone comfortable and
they're the second smallest of the
entire bunch but best of all every
single one of these sets of headphones
that we showed you today are under $50
and all of them sound very excellent
none of them are junk none of our main
crappie none of them have audio that you
go to every single one of them has great
features and has great audio
capabilities I honestly wish I could
bring sonically to you what they sound
like maybe in the future lab something
like that but for now you'll just have
to trust me on this and I've listened to
a lot of headphones in my lifetime a lot
of earbuds and I've been working with
sound my entire life I honestly think
you guys will be disappointed with any
of these and since each one of them has
different features from wood to you know
over your things you can run around to
in-ear connections I mean the features
there for you to choose the one that
will actually fit your lifestyle best
like usual download like button hope you
guys liked this video we'll have all the
links to everything we showed you so you
can get more information or if you like
them get a pair for yourself peace out
