once again to the channel where the war
between AMD Nvidia is definitely going
to be heating up once again now that
AMD's latest Vega frontier card has been
released now the frontier Edition card
is going to be something that I think
most people out there we're not actually
expecting I wasn't expecting it I was
expecting that when these cards came out
they were going to be strictly you know
geared for gaming and be able to compete
with NVIDIA with their cards at a great
price level and that was pretty much
what was going on but we're finding out
that actually the front tradition is
actually something totally new it's
actually a crossover card kind of like
the band the Eagles back in the day they
were part country part rock and roll
well this card is part pro level card
and part gaming card and that's
something that's actually really
original either you're buying a
quadrille card that's costing you $2,000
or you're buying a Titan XP if you want
the absolute best gaming card from the
people over at Nvidia but there's no
card out there by Nvidia currently that
you can get the qualities of actually
both cards now how is it going to pan
out I really don't know I asked AMD a
few questions about the card and I asked
him now if you turn this card into Pro
Mode is it like a fired GL pro card now
the firegl Pro cards are basically AMD
solution to that type of marketing for
doing CAD 3d all that type of stuff you
need to buy yourself a quadrille card
from people over at Nvidia or you buy
yourself a firegl pro from the people
over at AMD now if this card is actually
a true when it goes into Pro Mode a
firegl Pro Mode card that's going to be
killer because for the first time a
person will actually be inspired
probably to do 3d and all that stuff on
their computer because you're not going
to have to go out and buy a separate
video card at $2,000 now there's two
types of cards that are actually going
to be coming out there's going to be an
air-cooled model that's going to be
$1,000 and a liquid cooled model that's
out about $1,500 now a standard
air-cooled is 1,500 bucks for the Titan
XP that's right so that's some big money
there for water cooler one you're going
to probably see two or three hundred
dollars more so you're already kind of
pushing up to the level of having a
quadrille card now here's the drawback
though here's really is you buy
quadrille cards yeah sure you can do all
that three
when it comes to gaming and the numbers
aren't that greg's it's not really
geared to do that and the same thing
with a fire Glu by a fire ll do great
and all the other stuff when you go to
play games going to be and so if AMD
with the Vega frontier can truly cross
that plateau and bring a card to market
that will be able to do all of your true
workstation stuff right for your desktop
and with a flip of the switch become an
awesome gaming card all-in-one that to
me is going to be a huge success and
it's definitely going to put pressure on
Nvidia to come up with a similar type
solution believe me if this becomes
really popular and video will be forced
to make that same type of card because
people are going to want that because
just think about if you're a person and
you work at work and you do 3d CAD stuff
and one of the bummers about going home
with it you really have enough money to
buy another those video cards at home
because your system at home you like to
play the games you're developing on well
now they could bring that stuff home and
do all that work from home on their
computer through the Vega frontier so
real quick though let's jump in and
let's check out the specs and what this
card looks like it they going to be
surprised because instead of the
standard red and black blue and gold who
are these guys UCLA real quick to
compare specs the Titan XP has three
thousand eight hundred and forty CUDA
cores and twelve gigabytes of gddr5
memory and on the AMD Frontier addition
we see 4096 stream processors and
sixteen gigabytes of HBC memory which is
much faster than standard gddr5 now as
far as base clock speeds and boost clock
speeds go the titan XP has a base clock
speed of 1492 and a boost clock of
fifteen hundred and eighty-two megahertz
and on the Vega frontier side of things
their typical engine clock for base is
thirteen hundred eighty two megahertz
and their peak engine clock is at 1600
megahertz the memory interface
difference however between the two cards
is very very dynamic on the tight mix we
see a memory interface of 384 bit but
the memory interface on the Vega
frontier is an amazing 2048 bit memory
interface that's just incredible as far
as connections go they both require dual
8-pin connectors now the Titan X it has
a minimum power draw of 250 watts and
they recommend a 600 watt power
supply the Vega frontier however it
takes a minimum of 300 watts on the
board and they recommended 850 watt
power supply so that's what we've seen
so far about the car now there's a
little bit more information we'll have a
link down to mg's website they're pretty
much calling this the Radeon Pro series
of cards so it's no longer the Radeon
it's no longer the fire Gio Pro it's the
Radeon Pro now if the drivers come out
there featuring dual mode drivers which
is something altogether new and ambe's
kind of had a history of sometimes you
know being a little bit lag in the
drivers so hopefully with the release of
this card that Vega frontier will be
able to have the best of everything I
know it's going to look exactly this way
and we probably it's going to be between
between nine and a half to ten inches
long dual slot design what the outputs
on and are exactly are we don't know if
that'll probably change but you know
obviously it's going to be the ultimate
of everything and from the numbers alone
you guys can see the numbers on this
card the memory interface seemed to be
that it should allow for much higher
performance in this car and I think
since they're pushing the pro level of
the card that that's why they have all
these things so flick them to switch you
can do that and there has been some
tests that have been run so far the
scores have been all the way from 26%
all the width to 50% and SolidWorks and
we'll have a link to the article where
you can check out their take on this as
well and a special shout out to PC world
for inspiring me for this video but so
far it looks like this card as far as
gaming goes they said hey and honestly
we don't really see any difference but
obviously the ability to do that Pro
Mode thing is something totally
different so gamers out there I don't
know if this is exactly what you were
expecting I mean I was really expecting
a card that was just going to be totally
a gaming card that would blow the Titan
XP out of the water
maybe it even is that you know higher
price one I think this card to me person
would have been a little bit more
expensive and just a little bit more
geared towards gaming but hey Nvidia
they're going to have to do something
because AMD has come up with something
that is a very original idea I really
much like the idea I can't wait to get
my hands on one so I can bring the tests
to you and I'm going to bug the people
over and video get myself a Titan xB in
here as well so we can compare those two
cards head-to-head and see the
difference between Pro and just gaming
at the end of the day like I said $900
for one version aired 1500 to the
liquid-cooled version
obviously if it was me I'd want the
liquid cool version I'm sure you guys do
as well so hey folks I'm Ehlert
you guys been watching Tecna tomorrow
like usual all the information will be
down below that like button is what you
were expecting it it wasn't what I was
expecting
I'll have a poll for you guys can check
out and hear your opinions at this point
do you guys think that you'll buy this
card is your gaming card or do you think
that you'll wait until the RX series
comes out later next year and just wait
to get those cards hey love to see you
guys back in the channel peace out
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
