it's actually nighttime I was sound
asleep here on TECA tomorrow channel not
even on the TECA tomorrow channel just
nice and cozy in my bed sleeping after
that long ass Nvidia launch when hey who
shows up Jonathan my cameraman with a
brand new iPod touch the new fifth
generation one nobody's got these bad
boys yet who he had to hold up Rob
briber
yeah I don't know what he did but you
know he got this thing a day early and
so since he got it early early so I know
it's night time folks don't always get a
chance to videos at night we thought you
guys might want to get this day ahead of
time so let's do the unboxing and first
look of the brand new iPod touch and if
you have not subscribed to the channel
make sure you do so
why because I'm actually gonna be giving
one of these bad boys away very very
soon as you don't want to miss that so
with that said let's jump in and let's
check out the new iPod touch alright
folks so here we have it in my hand like
I said a day earlier the new iPod Touch
5th generation kind of like Star Trek
next generation but they're boldly going
beyond anybody else is gone so here it
is in this little package so it
basically just pops off now the only
real difference between this and the
iPhone 5 is that the iPhone 5 has a
little bit of a faster processor and
it's a phone beyond that it has an 11 36
by 640 resolution on the screen it's a
very tough screen features a new type of
thing out to make it last a very long
time now I'm gonna go ahead and pull off
the sticker that off of there I'm gonna
come down here
well sticker doesn't want to come off
for me I'll still pull the unit out now
this is the blue 32 gigabyte version let
me just take the whole sticker off
they're kind of interesting there here
we have it right here here's the home
button here is the Lightning jack and
here is the headphone jack I'll go ahead
and turn the unit on
see it's 8:30 at night it's a little
slide thing just like the phone all your
apps come up now the controls are
located here on the side is your volume
control and everything right here it's a
very very thin very very light normally
I really wouldn't be into a unit like
this too much but this thing actually is
very very interesting it's very very
small and you can take like anything
with you on the road so here we got a
little game on here for those little bad
piggies out there the bad Pease game
right here so here we go
I'm gonna put my little piggy up here
build myself a little vehicle of
destruction and then away I go yay I'm a
bad piggy we really just wanted to show
you guys how well the four inch Retina
display looked you guys can see it's
really shiny it's really clear very easy
on the eyes everything is just very very
nice so we'll go ahead and get out of
here and then I'll show you guys the
back of the iPod touch which is very
very nice in color there's a front
camera and a rear camera the front
camera is 720 the rear cameras 1080p the
camera is also a 5 megapixel camera for
those people want to do still images you
actually get a lot of room actually on
this for storing your photos and stuff
like that
they also have a thing called FaceTime
this features that but the FaceTime is
only 720 so let's continue on now I'll
just show you guys around it one more
time then we'll move on to the rest of
the unboxing so over here they have a
little hello
thing hello hello it's your greeting so
next up we have the loop cable you can
see this the next step we have the
lightning to USB cable
kind of stuck in here you guys can see
that here's the Lightning connectivity
really really small over to the usb we
also last but not least have the
headphones you guys may have seen these
headphones we showed them to you also on
some other stuff go ahead and just pull
these out of here so you guys can see
them look at these little things out so
check these out these are very
interesting the way they're shaped
they're shaped almost like musical
little head plugs that you use when
you're in a studio plug in your ear so
you don't hear the sound so they're
pretty interesting they come out and
I'll try them off on my ear just to see
what they feel like Thunder you guys
always wonder that
Falacci try them put in my ears No see
how comfortable they are now for being
something that there's no like
adjustment pads or anything they fit
pretty dang good in the ears
all right you can see they're not going
anywhere if you bang your head so I mean
if you're out jogging and stuff like
that down the street hey George
they're not gonna come flying out of
your ears and they're pretty comfortable
too
they actually don't hurt I don't feel
any discomfort from them whatsoever and
I can tell by the way they design it it
feels like there's actually two ports
the music's gonna be coming out in there
so I really look forward to seeing how
they sound so that's it folks that's
everything that comes in the box this is
the new iPod fifth generation coming out
tomorrow you got to be able to buy it
all over the place but we got a day
early here on tech Oh tomorrow this is
the 32 gigabyte blue version and we'll
see you folks later I guess I'll go see
how this thing sounds</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
