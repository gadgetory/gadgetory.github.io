year's CES there wasn't a whole
abundance of pc stuff but some companies
are still doing it and gigabyte is one
of them at this year's CES 2016 they had
an abundance of brand new video cards
and motherboards now most of these video
cards are based on the nvidia chipset
but they are geared for different levels
starting from entry-level cards all the
way to their latest high-end gaming
cards the g1 extreme gaming
now this bad boy is a 980 TI that's
going to seriously kick ass features 3
windforce fans and a whole lot of other
features including overclocking right
out of the box they had a really cool
display that you can sit and play with
that actually showed the card off but
luckily we have one in hand and that
will be our next video we'll bring it to
you is the review of that card and
although gigabyte didn't have a whole
lot of new product to show off at this
year's CES they did have some pretty
cool stuff going on including some
really nice case designs
you
they had an entire table at the back of
the room that was completely dedicated
to different systems built by different
builders each one had its own unique
theme its own unique color and there was
even some virtual reality going on where
I got to sit down and actually play some
virtual reality games
overclocking always a fan to people who
are out there into high-end stuff it was
going on these guys were actually able
to get this thing to minus eighty two
Celsius that's right you guys can see
here they're constantly pouring liquid
nitrogen into the system and doing their
favorite thing overclocking
so that's all there was to see it this
year's gigabyte suite at CES 2016 cool
things are abound I know that lots of
new products are released later on this
year and for them CES 2016 wasn't one of
the times that that was happening but
hey they still had some cool stuff going
on a lot of nice systems overclocking
and hey I'll see you guys back around
TECA tomorrow we're going to actually
bring you the full review of the extreme
gaming g1</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
