again the ticket amaro YouTube channel
to bring you guys a first unboxing and
first look at some really cool speakers
some people over at Logitech these are
the z6 two threes now what's so special
about these things well these things are
2.1 THX certified speakers that feature
200 watts of power they're supposed to
be very high in clarity and they actual
offer a lot of connectivity up to three
different audio sources through the
speaker so that's pretty cool
that means you had a bunch of stairs you
want to hook them up to them or do some
weird with something stone you
could oak to it also with headphones you
can plug those things in and go with
it's got a lot of different options so
let's jump in and let's see what comes
inside this box
you
got my knife always need that make an
incision here make another incision over
here that's right
till the night that you folks oh do I
cut somebody sorry apologies all around
all right see where the heck is this
thing open up now
looks like there's got to be more
cutting got open life up again wow I
having to do this yet
multiple cuttings over here miss this
one over here so got to do some more
surgery over here like that that was
interesting unboxing tool there go ahead
take this thing slice over slice and
dice don't think twice all right
sting coming not the friendliest of
unboxing boxes I've worked with alright
there's a tab ahh
we are starting to get somewhere there's
a lot of tape on the stand thing alright
then I think we're finally getting
somewhere
hope look at that the top has now come
off the box
we are officially inside the box and I
will turn the damn thing over get out
that's part of it but not all of it
inside there's no the box I'm going to
try to get that one out of there too
after some ripping tearing and shredding
which is all part of a good unboxing day
if you ask me and get some stuff out of
here there you go one speaker another
speaker nice connection wires here's one
of the speakers so we shall take it out
of its plastic concubine here some more
we're looking low Terry and shredding
almost had a nice table smack whoo that
would have been nice I went up when the
guys they make it over there they like
you know what I really know what will
drive the consumer mad let's just put it
a bunch of plastic so they got to go
crazy trying to get it off yeah that's
what we're doing I mean seriously these
things are packaged so well maybe for
some reason alright well there we go
so after no other stuff check it out
here they are thx Hey look nice power
button
your volume bass boost here's the
connector kind of looks just like an
old-school VGA connector for a monitor
which means you ain't going to be using
these speakers with anything else but
check it out this system cuz ain't
working nothing else baby so here's the
other one almost done getting out of
this lovely plastic there this one was
actually easier than the other one
alright Hey
and this one's almost normal RCA so we
have one RCA and one like all uh comport
it's gone port oh my god hold school
alright all there we go here is the
connector for the speaker's right here
it's your power cable t is green green
match the green your speaker speaker
plug oh by the way folks right here on
the side also some more connectivity
didn't want to miss that
then here we go get the sub woofer first
of all tear our thing out of here for
can the best I can already
and also if I let you guys know we went
to and got these speakers we got the
Matt fries but after Jonathan the camera
moves out there and then negotiated with
the pool back and forth we got these for
about $119 they price matched the same
thing that they had them for over on the
lovely Amazon now check out this
subwoofer it's pretty cool it looks
pretty nice
looks acts like a car speaker almost
it's nice and heavy another sound port
right there where the air is going to
pump out of your subwoofer boom boom
boom boom back here is all your
connectivity once again the comm port
the other speaker like we said before
auxilary so you can look up another unit
if you edit like say a Walkman or
something you could hook it up directly
through there also have another little
thing right there for your speakers so
that's it folks you guys might think I'm
old fuel Walkman reference you know I
mean I'm sure nowadays it's an eye this
or eye that or something you know nobody
else even makes anything anymore but
that just shows my age thanks for
watching this was Z 6:23 200 watt 2.1
thx speaker embossing at sake of
