to two minutes with tech of tomorrow
what's on the plate this week well right
off the bat we know microsoft's new
surface pro is coming out next week now
there are a lot of good things about
this that are cool it's featuring the
latest third generation I five 1920 x
1080 graphics it's going to have clear
touchscreen it's going to be pretty
awesome students you have all that power
in a tablet it's also winning the new
latest Windows 8 OS with its tile
interface you guys are all familiar with
that so basically this is a very first
Windows fully functional tablet that's
going to be on the market i know they
released their RT version before and
results on that we're kind of an we're
gonna have to see what these are now my
big thing about this is the internal
storage now the 64 gigabyte version nine
hundred bucks only has 20 3 gigabytes
available leftover storage for you to
have that's barely any movies or
anything else my thoughts on this is
that for something this price they
should have concentrated on getting much
more internal storage think about it
this thing's on the room with you all
the time isn't what you have inside
what's important I know that you can
slap something inside of it and you can
take external storage with you but it's
such an awful lot of money plus who
wants to have to carry that around your
bag that's where I think that Microsoft
made a mistake anyways more stories next
up you guys have all heard about Chinese
trying to do hacking now this is
something that's very very serious
because they say now that this is
organized and prolific there's even
books coming out about it now I know a
lot of people probably joke and go
away but it doesn't matter but here's
where the concern comes out and if
you're watching this over in China you
have to be watching my show I don't that
you get you to but if you do I reach out
to you is probably your government doing
this but hey man hacking in makes
Americans paranoid and so here's what's
going to happen you're going to create
all kinds of problems for others no
matter what you do I mean I don't think
you know you're going to get successful
like a bane type thing in Batman and
take over our stock market which is
really the only reason you know I can
think of it what you're trying to do
something even more prolific like do
some kind of crazy ass book and
take us over anyways
china kick back man stop hacking people
you guys can see through all the
articles that have happened this week
Wall Street all kinds of other people
Washington Post China's been hacking and
they're not just normally hacking
they've got teams of hackers like we got
pro football teams those homies have
hackers what else is going on well 3d
cameras they're becoming a big thing now
we have one called the links a 3d now
these things out in the market trying to
get funding to build themselves they put
their feelers out all across the market
they've got a kickstart program going
trying to get fifty thousand dollars to
get this new thing going now if it came
out just picture it everything you took
a picture of would be 3d which means in
the future pretty much everything would
be 3d like you have a holographic image
of your picture it could be really cool
results if anybody is out there you're
into that type of crazy stuff you want
to invest make sure you check out the
link in description below because we'll
have it to that so if you guys are into
it you want a 3d camera check out the
new links so next up on the news
speaking of hackers Twitter you poor
tweeters out there and I guess that
includes me because I do it too oh well
anyways 250,000 accounts have supposedly
been back that's right so 250,000
tweeters out there you have been invaded
your privacy has been invaded that's
right now so far the company hasn't
completely validated this but they're
saying hey it's very possible that well
you know um it may have happened so
that's pretty much it folks that's too
much of tech crew tomorrow I know you're
going to complain hey it's longer than
two minutes I tried to keep it to two
minutes anyways see you guys back here
on the channel all of these things that
i'm talking about will be over on our
website WWE tech of tomorrow calm we're
all have written you nice articles you
can check this out if you want to read
more in depth about this all have
pictures and all that kind of stuff hope
