to Marwin today we're looking at a fully
functioning iPhone 6 Club
oh well anyways let's jump
now before we hop on into the video I
want to give a huge thanks to people
over a digital storm they're going to be
giving three lucky winners their choice
of a steam game up to sixty dollars if
that doesn't catch your tongue I don't
know what does
check out the link down below for all
the details so now getting back to the
iPhone 6 now check this out you'd expect
when you go out and you buy yourself a
faux iPhone 6 that obviously you're
going to get some Louisville in this
case you get a full box as well that's
right you buy a fake iPhone 6 you get a
fake box with it now what do you get
inside this fake box where you get the
Quick Start Guide which hilariously
features iOS 6 screenshots hmm it's also
got a knockoff USB wall charger and
lightning cable it's got a sim card tool
and it also even features some fake
iPhone headphones which by the way you
can pick up for just a couple of bucks
on Amazon as you guys can see looking at
this iPhone 6 clone it actually scales
to the exact same size as the dummy one
that was released earlier this year the
big difference with the clone though is
that it's actually a functioning 4.7
inch iPhone 6 clone which gives us the
best look we've had yet at the larger
display iPhone unfortunately performance
is absolutely terrible on this phone as
its running an iOS skinned version of
Android and features an underpowered
dual-core 1 gigahertz processor now is
this thing a wolf in sheep's clothing or
a sheep in wolf's clothing if you
actually compared it against the iPhone
5s you can see it gets absolutely
destroyed in performance one thing you
might notice is that on paper the iPhone
5s is still a dual-core processor clock
slightly higher at one point three
gigahertz so given the drastic
performance margins that show how much
software efficiency and apples GPU adds
to the performance I'd say that's pretty
damn impressive what do you guys think
you can access things like control
center pulldown notifications like you
would in an iPhone but it's seriously
lags and you can see Android pokes out
here and there like when you hold the
home button to access Siri Google now
pops up but actually me and I think most
you'll agree I think that's an upgrade
performance issues aside this does give
us great insight on what Apple's iPhone
6 will look like and some notes of
differences compared against the iPhone
5s some of them include
power sleep/wake button which is now
located in the right above the SIM card
instead of the top-right lime controls
are now pill shaped buttons instead of
circular ones the Apple logo is now
recessed just like on the Apple iPad air
and the iPad Mini with Retina display
and gone is the glass portion on the top
and bottom of the back side of the phone
hello hello what I guess they want to
know and you probably want to know as
well so you're probably going to ask
where can I pick one of these things up
at well you guys can pick one of these
things up on a Chinese website for about
two hundred dollars now got to take
something though with a grain of salt
this thing strictly a like joke item a
novelty item something for shits and
giggles because obviously as a regular
phone it really just sucks sorry oops
that about wraps up today's video now
got to ask all you folks out there you
guys all really anticipating the real
deal and bigger Apple iPhones when they
come out hmm inquiring minds want to
know when we want to know as well also
all the information for this will be
down there below that like button so if
you guys want you can hit that if you
appreciate this type of video like I
said before we're doing all kinds of new
videos here and I got to say them before
I go you're never alone if you're with
your clone so hey that's about it folks
one more time want to give a special
shout out to the people over at digital
storm like I said the beginning of the
video three lucky winners can pick any
steam game up to sixty bucks for all the
details all that they'll be down the
bullet like button once again in the
description so I'm Network I'll see you
guys back here for more videos on tech
of tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
