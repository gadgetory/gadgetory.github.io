we all know that VR is becoming total
reality VR yesterday was the imagination
but now it's becoming the thing of today
and we're gonna be building a totally
virtual reality based system working
with the people over at AMD Coursera and
a few others and right now you guys can
see I got the four cards in the nanos
have arrived quad and nanos and to power
this badass VR system which we're gonna
be calling the a VR Nexus it's gonna be
badass we have a totally custom-built
900 e being made for us and I've got
this ax 1500 I it that's gonna be
powering the whole thing so let's talk
about what's inside this and how this
power supply is something that's for the
badass not to me let's go alright folks
so any good unboxing and first look
obviously you want to see what the Box
you're getting it in so from the box is
this and inside are all the cool facts
and you can even see how they have a
mocked up edition of seeing inside of
the PSU so you can see what the guts are
so go ahead and just drop that down on
the side is basically just once again
the name of the product and both sides
are exactly the same nothing special
about those and then on the back it just
tells you a little bit about their link
software and stuff like that and their
power curve and that stuff but do you
guys want to actually see what's in this
box
so I'm gonna go ahead and just pop the
cap here and go ahead and just rough and
tumble this out of here cuz there's
still something in the way there one
flap was not open all the way up there
we go yeah
giant way to come out of there
forget the box out of the way off to the
side and it also says in the back that
it's completely recyclable so for those
people who earn to green stuff I know I
like to plant it I don't want to go
anywhere so recycling is good and it's
cool if they had that there and then
their logo mate and China thing and I'll
just go ahead and somehow pop this open
alright guys and I got me a knife it's
the old SWOT knife those you know
special weapons and tactics put that
little sucker out there take a quick
carving hold it you the audience
oh my god I think I stuck you in the end
so we'll just pop the cap now if we
thing there give all the accessories
power supplies me back here in a nice
bag so let's just start out by taking
everything out and then we'll discuss at
all
so there's a nice big giant bag right
here this is going to contain all of
your cables and all their stuff they
usually have stuff from mounting up for
cable management once again that's
included and then last but not least I'm
going to get this up pop the pop there's
the giant bag with the PSU in it all the
warranty information all that good stuff
and then last but not least the giant
power cable you guys can see because the
thing is so huge it doesn't take a
standard power cable it takes a
different type all together for a high
voltage ship of course you even start I
guess we can just set up showing you
guys all this stuff for those who you
care about this is pretty much
everything in one single shot that comes
inside of the box
other than my nifty knife you don't get
that sorry
so inside the black bag we're going to
see the power supply itself just
cut that out take it out now some cool
things about this power supply is it has
a seven-year warranty so that's pretty
awesome seven years are quite a long
time in the PC world
you used to be changing your system long
before that so just continue getting all
this stuff out of here take it out yeah
where do we start okay well I was wrong
this one does have a power switch right
here on the back long if we plug the
cable in you can notice that this power
supply is very very thin also so it'll
fit a lot of different types of system
the - this is a much lower than your
standard power supply right here we have
the side we have the name this power
supply is also completely modular
features they're digital link software
which you can use inside the Windows
environment and monitor all of the stuff
that you're doing which is pretty cool
only works with a couple series those
the ax and the HX so you got to make
sure if you want to use that you get the
pepper power supply and here on the
bottom we see the fan now one thing
about this fan is it runs very very
quietly offers low rpms but still does
great cooling on it so one of the
features about it and this side you guys
can see it just shows a different model
number this is probably the model number
that is related to it it's made in China
and the last but not least we have the
back where all the cables and everything
hooks up now all these cables are
completely flat and they're meant to be
used and you know your great systems
where you're gonna do a lot of cable
management and they're geared for that
and that's the next thing with a mini
check it out
so we'll get past that okay
now the ax 1500 comes with a little kill
box for this thing has a frakkin huge
amount of cables because it's made for
putting you know for video card in your
system whether it be SLI or crossfire so
there's going to be a lot of cables and
uh let's see what they are the ax 1500 I
comes to the single 24 pin cable - 8 pin
cables 10 6 pin cables 20 SATA cables 12
4 pin cables and 4-year old schoolers
there's even two floppy cables that's
right no zip cable if you know what I'm
talking about you're showing your age or
my showing my age something like that
anyways last up you get the USB comm
cable now this is something industry on
the back of the PSU where all the cables
plug in you get a comport but you also
get a self-test button so you can
actually test the power supply and make
sure it's fully functioning before you
really do anything with it and so that's
pretty cool feature you guys see all the
cables we talk about they all connect
back here and the feature I was talking
about is these cables are all very very
flat so if you're trying to do cable
management and keep them all you know
nice and clean inside a system you want
cables like this some people are gonna
use all braided cables so if you're
gonna spend any more money and do that
you can do that as well but I gotta say
these are a pretty nice start so there
you guys have it now the only caveat is
for some people I guess is going to be
the price this particular power supply
depending on where you buy it can go
anywhere from 350 bucks all the way up
to 440 bucks you got to look around
we'll have a link down below I think
this particular one is like 390 bucks
for our link but if you look around all
over the place you might be able to find
it a little bit cheaper but if you want
something that's basically just really
solid rugged and obviously you know
Titanium's as high as you're gonna go
unless you're gonna go and rip off
Wolverine and get his power supply
you're not gonna have an adamantium
rated power supply and I noticed some
people out they go do these crazy tests
want to tell you something when these
guys certify this stuff they have such
expensive equipment on there and to test
it even get this certification that to
run like tests on it everything would
just be completely crazy when you put it
in your side your system you hear it's
quiet
it runs absolutely great it runs for a
long time that's a sign of a great power
supply and using their software when
you're inside of the Windows environment
which is pretty cool you guys can
monitor all kinds of different stuff
about the power supply you can monitor
what's going on with the heat change the
fan all that other good stuff and if you
want something for free to monitor
everything in their system you guys
should check out cam because we've been
showing that quite a bit and using and
it's actually pretty cool completely
free software that we'll have a link to
at the end but at the end of the day
like I said this power supply is
slightly a little bit pricey but is it
really pricey I mean if you're gonna
putting in for video cards they could
cost you up to what like say you know
1500 $2,000 depending on what card
you're using I mean there are cards out
there for people who are doing giant
works they
and they want something that's going to
work so I'm going to put my faith in
this one and uh hopefully this new
system is going to be really badass the
AV our Nexus will be bad freakin ass all
the parts or so I definitely probably
won't go blah blah blah money-wise
because as far as money-wise goes the
system is gonna be a filthy expensive
like usual pricing availability down
there like I said below that like button
you guys know what to do I'm Eric you
guys been watching tech of tomorrow and
there's all kinds of cool stuff coming
up in the next week and after next week
and there's gonna be even more crazy
stuff so many people out there know what
I'm talking about but the exciting stuff
around the corner see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
