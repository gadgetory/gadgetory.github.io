tomorrow now as many of you are aware
this past week was III 2014 the
Electronic Entertainment Expo which is
arguably the biggest convention for all
things gaming this is where we get some
of the biggest news announcements and
updates from some of the biggest game
producers and developers as a result of
it I wanted to bring you guys my top 5
most anticipated pc games that were
either announced or we finally got to
see some new gameplay for at this III
now this list is going to be limited to
games that are coming out within the
next year before next III we're not
going to talk about games come out and
holiday of twenty fifteen or twenty
sixteen releases this is all stuff we're
going to see within the next 12 months
now as always with most of my lists I am
not trying to argue that these are
objectively the best and they're going
to be the best of release I'm not trying
to say that these are the five most
popular that everyone's waiting for
these are just the five that I am
personally most excited to see come out
and can't wait to get my hands on to
bring you guys proper reviews of so that
being said let's check them out
you
first up on the list ranking in at
number five is the evil within being
produced by Bethesda Softworks with the
development overlooked by Shinji Mikami
the man responsible for starting one of
the biggest horror franchises around
resident evil the evil within is an
attempt to get horror games back to
their roots while still maintaining some
degree of action the emphasis has been
so heavy on the fear that their
presentation for a tad III was to stick
people in a dark room and watch and
record their reactions to the game's
frightening scenes whether or not this
game actually succeeds in reviving the
horror genre is of course yet to be seen
but it's a hope shared by many and has
been backed up by some really good
looking previews we're just going to
have to wait until october twenty first
to find out for sure now ranking at
number four and sharing the same release
date as the evil within is evolved this
is the next game to come out from Turtle
Rock Studios the team responsible for
bringing us the left 4 dead series and
now they're bringing us an asymmetrical
FPS featuring four players playing four
distinct classes with their own
abilities up against a single player
controlled monstrosity which feeds on
other monsters to evolve and gain more
abilities and become that much bigger of
a threat this was a huge hit at this
year's e3 s floor show with producer 2k
games actually holding a tournament for
the game giving us a great idea of how
it's actually going the handle and play
once we finally get our hands on it this
October now ranking number three on the
list for me is the fourth or depending
on who you talk to the third game of the
batman arkham series batman arkham
knight Rocksteady is back developing
this installment finishing the plot and
timeline they created with Batman Arkham
Asylum their second installment arkham
city expanded on the gameplay greatly by
opening up the world putting you on the
streets and night looks to be continuing
this trend by adding the Batmobile and
even more famous recurring Batman
villains including the introduction of
scarecrow the gameplay demo we saw at
this III was for the lack of a better
word intense and this will hopefully be
the sequel and fish to the series that
we've all been hoping for we'll just
have to find out in early 2015 now
ranking at number 2 is Ubisoft's fourth
venture in first-person wilderness
survival far cry 4 after far cry 3
surprise smash hit of 2012 followed by
its incredible standalone DLC Blood
Dragon in 2013 FarCry quickly went
being a fairly popular single player FPS
to one of the biggest open-world
shooters far cry 4 looks to be
continuing and building upon the
Foundation's three-set introducing new
kinds of vehicles a new setting up in
the mountains and a new villain that
looks to be just as if not a slightly
different brand of crazy as the
ever-popular boss plan to be released
right smack dab in the middle of the
holiday rush we'll just have to wait
until November eighteenth to find out
whether or not for successfully
maintains the hype that far cry 3 began
now coming in at number one on my list
of the top five most anticipated games
coming out in the next year and really
showing my roots as an RPG fan is the
witcher 3 the Wild Hunt since last III
we've seen trailers and quick looks at
how this game is meant to expand on the
witcher universe adding a more open
world element but this year during
microsoft's press conference we finally
got to see some real gameplay in action
of girl hunting down a monster and
getting involved in a bandit skirmish
along the way not only is this game just
ridiculously pretty but the combat looks
to be even more refined giving it a
major boost over one of the problems of
the series last installment and if it
can maintain the same level of narrative
and feeling of choice and consequence it
could easily be one of the strongest
releases of the year when it comes out
near the end of februari 2015 so there
you have it guys my personal top 5 most
anticipated games to come out in the
next year they've got to see new
trailers for or new gameplay for at this
year's e3 now keep in mind that while I
am really excited for all these games to
come out by no means do I recommend
buying these games blindly without a
second thought you should always check
out for reviews or listen to other
gamers opinions I will be buying them
day one but just so I can bring you guys
my thoughts as soon as possible and let
you know whether or not they live up to
the hype if you guys enjoyed this video
