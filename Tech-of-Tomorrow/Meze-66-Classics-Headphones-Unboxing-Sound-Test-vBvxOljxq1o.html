channel I'm glad to see you here once
again so what are we doing today well
today we're gonna take a look at
something that is both audio and
artistic all-in-one because the thing I
have in my hand is actually a one of a
kind there's no actual other identical
pair like this anywhere in the world I'm
talking about the mez classic 66
these are an awesome set of headphones
that are made of ebony wood and no two
are alike that's why I say they're both
an audiophile product and an art form
all-in-one because no one else is going
to have them now I reviewed previously
they're 77s these things were really
incredible they didn't even really need
a 24-hour burnin but I'm gonna do it
with these just like I do with all of
them now they sounded pretty clean
right out of the box now these things
cost about 199 dollars but they're also
audiophile headphones now you can listen
to these things through your Walkman or
any of that kind of stuff they're gonna
sound great but if you go out and you
buy yourself an aftermarket headphone
amplifier even when it's even 100 bucks
you're gonna hear a big difference
unless you have a really good sound card
inside your computer that said let's go
ahead and jump in and unbox these things
and see what they look like and talk
about those specs so here we see it the
mid 66 classics come in a really tiny
box because these things are very easily
foldable and taken up on the row so
here's the front of the box the side of
the box I'm gonna flip it around real
quick and Cameron's gonna zoom in here
and then let's real quick let's talk
about the specs all right folks let's
take a look at the technical data the
drive unit is a moving coil dynamic
speaker speaker size 40 millimeters
magnet type neodymium frequency response
20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz sensitivity of
plus 1 13 2 minus 3 DB impedance 32 ohms
total harmonic distortion minus 3
percent the rated input power is 10
milliwatts maximum input power is 20
milliwatts cable type is TPE
material is one point two millimeters
the plug is a 3.5 millimeter gold-plated
plug so now folks the box just basically
pops open and the headphones fell out
for that but I'll sit them back down so
basically here is inside the box what it
looks like not much to the inside the
box so let's first pull out the cans
nothing else in there so we'll go ahead
and set that off to the side two sets of
cables involved in here let me go ahead
and remove these out of here these
things are all woodgrain they're
completely removable so that you can
take them out no more crazy wire stuff
with these you have a I'm gonna try to
get rid of the camera guys there's a
left and right you can see ones green
ones red then you have the 3.5
millimeter jack that will plug into
basically anything these days they give
you two sets these cables they're a
little bit different
this one's wood grain the one that's
inside of here is not I'll go ahead and
remove that anyway just so you can see
it so they're just it you know actually
folks you know what now them look at
these up close I don't think these are
any different in the 77s they were
actually different but on these ones
they look like just they just gave you
two sets of identical cables so I was
wrong about them well man you know up
there next close to each other what do
you think jeez are they identical pretty
damn close huh alright then set those
down
so here the headphones themselves you
can see how they tuck up nicely a lot of
people like this kind of design when
they saw the dre headphones they're like
oh you know I don't want like the dre
headphones but I like the way they fold
up like that so you got that same fold
up thing going here can just pop down
these are very very very I want to
stress this high quality feeling nice
leather feel this does not feel like
junk at all this feels very very soft
and nice here you guys can see there
Evan II would note two pairs are
identical and the fact that they are
made of ebony wood means they're going
to sound much more natural what is the
most natural way to reproduce the sound
and having wood cups makes a big
difference in the sound so we go ahead
and tuck these things on my head and
we'll get a little feel for them so here
we have them on my head folks they're
very adjustable though they have a
little flick them thing here so even if
you had somebody who had a Gigantor in
size head you know they would still fit
this I'd pull the same way I believe it
does so look carriage egg and twin head
they'd still fit how they look on me
whoa
so next up folks let's plug these things
in and let's take a listen alright folks
so here's the cable I'm gonna go ahead
and unwrap it it's got this little wire
that's inside of it like we said before
they had right and left on the
headphones themselves they're not marked
right or left I mean I suppose it really
doesn't matter so I'm gonna go ahead I'm
gonna plug one in here
you can hear the snap of that as I plug
it in I'll bring it up even closer to
the mic up here so you guys can hear the
snap in so it snaps in place now we're
gonna go ahead and steal Jesus's s4
galaxy and take a listen to some techno
wow I got to tell you folks off this the
bass is just like boom the last that I
got the bass was not this booming you
guys got to hear it so let's move it up
to the microphone
hey I got an it I don't know if this
song is Jesus what is this song oh man
that is pretty funny that is just cool
this song sounds really cool this I
don't even know you have to burn these
headphones in I may still do it but
these things are sounding great right
off the bat like the previous is 77s I
didn't think they really centered all
that great on hip hop and stuff they
sounded great on jazz and other thing
else decided so clean but these these
wouldn't sound a little more hairier on
the balls and the other ones do and the
bass clarity seems to be kicking butt
but I'm gonna break him in you guys will
see the full written in in video review
later but for now hey that's it man
these are the mez 66 classics made of
ebony wood come to market at 199 dollars
no two are alike hope you guys like this
video if so show me that love and hit
that like button baby if you're not
subscribed make sure you do so you
should never miss out on anything here
on tech of tomorrow I'm going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
