by guns of boom get a little boom in
your game what's up YouTube lr care once
again on teka tomorrow got mister buddy
on my lap cuz he was like just going let
me end this video dad so we had no
choice but to let him in that video now
you guys all know that the 8th
generation processor from Intel they're
all coming out in October 5th the NDA
will lift we can bring you guys all the
scores for the different stuff that
we're going to be doing like I told you
guys before I have in-house I have the
brand-new eighty-six hundred K this is a
very nice CPU I'm going to be comparing
it against the 1600 X in our initial
test and then we'll test the higher and
stuff a little bit down the road but
right off the bat we're gonna be tone
you today is the motherboard and the
stuff that we're gonna be using in our
test bed now I don't know also if you
guys happen to see a video guys that we
did a little while ago we showed you
this crazy game called guns of boom
honestly one of the most addictive ever
phone games I've ever seen I don't
really like phone games that much but
this one honestly sucks you in so real
quick though let's check out that game
one more time before we jump into the
video all right folks
I usually would not say this but I can
honestly say I haven't played a mobile
game quite like guns of boom ever before
I mean it's a first-person PC shooter
game only on your mobile device and with
non-stop player versus player action
including clan battles you can get that
desktop PC shooter feel right in the
palm of your hands and the controls are
super easy and simple to use shooting
and moving around the map was a blast
and with the auto fire option all you
have to do is get the enemy within your
sights and then watch them get blown
away and for an extra challenge you can
turn the auto fire off but even when it
was turned off I could still easily move
around and unleash the lead speaking of
lead guns of boom has a massive
selection of weapons from rifles machine
guns and shotguns to pistols knives and
even grenades this game has it all you
can even click skins for your guns or
customize your character with different
masks and costumes play guns of boom to
collect them all and best of all you can
get guns of boom today at Amazon Google
Play or the App Store honestly if you're
into first-person shooters and you love
phone games
you've got to check out guns of boom
we'll have the link down below free
people to check it out and download it
for yourself now right off the bat our
test system starts off with a really
nice motherboard from gigabyte this is
their brand new Z 370 a horas Ultra
gaming motherboard now this motherboard
is not the total top-of-the-line
motherboard but it's not the bottom
either it's kind of like right there in
the middle motherboard has a lot of nice
features there's plenty of room around
the socket for you to install your
coolers and another great thing though
about this launch even though you do
have to buy a new motherboard you can
still use all of your old 11:51 coolers
on these boards so so even though you
might have to buy a new board you can
still use your existing cooler as far as
PCI so let's go on the motherboard there
are six all together there's a 16 X 8 X
and a 4 X PCIe and there's also three 1x
slots the board also supports 64
gigabytes of ddr4 memory this is where
it's all the latest overclocking memory
and also XMP profiles as far as video
card support goes you can do crossfire
and sli configurations as well on this
board the audio on board although it's
not the absolute best it's still pretty
decent the realtek ALC 1220 pet
featuring 7.1 HD audio the ARS Z 370
also features RGB fusion on the
motherboard so if your builder looking
at one than the motherboard that just
has that little bit of extra bling this
board definitely has that even though
I'm not going to give you guys the full
blown review of this motherboard this
time cuz I want to be able to do that
with the scores I just got to say it
this motherboard is built like a tank it
has all of the great a or schooling and
all the features that come with that
series of motherboards and all at a
pretty great price the memory we're
using in our test system is the corsair
dominator platinum series 16 gigabyte
kit now this is - eight gigabyte sticks
at 3000 megahertz this memory is a
little bit pricey but it's also very
very fast now the cooler that we use for
this test system is really really kind
of strange it's the Zalman rezar ater
and this thing's kind of crazy because
instead of having your standard
reservoir it actually works off a
different type of technology and it does
keep the CPU very very cool and I think
you guys will be surprised how cool and
you guys see the test results but even
though this product is some
it's kind of crazy looking and not the
traditional style thing it actually
works pretty doggone well the SSD that
we used in our test system is a little
bit pricey the Kingston HyperX 240
gigabyte drive I don't know why it's a
really kind of high price that we
already had it in here in the house we
decided to use it but we'll have links
to much better price drives for you guys
down below for our test system I wanted
a power supply that wasn't completely
overboard but would not have enough
power to you know handle SLI or
crossfire if I needed it so we chose the
C Sonic focus plus series SSR 850 FX
power supply now this is 80 plus gold
power supply has a really nice warranty
it's completely modulated and this
thing's just really nice and priced well
at 109 bucks like I said before folks we
all know that in a lot of ways cabbie
Lake was just kind of a total fail and a
disappointment and I know that many of
us are really hoping that coffee lake is
going to change the game I'm hoping it
does just because I like technology and
the newer the technology I'm always
going to be hoping it's better than the
last generation right we all hope that
so our first battle like I said I 580
600 K versus the rise in 1600 X all
right folks so there you have it
everything that we're going to be using
when the NDA lifts on October 5th for
our test system for the brand-new 8th
generation Intel CPUs hopefully in these
dollar dollar tests that we're going to
be doing we will find out who the new
winner is will be the coffee-like CPUs
from Intel or we'll all the rise in CPUs
still be dominating for the mainstream
I'm Miller you've been watching techy
tomorrow man we'll have links to all
those different products that we're
using our test system down below so if
you want to duplicate it and do it for
yourself or build a system around it you
can do it peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
