Squarespace good morning Sunshine's dang
nabbit it's good to see you here on the
channel so what's going on here on TECA
tomorrow well it is launch day of the
new nvidia gtx 750ti
that's right now this card that we have
is a 2 gigabyte model going to be
hitting the market at about 149 dollars
there is a virgin underneath it it's a 1
gigabyte version it will be 139
there's also another card that's being
released on the market today that is the
750 we do not have that one in-house we
have the 750 Ti in the house so with
that said let's jump in let's see what
this car is all about
now before we actually jump in and talk
about all the specs and testing online
good stuff let's talk about the cards
we're testing them against and take a
look at it now we haven't got the 265
from AMD for some reason those folks
don't show us a lot of love it if you
want to show us love go over and Twitter
them twerk them go onto their homepage
send a message and say hey give tech of
tomorrow some love but we do have to
have the 260x
and we also have the GTX 650 Ti now I
got all these cards behind me this is
the new card right here now this thing's
very very small 5 and 3/4 inches by 4
inches by one and a half inches
we'll have that all translated into
metrics as well for you guys but this is
pretty much the smallest mid-level
gaming card I've ever seen like I said
this thing is going to be priced at 149
for the 2 gigabyte version that I've got
right here in my hand but it's very
small now it's in the next card this is
the P&amp;amp;Y 650 TI now you guys can see
these are both 2 slot design cards all
the PNY card is a little bit thicker
it's about 2 inches this one's one and a
half inch and you can see it's also a
bit longer this cards about six and a
half inches long while this one's five
and three quarters derailleurs you guys
can see are pretty similar quite a bit
the same so let's move on now let's take
a look at the AMD competition next up
the XFX
r7 260x now this one is a little bit
cheaper but it's pretty comparable as
far as the numbers go now you guys can
see this bad boy is quite a bit larger
once again to slot design as far as the
width codes is once it going to be about
two inches but as far as lengths go
check it out this card's a little bit
over seven inches five and three-quarter
inches much much heavier card as well
rear i/o is armed you know they're
pretty similar you get a little bit more
than one this AMD card as you guys can
see they have a little bit more options
on that card now let's move forward
let's talk about some of the specs and
then jump in and see the testing max
well let's improve the utilization of
their cords by changing the architecture
behind their SM and its control logic
technology in the previous Kepler design
the SM contained a single control logic
that had to handle under 92 course
simultaneously but now NVIDIA has split
that single core into four cores that
now handle 32 cores apiece
so what that really boils down
to foes that the power slash performance
ratio is now four times better than
previous generation chipsets now this
thing has a TDP of 60 watts pretty
incredible right all the power goes
coming right through the PCI Lane so
you're not gonna have to plug it in what
so ever also the power requirements are
about 300 watts the power supply that's
they're saying is like your minimum that
you want to go to something smaller
might work but pay to be safe you
probably want to fall around what
they're recommending for you all right
so here are the specs for the maxwell GM
107 card has 640 cuda cores 40 texture
units and 16 ROPS the core clock is at
10:20 megahertz and the Boost 2.0 is at
1085 megahertz
now the card we have is the 2 gigabyte
GDR 5 model clocked at 5400 megahertz
it also features two 64-bit memory
controllers for a total of 128-bit
memory interface the total memory bound
to the card is eighty six point four
gigabytes the card oats also made in the
current 28 nanometer process so those
are the tech specs folks and with that
said let's rock out to the benchmark
song
what all right you're back so that's it
folks by the way if you guys like that
song it's called the human Zoo you guys
can actually listen this music for free
over WWE that tech of tomorrow music
calm which we actually made using
Squarespace you guys can try squarespace
yourself for free if you'd like to it's
something very interesting if you're
looking for something that's very quick
easy and efficient just make a quick
website and get up and going Squarespace
is something that you guys are going to
want to check out now one thing that's
really cool about this though is its GUI
interface it has all the drag-and-drop
menus you want to use all the type of
plugins you need to get your website up
and going and one thing that's also
ultimately cool is you guys can actually
save yourself 10% and get a free trial
membership by entering the code T ot to
a checkout so that's really incredible
stuff you guys can save money check out
what it's like to have your own website
if you like it you can stick and if you
don't you can dump it to the side of the
road but actually Squarespace is really
cool and its really intuitive for those
who are brand-new to creating websites
alright folks you guys have seen all the
tech specs you guys have seen how it
runs now you guys can see that it does
run a little bit hotter than the 650 TI
card well you know this thing has a very
very very tiny fan I was actually joking
around about it because the fan out
actually reminds me of like a very
old-school CPU fans how many of my old
tech friends out there know what I'm
talking about like back in the old AMD
things this was like an AMD CPU fan
believe it or not they were about the
exact same size and looked about the
same size as that pretty interesting
stuff and now this is actually cooling
the car but for a car that's so small I
got to say the 750 Ti is going to be a
pretty damn good thing because picture
this it's faster than the card that we
tested now when we get a hold of the 265
which you guys know to go buggy AMD let
them know we need that card will bring
more tests to the tables or if it
becomes for sale we'll grab that sucker
either way but for right now this card
is doing very very well at the price
point that it's set for its it as a
mid-level card it's priced at about 150
dollars all the other vendors will be
jumping onboard so you're going to see
the cooling by gigabyte all the other
people out there making their cards hey
Zeus m/s I don't want to forget anybody
you know you guys are all going to make
your own cards based off of this so with
that said I'm Elric thanks for watching
this video if you guys like the like but
down there and beyond that down below is
the description of all the information
if you like to purchase one of these
cars or just check out more information
about this also over on our website I
will have a full written review on this
over wwk and more calm so I'll see you
guys over there take it easy
we'll see you guys background ticker
tomorrow for more tech later see ya
