Squarespace it's Sunday and you're
watching tech of tomorrow why you guys
here because we've got some really hot
new stores for this week lots of cool
things have happened and we're going to
talk about them with you right now we've
got new Haswell chips we've got new
video cards things going on with Google
and a lot more so stay tuned as we jump
into the Sunday edition of the news here
on tech of tomorrow so it looks like
three CP usually making their debut the
first is the core i7 5820 k which is a
sub fun at our price tag cpu featuring
six processing cores and we'll work with
up to 15 megabytes of cash this chips
base frequency is set at three point
three gigahertz with a minimum speed of
1.2 gigahertz this will result in a chip
that performs well an acceptable price
tag next up is the core i7 5930 k which
is said to carry six cores in a price
tag of approximately six hundred dollars
it features the same 15 megabytes of
cash along with the base clock of 3.5
gigahertz it's two hundred dollars more
with it's just a bit more performance
this is likely because of the PCI
Express configurations of the chip the
cheaper I 758 20k has only 28 pci lanes
this will allow you to install 23
graphic cards with eight lanes dedicated
to each card with four lanes leftover
fretted devices the six hundred dollar
core i7 59 30k however will have 40 pci
express lanes making room for up to four
graphics cards with eight lanes each
with another eight lanes to spare last
up is the most high-end expensive
extreme core i7 5960 this is the
top-tier chip in the lineup featuring 8
processing cores and 20 megabytes of
cash the cores will all clock in at a
base frequency of three point 0
gigahertz this is probably to remain
within the 140 watt TDP which all the
CPUs currently carry it will also have
the same pci express configuration as
the I 759 30k featuring 40 lanes now
words of processing on Intel's highest m
processor right now haven't been linked
but knowing intel this will come in at
about a thousand dollars traditionally
you see Intel's highest CPUs at that
price and they've been that
for years so you can probably expect
them to remain the same next up hot news
in the graphics card division now this
news a little bit weird and from a
company you may not be familiar with but
yet you may be KF a tune better known as
galaxy in some parts of the world has
introduced a highly overclocked version
but it's already overclocked gtx 780
half the GTX 780 a half 0 c plus not
only is this card supposed to overclock
extremely better than any other card it
actually comes with twice the amount of
memory the card does though look
identical to the original gtx 780 hof
from galaxy and it's basically based in
the same board design the GPU on board
the card is clocked at 1019 megahertz
base and will boost up to a thousand 71
megahertz this is not a great
improvement over the older card which
was clocked at a thousand six megahertz
with a thousand fifty eight megahertz
boots frequency but the biggest feature
all about this card is that it doesn't
carry the standard three gigabytes of
gddr5 in fact this thing carries six
gigabytes was a whopping improvement and
something you rarely see on desktop
cards the next story comes to what we're
doing right now what I'm doing filming
it where you were doing watching it has
to do with YouTube and YouTube has just
announced a whole new bunch of tools to
help the interface and help you as the
user get your stuff out there better how
are they doing this well one of the
first things is now you can get full
1080p at 60 frames per second and there
are a few videos that have already come
out showing this technology off
including one that shows not gaming but
actual real-life footage another thing
is a lot of the tools now you won't have
to go out and worried about copyright
infringement on sounds there's going to
be a thing you can actually import your
own sound it'll be easier to add friends
list and be easier for people to
actually interact with your youtube
channel all the way around so a lot of
things are rolling out with YouTube so
not only will be able to see it better
you'll be a bit actually interact and
make your videos much better with the
latest tools that are coming out another
thing that's really cool is the new fan
feature now a lot of times you guys get
mad about advertisements and all this
stuff we'll check this out they'll now
be a fan feature where fans will be able
to directly give money to their favorite
channel so if you like the channel
so much that you don't want to see any
commercials on there you and your
friends can get together and you can
donate money of that channel and allow
them not to put ads in their channel by
being funded by their own users so
that's is something I wanted to throw
out to the end it ought to be pretty
interesting and I'm looking forward to
it and you should be too last up on
today's news google i/o 2014 has
released some very interesting
information three top things android l
android wear and android auto what the
frak am I talking about well hey let's
check it out android l is android OS is
cat successor it doesn't really have a
name yet but we know it'll begin with l
this platform update will attempt to
unite web and app user experiences
through the material design interface
developers will be able to use google's
new polymer toolkit design web apps that
look like they're android counterparts
including 3d rendering it also promises
notifications on the lock screen like
iOS 8 owner detection so you can unlock
your device will have a passcode better
power consumption and better battery
monitoring including battery historian
to show how much juice each app is
sucking up while you're using it Android
wear is it a new clothing line no let's
see what it is breaking the power of
android to your wrist the Android wear
SmartWatch platform will integrate your
phone and enable you to control your
vices without reaching into your pocket
Google's demonstration showed Android
wear behaving very much like Google now
activating with the ok google voice
command and letting you check incoming
calls send auto responses set reminders
view notifications and control your
phones music app from your watch Andrew
we're also promises integration with
third-party apps what this means that
someday you'll be able to order your
uber ride or pizza from their favorite
24-hour pizza restaurant right from your
watch Android auto the only one for some
reason I had memorized totally in my
brain now what's android android auto is
going to work with your car your got to
put any kind of features inside of your
car at all everything that is on your
phone will actually transmit and work
with your car's interface so this means
you'll be able to use your phone even
more seamlessly inside your car in fact
