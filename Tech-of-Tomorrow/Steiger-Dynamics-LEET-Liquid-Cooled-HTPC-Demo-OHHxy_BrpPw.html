Steiger dynamics we are freshly launched
system builder based out of Los Angeles
and today I would like to introduce you
our very new line of HTTP C's which is
actually the most powerful and world's
first liquid-cooled
ATT pc on the market' especially made
for or high-end living room gaming so
let's just quickly go over here and I
have a look at the hardware so this is
our full aluminum hand brushed
custom-made case it's a it's a one-piece
shell of extremely high high quality so
we believe we have the the best case on
the market when it comes to quality and
it has like a 0.2 inches wall thickness
which is which is unmatched featuring a
7-inch Samsung front panel showing our
our own monitor app we can here you see
the screen performance green for CPU RAM
and and GPU low levels temperatures and
so on when we can have a look inside we
have our our custom LED lighting so you
can see a little bit more can switch it
on right here and yeah basically inside
it's it's top-notch high-end I inspect
system can start here with with the
storage drives it's right there this is
a for Western Digital red start Dr which
we picked because of their dealer
support continuous operation ability and
yeah basically you can use it as as a
home server as an ass our system is
replacing these systems completely right
here's the the see sonic 1000
Platinum power supply one of the most
efficient and unstable power supplies on
the market let's chat attached that is
our custom cabling right here single
sleeved voice quality
and maintainer made two to fit justice
precisely then right here you see our
our radiators of our custom liquid
cooling solution it's actually custom
custom-made radiators fitting our our
case made by Swift tech for us so we
developed a whole liquid cooling
solution with these guys when the worst
we do really well we can fit up to an
Quad SLI GTX 690 setup so put two six
nights in there with a six core or a
four core and still gonna be it's gonna
be cool enough and right down here
you'll have our our quad seat on what
general cable TV card assume what
general means you can actually like
record three channels and then watch one
simultaneously or spread four different
channels wirelessly throw through
devices in the house that's very
comfortable and then all this is based
on a on a Maximus five extreme um on
here c77 Asus board with an overclocked
i7 3770 are okay and yeah DD Asus board
has a custom bias we refined DD pwm fan
settings so we have like the broader
range in an idle in idle system is
completely inaudible and then once it
gets up on the loads either with gaming
or encoding or whatsoever the the fans
would rise a little bit in speed too you
have to cool it down sufficiently but
it's still gonna be gonna be very very
quiet exactly what you would expect from
your living room system so when we have
a look from Europe case
33 32 gigabytes of dual-channel RAM and
then just below the blu-ray drive or the
writer depending on configuration you
have a SSD set up in decades to to 40
gigabytes of course a new terminal GTX
running in Reggio involves providing up
to 1 beta bytes read and write speeds
making the system incredibly snappy so
yeah that's let's take let's talk about
the the back panel of our system so
basically this is a power switch for the
for the PSU then then down here we have
with the with the Maximus 5 formula we
have a thunderbolt port we have like an
internal integrated Wireless and
Bluetooth card we have our standard USB
connectors here we have an onboard
onboard HDMI and DisplayPort connector
which we don't use in that case because
we have our dedicated to the GPX 690
graphics card in there we have some more
ports here for analog audio or optical
s/pdif which we also don't use because
we actually do use our our DVI port on
the HDX 690 within HDMI connector it's
it's actually the same standard
transmitting both sound and and video to
the AVR and from there to the TV so we
have our true HD 7.1 lost less
bitstreams
audio and and of course lossless video
to the TV with it and we go up here see
our our fan spinning we actually
use the gentle typhoon fans which are
known as to is the best fans for for
radiator views and also the most silent
or the highest pressure that's what beer
we were known for and then here
our engineers like building pluck at so
you have to get the signature of whoever
built your system which will then later
we also using for contact person and in
case you experiencing any any problems
would you hopefully don't
so basically when we talk about the
noise level or system it's it's
completely inaudible in silent there's
three theoretical sources of noise which
is the fans which is the pump and the
hard drive which are the mechanical
parts in there and we like all the all
the all the stuff we use is completely
inaudible in idle and optimized for that
and then of course the defense will turn
up a little bit once once the load
levels go up but it's still gonna be an
extremely silent system and really made
for for the living room
yeah so now let me just show you how
well a high-end piece of gaming from
from the couch really works a bit slow
basically for you like I have the
keyword random I like the works Persian
Guinea indeed it's a smaller keyboard
we'll put it to your right side you can
either like clicking here or uses
Thunder it's WASD keys so we have a
wireless said she saw a doctor tech
mouse here at K 800 keyword both work
very well in a long distance living room
environment which is very important
because all the interferences you have
with other wireless devices but those
we've tested a lot early a lot of
devices out there and those to work work
perfectly you know lag free and yeah
just give it a shot with Crysis 2 and
yeah have a look and
see see for yourself how it goes and how
inserted actually is and and how
comfortable it is just just to gain from
it so far
okay so here's now we're playing on our
70 inch full HD 3d TV basically this is
2d now because the camera can pick up 3d
we love to play games in 3d and Crysis 2
natively supports it so it would
actually work but there's no point in
showing you and the first thing I want
to present to you is like how really
like how instant electri the mouse works
now so you see the mouse how I move it
and see it on the screen it's like it's
like connecting it with a cable and
coming from a Counter Strike competitive
background I'm really sensitive to think
like that so that was one of our
prerequisites if you want to do a gaming
htpc and if you like check out this
detail and enrichment and everything
looks like
doing some soul whatever is out there
it's so much better and then this is
full HD and hardware settings which is
the maximum you can do on prices to that
system we crossing the hunger that PS
limit as you can see in the right corner
that's perhaps and that's our current
fps and in Full HD officer
and when we come to systems max itself
like a temper just see them down there
on the possibly longer door which is
always running in the background so you
can just like that flight full control
over your settings and yeah and this
keeping really cool that we have like
CPU 1065
yeah working really well so yeah now
we're done showing you the gaming part
so what I'm gonna do now is show you
some some
stress tester so I'm just gonna like
the alt tap switch and leaf prices
running in the background so it's that
system running see there and now we're
gonna stop just our stress testing with
prime95 over the live line test for
Duran and like the very high CPU
utilization and at the same time or on
fur mark which is like a high end GPU
stress test so you can see on the screen
below there that both CPU and GPU
working 100% low levels and the CPU as
with liquid cooling going up to 75 mile
the GPU stays really cool left at 45 and
then really slowly going up and remember
that's a that's a normal clock 377 was
here okay overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz
and voltages up respectively and yeah
also the GPUs it's a 690 Hydra copper
which comes pre overclocked factory wise
because didn't do anything else there
but still as if I'd be some heat the
system suggests this just things we need
to reassign in a cool
so yeah now you got some first
impression of our system and I hope we
could convince you and it's actually
called the lead because we believe it's
it's really truly elite and if you would
like to just check it out have a closer
look see some photos some specs can
check out our website on www stagger
dynamics comm or find us on the web and
just google us and yeah have a look you
can configure it and yeah we'd like to
hear from you bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
