digital storm would you like a chance to
win our nine 290x make sure you check
out the link in the description below
what's going on buddy welcome back once
again detected Mr World War once again
filming outdoors this time that bill
Blevins barked probably the only Parkers
Rowland Heights that exist and we
decided to climb to the top of the hill
and what's really interesting we got
this thing in the mail though from
Nvidia now this is a pretty interesting
thing says what would Gore didn't do now
obviously they're talking about Gordon
Freeman and that's gonna be half-life 2
is supposed to be coming over to the
shield you guys can see there's a little
shield on there as well but we actually
use this for something a little bit
different now even though Nvidia is
releasing this and giving this away and
promoting stuff we actually had another
reason for using it JJ from a Zeus came
over to our house and he did some
filming and what I actually did is I
took this ice-truck JJ and I took the
striker striker gtx760 striker Platinum
accelerates your game now obviously this
is gonna be one of their high-end cards
and this thing looks pretty bitchin so
here's the Box front nomenclature on the
side in case somebody's looking to
purchase it lab is also down below
obviously in the description I'm a lot
like button we will we will we will and
then we'll be here show you guys the
back of the box this real quick and
that's the back of box net Oh way it
goes huh so content this would be you
know the bundle or content of the box
inside the little lazy thing I'll pull
it all out of here not a whole lot to
get but let's just get it all out of
here so we've got drivers manual that's
right drivers manual teaches you how to
drive
we've got SLI cable a super duper long
one so regardless of you know how far
your cards reporting the motherboard
this will work you also have your speed
setup guide bun Tonto and last but not
least your 8 pin 2 dual 6-pin connector
right there eight two dual sixes for
being kabane and that's pretty much it
for that stuff
don't don't uh check this out we'll
start off in the back now everybody
really really loves this about a Zeus
cards is the shield super duper tough
don't worry about cutting your hands up
showing the card out any of that other
type of stuff at all just flip it around
real quick you guys can see there's a
single six pin single eight pin power
connection you guys can almost see the
heat pipe reading it all the way across
the top flip it around you can see
there's two fans so like their DC -
series of cards you have two fans and
also something really cool also right
here on top you can see this thing that
says Republic of gamers when you plug
your card in this actually lights up
pretty bitchin stuff right I think so
you also have your two sli fingers that
are right here these cards would do up
to triple SLI here's the ER I owe these
guys pretty much stick to the standard
rear i/o that you see on any any Nvidia
card to DV is standard HDMI standard
DisplayPort nothing new there what's new
those is a complete rog bitching looking
card that's gonna be priced right gtx
760 is a very nicely priced card you
guys all know that stuff but this
thing's not quite out on the market yet
