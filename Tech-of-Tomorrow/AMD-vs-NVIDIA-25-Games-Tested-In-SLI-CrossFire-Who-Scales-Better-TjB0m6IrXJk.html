once again to the channel now the
biggest question that I get from people
all the time is how well this SLI or
crossfire work how many games does it
actually work on is it worth the money
and should you actually even do it well
we've tested 25 different games on
intents platform to show you which games
actually fully take advantage of these
technologies and which games really
don't so instead of hearing me talk
let's first check out that test system
and then let's rock the Frick out to the
benchmark song and check out the benches
this is the current test system that
we're using but we're totally upgrading
this and the next time you guys see the
test scores come out we'll have an i7
6700 K on a brand new nice z170
motherboard so stay tuned now it's time
to rock out to the benchmark and check
those scores out
all right your back will put rocket down
for a second talk about this stuff so as
you guys can see we tested 25 games and
that of all of those games only eight of
them really didn't scale well at all
with SLI or with crossfire and pretty
much that's quite a good amount of games
that actually do scale pretty well now
the big question out there is is do you
need this now if you're a person who has
a very small catalogue of games and
you're the type of person just buys a
game on game day plays it and then it's
completely done with it and I don't know
if you really might want to do this but
if you're a person who has a lot of
catalogue and games and steam and stuff
and you have a lot of older games like I
have like minute like almost like 300
300 games on there so like for me
there's a lot of benefit to having
either SLI or crossfire because in
certain games when it does take
advantage of it it does a damn fine job
and obviously when it doesn't well
that's just a few frames here and there
and it's not really worth talking about
and as newer games come at it sometimes
takes these games a while to catch up
and patch everything to make sure that
it works perfectly within the crossfire
or the SLI environment now I will say
this overall that for the whole gaming
it did seem like just slightly a wee bit
that the SLI was a little bit more
stable as some of the games that we were
playing in crossfire did show some
screen tearing and stuff it's not the
end of the world I didn't really put it
inside the testing anyways because it
could just be something that we saw
maybe somebody else wouldn't have it so
I'm not kind of like really push that so
pretty much you can see right now
they're you know they're running pretty
close it's not that big of a deal and
the reason that we use these particular
cards instead of all the new ones and
everything out there is because these
particular cards a lot of people have
out there in the world let's just face
it 9 maybe so lots and lots of cards
290x great well-priced card people have
them out there so at the end of the day
I have to say this if you've got the
money that having a single card is all
you can get get the absolute best card
you can get if you're doing that because
that's gonna be your best solution if
you're an uber gamer but if you have
like I said a huge
huge catalogue of games you play games
all the time replan having sli or
crossfire is definitely a solution you
wanna have inside yolo system so I'm
Eric you've been watching Tekken
tomorrow
like usual we'll have links down below
for these cards you want to check them
out for yourself and we'll see you back
here on checking tomorrow from war
goodness we've got that too FTW coming
the gigabyte g1 gaming coming and
obviously something from team red and
black to which you guys have all been
talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
