Elle or Karen taqaddum arm we're about
to bring you an unboxing and first look
of the brand new flagship phone from LG
the LG V 20 now you guys might be asking
why I'm not doing a full review and I
just want to state right off the bat
that some people out there do have
reviews but these reviews should all be
taken with a grain of salt because LG
has specifically said that there will be
a couple of different features when the
model actually gets released into the
United States one of the main things I
believes are going to be changing the
battery out and doing a couple different
insight technical things so actually any
full review that you see out there isn't
technically accurate and that's why
we're not going to bring you the full
review today we're just gonna bring you
the unboxing first look and then we get
the actual foam that it's going to be
the working model then we'll do the full
review and show you the scores so
obviously we got the box right here nice
little LG box all white all around you
pop that out now LG is pretty much
pushing this phone saying that it's
pretty much for storytellers they want
the phone to be designed for people who
are out taking pictures making movies
basically doing anything that's media
interactive you know like nowadays
everybody's twerking everybody's doing
stuff on the internet so this phone is
completely designed to do that not only
is it just your phone for answering your
phone there's supposed to be high
quality audio this thing actually has a
DAC and yes there is a headphone jack in
the v20 so not to worry about that
whatsoever now okay so now that I've
taken the box out of the sleeve let's
take a closer look over here on this
side you guys can see we have the LGB 20
phone we have the accessories the power
plug and the charger and then finally we
have the battery right here now the
phone itself is something of a mixed
blend of things because it has a lot of
features that are really nice and then a
couple of things that just aren't so
nice so let's first off do something
that we normally don't do let's actually
talk about the size of the phone now the
LGV 20 it's size is in at 159 point
seven by seventy eight point one by
seven point six millimeters so you know
it's going to be pretty thin and it's
also pretty large the screen on front is
actually quite amazing it's a 5.7 inch
IPS screen that features a resolution of
25
five 60 by 1440 and 513 pixels per inch
there's also a secondary IPS quantum
display that's kind of like the s7 and
this is 160 by 1040 but still has 513
pixels per inch now some things that you
cannot see since they're obviously
inside of the phone is the Snapdragon
820 processor this phone also comes with
four gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes
of internal storage right off the bat
and you also have an SD slot so you can
do up to two terabytes of external
storage via that so a lot of options as
far as the storage goes now these guys
are really touting all of their audio
features on the phone like we said
before there is an audio jack still so
you stick it on long jack and there's
actually an internal built-in there's
four different DAX inside of it so your
audio experience should be very very
wealthier headphone since it actually
has a DAC built inside of it
that's geared for good audio there's
also two stereo speakers now from what
I've seen so far and heard the speakers
from other people's reviews and stuff
the speaker's don't sound like they're
the most like outrageous things in the
world and for something is totally
geared and saying that they're geared
towards audio and doing stuff like that
I would have thought the speakers might
have been a little bit better now they
also have a smart microphone inside of
this phone as well so the LGV 20 should
be able to go out and record all of your
things like concerts and stuff and since
it does have that smart mic even the
high end signals like high volume and
stuff like that shouldn't distort on the
phone you should be recorded stuff so
making their own home videos that type
of stuff should all be very very well
there's also two cameras on the phone
the LGB 20 actually contains two
wide-angle lens one for the front and
one for the rear the wide-angle
capabilities the front rear cameras
capture photos with an inclusive
background meaning users get more in the
frame and leave nothing out
the five megapixel front camera has a
120 degree lens that expands the selfie
experience so take bigger pictures with
even more friends now the five megapixel
front camera we all know that's not
going to be a great camera it's made for
selfies and stuff like that the 16
megapixel rear camera however has a lot
of different features that people are
going to like and we'll be doing a
separate review comparing different
phones and their different camera
features you know like the iPhone 7 I
told you guys I was very interested in
those features on the i7
you know the plus on this phone as well
I want to check out all the camera
features and bring you guys actually
videos comparing the camera features
some of the new features are auto shot
the auto shop function on the front
camera produces perfect selfies with its
face detection feature this triggers the
shot when the subject is ready and
smiling LG touts of the new V 20 has the
fastest and most stable autofocus that
you can get and it doesn't in any
environment which means that pretty much
all you need to do is point at the image
and click and if it does that that's
going to be a very nice feature of the
LGB 20 steady record 2.0 is the latest
version by LG for image stabilization
and here you guys can see that even
though Jesus had the camera in his hand
walking he was still able to film me and
Buddy the dog without any problems
whatsoever and this is a great way to
show you the image stabilization powered
by the ESS sabri es9 2 + 8 engine the
quad deck and the b20 delivers clearer
sound by minimizing distortion and
ambient noise by up to 50 percent and
like I said previously the audio
recorder inside of the V 20 is based off
smart technology what that means is if
it's at low volume it's going to
increase the way that it records and if
it's too loud it's going to pad it
making sure that you get a clear and
even signal all the time on your phone
also another audio feature that's
currently only available though on the
Korean models is LG has partnered up
with B&amp;amp;O play and this helps bring the
most natural and balanced sound to your
phone via their technology the LG b 20
is made of a couple of different new
materials it's made of an aircraft type
of luminance use in planes bicycles and
that type of stuff and it's also made
with another polymer to make the entire
finish of the phone complete now some
things about the LG v 20 which I was
just kind of like shocked about is that
there's no dust or water resistance
whatsoever on the LG v 20 and I would
have thought that you know with all the
other features they're throwing into the
phone
why isn't there anything like that you
see all the other phones that are being
released they have at least some type of
water or dust resistance and this phone
is kind of lagging in those areas so if
you drop it in water you get it to dusty
or whatever you may have some problems
with the phone now the good thing though
is that this phone has passed all kinds
of drop tests so from a 4-foot angle
they've dropped it on space on its side
right around around around and they say
the phone is very very durable and it's
up to military specs so that's a good
thing about the phone I mean I don't
really know how much you know the dust
and water protection really comes in for
a person just use their phone in their
house or for business I mean if you're
not out in a lake or you know being
around any crazier you'll probably be
just fine but it definitely has to be
mentioned when we're talking about the
LGB 20 I think one of the biggest things
though about LG's b20 is it's going to
be released with nougat 7.0 so it'll be
the very first smart devices out in the
market to have this on so LG's got
something going on for them there it'll
actually be a little bit ahead of the
pack when they release the LGB 20 this
month another thing worth mentioning is
the new mobile user interface the LG UX
5.0 plus the LG b 20 comes with the
mobile user interface LG UX 5.0 plus to
make it easier to use this technology
was first introduced on the LG g5 and
basically all it has been done has been
updated to make it more user friendly
and more ergonomic for the user another
thing of note is that the LG v 20 is the
very first smart device to feature
googles in apps now what in apps is is
it searches through everything on your
phone to find the information that you
need much quicker and much easier the
controls on the LG v 20 are also very
simple there's a single button on the
back on the left hand side we have two
control buttons and on the right hand
side we have something very unique with
this button you're able to push it and
then take off the back of your phone
case so that you can install the battery
this is actually pretty nifty and very
easy to use taking the back off the LG
v20 you guys can see there's room for
the battery room for the SIM card and
room for the SD alright Tech fans so
there you have it the unboxing and
pretty much first look of the LG v20 the
latest flagship phone for the people
over at LG we'll have a full review on
this phone in just a couple of weeks
when you get our sample and this phone
will be released later on this month
first in Korea and then around the world
I'm Elric you've been watching techni
tomorrow down below it like button will
have more information so if you want to
check out more information about this
phone for yourself
you can do so we'll see you guys
background ticker tomorrow for more tech
and soon the full review of the LG
20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
