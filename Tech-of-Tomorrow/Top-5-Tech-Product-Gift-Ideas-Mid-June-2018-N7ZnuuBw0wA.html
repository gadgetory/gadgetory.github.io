there's always new companies new
Kickstarter's new projects always taking
off and people want their product to get
known so whether they're way to get
known well then they get their products
to a youtuber like myself to bring those
products and show you guys just what
these products are so today I have five
products and today's video is sponsored
by these various companies they all
brought today's video to the table just
so you guys could see their particular
products they're all pretty cool they
start up at $59 go all the way up to 179
dollars or some really expensive and
crazy earbuds that I think you're gonna
trip are just how the design is made on
them so that's what today's video is all
about so let's jump right in
let's check out these five different
products and if you guys like them hate
we'll have links below where you guys
can check them out and buy them for
yourself so with that said let's go
first up we have a pair of headphones
for $59 and they're an Amazon choice
product as well now these are the ACI
lh1 wireless in-ear headphones now these
things are pretty well made
they're definitely better than your
budget headphones especially the
wireless bluetooth ones you know the
cheap ones that you see on the Shelf
these are way better than those it's got
a simple matte plastic design and a
comfortable set of liquid silicone
rubber ear tips to make them comfortable
inside your ears you also get three
extra sets of different sized ear tips
so you shouldn't have a problem finding
the right size to fit inside your ear
comfortably this particular set of
headphones has a Knolls balanced
armature driver and a dynamic driver
that worked together to bring you a
balanced sound these headphones are also
eye px5 waterproof rated and they are
magnetic too so when you aren't using
them they can kind of dangle down like a
necklace battery life is 11 hours on a
single charge which is pretty good too
and to get a full charge can take
anywhere up to two hours the h1s also
have a remote on the cable for your
music so you can fast-forward rewind
play or pause if you want to make a call
hey you can do that as well as far as
the sound quality goes with the H ones I
feel that they're very very sound note
what I mean by this is that they do not
color your sound with any particular
variety of tones and there's not too
many highs not too many lows not too
many mids it's really just right down
the center of the road which is good for
pretty much listening to any type of
music you want and plus I think you'll
be really surprised at how loud these
headphones actually are and best of all
they have a one-year warranty and are
only $59 and I didn't mention it before
they're an Amazon choice product which
means that lots of people have used them
and said hey these are nice next up
another set of headphones and we're also
doing this in the price order so from
low to high it's so these are the air by
crazy baby now these are pretty
interesting because they come in a pill
like environment like the whole set
comes in this little pill thing which
you can actually plug in through your
USB C port as well and charge it so
that's kind of pretty cool but they have
a lot of other features as well so let's
check those out like I said the air by
crazy baby nanos they come in a cool
little pilled magnetic case now this
thing sizes in the capsule is
twenty-seven point five millimeters in
diameter and 88 millimeters in length to
charge the crazy baby nanos you guys
will see that on the end of the case it
has a USB type-c charging port it also
comes with three extra sets of rubber
ear tips and wingtips for an extra fit
for comfort I think the most headphones
out there come with these nowadays but
it does make it really nice we're just
trying to dial in your comfort level the
nanos feature high fidelity sound
passive noise isolation and they're true
wireless stereo bluetooth headphones
they're also splash proof what's also
crazy is they come in 10 different
colors yeah that's right I'm not going
to name them all up but you guys can see
right here 10 different colors which is
just amazing Atlantis green volt green
what's going on here one thing that's
also very unique about the air product
is that it uses industry-leading 998
custom-made carbon nanotube diaphragms
to get all that great sound so
wirelessly you can get about a maximum
of 12 hours listening time now the
headphones by themselves without the
charging case they get about three hours
but
with the case you get another five to
nine hours the frequency response on the
air headphones is eight Hertz all the
way up to 24 kilohertz and the impedance
is 16 ohms some people might find it a
bit strange but there's only a single
button required for the operation of the
air headphones there's a single button
on the side of the headphones which can
be used as the play previous or forward
functions when you're listening to music
and can also act as an answering machine
or a hang-up button when you're using
your phone okay so probably the only
real caveat I'd have about these
particular headphones as they are pretty
bass heavy so if you're a person who
doesn't like kind of bass heavy stuff
you may want to look elsewhere but if
you listen to rap or pop or anything
like that these headphones will sound
really nice for you for rocking stuff
they're just okay for classical music
and not really in the thing for that or
anything like that but if you listen to
music that has a lot of bass and a lot
of lower tones in it you might be really
impressed these headphones they're
currently 99 bucks so if you're in them
you think they're interesting check them
out now next up as far as the pricing
goes is the k3 from the people over get
creative and Sound Blaster this is a
pretty unique product because it's not
only your headphone DAC it's your audio
amplifier it's a mixing board it has
auto-tune all kinds of different hookups
and stuff honestly if you're a person
who loves to do music and you like to be
on the go and you want to stream and be
able to do a lot of different things on
YouTube this is a pretty unique product
you may want to really check out so
let's check it out
a little in-depth you guys can see there
are two standard XLR jacks now these
jacks are also phantom powered which
means that you can use that type of
microphone that match that and it will
have the power built into it something
you really don't see in a unit this
small and especially not for 129 bucks
next up you get a guitar input jack this
is your High Line's e jack and next to
that you get two headphone amps and yes
you can control each headphone amp
individually so all-in-all this product
has a lot of different features in it
like I said just even for the inputs the
k3 is completely USB powered so you
don't have to worry about carrying
around any type of thing but they also
do offer an external battery
back if you ever wanted to pick that up
now in the back side of the unit you
guys can see there are two RCA's for
lineout now if you want to record from
your phone something also very
interesting as the next connection now
this is a 3.5 millimeter mobile input
jack and to the right of that the line
out you see two more RCA jacks and fine
to the right of that is the USB
connection port for keeping your unit
powered on something also unique about
this product is that you can plug and
play with phones tablets PC and Macs
with no driver installation necessary at
all the K 3 features 24-bit 96k low hurt
crystal-clear audio playback it also
features an auto tune and reverb engine
now what this means that if you're
singing into it it will give you auto
tune and you can also add different
types of reverb depending on your style
and sound all the controls are located
on the top of the unit starting on the
left hand side you can see there's some
operation controls for different types
of reverb next to that you have two
little boxes which show what parameters
are going on you also see the auto tune
button and the reverb delay control as
well and above that there's also
something very interesting a button for
controlling whether the song is in minor
or major mode next to that are your
mixing controls next to that your
monitor controls now down below you can
see the input control you have controls
for your base and your treble you also
have control for your mic input and for
your guitar input as well you guys can
see that next to that there's a little
button that says voiceover now
underneath the voiceover button is the
sound board button now there's also six
different effects that are built inside
the unit and you use this button to
control them and access them above that
is the mobile in control and then
finally down below that is the phantom
power button now right next to that is
the output control you have your mobile
out and then the controls for both of
those headphone jacks like we spoke of
earlier if you're somebody out there who
loves music likes being on the go uses
their laptop and doesn't have a whole
lot of money to invest in killer
equipment and your youtuber the k3 plus
seriously is something you can look into
it's a very nice
and for price for $129.99 I gotta say I
honestly personally would use this unit
it works great we tried it here and it
worked very very easily with no problems
at all if you want more information Hey
like usual we'll have a link at the end
next up is the z3 edge s3 dual - canvas
products and we're gonna be going hey
this is gonna be pretty cool you might
be going hmm but people who are uber and
those type of drivers that are out there
you know working on the road this
product might be definitely something
for you to record what's going on inside
your car and then the unit's pretty neat
because one part hooks up to the very
front and you can either have it
recording inside of the car or you can
have it recording everything's going on
in front of the car you can also set the
other camera at the very back of the car
and record everything that's going on
back there or recording you turn the
other way and you can film what's going
on in your car so you know I mean if
you're one of those uber type driver
stuff and you get some unruly clients
this type of particular product could
actually save your butt at your job you
can say hey look there's how these
people are actually behaving it's not me
it's them now one thing cool about the Z
edge s3 for those people are out there
do a lot of driving is that you never
have to miss a license plate ever again
because you can simultaneous record it
in the front and in the rear now if you
only use a single camera which means you
disconnect the rear camera you can get a
qHD resolution of 2560 by 1440 P at 30
frames per second but with both cameras
hooked up you get HD 1920 by 1080 P but
still at 30 frames per second for
additional protection the 470 milliamp
battery enables 30 minute video
recording even with the engine off the Z
edge s3 also works very well at night it
actually has technology built-in which
allows it to work really well even in
dark light spots and make sure you still
get a crisp picture so that you can see
what's going on ahead of you the Z edge
s3 features a hundred and fifty degree
viewing angle and this is done by six
precisely engineered optical glass
lenses which capture that 150 degrees of
viewing
recording more of the road around you
the Z edge also features parking mode
with parking mode enabled the device
continues to monitor the vehicle even
when the engine is switched off and like
I said earlier it can do this for up to
30 minutes once your car is turned off
there are a lot of different features
with the Z edge now the only caveat I
would say is that even though this unit
isn't that hard to wire up unless you
really want a bunch of wires going from
the front to the back of your car I
would honestly suggest getting somebody
who installs you know professional
stereos and that type of stuff in your
car because they'll be able to install
this so you don't see any wires
whatsoever and it'll be totally
beautiful just like a nice PC case with
all that nice wire management so if you
want that done you might have to pay a
little money but beyond that the unit
works really good it's easy to install
has a lot of different features for
those people out there who are looking
like this like I said before if you're
an uber driver and you want to record
what's going on inside of your car and
give her those unruly clients well this
must might be your any ticket now next
up is a product from the company I home
it that's right I home and I had a
couple times saying well I want to say a
moment moment but no it's I Holman this
is a digital photo frame that also acts
as a two-way calling device so not only
can you check out all the cool pictures
of your family and stuff like that
you can also talk on the phone with it
and have FaceTime with somebody as well
which is pretty cool so you know if you
don't have a giant screen at your house
but you want to seem like a nice big
picture of your grandma or some and she
knows how to do this off her phone well
you can be having a conversation and do
that so let's jump right in and let's
check out what the eye helmet digital
photo frame is really all about many of
the digital picture frames in the market
are just smart to support Wi-Fi but with
I moment they decide to take it one step
further and use AI technology the eye
Holman digital photo frame features
something really interesting it
automatically organizes all of your
photos to different places like two dogs
two trees two people so you don't really
have to worry about that and you can
custom set it if you'd like to if you
don't like the parameters of this basic
function but it does make things really
really
to store all your photos on let's just
face it if you can just look at
something go oh yeah that's where it
goes it's really simple now as far as
the specs go the eye helmet features the
nine point seven inch IPS display with a
resolution which is an HD touchscreen
resolution of 1024 by 768 you can also
control the eye holman from your voice
that's right you can control your frames
simply by asking and you can manage your
device from any corner in your room if
you're someone with the family and I
mean a close-knit family who likes to
talk all the time and share those
special moments with the eye helmet you
can make hands-free video or voice calls
to anyone within the photo frame from
anywhere at any time this particular
feature of the eye Homan is something
that I think is really nice because I
think it actually has a lot of potential
the eye home and app is also pretty cool
you can download it on your phone this
way you can share photos you can share
videos you can do a lot of stuff then
it'll install on any smart device
whether it's an iPhone or an Android you
can also upload your photos and your
videos by various methods by SD card by
USB by your mobile device by ur computer
or by cloud storage so you really never
have to worry about missing that special
moment so you guys can see the I Holmen
has a lot of features beyond being just
a standard digital photo frame the
ability to have all of your pictures
automatically classified and stored for
you that's really really cool the fact
that you can do all that FaceTime with
your families and videos back and forth
do storage through all kinds of
different device including the cloud
it's honestly a really interesting
product so if you guys want to know even
more about this product well obviously

want to bring into your family's life
