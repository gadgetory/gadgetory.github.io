trump tower where asus is running strong
we're in their sleep and we're with the
man you guys know him mr. JJ he's been
with me many many times and they've got
lots of exciting products but one of the
biggest ones that everybody keeps asking
me to talk about is the new Ares to card
I mean my email box is filling up so
with that said we're going to talk about
this so JJ come on men let's hear about
this new areas doing all the great
things about it well I mean pretty much
this almost self-explanatory I mean Ares
is already kind of pre known from our
previous launch of the product at being
a you know previous worlds fastest
graphics card so with areas too that's
once again what we're focusing in and so
this is two 7970 gigahertz edition cars
onto regular 79 70s the two gigahertz
edition cards sandwich into a single PCB
to make the world's fastest graphics
card one of the coolest things are going
to see right off the bat is that
historically our previous and highest
end cards have always been triple slot
this is only a two slot card and the
reason why is we have an entirely custom
cooling solution so it's hybrid we have
a air cooler that's a downward firing
detection cooling our PCB and our brm
assembly so we got all that really
awesome stuff like the digi+ power to
buying the SI p power components but
then we also got this double-wide
radiator with the cold plate which is
actually cooling the two GPUs so it's
like pretty much like twice the amount
of coolant you could normally get you've
got all your standard air cooling plus
you've got liquid cooling all in a
single card under percent and so that
gives us two big advantages one we can
keep awesome thermal performance and two
we can keep it really quiet even under
gaming load and as you saw when checked
out the thermal performance temperatures
in GPU tweak on average we're usually
only looking between about 53 to about
57 see so if that was just one card that
would be really impressive but the fact
that we're doing with two GPUs at that
full clock speed is awesome and think
about this guy's with the card worrying
that cool you get all kinds of headroom
for doing the overclocking and over
bolting because you've got it running
that cool when you're increasing all
those things it's going to maintain that
coolant instead of getting hot and
shutting down on you right yeah
definitely I mean usually with you know
an Aries ties class product you know
most people are just going to kind of
drop it in set and forget it's kind of
like you
running the best of the best you know in
terms of display output connectivity
it's a given you got five way or six my
affinity it's fully supported no little
mini sized connections to duly execute
to DVI and then for full size DP ports
you got the pitbull the got the
assignable bio switch that's on the card
is well unless you toggle between
different resolutions and like always
it's going to be limited to 1000 pieces
global production it's going to be
coming pretty soon to the market MSRP
$1,500 so definitely for the guys that
are looking for the absolute best of the
best now these would be also signed you
say there is an addition signature on
them there's actually a laser etched
serial number yes that will denote each
cards limited edition status so not only
you're getting a video card you're
basically getting a collector's item
because there's only a thousand pieces
this is going to be a very hard item to
get and with all you guys out there
coveting them you know they're going to
be gone like that now one other question
mmm Remy what's on it three gigabytes
six gigabytes six gigabytes of memory
it's running out to full gear its clock
speed so you got 6.6 gigahertz as far as
the frequency goes and six gigs for you
guys that are loved and do one you know
3-way affinity or even five way or six
way yeah this one's on you guys about
why you guys asked me all time what's
going between a 3 gigabytes is 6
gigabyte card with a 3 gigabyte card you
can make all the bells and whistles go
but you go to that six gigabyte card you
can have triple monitors running at the
highest resolutions and still maintain
all the bells and whistles you guys have
seen us do videos and other stuff like
that when we get a hold this card will
do a monitor stuff for you guys once
again because this is going to be
incredible alright folks so there you
see it the new Ares to buy a Zeus coming
to mark with a thousand pieces $1,500
digitally etched it's going to be an
overclocking mad beast we'll see you
guys back here with another video with
JJ really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
