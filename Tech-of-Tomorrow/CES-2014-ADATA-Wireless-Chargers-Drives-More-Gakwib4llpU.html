booth at CES 2014 of the a dudes with
other charging station food you guys
know everybody has mobile technology two
days I mean everybody has everything in
your phone to your iPad to your whatever
pad and there's all kinds of products
these guys have now one of the latest
ones this one right here though this is
the elite siiii 700 it's a wireless
charging system you don't have to plug
anything in whatsoever you just set your
device by it a little thing up in your
screen and will automatically charge
your device so that's awesome that means
you have to worry about a power charger
you not to worry about if you forgot
your pledge actually I did coming to
vegas i forgot my power plug for my
phone so if i had this product right now
which maybe i'll ask for i can actually
charge my phone that have to bug in a
few rounds because a you know i did a
brain fart and didn't bring my in there
but they have all kinds of cool stuff
and you guys can see here starting out
to the dash drive air you guys have seen
this before sort of wireless little
storage device you can stream stuff out
from it connect to it awesome for those
people who like to have their
information all inside their home they
have their new dash by verdi 8800 we
also see the dash drive durable coming
in at 32 gigabytes really really small
portable product right here it's this is
being charged right here like I said
this is the wireless thing and you can
set it up different ways according to
what you want to do so if you have a one
phone that's bigger than the other you
want to do something different you can
set up in different ways I'm trying to
remember how exactly this thing opened
up here I know that it does open up all
right well it does open up folks trust
me here's it's already open and this
part right here I can slide in and out
and you can set it up different ways to
accommodate different phones so that's
pretty cool this is a real giant one so
you want to have it like that so you can
set this bad boy on there and have it
well balanced over here we see the last
bit which is their power banks these are
things you take with you you can take it
and charge your phone or whatever you
want to use just plug it in and
automatically has a charge inside of
these so it automatically charges the
device that you want to it that's pretty
much with all these products all the way
down here are including this one for
ladies so you think we're going to give
this one as use the cameras man
it matches his own nevermind I can't say
it on camera but it's getting pretty
loud here in the a data booth so I'm
gonna out of here but this is the
last bit folks so we'll see you guys
here for more videos at CES 2014 next up
