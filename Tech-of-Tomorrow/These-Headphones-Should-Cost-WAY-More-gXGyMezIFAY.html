tech of tomorrow now if you're out there
and you're a person is a lot of
traveling or you're looking for a pair
of headphones that are noise canceling
but won't break the bank like those
insanely priced bose ones then today
we're going to check out the e foix m
solace these things are under sixty
bucks
have a lot of great features and if
you're a person who travels a lot and
you're worried about losing something
and don't want to worry about the price
this may be your a ticket let's delve in
so instead of doing a traditional
unboxing we took the stuff out of the
box but here's the box there's not much
to it there's some of that too you know
the weird silicon in there to keep it
from getting a wet line goes around the
world then we got the headphones
themselves these come in the box as we
flip the cap right here you guys can see
we've got the old-school plane connector
mountain opening planes still use these
but I think back in the day they use
they fit a lot but not anymore so that's
off the size you've got your mini to
your standard and then you've got your
cable that goes from your output device
into the cans themselves and then lastly
we've got a nice little like instruction
manual that tells you about these cans
now they're pretty interesting 44
millimeter drivers inside of here these
things are pretty decent no super
extreme a high-end name or anything like
that because once again these headphones
are under $60 now the thing that I like
about them though is they are extremely
extremely comfortable so if you're a
person who's traveling on a plane and
stuff like that and you don't want to
hear that background noise in the plane
you can simply turn on the noise
cancellation features and then snippy's
things on your head and be comfortable
for a very long period of time if you're
traveling around a plane you simply just
plug in the jack and then plug it into
the plane or if you've got your Walkman
or anything like that
Paige did you catch that the Walkman who
the original the og the Walkman but if
you got any kind of device you know that
that takes a little piggy stick it in
there and get your audio through these
now as far as the sound goes these
things can get very very loud the
souls's can get pretty blasting in your
ears you can trump the bass in trouble
and adjust it to where you want it to be
like compared to some of the others I
would say these do have a little bit
more bass so if your person who prefers
the Bayesian
things you might be a person who likes
the soleus now there's two sets of
controls the volume rocker and the
controls for turning it on and off the
noise cancellation are all located on
the right hand side and on the other
side you simply have the plug that
connects into your output device very
very simple stuff now people ask a lot
about the noise canceling feature what
exactly is noise canceling I mean really
does it cancel noise yet what it's meant
to do is like get rid of background
noise like humming washing machines
engines on planes that type of stuff
it's not meant to cut out somebody
talking directly to you or voices you
wouldn't want that to happen and like
you know if somebody's my smacking you
you want to be able hear somebody
talking to you but if you want to get on
a plane or be somewhere in public and
you want to skip rid of that background
noise you simply switch on that noise
canceling device and to use the noise
canceling feature of the headphones
you'll need to remove the side cover and
add a couple of your own triple-a
batteries batteries are not included now
real quick though let's take a listen to
a couple of audio clips of the different
kinds of audio and see what you guys
think now I know it's not the exact
totally true representation because
they're not on top of your head but it's
the best I can bring you the digital
format so let's check that out real
quick
okay so here's what I think folks the
bottom line is these headphones are only
$60 now I know there are some higher end
you know headphones that are out there
but they don't offer any of the noise
canceling features that you see in this
now
does the noise canceling feature work
absolutely the most beautiful in the
entire world I don't know we tried the
Bose ones and honestly they do offer a
little bit better noise protection
that's just how it is but those
headphones are also in the four and $500
range these headphones are very well
made they're very very flexible as you
guys skells feel like timing or not
that'd be kind of crazy like a time
they're not but like I said 60 bucks
they're very comfortable the drivers
inside of them they sound really good a
little bass II so people like bass
you're going to enjoy that but if you're
traveling around a lot and you don't
want to spend a bunch of money on
headphones because you might lose them
or custom might lose your bag and you're
screwed out of all that money I think
these are an excellent what I would say
be set for you you know if you've got
the money near an audiophile person
you're going to want to buy the best you
can get but if you're not the most
extreme audiophile you want something
that works you want something that's not
going to break the bank
I think the soul is just might be your a
ticket I'm Eric you've been watching
taken tomorrow like usual we'll have
links down below where you guys can
purchase a pair for yourself and we
always want to hear your guys's comments
and what you guys have to say here on
the channel
and best of all now that we're back in
business we'll go ahead and give these
away to you guys and announce it over on
Twitter see you guys back here for more
