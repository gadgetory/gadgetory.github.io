you guys back here once again on tech of
tomorrow we're going to bring you guys
some more tech shiz Nick
what are we bringing today well if you
guys happen to miss it we're giving away
a full-blown Haswell system that's right
this is a fifteen hundred dollar gaming
system that features that the CPU we're
going to be looking at today and a GTX
770 lots of other parts so if you guys
happen to miss that check that out in
the vid back here behind me but with
that said this is the 46 70k this is an
unlocked CPU from Intel coming in at 3.4
gigahertz and we've got it right here in
front of us so let's go ahead and unbox
this thing and see what it's all about
alright folks so here we have it here is
the box first we'll just show you guys
the front of it flip it around the side
real quick you guys can see they have a
little CPU in the little window there
for those people who like to see that
then around the side you can see LGA
1150 this is the has well made for the
new z87 chipset
not much really to the box I mean the
back of it just shows you some stuff for
like it's made and stuff like that
that's pretty much it but not a lot to
it so let's start off by opening it up
you can see there's a little tab right
here keeping it closed I've got my over
extraordinary knife right here to do
this go ahead take a stop by here and
I'll throw it at one of the side people
damn I think I took out the camera room
with that one go ahead and pop the cap
here see once again we have a box within
a box in the box let's go ahead and
slide this out kablooie so that's all
that go ahead and take this see right
here come with our little user's guide
the official logo of Intel in case you
want to stick that in your case or
anything go ahead and pop this down this
is the little retail cooler you guys can
see it's one of the pop type you just
stick these things in pop them clip them
no pain no nothing pase is already on
there so you don't need to use anything
very simple for those people who are
going to do overclock here to
overclocking though you don't want to
use this now we'll go ahead last thing
right here is the CPU in the box with
little box within a box box ception and
so here it is I 546 70
unlocked ready to be overclocked here's
the back you can see there's no pins all
the pins are actually on the motherboard
itself unlike AMD CPUs I actually do
prefer this it's a lot easier to bend
the pins in the CPU than it is to bend
the ones on the board alright folks so
there you have it everything that comes
in the box in the new Intel i5 46 70 K
processor now the main reason though for
this video this one make sure you guys
don't forget about the full system that
we're giving away that's really the
whole you know hijinks about this whole
thing we're giving you guys a system a
system a system you know you want to win
that damn thing hell I would want to
myself so check it out
for any of the information about any of
stuff check out the link in the
description down there by that like pin
which I know that you're going to hit
and that's pretty much it folks
I'm Network we'll see you guys back here
in Tekken tomorrow and if you're not
subvocal you want to make sure you are

something I'm out of here
