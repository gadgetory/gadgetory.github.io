since the word computer came out and the
first computer hit the market I've been
playing with Commodores and migas all
that stuff in the beginning till finally
we introduced the revolution of the PC
and when the PC first came out they were
really very few serious you know PC
gaming companies out there at this
particular time it was barely being
touched upon and if you look back at
those times sure they had games like Dig
Dug I've mentioned this before and they
had liking the little tiny games that
were like that but there was nothing
really graphically stunning nothing very
you know
audio stunning either and most of the
computers back when they first came out
to pcs really didn't even have any kind
of true
dedicated sound solution yeah sure you
got the beep-beep type sounds going on
but no true audio for listening to music
yeah you could put a CD player and you
could listen to your CD player from the
off your CD and stuff like that but you
had no type of sound card so when the
gaming market started coming around all
of a sudden we've seen this company come
out creative with all of these Sound
Blaster products and at that time
creative ruled the roost
I mean honestly back when I was playing
the original doom and like the original
unreal and all this stuff if you didn't
have inside your computer a sound
blaster with the ax and you just weren't
a happening gamer and then we saw EAX
I'm excuse me sorry we saw turtlebeach
and a few others jump on this market for
a long while these companies sucked in
the gravy and the riches of being really
the only solutions that you could have
for gaming well this really really
started to change later on down in the
game now I was working with analog
devices and Google at the time now I
know why people are gonna stop this code
no it's but honestly I term the
term Gmail I'm not a greedy person I
didn't try to sue them or anything else
but we were all to lunch meeting and we
were talking about it and Google was
saying hey we want to come out with a
brand new email system and I joked and I
said hey why don't you just call it
Gmail they all went and Gmail was born
this is the absolute God's truth
need any money from this everything else
it was just a happening conversation
that they took up and liked but at this
time analog devices was working on the
onboard sound on motherboards and during
this time I also worked for a company
called Sonic focus you guys probably
have never heard of them but you
probably looked them up and checked them
out what we talked about me and Tom
paddock and Tom paddock he is my mentor
in the sound world he has worked for the
Grateful Dead for the Steely Dan he's
worked for all kinds of big bands he's a
great studio engineer and he was a
person who really trained me about audio
well me and him were having a
conversation one time another type of
thing like this and we started talking
about why is all the stuff that is pull
every mp3 is there any way that we can
take that stuff that's pulled out of an
mp3 and make that mp3 still sound like a
full-fledged sound file like a WAV file
without sacrificing stuff and this is
the product that we worked on for many
years it was sold to Hewlett Packard and
then finally guess who it went to be
beats by dre the technology that's
inside of beats by dre is the same
technology dates back all the way to
Sonic though because I'm kind of getting
kind of off mic my thing but that's what
I'd say I've been working with sound for
a long time and at this point in time
creative and turtlebeach these companies
made a serious error and I'm talking
about a serious billion-dollar error
okay
just like when Intel has fumbled the
ball and it's costing millions they
didn't invest and do the right thing the
same thing happened to these companies
instead of investing with the
motherboard companies to get their chips
onto the motherboard they fought a war
to maintain domination with sound cards
well we all know that in the past few
generations of motherboard and stuff you
can get on board sound now that's even
better than some of the stuff you get in
the past hey Zeus has great stuff on
their motherboards gigabyte does I
believe you mean MSI does a lot of
companies now so when this happened
these companies completely screwed up
because creative labs turtlebeach all
these companies
they could be on a motherboard but
here's the caveat to that okay
there's millions of motherboards out
there right sound card cost you 100
bucks it's a hundred bucks or something
inside of creative or total beats
whoever that fracks pocket right only a
couple of bucks for an onboard ship or
probably maybe probably up to like you
know maybe thirty to fifty dollars you
know to get the whole implementation but
still much lower money unless you have
all your sound chips on SuperDuper
high-end motherboards and they're all
super duper high-end chipsets which
they're not mostly everything out there
is a real tech 802 something right now
they're out there there's so many real
tech things because real tech went
underneath the radar went directly to
them if you guys ever saw the azalea
chipset on the motherboards I wrote all
the codec for that so all the sounds
that you heard the environments I wrote
all those on a parametric EQ and gave
them to Intel years back so all that
stuff that was doing I was working in
that and this is when these guys had a
chance but instead of doing that we see
creative they license creative software
oh boy it's not true creative it's not
eex and positional audio has changed
completely
if these guys would have just worked
with the motherboard companies these
companies would be doing just as good as
they were doing before because they'd
have the market share but instead they
fought against the grain and now hardly
anybody ever buys an internal sound card
anymore
it happens sure it does but whenever
somebody calls me and they want me to a
build I never hear hail Rick please make
sure you put a sound card in there I
never hear that because everybody knows
that the sound that comes onboard now is
actually adequate to power all your
games and if you spend money on a really
good high-end motherboard you're getting
really high-end audio you know you're
getting the top Japanese components
you're getting everything that's really
good all built on your motherboard so
you don't have to worry about spending
any extra money on the side to do this
and this actually helps it another way
is to know more PCI card slot no more
bandwidth being take from the PCI slot
and you have an extra slot open to put
something else in is another nestled and
okay their card for SLI or something
else so
really eliminating that discreet sound
card was a good idea and all these
companies could be in the riches right
now and this is how the sound card
companies finally went down and have
went under you don't hear about them
anymore
there's no commercials there's no
nothing you never see any game that's
coming out saying hey use it with
creative in the past there were so many
games just like it says you know NVIDIA
meant to be played or Intel Inside
hey creative had there a whole thing
with the ax and they would have games
coming up and said hey he acts into the
side of them you never see that anymore
at all even though there probably is
positional audio and many many games
it's not being talked about touted or
being focused upon in any way like it
used to be and if those companies would
have just played their cards a little
bit different they could all still be in
the market today instead you see real
tech a company that has really nothing
to do with audio standard they're not in
the audio market whatsoever they're not
in the Pro Audio they're not a musical
gear audio they're nowhere they're a
chip company so all these companies they
actually you specialized in high-grade
audio and got their asses kicked by a
company who just makes cheap chips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
