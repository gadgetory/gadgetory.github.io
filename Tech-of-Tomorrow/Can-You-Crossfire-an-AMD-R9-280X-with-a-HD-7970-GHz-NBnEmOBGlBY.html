tomorrow we're bringing you guys all the
tech all the time now most people know
that a new line of cards from a and B
has launched and there's been a lot of
questions surrounding these cards of how
they'll work in crossfire with other gen
cards so the main test that we're going
to be showing you guys today is the new
r9 280x used in crossfire with a semi
970 gigahertz Edition video card now we
did run into a few little snafu here and
there but we did get it for the most
part to work without any problem with a
few variances here and there which we'll
get into and talk to in just a second
right here I've got the test station
back here behind me it's based on has
well it's got 32 gigabytes of Patriot
VIPRE memory Xtreme it's got the 4770k
got an Evo 612 cooler on there all in
all a pretty solid test ation we got the
hero motherboard from a Zeus back there
that's a really good solid board for
doing testing on and with that said
let's actually jump in and talk about
some of the problems and some of the
things that we discovered by trying to
get these two cards to run in crossfire
now first of all one of the things that
we noticed is that you cannot have the
r9 280x is the primary card you have to
have the Civ a 970 gigahertz card as the
primary card in order to get this
crossfire configuration to work now as
you can see in different applications we
got different results showing which card
is which in GPU ID and in the unit
engine they showed separate cards they
showed the r9 280x a separate card and
they showed the 7970 as a separate card
but we ran the latest 3d mark it showed
both those cards as 7900 series card so
some of the software out there is taking
a while to catch up like I said we
originally got the cards the card
strictly showed as 79 70s after a BIOS
update and a driver update then the card
showed to be r9 280x card so maybe the
same things happen out there
with some of this test software maybe in
the future when these guys do an update
will they'll show all the cards as being
you know what they are but for now you
guys can see the results of varying but
you can successfully crossfire a 79 70
gigahertz card and an r9 280x so I hope
you guys really like this video if so
hit that like button down there and show
us that you like it all the information
will be down there in the description
button as well if you're not following
us hey hit the sub button back here
behind me and I'm Alec we'll see you
guys back round teka tomorrow for more
tech now tomorrow for those folks
interested we will have the crossfire
results of the new r9 280x but for those
people who stuck around and watch the
video down the link the description
below we'll have a link to that right
now so if you're an early bird you want
to check that out go and check out the
link in the description below you guys
can also click right here if you want to
I'm Eric and we'll see you guys back
here on tech boom are
and be with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
