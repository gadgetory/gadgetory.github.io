 bricks Google glass gets a
makeover and a big dude from the Bitcoin
industry is in deeds
so that's right folks in case you missed
it
gigabyte is now making a bricks edition
that's totally based on the AMD platform
it even looks like one of those super
fast speedy cards you know Ferrari or
such it's got that red and black
makeover even maybe some rose stuff from
the bows if you like that color scheme
you're gonna dig this and if you're an
AMD fan you're gonna be stoked now this
thing comes with an a8 APU inside of it
and an m2 75 X video card all built
inside this little tiny box so you know
it's gonna have some cojones and it's
gonna be able to play even some of the
latest greatest 3d shooters that are out
there
awesome awesome stuff also Google glass
is now getting a makeover and it's gonna
be really cool because people who have
prescriptions will be able to get this
in conjunction with Giggy and the
glasses now one thing that was kind of
tribute about Google glass before is no
matter where you went
everybody could actually see you had the
Google glass on and socially this kind
of had some kind of weird impacts on
people who are like hey don't film me
now the way they're doing it now they're
gonna actually have four new types of
frames and they're gonna be two
different types of things you're
actually gonna bid on the first explore
model so altogether there's gonna be six
different new changes four original two
they're actually going to be on the
old-school model they came out this is
gonna be pretty awesome because now you
can wear this thing and it's not going
to be you know so much in your face you
can have an irregular set of glasses
they'll just have a little thing right
here and it's not going to be so
standing out tech-wise going hey look
I'm a super geek it's gonna be kind of
more socially acceptable and I think
this is going to be really cool now
there's gonna be two different types of
things there's the original fifty
hundred dollar charge you're gonna pay
but they're gonna have a 250 dollar
model for the prescription and that
stuff which you may be able to get
reimbursed through by your health
insurance company and that would be
awesome right there but also they have a
one hundred fifty dollar upgrade for the
explore model so this is really cool
stuff now last up in the news we all
know Bitcoin dude he's out there now
this dude's been busted you know I guess
busted you know we won't know till the
actual case rolls through and they
convict him but so far the news is that
homie got caught laundering some drug
money using the Bitcoin system and so
now obviously IRS the you know all that
crap is up his shin angling and he's in
deep deep
the dude actually resigned from the
company which is actually good I give
him respect that why drag the company
down with your name so you know for that
point alone I give my hats
you should really take all your homies
down with you you know you get busted
you did your you do your time you
know what's the old saying you know if
you can't do the time don't do the crime
well hey he retired from his own company
he's gonna take care of business so
that's all really really crazy stuff now
like usual we'll have articles and all
of this stuff down to the like button in
the description which by now I imagine
all my viewers are familiar with the
description button since we've had all
these contests and stuff so down there
there will be links to all these stories
so if you're interested in that stuff
you're interested in seeing gigabyte
 of bricks you're interested in the
Google makeover or you're interested in
seeing this homie who got busted you
know laundering isn't hope to get those
bitcoins all these stories will be down
there below now for you NVIDIA fans
there's a bonus story that's right P and
Y is now releasing two more versions of
the 780ti card they're gonna have their
new overclocked version and they're
going to have their classic version so
this should be some pretty interesting
stuff now one of these cards is going to
be obviously overclocked and pushed past
the limits gonna have all these great
numbers the other card is going to be
clocked lower one will have three fans
one will have two fans but from video
people out there who just going hey I'm
looking for a brand new card and you're
looking for him video stuff PNY has
