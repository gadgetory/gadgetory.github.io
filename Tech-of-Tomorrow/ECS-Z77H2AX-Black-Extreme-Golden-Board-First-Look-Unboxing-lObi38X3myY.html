again it's me our host here in the tech
of tomorrow YouTube channel bringing you
on unboxing and features review of a
brand new board from the people over at
EC yes now this is a really cool board
you can see it over to the left here
this is the z77
h2 - a X motherboard now this is a
golden sample black extreme motherboard
first time I heard black extreme I was
thinking hmmm porn but nope that's his
motherboard but with the way this thing
looks I could actually see it being a
hood ornament on some ratbirds car this
board is all gold components all the way
across the board has a lot of good
features but this thing is really geared
towards someone who's looking for a
motherboard has got lots of features and
really wants to show their shit off
because that's what this baby is all
about it's black and gold it's badass
it's black it's extreme
let's jump in and take some closer looks
at this motherboard
alright folks like usual with any
unboxing and first look whatever it is
we're gonna show you the box now the
front of the box in the back of the box
look pretty much the same now this side
has a lot of their features so we'll
start off at the left the box now this
motherboard supports all voice graphics
cards and with the new virtue MVP you
support multiple graphics you can see
that right here there's switchable
graphics means you can use any type of
combination of video cards you can also
use the onboard graphics of your CPU to
increase performance using the virtue
MVP chip as well a lot of other features
down here ultra stability friendly
design they're gonna have the
intelligent utilities these are all the
latest things that these guys here with
their boards entertainment they have
wireless LAN bluetooth gigabyte lan
let's see your I'm going blind guys HD 8
channel audio so a lot of different
features there over on the other side of
the box we've got some more stuff I'll
try and make it glare not too much just
as Extreme Performance for your gaming
station 3 Way GPU configuration PCI a
generation 3 you guys know that ddr3
2667 that's really good here we see
there cool tech 4 I guess it's a heat
pipe design we're gonna see on the
motherboard you guys knows the unboxing
I'm not really too familiar with this
motherboard but basically there are a
lot of features on this board so let's
just bending around real quick as I told
you guys before all the components on
this motherboard are golden black or jet
and gold shows all those off here
they're gold disability golden royalty
golden quality and golden cooling just
golden it's golden now here again on the
front it says 2800 + overclocked memory
on the back we saw a little bit
different number that's no big deal so
first all pup little cap right here open
the top up just go ahead and just set
this thing down and pull it out of the
box
there's thundering lightning outside as
I drop the box both my animals a dog in
the cabinet jumping up like it was an
explosion
so there's actually one more tab right
here fully pull everything out we're
gonna go ahead and pop that tab hook
this out I'm gonna go ahead and set the
motherboard off to the side real quick
though
and then let's go over all the stuff
that actually comes inside of the box
which would be a contact stuck in here
in the handle way all right we'll get
some sound effects right in the camera
and like take the box and I thought oh
all right here we go pop the cap right
here again now there's a lot of stuff
inside this box so I'm gonna shut it out
here one piece at a time few folks to
see so wrap the bat we have this this is
their installation guide go ahead and
set that off to the side we have a pair
of SLI cables next up we have a wireless
antenna little things to block all the
different components on your board if
you don't want to use them on your rear
i/o that is we've got the z77 h2 - ax
oops any CD's in there as well let me
under there when an operation manual for
the virtue Universal MVP we talked about
this before this is what allows you to
use any type of graphics cards
combinations including the onboard
graphics that conjunction with your card
so I've got an okay as I dig through
here I come across another SLI cable as
it said it did support triple SLI on the
box and it's coming with the cable top
so there's no little thing a little dust
covers these going to rewrite you just
stick them on there if you don't want
dust to go into those things I never use
them but you may want to in with
actually two packs of those then we'll
go ahead and we'll take a look at the
rear i/o it's also shiny and gold so
even if you don't like the motherboard
you can just melt the damn thing down
for parts and take it over to the gold
guys so there's that let's set that down
so we got one two three
four five six SATA cables now they've
little package right here I'm going to
go and open up this up this I'm sure is
going to be the USB 3.0 breakout box
most the higher-end motherboards are
come with these these days and voila
that is what it is
it's the ECS if you want to actually
mount it on the rear of your system
inside your case and as this practice
which you can use for that if you don't
want to put it inside the frontier case
if this is all the content and then
we'll move forward and we'll actually
look at the motherboard itself or the
meat and potatoes all right look at this
thing yeah now look at this crazy-ass
looking motherboard gold and black has
that nice new motherboard smell plenty
of room around the ZIF socket really
interesting the way they have this thing
paid though you can see that all the
components are completely cooled by this
cooling solution and inside it there
there's actually heat pipe I'm gonna
spin that up so you guys can see that
now we'll start up the top of the board
right here we have our first CPU fan
header I'm gonna bring this up as the
camera can see that that begins right
here then we're going to up here at the
top where you see it says easy measure
point this is so you can hook your
diagnostic tool directly up to the
motherboard and calibrate and see what
you're doing this is a pretty good
feature all you gotta do is touch it
with your stuff and away you go next we
have another fan header right here to
the right next up we have the memory now
this is just dual channel ddr3 up to 32
gigabytes of memory here's our first
power connector this is the eight pin
then additionally on the other side of
the board I have the 24 pin power
connector we have a start and reset
button located right here in the
motherboard this is great for people
running a test station and stuff like
that we're gonna go over here to the PCI
slots we have 1/2 of the PCIe x 1 slots
then we have 1 2 3 PCIe x 16 slots but
you know that they're not going to run
that way it'll be
eight eight and four then we have two
standard PCI slots one here one there
you can see there's additional cooling
running all the way down to the
motherboard it's cool get a close look
up with this right here where it says X
black extreme hey we're a bounce-back
over the side of the motherboard here
all of our SATA connections now it says
right here serial ata six gigabit so
that's supposedly going to mean that all
of these controllers are going to be
that I believe that two of the
controllers are Intel and one of the
controllers is as media here's a very
interesting port on this board this is
the new M SATA connection there's a lot
of stuff that's going to be coming out
in the future so you'll be able to use
this and I like the way that's set in an
angle that's gonna be pretty interesting
now as far as the USB breakout box we
showed you that earlier that's this
piece right here this piece right here
connects right here on the motherboard
this is the USB 3.0 header right here
then we have one additional USB header
right here we have another system fan
connector right here your s/pdif audio
and that's pretty much all the
connectors that really matter on this
board just take a quick shot let you
guys see everything again notice all the
gold stuff in-between everywhere on the
board everything where it can be gold is
pretty much gold alright folks
now let's take a look at the rear i/o on
this board now this board to me has some
features that are kind of wack I'm not
really quite understanding what's going
on with this but I'll start on the left
hand side where we see we have the
Bluetooth connection here then we have
two standard USB headers eSATA here is
the clear CMOS now here's where the
board to me honestly I don't mean to get
on easy s's case but this to me is a
fail why do we have a standard
old-school VGA connector on here when
this board supports DisplayPort
technology so I have an HDMI port and a
VGA port I mean I don't know that to me
is just really crazy I'm not really down
with that moving on we see right here we
have the Wi-Fi connector to more
standard USB s another eSATA port there
over here we have a total of four USB
3.0 ports we have our rj45 LAN then we
have both our optical and our standard
analog eight point one surround sound
connections
all right here oh I just gotta save
folks as far as this rear i/o comes out
to me I'm not happy with it somewhere
between this and this they've sacrificed
something here I'm just I'm not really
liking that this should have a display
port on it it should also have a normal
DVI port on it so as far as this rear
eye goes folks I don't know I'm not
really happy with this let me know your
guys opinions and that's pretty much it
this has been the unboxing of the new
black extreme ECS golden board z77 h2 -
ax thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
