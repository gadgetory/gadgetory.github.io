hot stories for you interesting stuff
that's happening first off the number
one news thing we've heard check this
out Intel plans on releasing their own
desktop box that's right so just like
you have apple TV you have Roku and you
if your PlayStation 3 Intel now plans on
entering this market now what these guys
have done is they've gone out and
they've headhunted all kinds of people
from other companies like Apple Google
Netflix to bring you guys actually the
best people and the best service around
now whether Intel can do this or not is
going to be either really the main
question because already these products
are doing really good Apple they have
really high prices on movie rentals so I
kind of quit using them now if Intel can
come to the market and a lower that
price down the movies to like a dollar
rental like a redbox Intel I'll be
buying your service so if you guys want
to check out the full link in the
article for this check it out over on
the website the link will be in the
description below where you guys can
read the full article on this new
product from Intel next up on the news
that's right for you guys who love the
Caped Crusader fans the movie Bane and
Batman there's a lot of rumors going on
that there's going to be a new Batman
game coming out but there's going to be
some serious change this game that may
affect how the game is for one thing
Rocksteady Studios the companies behind
all the other titles arkham city Arkham
Asylum they are not going to be involved
in this whatsoever and either is the
person who wrote it so mr. Donnie will
not be involved he will not be writing
this so my main concerns with this are
will the game be so different than
previous versions that I'm like hey what
the hell is this i'm playing or will it
be something entirely new like usual i
have the full article over on our
website so check that out in the link in
the description below and lastly folks
i've wrote an article on the division
between the mac and pc user groups you
guys all know whether i post anything
from mac the hay is just unbe
believable now I will say this though it
does seem like the actual hate is more
towards the Mac people from the pc
division then the Mac people towards the
pc and there are a lot of reasons for
this do you guys like to check it out
