back to tech of tomorrow I'm miller host
and here is your favorite co-host bud e
dog say hello to the camera buddy hey
everybody out there so check it out it's
Sunday and we've got tech news for you
guys now what's up first on tech news
we'll check this out you guys should all
know that this next coming Friday apples
gonna release a whole bunch of new
iPhones and there's actually some crazy
guy in Tokyo who's going to wait 10 days
out standing on the line to get this
damn thing I mean this is incredible so
right now this guy is standing in line
in Tokyo Japan awaiting the anticipation
of getting this new iphone now I don't
know what you guys think but I think
that's crazy this guy is basically going
to have to camp out out there for an
entire week actually more than a week 10
days is a week plus 3 baby and that's a
lot of time to be sitting outside just
waiting now one thing cool though you
guys concede that this dude has totally
set himself up he's got himself a
comfortable chair he's got his snacks
he's got his red bull so he's ready to
rock and roll now for most folks I think
that you're gonna think this guy is kind
of for waiting out there that long but
check it out is there anything at all
that you would wait 10 days in a line
for now there is one thing that I would
wait 10 days in a line for I'll be
honest with you if they can get me a new
foot a new Bionic foot to replace when I
had cut off i would laid in line for 30
days I wouldn't care if they told me it
could happen I have to pay for it I'd be
sitting in line but that's about it
because beyond that sitting outside that
long for me would be insane what the
hell i do with buddy all the time we
could just sit there and beg for money
please give us some cash for our iphone
toward the dog feel sorry for the dog
all right well enough on that so next up
check it out back behind me I have the
EVGA had drawn now this is their brand
new mini IT
case that has a ton of features
this thing's badass it's totally geared
for the gamer it's 305 millimeters by
169 millimeters it's mini ITX you can
use a water cooler on the top that's
right you can use a dual rat on the very
top of this thing fits full-size video
cards and even comes with a 500 watt
that's right gold certified power supply
all inside this box now our little
article did about this the other day if
you guys want to check in that stuff out
it will be down there in the description
below but in the next few days I'm going
to be doing an unboxing and first look
and just tear this little beast apart so
you guys can check it out but he's all
following my hand magic magic all right
and so the last story of the day check
it out I know a lot of people out there
windows a that are like on a good yeah
windows 8 but check this out this
company called in touch is going to have
this new product that's going to be a
70-inch fully touchscreen pc monitor all
in one it's going to be loaded with an i
528 gigabyte SSD 4 gigabytes of ram and
it's going to be completely integrated
with a touchscreen so this thing is
going to be great for people are doing
board presentation you can have actually
five people accessing at once showing
different things that's kind of neat so
this thing is going to come in two
flavors both the 55 inch model and a 70
inch model and it's totally geared for
people who are going to be either in the
classroom showing stuff off or in a
boardroom because with the accessibility
that you're going to be able to have
with all the features on it's going to
be really cool no longer you have to use
a little pointer and point at things you
can actually use it and touch screen the
monitor and show off whatever you want
to do that's really good teachers who
want to show their stuff off that'll be
great they won't have to be using a
pointer will have anybody sitting with
one of those little projector screens or
anything else it'll be simple you just
hang this thing on the wall touchscreen
it and everybody out in the audience can
easily view it I think it's a pretty
cool product for productivity what do
