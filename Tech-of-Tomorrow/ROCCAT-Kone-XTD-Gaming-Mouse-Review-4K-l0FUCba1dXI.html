tomorrow bringing guys another accessory
review and today we're looking at this
the konex TD from Roccat now this is
what Roccat calls their max
customization mouse meaning there's a
lot of different things you can tweak on
this the way the buttons macros
sensitivity and even color schemes we're
going to talk about how it feels what
kind of special features it has to offer
and how well its customization interface
works and of course at the end we're
going to let you know whether or not
it's worth your dollar today on tech of
tomorrow
okay so the first thing I want to
mention about this mouse is just how
comfortable and ergonomic its design is
the Konex TD has a very simple aesthetic
in terms of its form factor yes of
course the Roccat symbol and the
blinking lights on the side do make it
look fancier but as far as the actual
shape of the mouse goes it's actually
very sleek simple straightforward but
most importantly of all just really
comfy to use over extended periods of
time it's curved just right for your
hand to rest slightly on it and the
thumb groove on the left side is
near-perfect and button placement for
the most part is really easy to access
with minimal awkward movements for your
hand in total there's technically 12
different buttons obviously the left and
right mouse clicks a scroll wheel for up
and down that also has switches for
pressing it down or tilting left and
right two buttons located behind the
score wheel and one up in front and two
buttons located on the left right above
the rest of these buttons the only one
that ever really gave me any problems
was the one located in front of the
scroll wheel mainly because it required
you to rest your middle finger on the
wheel and try to press the button
without accidentally scrolling or
pressing down other than that though the
rest of the buttons are pretty easy to
access
now while this mouse does have only 12
buttons it actually in function really
has more like 22 thanks to the fact that
one of the buttons acts as a sort of
Shift key giving the other 11 buttons
two different uses now in terms of its
default settings there's a lot of good
generally useful functions like being
able to adjust the DPI or your volume
but using Roccat software you can
customize these to have any number of
other functions or macros this is
another really big point of praise for
me Roccat software is really well
organized and really easy to learn how
to use in order to customize the comb
just the way you like it you can store
up to five different profiles each with
adjustable things like what kind of dpi
settings you want available sensitivity
lifts off button assignments and also
control over the mouse's for lights
giving you options over how they pull
switch colors they use and how quickly
it does so the only thing about the
Roccat software that does bother me is
that there's this strange really
gravelly voice that the software uses to
let you know when you do certain things
if you adjust the DPI change the volume
you're gonna have this random voice just
come in and start talking to you the
mouse even has built-in achievements
that when you do them the voice
announces congratulations you've
unlocked a trophy which really catches
you off guard sometimes especially if
you don't take a look at the initial
settings thankfully though they can be
if you take a look at it now as far as
other features go there are a few other
little things I want to talk about in
terms of the conex TD it does have
adjustable weights which can be accessed
from the bottom Mouse by turning this
little dial right here and it even comes
a little carrying case for those you
that might want to adjust the weights
when you're on the go or just have a
place to store the ones you're not
actively using it is a wired mouse but
uses the ever-so-popular braided
military-style cable we see in a lot of
gaming mouses these days and it also has
little glide supports on the bottom of
the mouse to make sure that moves nice
and smooth across your desk surface now
overall I have to say that I really love
this mouse and it's now actually become
my new primary default for when I'm
gaming it's a really simple
straightforward design that benefits
from a really high level of degree of
customization and comfort it's not the
flashiest looking one on the market
still looks really damn good and the way
they handle the sidelights
and the many ways they can be adjusted
gives players a great degree of control
over how they want it styled now the
Konex TD does have a recommended MSRP of
$89.99 but a quick browsing the internet
right now will show you that a lot of
websites offer it for more around the
60s which for what you're getting out of
this mouse is an absolutely fantastic
price simple yet highly functional I
cannot recommend this mouse enough not
just for its price point but just
overall well that was my review of the
