another week of text here on TECA
tomorrow first up a really nice keyboard
and the people over at Coursera now yes
of course they're did provide this
keyboard for the review but there is no
money exchanged between us I was not
paid to review just provide the product
to bring that information to you now
this is the k95 RGB platinum so pretty
much the top-of-the-line keyboard from
the folks over at Corsair this thing's
made of top-line aluminum aircraft
that's right aluminum aircraft actually
it's made of a high-grade aircraft
aluminum or aluminium as I know that
people overseas say now aluminium
although I know it's correct it's really
kind of weird thing to say but hey I'll
say it because I know people here every
time I say luminaires like stupid
American but oh well that's the story we
say it over here but we've got it in
there so this thing's made of high
quality materials it has a bunch of
programmable keys it lights up every key
individual RGB just basically like I
said this is like the Coupe DeVille
Cadillac rolls-royce of keyboards so
with that said let's see what it's all
about so first off let's check out
actually what comes in the box so you
get the keyboard itself you get a bunch
of different keys too so this way you
can change the keys to be whatever you
want them to be and just a little tool
that comes includes you can pop those
keys off easily and they're easily
replaced you also get the wrist pad and
that's pretty much it inside the box the
detachable wrist plate even though it's
not talked about very often on this
model it's very nice you have clips
right here that you simply clip into the
bottom of your keyboard and then you
have a double-sided face so that
magnetically attaches one side is much
softer one side is harder so no matter
what kind of risk pad you like you're
going to find it right here the t95
platinum is made out of a single piece
of aircraft-grade anodized brushed
aluminum this thing is built to
withstand a lifetime of gaming its
lightweight its rugged and this is
necessary for a keyboard that's going to
see a lot of action as far as the looks
code generally it looks like any other
keyboard that you've pretty much seen
out there I mean let's just face it most
keyboards are going to have a standard
design where the keys are laid out
you're going to have a few differences
in the programming and the way things
work but the way they look is kind of
the same on all keyboards now so
all time media controls are located up
on the right hand side and these were
all enhanced on this keyboard so that
everything works with the programming so
you can operate all your music and
everything flawlessly through those
controls also on the top left hand side
of the keyboard we see the lighting mode
button the next button is brightness and
then after that you have the windows
lock key button and as you put the k95
onto its face you can see if there's
also cable management so if you're
plugging something into your USB pastor
you can keep those messy cables out of
the way the keys on the k95 are also
something very unique in partnership
with Cherry the Corsair k95 RGB platinum
utilizes new MX speed RGB mechanical key
switches now these are designed
specifically to meet the demands of
hardcore gamers an ultra-fast 1.2
millimeter actuation point and a light
45 gram activation force make them ideal
for split second key presses or clutch
gaming moments with every millisecond
counts and if you're wondering will
these keys ever go bad well it comes
with a 15 million keystroke guarantee so
I think it'll be a lot of gaming before
it breaks on you one unique feature of
the K 95 Platinum is light edge now this
is a 19th owned independently controlled
light bar running along the top edge of
the keyboard and wrapping around the
corners what's really cool though is
that this lighting accent can be
programmed with very complex lighting
effects independent from the effects
being executed on the main keyboard
matrix for an example you can have all
the keys doing their own effect like a
rainbow effect and you can also have the
light bar doing something all on its own
so separate animations on each one so
that's kind of nifty probably the best
feature of all though for gamers is the
ability of the k95 platinum to have
every key to be fully programmable for
in-game actions what's even cooler
however is a special place was reserved
for six dedicated GPS lined up along the
left edge of the keyboard the carefully
defined position of the six dedicated
textured G keys as well as a concert and
textured key caps on them are supposed
to deliver the best gaming performance
and they're supposed to do without
fatigue or any accent no tea presses the
gamer can also take advantage of those G
keys to assign them for their most often
use macros keyboard shortcuts or kiri
maps the choice is yours
and for gamers out there who don't have
either a long enough cord who don't want
to plug them
actually into the PC you can plug the
mouse right into the keyboard through
the USB pass-through port with 100%
anti-ghosting and full Q over effects
you never have to worry about hitting
too many keys or having the keyboard not
respond to your command now earlier we
did the unboxing we showed you some
different keys now these are the FPS and
MOBA keycap sets these are textured and
contoured key caps that provide maximum
grip and enhanced keel which means that
they actually feel a little bit
different than the other keys on the
keyboard and these are like the WASD
keys and you can see that we've changed
these out and they look at different
color actually than the standard keys as
well instead of being black they're
actually great so they stand out very
well on the keyboard now this next
feature I don't know how much will
actually affect mini gamers out there
some people going to be like oh hell to
the S is the absolute best thing there
is it would be like and that's no big
deal but you can actually have three
fully programmable profiles in the
keyboard that are actually inside of it
you don't have to program using any
software or anything else you program
into the keyboard itself and you can
take the keyboard anywhere you want and
have those same programs ready for you
wherever you are at its heart the k95
RGB platinum is a platform which
utilizes the low power and fast 32-bit
ARM Cortex processor which together with
eight megabytes of onboard flash storage
and high performance LED display
controls is capable of driving the most
immersed dynamic LED backlighting
effects and the most complex macros ever
before available of course there are
calls this technology Hardware macro and
lighting playback this technology allows
the imager to save any backlighting
effects even the most complicated and
multi level in-game macros can be saved
to the onboard memory and played back
without any need for external software
and although the k95 platinum does come
with a lot of options to be
pre-programmed onto the keyboard itself
with the Q software you can program
anything you want and you can do much
more sophisticated programming using the
Q software and it's really easy to use
and operate once it's installed you just
open it up on your PC and everything's
right there in front of you to be able
to adjust you can adjust all the
individual colors of each and key you
can adjust the brightness of each key
you can adjust pretty much the color
spectrum of each key and basically it's
almost I feel almost
unlimited possibilities I'm going to try
and see in the future if I can actually
use the lighting effects to try to write
something on the keyboard itself I think
that would be really cool so those are
pretty much all the specs and how the
keyboard looks the k95 RGB platinum like
I said before is supposed to be the
creme de la creme keyboard out there
fully programmable across the board
macro Keys lighting effect comfortable
wrist pad now all that sounds good on
paper but how does it actually feel them
what is the comfort level when you're in
game personally I thought it was very
very nice to use all the keys are very
responsive and since you have such a low
threshold to make it activate you don't
feel like you're slamming the keys down
and making that big loud clacking noise
that you paired with some of the
previous keys that come on mechanical
keyboards I mean let's face it
some of those cheery keys make a real
banging sound when you're playing on
them and I don't particularly like that
if your user who doesn't like that and
you like to smooth operation I think
you'll very much like the way the k95
platinum feels so alright gamers and
tech fans there you have it Corsairs RGB
k95 platinum the badass of the badass if
you're a gamer out there and you want
the uber keyboard that has everything
under the hood then this is something
you'd want to want to look for because
you can program every key individually
to do what you want to do you could
program the color of it you can program
how bright it is great multimedia
controls the bar that's on there for
scrolling and doing everything is really
nice it's comfortable it plays well if
you like mechanical keyboards but you
don't like all the noise I think you're
going to really enjoy this unit now the
cavity this thing is though is it does
come to market at $200 so gamers out
there on the budget are gonna be like
wow I can almost buy a PC but if you're
somebody out there and you're like a
professional gamer you just take your
gaming seriously that's all you do
you're going to want the best of the
best there are a lot of keyboard
manufacturers out there and making
keyboards I know you guys can have left
two comments I want to see them down
below so I know the people gonna say
they like this one I like that one and I
welcome that kind of thing I definitely
want to hear your guys opinions on
what's going on so I know you guys been
watching Tekken tomorrow down below that
like button there'll be more information
if you want to click on the button check
out more information them or maybe
purchase one for yourself check out more
stuff on them before you make that
decision though
because I'm one guy and there's lots of
the guys out there but honestly I give
this key a double thumbs up it was a
hundred and forty nine dollars I would
say it's like wow totally worth jumping
on two hundred dollars I have to admit a
little expensive for most gamers budgets
but hey if you want the best the best
price means Jack diddly to you
you're just going to get so see you guys
back in the channel for more tech here
on TECA tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
