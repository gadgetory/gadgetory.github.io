tech Oh tomorrow we bring you all the
tech all the time what is the hot tech
of today well today we're going to be
talking to you about the new Google
Chromebook pixel what is the pixel well
you're about to find out for one thing
it has an incredible screen resolution
2560 by 1700 with a 3 by 2 aspect ratio
now why do they do this well for one
thing you know if you make the monitor
really really wide maybe that's cool for
some widescreen or some movies but when
you're viewing webpages it's much much
better to have it taller you can see
more of the page and I got to give the
people at Google kudos for doing this
they're basically just trying to throw a
concept out there like a hook and saying
hey who's gonna bite you want to do this
now as far as the rest of the specs go
you get an Intel i5 dual core 1.8
gigahertz processor 4 gigabytes of
memory running at 1333 megahertz
SD card slot main display port two USB
2.0 ports and a headphone jack now this
thing's coming to market at twelve
hundred and ninety nine dollars but to
be honest with you you can throw all
that stuff out the window it's all
completely irrelevant the big thing
about the new pixel is its ability to
bring this concept to market basically
everybody else out there has their own
thing they're doing their own thing but
nobody has something like this so this
will force people hopefully force people
to create a bunch of new app to support
this now as far as economics go this
thing actually is incredible the
keyboard very very comfortable reminds
me a lot of the keyword that you see on
all of the new Macs very very
comfortable ergonomic easy to type on
the screen though is absolutely
beautiful just take a look at this and
look at what's on the screen nothing is
better than this the clarity is so
in-depth it's vivid it totally pops
colors and everything are just
incredible on this now everything on
here is run through the Chrome OS so
you're not going to be doing anything
else on this thing but that you can
check your email you can watch
movies you can stream movies so
basically anything that you can do in
the WWE environment you can do on the
Chromebook pixel but you can do it by
looking at it but there are a few things
you might want to take into
consideration here take a look at it
when it's all closed up it's very
lightweight very very business looking
it's totally different than anything
else out there on the market and there's
also another way that you can look at
this right now if you buy the Chromebook
pixel you get three years of Google
Cloud storage at one terabyte usually
this is $50 a month which is $600 a year
if you buy this right now
you get three years of free service so
if you want to look at this another way
Google is actually paying you to take
the Chromebook pixel home because if you
look at it that way by the time that you
get reimbursed for all this stuff that
you're not paying for you're at $1,800
they're selling it for $12.99 so wait
ten or dollars means basically you're
getting paid almost $600 just to take
the Chromebook pixel home originally
when Google came out they kind of said
hey this technology is supposed to be
like disposable technology really cheap
easy to get in the market and then all
of a sudden we get the Google Chromebook
pixel at $12.99 everybody's going holy
crap that's expensive for a web browser
but really totally irrelevant this thing
was made by Google as a conceptual
design to get other people out there in
the market to grab a hold of it make
applications for it and make it a much
more robust environment it runs very
very cool not hot at all incredible
resolution screen now at the end of the
day though what I really recommend this
to anybody know I gotta say I'm not if I
was gonna recommend a laptop the retina
it be the macbook retina display pro
they'll just be a much better product
but if this is something you're
interested just a tries experiment and
you want to use that one terabyte of
storage and it's important to you then
you can look it at that aspect and you
can buy it and jump into it but I cannot
recommend the saying hey this is a great
product it's a very innovative product
and a great concept from the people at
Google what they're really trying to do
this product like I said is get other
people involved
this is pretty much like the cheese to
the rat or you know the bait on a hook
they want somebody to bite get on this
and start developing and if they did
that this could become a very viable
source in the future and this product
could become something you want to check
out as a prices drop and technology
comes back we'll have to revisit this
and see what it's like I'd like to hear
your opinions guys let me hear what you
think about this like usual I hope you
guys like this video make sure you hit
that like button and show me that you do
and if you're not subscribed to tech
know tomorrow make sure you are cuz we
always have the latest tech here for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
