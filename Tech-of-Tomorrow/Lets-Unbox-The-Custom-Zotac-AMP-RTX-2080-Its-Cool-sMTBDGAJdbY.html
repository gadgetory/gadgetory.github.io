we've waited a couple of years there's
been tons of controversy people even
thought they would begin we call all
kinds of different names 1180s but no
check it out
it's the twenty eighty the twenty atti
they have arrived we have a couple of
them to show you as you can see here I
think you guys can be pretty exciting
today we're gonna bring you the unboxing
but before we do all that let's hear a
word from today's sponsor wondershare
and their PDF element dealing with PDF
used to be such a pain there's no easy
way to modify the content on the PDFs or
convert the scanned PDFs but with PDF
element it's a totally different story
you can easily create edit convert sign
and OCR PDFs to simplify your document
tasks work smarter faster and easier
experience PDF element today alright so
it's finally here now this particular
version is one of the very first
aftermarket versions that you're going
to see most of the others cards that
you're going to see are going to be
founders edition cards now this is the
zotac gaming amp Edition card it's a
little bit overclocked
unfortunately I won't be able to show
you those particular numbers just quite
yet you guys can see the front of the
box not too much they're just told you
guys that hey yes it's a geforce r-tx
2080 alright on the back of the box not
too much there it just has their
spectral lighting it has their firestone
which is their overclocking software and
then it says be already we'd obviously
think those cards v already especially
with the price in this particular card i
believe is by eight hundred and thirty
nine dollars so it's up there in price
so let's go ahead and pop the cap though
start taking it out of the box and we'll
talk about all the specs and stuff as we
get it out of there so we'll sit it down
here pretty interesting with them so far
kind of interesting packaging there I
like that that's kind of interesting
because we're going to slide this this
particular thing off with here small
specific it slide this out of there
there we go kind of interesting there
they protective sleeves up I mean the
neat little ugly me thing to it I'm
gonna call it glean me think I'm gonna
go with glee me thing all right we can
see right here the box nice nice
pop the cap here right up the bat gonna
get some paperwork exactly's on it I
don't know but what the heck it's
unboxing brand-new stuff let's see what
it is
just ZOTAC the quick installation guide
just some quick little information about
their card nothing really you know too
important to write home to mom about
their open the box up so we're at the
back we're gonna see two cables these
are for the older power supplies that
have molex we see a single six pin and a
single 8-pin connector on this
particular card it's recommended that
you have a 650 watt power supply and
obviously it's going to take a single
six pin and a single 8-pin connector to
run the card let's go ahead and pop the
card all right so we're gonna take the
card out of its protective sleeve now
right off the bat you're gonna see
there's three fans on the top of this
card now one thing is very interesting
about these particular fans though is
that each one can be independently
controlled which means that you can turn
this fan to one rpm this man to another
this one to another so you can actually
set it to where you see the cards
optimally being cooled
that's actually pretty cool and you
can't have kind of mean to say that but
you know you know what I mean it's
pretty cool that it's gonna be keeping
the card cool and the fans are actually
an all new design which you're supposed
to produce a lot more wind blowing
against the card so it should be much
cooler
underneath that you guys can see the
rest of the cooling apparatus it's a
really really clean looking card nothing
really over the top or anything got a
little bit of a design here but there's
nothing crazy about this card you can
put it in any system and it's gonna look
just fine
also something else you cannot see right
now at this point I'll spin the card
around to the side is that there are two
thousand nine hundred and
forty-four CUDA cores inside of this car
it's an 8 gigabyte card featuring GT dr6
the memory clock in this particular card
is 14 gigabits per second so that's the
information there right now they haven't
even let us know what the base clock
speed is or the overclock stuff that's
stuff so much under NDA now you can see
zou tech gaming on the side this is
going to light up
there's also Spectre lighting and that
goes all the way around the card and you
can control that independently as well
so you have all kinds of RGB lighting on
the card as well like we talked about
single 6 pin single 8 pin power
connector 650 watts of powers what
they're saying to use in this particular
card um once again you can see all these
aluminum heat fins going all the way
across the card basically the heat it
gets sucked away from your card into the
heat pipes the fans blow on them and all
that heat dissipates all the way away
from your card keeping your GPU you know
running nice and cool
also what's around you something
different here take a look at the rear
i/o now this where I was different in
this particular way the i/o actually has
a USB type-c port ah that's right so you
get three standard display ports and
HDMI and you get USB type-c and with
this particular card you can run four
monitors all at the same time off the
single card on the back of the card
something I always like you guys know I
love these back plates these are great I
think it's also a nice design they
finally are leaving this open a lot of
times in the past they have this covered
this actually would cause heat problems
because the heat wouldn't be able to
dissipate away from the card causing a
little problem of heat in this
particular spot leaving the back open
like that allows that heat to actually
just dissipate out into the system so
good design and you guys know me I love
a good backplate though Tech gaming live
- game I know many of us do and that's
why these cards keep selling even at the
crazy ass prices that they are now very
bottom the card not much to see just
your PCI interface you can see some heat
pipes running all through there and
pretty much that's it I mean you get the
card you get the two cables a little bit
of this nomenclature and that's
everything that actually comes in the
box of this particular card
unfortunately everything else about this
card right now is still under NDA will
brave bringing you guys all
full scores and all the stuff on these
cards in the 19th this month so just
hang on to your hats because we'll have
all the information Day on launch day
