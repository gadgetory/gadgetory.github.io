by the Corsair void Pro headphones if
you're not wearing him you're not
listening what's up guys welcome back
once again to techno Marwar today we
have a head-to-head battle between the
RX vega 56 and the gtx 1070 fe cards
both priced around the same thing about
$399 obviously when the first reviews
came out of the RX Vega cars they were
very very immature and new drivers but
now that those drivers have been more
mature well let's take it and have a
head-to-head battle between these two
cards test it on 28 games that's right
28 games and a head-to-head battle with
the RX Vega 56 verses that gtx 1070 fe
let the games begin
so the parts that we use in the test
bench that you're seeing in today's
video consists of an Intel Core i7 6700
K at 4.0 gigahertz which turbos to 4.6
gigahertz now this was done in an AZ
rock z170 motherboard 16 gigabytes of
HyperX ddr4 at 3333 megahertz the
drivers use in the gtx 1070 efi where
the whq l3 80 5.41 drivers and for the
big at 56 we use the seventeen point
nine point two drivers all results in
today's testing show average frame rates
but we also include the minimum frame
rates as well one thing to take note of
is that all of the cards weren't there
stock speed for these tests we have an
aura clocking video coming out a little
bit later but with that said Before we
jump into the benchmarks the conclusion

and rock out to the benchmark song and
let's check out those benches
all right Tech fans so check it out you
guys can see that these two cards traded
blows back and forth back and forth but
at the end of the day I have to say at
the RX Vega 56 is the winner now here's
the only caveat however with this right
now
the price is supposed to be 399 right
but you can't find a card for 399 - Vega
56 hardly anywhere whatsoever so my
advice is really this I would completely
skip the reference versions of any rx
card anyone the Vega 64 the Vega 56 I
would ignore them completely and I would
wait till the cards come out from all of
the aftermarket manufacturers gigabyte
you know everybody who's in the game
who's gonna be making a card you should
wait for their cards but with these
testings you guys can see with the newer
drivers though the RX 56 is kicking some
serious butt it's just a wee bit faster
than the 1070 efi but hey a wee bit
faster is still a wee bit faster making
that card the winner in today's battle
now like usual we'll have links down
below to these two cards you want to
check out more information about them or
just get one for yourself it will be
there
I may lurk you've been watching Tekken
tomorrow we'll see you guys back here
for more tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
