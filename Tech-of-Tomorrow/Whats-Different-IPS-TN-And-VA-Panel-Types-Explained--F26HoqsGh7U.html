a PC enthusiast chances are that you
really don't know the differences
between the different type of panel
technology using the different monitors
that are being sold today so I thought
hey you know what I'd like to know more
about this technology myself so I went
out there and looked around found all
the information I thought you know what
I will share this information with my
viewers as well so today's video is
breaking down the different types of
technologies based on the current panels
that are being sold around the world in
different monitors so with that said
though let's hop in and let's talk about
the main three that are out there now
first up our IPS or in-plane switching
panels now these are generally
considered to be the best overall LCD
technology for image quality color
accuracy and viewing angles they are
really really suited for graphics and
other applications which require
accurate and consistent color
reproduction IPS panels are for the best
view angles of any current LCD
technology with wide viewing angles up
to 178 degrees these panels also have a
higher price tag though going along with
them especially compared to VA and
affordable ta panel LCD displays the
response time of IPS panels is not the
fastest however as they currently range
from 4 milliseconds to 6 milliseconds
which is only slightly slower than
current TN panels mini gamers who play
fast action games think that ghosting or
motion blur occurs on all IPS panels but
motion blur only needs to be a concern
in response times are of seven
milliseconds or higher there are also a
few different types of IPS panels for
example there's s IPS H IPS ee i PS and
p IP s now all of these are relatively
similar regarding the technology they
use though H IPS panels do have a
slightly different pixel structure than
the rest and the majority of the e IPS
panels only offer 6 bit color depth now
s IPS monitors are another variation of
IPS there are not many of these panels
being made though as they have a much
higher price point but an S IPS panel
can often be identified by a slight
purple hue on the blacks when viewed
from a wide
Hipps is a newer variation of si PS and
it offers a different pixel structure
that improves contrast ratio and lowers
the pixel pitch to provide a better
picture quality and they're really
considered to be the high end of IPS
panels now right in the middle of the
road our v8 pals now these are vertical
alignment technology now these are SP VA
MVA and are right in the middle of the
road like I said of LCD panels they
offer better color reproduction and a
wider viewing angle than ta panels that
which are the lowest of the bunch but
they also have slower response times
they are very similar to s IPS on paper
however they offer large viewing angles
and good color reproduction though not
as good as IPS panels the response times
are generally worse than T and our IPS
panels however and there have been
reports of a few VA pals that suffer
from input lag so so overall VA
technology is probably not the best
choice for fast-paced gaming VA panels
have the advantage of higher contrast
ratio compared to other panel types
however which leads to better black
levels the biggest disadvantage of VA
based panels is color shifting color
shifting is when the image viewed from
one angle changes or shifts when viewed
from a slightly different angle making
various uneven brightness levels across
the display and what's really crazy is
this bothers many users to the point
that they will not ever consider buying
a VA base panel at all and there are
other users who don't notice who aren't
bothered by the color shifting
whatsoever
coach ifs also caused a loss of shadow
detail in dark scenes when viewed
directly from the center of the screen
now last up our TN paladin this stands
for twisted nematic now these panels are
the most widely used panel types and the
manufacturer of LCD monitors around the
world TN panels are also really cheap
and offer excellent response times
making them perfect for fast paced
gaming the response time of current ta
panels ranges from zero milliseconds all
the way up to five milliseconds
unfortunately the color reproduction
viewing angles and contrast ratios of TN
panels are the worst of any current LCD
panel technology so to wrap things up si
PS h IPS super pls a HB a and other
IPS panels are generally considered to
be the best panels all around they're
great for gamers they're great for
people who do art and stuff like that or
need the colors to match but they're
also usually the most expensive now SPV
am VA and VA panels offer better color
reproduction and viewing angles than TN
panels but they also have slightly worse
response times these are a little bit
slower than TN or IPS panels however
they do offer the best contrast ratio
another caveat is they may suffer from
color shifting which will really suck if
you see that but a lot of users say they
can't see it now the most commonly used
panels in the market are TN panels why
because they're cheap and they have the
fastest response times making mini
gamers say hey these are the best panels
for me but they also suffer from
inferior color reproduction contrast
ratio and viewing angles unfortunately
though most of the monitors made around
the world feature these types of panels
do the fact that they are cheap now the
newer monitors are coming out in the
market though do feature complete 10-bit
color depth though with TN panels making
them slightly more on par with IPS
monitors in the current market now I
want to send a special thanks out to the
people over at PC hardware help I
checked out their article and they made
some of this information very possible
for me so if you guys want to check out
their article we'll have a link down
below to them so I'm Mel Ark you guys
been watching Tekken tomorrow I hope
this explains things pretty much out for
you guys really if you're a person who
does more than gaming which means you
game you actually work in Photoshop you
edit videos you are definitely going to
want to get yourself an IPS base monitor
and as we saw a little while ago on a
$2,000 monitor they do have IPS monitors
down at 4 milliseconds at 4 milliseconds
you're not getting blur you're not
getting ghosting you're not getting any
of that stuff on that type of panel even
though a lot of people think that you
know you do get that it's not really
happening the panel that we got over
here behind me there's $2,000 it
features an IPS panel and it is just an
amazing monitor it can do anything on it
now if you're a person who does a little
bit of editing you do a little bit of
stuff like that you know
and you still want to have good color
reproduction then you want to be going
probably with a VA type panel which is
right in the middle of the road and if
you're just strictly a gamer somebody
who just games and really color you know
reproduction isn't laxing you know the
total caveat of what you're doing excuse
me that may be the total like you know
crown of what you're wanting to do then
you'll probably be cool with getting a
TN panel monitor and let's just face it
they are pretty much the fastest like
they said on the response times and
they're relatively cheap they usually
feature really good technology from AMD
you can find a lot of these monitors out
there under $500 that actually have all
of AMD's technology built into them so
you get free sink right out of the box
so hope that's explained things I'll see
you guys back here in the channel for
more tech peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
