here once again so check this out for
decades Intel has held complete
dominance in the semiconductor market
almost since their onset they've been
the leader in fact last year they sold
265 billion dollars worth of their chips
that's quite a big amount of chips but
TSMC which the Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing company sold 194 billion
and is slowly creeping up and at this
point has actually gone ahead of Intel
as a semiconductor company now when I
say it's semiconductor company this is
the person that's actually manufacturing
the chips that you see and there's a
reason why is MC is pulling ahead
now Intel has tried to do what's called
contract chip building which means they
get other people to invest their money
and have Intel make their chips
well Intel pretty much fell almost flat
on their face with this particular thing
and that's one of the reasons that
they're losing this battle because let's
just face it
AMD Apple are all making their chips
through TSMC and the very fact that
Intel is having problems getting their
10 nanometer technology to the market
and it looks like TSM C is gonna have
seven nanometer processors later on this
year puts Intel at a severe disadvantage
it really really does now these two
companies do have a completely different
business model and the models are this
Intel are Indies all of their chips they
do all of the research and development
and they manufacture their own chips
however they're not manufacturing chips
for a lot of other companies and that's
where tsmc really comes in and since
they're already doing contract based
building these guys are pulling ahead
ever so slowly now on the desktop market
Intel still doing pretty good with their
chip sales but was n2 right around the
corner we're gonna probably see that gap
closed if not totally surpassed and at
that point that'll put Intel at an even
bigger disadvantage and the very fact
that they're having
with their 10 nanometer process is gonna
affect things across the board which
we'll talk to another video it's gonna
affect things even on their discrete
graphics card market so all in all Intel
trying to shoot for this 10 nanometer
process is actually holding them back
quite a bit and even their stock people
are kind of very upset about this
claiming hey where is this new
technology that's promised we need to
breathe new life into Intel now that
being said I'm not saying that AMD is
passing up Intel now in certain areas
they're doing really well on the server
market the epic chipset there's like 40
different servers out there that's
starting to really get into the market
and saturate it which means Intel's
losing sale in that department and
honestly in the server division
workstation division that was an area
that Intel was never even really had any
competition in whatsoever but now you
see them having severe competition and
if tsmc can come out and they can have
themselves a seven nanometer processor
before Intel that's gonna make a big
dent in the market I mean it will II
will it will change the market
altogether and in fact if you go to
sites like The Motley Fool who talk
about stock options and what you should
buy and stuff like that you'll see that
the Motley Fool is really no longer
offering Intel as one of their top ten
stocks which is kind of weird because in
the past Intel's always been a stock
that people like hey buy into it and you
could be SuperDuper rich like if you
would have invested even five thousand
dollars in Amazon when it first came out
that'd be worth like five million
dollars today so even though we're
probably not going to see like any you
know double or triple digit jumps in
Intel stock it's still been good stock
to buy but with tsmc totally started to
dominate the market and making more
chips or people this is definitely going
to change as we roll into 2019 and this
seven nanometer process it may not seem
like that big video to people but it
really is because the smaller the die
the more manufacturing you can make the
more stuff you can have it takes up less
space in the die so you can make more
chips more chips more chips which means
that they can actually have the ability
to make more chips than Intel can even
shout at that point that will really
really cause a severe gap in the market
now contract stuff would really help
Intel quite a bit if they could jump on
that market but for some reason right
now they seem to be really failing in
that market it just seems to be
something that I guess you know since
traditionally they've never really done
that you know it's like a company that
makes chocolate ice cream all of a
sudden make him Nell and people just
like what Fadel ice cream from chocolate
company that just doesn't make any sense
and it's kind of the same thing that's
happening to Intel for years they've
never ever worked with any other company
they've never opened up their fabs to
anybody else so when they're hoping
their doors wide up but now and saying
hey come on over I think people might
even be a little bit leery of that going
well what the heck's going on here why
is until all of a sudden changing their
game plans well they're changing their
game plans because the entire market is
changing and shifting and honestly the
entire market is changing and shifting
to one that will actually put Intel in a
possible secondary position all the way
across the board this could seriously
happen if TSMC can work with these other
companies and produce better chips and
better chip yields then they can
definitely take over the market now one
strategy that Intel has taken in the
past and I'm sure we will probably see
this happening I mean sure this probably
make a lot of people happy is will see
Intel start to cut the prices on their
CPUs to be competitive if Xen 2 comes
out and it's so much better than Intel
that it makes it into have to go oh my
god they're gonna definitely have to
lower their prices to compete in that
market and if they could somehow change
things and get some of these contracts
with these other companies that would
definitely change things for the better
TSMC is growing rapidly I mean they
really are growing rapidly and their
stock is something that's being
recommended so when you look at it from
just a person who's like investing in
stuff like that you'd have to say wow do
I really want to invest my money in
Intel or do I want to invest my money in
TSMC and I think most people these days
are going to want to put their money
into tsmc now this will totally change
the market in another way as well if
people stop buying Intel stock
altogether that will affect Intel's
overall revenue in a big way less people
investing in stock less people buying
into the company which means the company
will start to shrink instead of grow and
at that point that will really change
the marketing I mean let's just face it
TSMC is making chips for other people
just the very fact that they're making
chips for all the Apple stuff that's a
big deal
iPhones sell like hotcakes and since
they're making the CPUs that are in all
of these iPhones that alone gives them a
lead and plus working with AMD as well
and you know there's probably lots of
other companies to it they work with and
do this that is giving them an edge
which is not Intel off their throne so
really for the first time in history
Intel is no longer the number one
semiconductor manufacturing company
they're just not even though last year
they did make a few more billion dollars
than TSM see this year they say that the
growth will be much larger I guess last
year until I had a growth about 6% in
the market but TSMC says that this year
they're gonna show at least a 10% market
growth and if you look at the numbers
that 10% market growth will be quite a
big leap I know you know 10 to 6 doesn't
sound like that much when you're talking
about billions of dollars and billions
of things it's actually quite a big
number and this year may be the first
year that we see Intel get totally blown
away on the market with TSMC actually
growing bigger faster and making more
money all the way around the board which
will just be crazy now like I said
before I know some people you know think
that this translates into like AMD you
know making better CPUs than Intel and
stuff like that or taking more market
and that's not really the case AMD right
now and these according to the latest
numbers has about 12 percent market
share in the CPU industry with Intel
taking all the rest for themselves so
that alone keeps Intel you know doing
better as far as market segments go so
as far as just selling to mean you the
retail market and all that stuff Intel
still can't be touched at this time
point but the decisions that they make
in the next few months will definitely
determine what's going to happen to
Intel down the line will Intel make
the proper changes to get back their
glory and be in the limelight again and
be the number one semiconductor company
or will TSM see totally dominate this
year working with more contracts more
companies and getting that 17 excuse me
and getting that seven nanometer process
to the market before Intel if these
things happen until we'll seriously be
in trouble and 2019 will be a completely
different year another thing is is that
Intel is trying to enter into the
graphics market the discrete graphics
process of wove another video on that
and that alone is going to be delayed as
well but right now it does seem though
that Intel is no longer the giant they
once were and if they make bad decisions
for the rest of this year and the
decisions don't match up with actually
the business world we could see Intel
topple off that and see tsmc become the
strongest and the most viable
semiconductor manufacturing company in
the world and that will be a big change
people don't really realize that at our
level but there are people out there who
have stocks in this company where they
have millions and billions of dollars
invested into the stock and if Intel
topples all those people with that stock
will lose a lot a lot of money so you'll
probably see as we've actually started
to see people dumping off their Intel
stock and buying in to TSMC and this is
going to be a very big change in the
market Intel was number one like I said
for decades but check it out
the times they are a-changin we'll see
you guys back around Tekken tomorrow for
more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
