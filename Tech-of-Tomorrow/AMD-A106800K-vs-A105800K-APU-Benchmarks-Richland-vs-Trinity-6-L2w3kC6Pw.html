guys back here once again on tech of the
bar now you guys have been asking for it
and now we're going to bring it to you
folks
hot off the table that is the benchmarks
for the new AMD a10 6800 k now on our
initial test we've run it against the
5800 case you guys can see the
performance differences there and I
think you guys will be you know pretty
much aware already of what's going on
but now you guys will be able to see in
our benchmarks how it actually really
does now we will also be testing it
against an Intel CPU as well that is the
i5 44:30 that I've got right here to my
side right here and this thing's on the
LGA 1150 platform now some people have
made comments before when we were asked
about this I want to assess against the
i3 but the only thing is on the Haswell
there is no i3 for desktop we know this
processor is a little bit more money but
we want to test 2013 technology against
2013 technology also if you guys would
like to see us unbox this leave a
comment down below stating hey we want
that and hit that like button to let us
know we'll go ahead and do an unboxing
of this processor as well with that said
though let's jump in right now and let's
check out the benchmarks of the new AMD
a10 6800 k against the 5800 gauge
so there you folks have it you guys can
see from the benchmarks that you're
getting about three to ten percent
performance increase depending on what
application you're running now one thing
I definitely though have to mention
right the bet is that the new 6800 K it
does run a hell of a lot hotter than its
previous generation 5800 K that is
something you might want to consider
before upgrading it's going to require a
better heat sink and a better cooling
solution to keep that bad-boy running
cool due to the fact that obviously it's
an overclocked chip right out of the box
most you folks know that this is
basically new technology and that's the
way it goes a lot of times they push
this stuff it just gets hotter Intel's
known to make stuff try to run cooler
AMD's been trying to get stuff to run
faster sometimes it's a sacrifice so
that's what it is now we'll be testing
this against the Intel platform we'll be
seeing if the HD graphics that are
inside of that the 4600 are actually
better than the ones on the a-10 that'll
be our next test up stay tuned you guys
liked it hit that like button if you're
not subscribed we hope you are you guys
know what to do I'm out of here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
