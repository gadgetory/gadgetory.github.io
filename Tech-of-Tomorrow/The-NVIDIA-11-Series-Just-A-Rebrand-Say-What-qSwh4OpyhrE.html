I ate a bunch of bad food at the fair
and woke up with an extreme got ache and
on top of that we're hearing more rumors
about Nvidia's upcoming cards and what
they're gonna be about and all that kind
of stuff but Before we jump into that
let's real quick hair word from today's
sponsor of course there if you were
looking for a nice set of wireless
gaming headphones that will not break
your piggy bank and still have a lot of
nice features the Corsair hf 70s may be
just what you were looking for with
features like true 2.4 gigahertz
connectivity a removable mic easy to
adjust controls and solid sound these
headphones are perfect for their price
range the HS 70 headphones work with
your PC Xbox or Playstation 4 and come
to market at under $100 check them out
and see what you think ok so so far
we've heard a bunch of different rumors
have been going on for months what the
specs are gonna be when they're gonna
come out you know Jensen said it's gonna
be a long way off my contacts have said
hey there's nothing really going on but
now oh and also you know the lenovo and
by the way sorry I don't know why the
heck I called it Lenovo so many times
yesterday I must have been just in
another glow but Lenovo excuse me we
also you know got confirmation from them
that they're gonna be using 11 series
inside of their stuff but now we're
hearing some other rumors and to be
honest these ones kind of bummed me out
because from all the rumors I heard
talking about double-digit performance
and all this stuff I have to admit that
I was personally very very exciting when
you see with this new launch you know
brought to the table because let's just
face it I mean it's been so long since
we've seen a new video card from Nvidia
it's just mind-boggling like like I've
said before these were usually things
that were every year at least we were
getting new cards and spend such a long
time in between launches it's
mind-boggling
honestly the longest ever in history
that I can ever remember in the
beginning things were like much much
faster then they kind of like mellowed
out then they kind of got to every year
but now it looks like we're getting like
a new video card to release like every
two to three years which is just kind of
crazy stuff
now the thing that really sucks is the
latest rumors that I've been seeing is
that these cards will be rebranded cards
that's right
rebranded cards which means that they're
not going to feature a new architecture
they probably won't be GP 104 it's
probably not gonna be that maybe we'll
see we don't know if it's going to be
the next generation of technology or
anything else because if it's just a
rebrand that usually means it's gonna
feature the same technology as the cards
we've seen before with maybe just a
couple of performance boost here and
there which means that all those dreams
I was having of double digits will be
you know surely flush down the toilet
as far as you know we're all wanting 4k
every game over 60 frames per second
we're really hoping for that if it's a
rebrand I don't know if they'll be able
to touch that but if it ends up just
being a rebrand I have to admit I'll be
really really disappointed I mean after
waiting all of this time I was really
hoping for something that would really
jump out of the gate I mean even though
like I've said before there's really
absolutely no reason you know for them
to release a new card since they're
already pretty much on top it would be
really badass of them honestly to
release a card that just totally blows
away everything on the market completely
and creates a gap I mean now you guys
might get mad at this but check it out
if they did that they would force AMD to
really up their game even more let's
just face it if Nvidia released a brand
new card and it was double digits and
all the stuff that we're hearing about
it was gonna be just you know a great
SuperDuper fast card that would make AMD
have to really really get off their
laurels and work not saying that they
have been working hard but they would
have to work double hard to do that so
for us the end user that's nothing but a
good thing but I mean I can see why a
giant corporations like well no we don't
want to do that right now because
they're still selling cards but I mean I
would think that the 1080i market and
the 1080 in that market and the 1070 is
slowing down a little bit especially
since the availability of cards has been
absolute crap for the last year and it's
just now starting to balance out and I'm
actually hearing rumors that cards in
the next 30 to 45 days
might even drop 20% more well that would
make sense because if they do release
new video cards even if they're a
rebrand well obviously would think the
old stock would get a price down which
will be great for people out there
building systems who have wanted these
cards for the last year and couldn't get
their hands on them but for real tech
enthusiasts and people who are looking
for cards that are like gonna push the
envelope that would be a pretty damn
depressing thing to just get a card
that's a rebrand so I really really hope
at the end of the day that this
particular rumor does not turn out to be
true but if it does I have to tell you
I'm gonna be really disappointed I think
that you guys out there will be really
disappointed as well because like I said
we've all waited so long so long
honestly just so long man I feel like
the guy who fell asleep under a tree for
a few years you know you know it's just
been so long since we've seen a new
video card from them and if I'm gonna
see a new video card I want to see a new
video card that's totally badass not
just a slight bump in the road I don't
know how you guys feel I definitely want
to hear your comments down below let me
know what you guys think but honestly
Nvidia if it's just a rebrand what the
heck man I was looking forward to some
double digits some killer card new
technology lots of new stuff to talk
about because let's just face it new
stuff fuels the news he would give me
more stuff to talk about them and the
new cards come out from the partners
that gives more reviews and stuff that
kind of technology and that stuff really
fuels the industry a rebrand although
it'll be interesting for a short time
isn't the same as releasing all new
technology that totally blows away
everybody on the market and that's what
I was really hoping for so I know you
guys been watching teching tomorrow
we'll see you guys back in the channel
for more tech peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
