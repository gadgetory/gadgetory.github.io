to take it tomorrow we're always
bringing you all the tech all the time
in case you're new here I'm mark your
host and unless you guys have been just
not paying into the PC stuff lately
intel has released a whole bunch of new
stuff that's just come out all the new
line of i5 and i7 chipsets for the
desktop and mobile have now been
released we did the review on the new I
7 4770k if you guys missed that check
that out right here now with that said a
lot of za7 motherboards have hit the
market we've got the g1 sniper fire from
the people over at gigabyte and this
thing as a shitstorm of features on it
including a brand new sound system that
features op-amp technology which means
you can go in and change the little
things on the motherboard and change the
way the sound is really cool stuff now
all IP we're gonna ask z87 chipset
what's new about it not a lot is really
new you get some additional SATA ports
some additional USB ports but all the
kind of things are really important to
us as far as our 8x gaming lanes and all
that kind of stuff 16x gaming lanes all
that kind of stuff is pretty much going
to stay the same not much different so
with that said let's jump in let's check
out did you want cyber and see if it
makes the kill shot
all right folks we'll check it out
here's the box I don't see many folks
say hey you know we don't care about the
box but other people do and so we're
just gonna go ahead and talk about the
box this brand new g1 killer you guys
can see the bullet right there I know
that in the past some people made fun of
the little gun design that gigabyte had
in the motherboards they've removed all
that and they've done all kinds of new
stuff with their BIOS in fact glass has
been all new gone is the old 3d bios in
is their new bias now check it out
here's the gigabyte op-amp upgrade kit
which is included now this is really
cool because you have your onboard sound
and with this you can actually change
the way the sound is either more bassy
more clarity whatever you want there's
something to fit obvious the g1 sniper 5
the rest that's down here you guys know
it's all for the new Intel LGA 1150
chipset that's right so we're gonna
continue on here real quick just rook
we're gonna go right here zoom in this
for people out there who are looking to
buy the motherboard this is all the
nomenclature you guys can see all that
stuff there but now the back of the box
is actually really important a lot of
times don't do much about it but this
time
there's actually so much here we should
talk about it what's the star up here at
the top g1 sniper 5 the g1 killer logo
here ultra durable 5 Series you guys get
a Bluetooth 4.0
30 megabyte per second dual bandwidth
Wi-Fi card so that's pretty cool over
here you guys see once again the
gigabyte amp up audio exclusive upgrade
or amp gaming motherboard no sound like
this has actually been on an a
motherboard that I've ever seen you guys
can see it comes the creative sound Core
3d with custom and gold-plated shilling
niche icon high-end audio capacitors
they have Ultra networking once again
they have the killer eat when t2 on
board for network and they also have
Intel's
onboard audio that has high ESD
protection now you can see it has for
weight graphic supports so you can do
four-way SLI or four-way crossfire
whichever you want to do exclusive UEFI
dual BIOS durable black solid caps all
the way across the board you guys can
see a lot more stuff on the board I'm
not going to go over every single bit of
a check it out you can also use water
cooling on the board they use an all new
IR digital power design the
International rectifier which is the
number one IR digital pw WMS with its IR
power stage ICS it's got two times the
copper PCB and quick button technology
for your onboard power reset blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah
obviously the onboard video will support
4k HDMI and you guys in this real quick
see the rear IR right there I know
that's a lot of stuff in the box folks
but this is a brand new box and I mean
people have seen it I decided to go a
little bit anal on doing the box so now
let's go ahead and take it out of the
box and start checking it out for real
oh I felt really good I shouldn't make
those burritos I guess for lunch huh no
not just a box care there get the other
way there set it down here so inside
here start up you guys can see it all
comes in its own complete box inside the
box box section again all protect it and
everything go ahead and set that down
the cat got a little plastic cap here
too it's gonna come off now I'm gonna
pull the motherboard out and new it you
know I'm has that nice new motherboard
smell let me just pull this and get this
out of the way real quick though and
let's go over all and I mean all of the
exclusive stuff that comes in this box
so let me start pulling it out one by
one folks
alright folks we're going to start off
with the rear i/o see it's all
color-coordinated everything's really
nice and easily marked there get a six
USB 3.0 in the rear i/o that's pretty
cool we'll set that down there's just so
much stuff inside of this box folks I'm
telling you gigabyte really through in
the entire kitchen sink here here is you
are lovely Wireless and here's the cable
that connects it to your motherboard
really nice some of the nicest Wi-Fi
you're going to see keep going so here
we go here's a really cool tool anyways
folks check this out we talked about
that audio right here's the op-amp
upgrade kit you get actually an
additional op-amp it's included here but
you can go online and you can choose all
kinds of different ones from different
companies it's really fun to experiment
and we had a lot of fun at their event
doing this I think you guys are going to
be highly impressed with that and
there's a tool right here to remove it
one thing that's really funny to mention
this if you guys ever bought an Intel
motherboard this tool actually removes
the BIOS chip on Intel motherboards kind
of strange set that down just so much
stuff in here folks it's got to tell you
gigabyte this here is the CD with all of
your drivers and all that stuff
here's your wireless disk this has all
your wireless stuff set that down to
folks there's so much in here folks I'm
just telling you
all right so continue moving on here
right here that I've got right here I'm
gonna pull this out of the bag for you
folks here's the antenna that uh hooks
up so Kabu Kabu me two connectors are
inside of there you got this little
antenna right here so you get great
Wi-Fi connectivity here is a breakout
for your USB 3.0 four front panel
connectors right there not that we have
one two three black SATA cables I'll say
two six now we come to the SLI bridges
so check it out four-way SLI bridge they
are not joking around in this board
3-way SLI bridge and those for you who
like moderate kink just your standard
two-way SLI we also have a single
crossfire connector know multiple
connectors now why is that Giga Byte be
fair be fair over there
we're getting down to the nitty-gritty
folks well we had a couple more things
in the box here we have the user's
manual multi-lingual installation guide
book and the set your desktop free this
is for all your wireless stuff right
here and so that's what we call the
accessory pack that's what comes in the
box now let's move on and take a closer
look at the motherboard alright folks so
now we have the motherboard out of the
box you guys can see it all has the
complete black and green which I
consider the old-school Kawasaki look to
it but it's also nvidia like to now you
guys can see all the top here with the
ultra durable all around this cooling
off the MOSFETs and everything is
something that can be liquid cooled or
air cooled you see there's ports right
here you can actually connect these up
to your liquid cooling kit and there's
actually another fan right here edition
cooling off the board really nice stuff
now there are a total of nine fan
headers on the board beginning up here
on top and one of the really cool things
about these new fans if it can actually
be controlled through the BIOS on
previous generation motherboards there
were a couple of them that you could
hook up they could not be connected and
run through the BIOS now with this
motherboard you can go into the BIOS and
control all of those fans here you guys
can see there's plenty of room around
the LGA 1150 socket right here for
putting in your cores either aftermarket
or standard then we're gonna move over
there next to that I'll actually flip
the board around here for us to take
some additional looks here now the
cameron leg zoom and over here now right
down below the syph socket or to the
side depending on how you want to look
at it you guys can see the memory slots
there are four dims supporting a total
of 32 gigabytes of ddr3 memory they're
all color coordinated and nice so we'll
start off down here folks as well we can
see there's a power button the reset
button a little mem button here we can
see all the black high capacity parts
they're being used you also have a
switch right here for your BIOS this is
a dual BIOS motherboard so you can
switch the BIOS back and forth or if one
burns out Jax who works out pretty well
if you're doing a lot of overclocking
here's a 24-pin power right here here's
your LED reader this will tell you if
you guys have some kind of air on your
motherboard we'll give you a post button
it'll say either a nine or FF or
something it'll tell you a code you can
look that up in your manual and find out
what's actually causing the motherboard
problems
don't move along over here we see
another complete cooling solution right
here we see the heat pipe running along
so if you put the liquid in here it's
gonna be cooling all the way around down
to the board it's got the g1 killer a
little skull like thing right there
little knife in its mouth here we can
see the battery you need to remove this
at all to reset your system you can do
that we also have a USB 3.0 connector
right here so you can plug that in stick
that into your front connection that we
showed you earlier in the unboxing all
right folks now let's move down the side
of the board now this is pretty
interesting right here this is something
new this is the ATX 4p you guys since
this right here now what this actually
does this provides extra power to your
PC
so that's kind of pretty cool now here
are all of our saner connectors these
black ones right here these are all
brought to you on the z87 chipset these
ones right down here are brought to you
guys by the Marvel chipset so all in all
you get ten really nice plenty of
connectivity there you're not going to
run nothing with that let's flip the
board around we'll stick on the side of
the board down on the side you guys can
see there's more system fans all your
connectivity right here another USB 3.0
more system fans all the way around
since we got the board up right here now
let's talk about the connectivity as far
as your lanes go we have one two three
four PCI Express lanes these are all for
your video cards and that type of stuff
and then we have the PCI 1 X lanes these
are one two three running all the way
down now let's flip it around though
folks and let's get a really close up of
this down here this is all of the audio
for the motherboard very important stuff
all the high-end niche akan capacitors
and everything here's your little amp
ship that we were talking about before
this can be pulled off removed from the
board and changed out more high-powered
nichkhun capacitors are down here this
is all based off the creative this is
their new creative sound core alright
folks so now let's take a look at the
rear i/o and this one is actually quite
nice and offers something unique that I
haven't seen hunt any of their
motherboard so we're to start off over
here on the right side we first see the
two USB 2.0 connectors then we see the
legacy ps2 keyboard mouse port coaxial
audio now here's where things get really
really interesting on this motherboard
you get two gold-plated HDMI ports now
this is really interesting
dual gold-plated HDMI ports gold-plated
DisplayPort then we get to nix one is
the killer
one is the lamp the superior ASD and we
get two more sets
of USB 3.0 and then finally we make our
way over to the audio now check this out
everyone the connections on here is
gold-plated so you get all this your
gold-plated for your 7.1 and then for
your digital s/pdif you get a connection
right there one thing I might have
missed folks is want to make sure I just
don't miss abrupt folks is right here is
the 8 pin power connector up here up on
top I think my apply we're showing the
board I might have missed that out so
make sure you guys see that now let me
just flip the board around real quick
let you guys see the backside of the
motherboard alright folks so there you
guys have it the new g1 sniper fire from
the people over at gigabyte for the
brand new LGA 1150 CPUs on the z87
chipset people so that's it now this
thing's probably gonna come to market a
little bit over $200 but it does help
standing features on it if you're into
this kind of color scheme and this kind
of build you're really going to be into
this thing a lot of improvements have
gone into this board like I said the
BIOS has been completely changed you no
longer get their wanky 3d bios they have
their brand-new complete digital bios
digital power all that stuff on the
board so I'm really looking forward to
throwing this thing on the test station
and see how it does in real time hope
you guys liked this video if so make
sure you guys come to kick that like
button and if you're not subscribed to
channel Hey we always appreciate seeing
you back here so we hope you do I'm
Mallory take it easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
