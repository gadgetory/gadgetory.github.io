letting me know what the holiday season
means to you so if you're Jewish and you
celebrate Hanukkah let me know what that
experience is like for you if you're
Christian explain that to me if you have
something else just let me know I really
like to get to know my fans better you
guys know pretty much all about me and
my Q&amp;amp;A I gave you guys pretty much blunt
straight-up answers to everything listen
to what you guys said so I'm always
listening to you guys believe me I
always them but sometimes making changes
a little bit harder than just you know
snap my finger make it happening like
the video card test platform I got to
get all the video cards rebuild it then
test them all from scratch with like
basically weeks with a work and trying
to bring the videos and just keep normal
life together it can be a strain so with
that said though 12 days of Christmas
coming up lots of prizes it's
international if I see a dislike on
there I'm just going to laugh because
like what can you dislike about this
video but I'm sure there'll be a hater
out there who dislikes it to say oh you
know what I don't like it because you
know you're not shipping free stuff to
the planet Mars sorry fedex doesn't ship
there I asked and since it doesn't ship
there and Amazon doesn't ship there
either you guys are SOL on the Mars
shipment so if that's why you're hating
the video
anyways this is my love back to you guys
it's easy leave a comment down below let
me know a little bit about yourself and
what the holidays mean to you and it's
going to be an awesome season this is
really just the tip of the iceberg I'm
going to be bringing you guys gift guide
