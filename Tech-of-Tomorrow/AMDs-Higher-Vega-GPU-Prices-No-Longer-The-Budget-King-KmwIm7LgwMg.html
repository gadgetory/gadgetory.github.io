to even start today because I'm just
kind of like tripping the out and
that's what it is now you guys know for
years I've always supported AMD as the
underdog they were always fighting
against the nvidia thing but the thing
that AMD always had was they had lower
prices on all of their stuff you know
that's just how it was we all went AMD
we didn't have the money to buy the
higher and stuff we went to them as our
budget stuff and we've been doing that
for years but my question of the day is
is Andy actually going to remain the
budget King because there's just a lot
of weird stuff going on I told you guys
in my fanboy video that just blindly
buying stuff without knowing how well it
does or anything completely destroys
completely destroys competition I mean
the Vega card came out I don't know what
you guys think but in all honesty I mean
it was it was pretty good it was not
exactly what I thought that it was going
to be and I based all my reviews off the
prices that we were told the cards were
you know when we did the card launch
well it's kind of funny because a few
days after the review came out the
prices went up and if you go out and you
look you can't pretty much find any AMD
card in stock right now now some of this
obviously has to do with mining but a
lot of it just has just buying stuff
like my friend mark and we'll have the
scores for this from from his from his
channel on here he bought the liquid
cooled version of the 64 1300
freaking dollars it's nowhere near as
fast as a Titan XP and even at its
extreme rates it does beat at 1080 but
let's just face it
$1,300 you can get a 1080 online for
less than 400 bucks if you look around
there people selling used for 395 450
bucks but definitely you can get a 1080
for much cheaper now another thing I
want to address here is a lot of people
were asking you know hey man were those
scores that you were doing right the
64-bit card is actually doing worse than
the 56 and yes it's true
the MSAA does not seem to be able to be
handled whatsoever on the 64-bit card
the 64 obviously and the 56 does
actually does better the Vega 56 because
it actually handles it better now
there's been a lot of weird scoring
stuff
I'm shaking my head - I yell to the guy
who does my testing I'm like dude what
are you doing this can't be
realistic like how is this car beating
it so we talked to some other sites and
we talked to mark from Babel tech
reviews and like yes it's true in a lot
of instances the 56 actually can beat
the 64 and that's just the way that it
is but the thing that blows my mind is
that none of these cards are in stock
anywhere they raise the prices and now
you came and get one of these video
cards anywhere for any low price so if
you were expecting to hop into an AMD
card to do your system and expecting to
save money or be on a budget no way so I
have to say right now as far as the VGA
side of things AMD is no longer the
budget choice now they may put on their
card as a retail thing some price but
you're seeing everywhere out there that
these cards are expensive as hell and I
noticed some guys to say they got really
lucky you know they walked into a Best
Buy well I've walked into a bunch of
Best Buy is trying to find these cards
and I can never find in stock or
believe me I would buy a couple more
myself just to have them here for
reviews but you can't get any of these
cards now is they AMD purposely not
putting the cards out to the market or
that just that people just suck in these
things up for no reason because if
you're just a gamer why would you not
want to get yourself a 1080 TI at this
point since the Vegas 64 can't beat it
and you can get a liquid-cooled one for
much cheaper than $1,300 so mark went
out he spent $1300 on this card I was
just like wow dude really 1,300 bucks so
he's like well you know I think it sound
from AMD I wanna have a good one so I
bought it but just imagine that man 13 I
think is even more than 1300 dollars of
tax and shipping and all that crap I
think was even more than that that's a
lot of money though for a card that will
not be a Titan XP liquid car which you
can get for around the same price I
think there are about $1400 on average
but if you look around I've seen them as
low as 1300 bucks especially around the
same price as this and we're talking
about something that has more
performance so I'm really just
scratching my head all around right now
on this AMD thing now obviously when it
comes to CPUs the market seems to
balance out right there we kind of know
where they're at you know they have more
cores are they beating you notes into
the over i7s no they're not at when you
know and we'll see you in the next gen
raishin of Intel CPUs gets here which is
in about a month or so we'll see how it
actually does against those releases now
obviously no Intel stepped on
their dick on this last launch and I
think if you've got them in a room they
bi yeah all right we just do this crap
out there you know because they're
really waiting for the next generation
of CPUs and I've talked to a lot of the
people that make manufacturers a
motherboard and stuff and they all tell
me that the next-gen is badass so
I'm really looking forward to that I
mean I did buy a 78 20 at a 7800 we just
actually got them in the other day and
I'm waiting for my motherboards we
bought those just I had to see what they
do but AMD on the CPU side of thing
seems to be you know pretty balanced out
when it comes to the GPUs and video
cards it's just outrageous and really
the thing that takes me up is I really
don't understand is why they raise the
prices a couple days after release I
mean everything in my video is based on
the fact that yeah it could be to 1070
and it was at a better price point than
a 1070 well now it's about $100 more
than a 1070 so does my review that I
made does it even mean jack anymore
honestly I feel like my reduced
irrelevant now because I based it on
performance versus price so in essence
AMD you kind of made me a liar man not
not appreciating that then following you
for years and helping you out but now
you made me a bunch of us other
reviewers you've pretty much made us out
to be Liars because you raised the price
and I'm still just like wondering what
the hell is going on with stuff like
this
AMD at this point right now for me I do
not feel that they're like the budget
leader in the video card department
they're just not every one of their
video cards right now is super
inflated prices I mean I guess this is
really due to everybody out there doing
different kinds of mining stuff that's
well you know everybody is claiming you
know is what's up but is it really that
or they're just a short of GPUs being
put out to the market
forcing a crowd of fans who want these
cards to pay the price just because they
can't get a hold of me you know like
like it's like the lost diamond of
Sahara to get an AMD card well I'm not
going to pay those high prices and you
guys spoke when I did my last video and
I put an AMD video card in there and all
you guys did was bitch unsub and leave
me nasty notes about how up I was
for using this $349 video card in the
system you know the 570 you know I
listened you guys
I brought near the 1050 GI system to the
board like you guys wanted but the whole
thing is though is that those prizes and
all that stuff have nothing to do with
me
Tek them tomorrow has absolutely nothing
to do with AMD is high prices and I
chose that video card because I thought
you guys are the hard core AMD fans
would want to see this system of the
1200 with an AMD card in it but that
really didn't seem to be the case there
were really a couple of requests from
people were like hey you know use this
of their car but pretty much across the
board the 1050 Ti is what everybody said
would match that system perfectly so at
the end of the day what are we going to
do if the CPU side of things for me and
being start becoming the same way just
going up going up going up going up
video cards going up and will NVIDIA
when they release their next generation
cards that supports totally the same
type of things that AMD is doing as far
as the mining goes how will that shifts
the market when they do that will AMD
cards no longer become like that lost
diamond of blah blah blah blah or will
they just begin it be something that
balances out the market like usual I
want to hear you guys comments below but
right now I'm just I'm kind of really
angry about the pice raising I'm sick of
the price gouging and all the weird
comments going around to it I should be
able to go out there and purchase an AMD
card at the price that they listed at
launch you know what I mean when they
release the 570 I should be able to go
buy a 570 at a 570 price but can I tell
to the no they're almost $400 even more
expensive in some cases so it's just
gotten crazy I don't know if AMD is in
it you know sorry I don't know if really
AMD in the future is going to be the
budget King anymore because the way
things are trending AMD right now is
getting more money for their video cards
that actually have less performance than
their Nvidia counterpart and that's just
completely utterly crazy at the end of
my day when I go out and I buy something
with my money I don't care whose names
attached to it all i care is it's the
absolute best performance i can get and
since that's not really happening we're
seeing something that we probably really
haven't seen before ever in history
where pipe actually supersedes reality
and that's how it is so peace out I'm
Miller you guys have a great day we've
got a lot more stuff
going up with Vega a lot of testing
coming up with my friend Mark from out
like I said battle tech reviews so we
got a lot of stuff we're doing in
conjunction with him we'll have a
LinkedIn site down below if you want to
check out his stuff he strictly does
writing stuff Reister we do video so
we're kind of a good combo and we got
lots of stuff coming so stay tuned
detector tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
