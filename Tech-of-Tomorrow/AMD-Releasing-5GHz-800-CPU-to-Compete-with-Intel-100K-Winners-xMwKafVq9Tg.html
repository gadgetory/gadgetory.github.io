know why you guys out there said hey
take a break unfortunately the news
waits for no one I know you guys want to
know the latest news now first up AMD
fence you guys are going to be psyched
there's an what that's possible food to
be coming out it is code named the
Centurio and it's supposed to be clocked
at 5.0 gigahertz right out of the damn
box so picture that AMD at this point
would actually be winning the clock wars
as far as clock speeds go Intel's i7
goes at 3.9 that's the highest they have
right now so I and II came out with a
five-point oh they're going to be the
apt to cook in the clock wars now will
that mean there'll be the performance a
sticker that is yet to be seen but we'll
have to see when the damn thing comes
out now I know you guys can see that
right here behind me I have the sensei
this is the steelseries since I hi i
want to be a masa and this thing is used
by a couple of pro game players out
there who are serious about their game
now we're going to go over view that
thing right now so i got it right behind
me we'll just do some quick stuff here's
the box i'm going to spin it around show
you guys the back of the box i'm going
to open it up and you guys can see right
inside of here there are two gamer guys
alright folks or one was the knife right
we're going to take little knife here
take a little trusty incision right here
in the back here make another one right
here go ahead and chop that thing off
gets up popped off there kaboom what are
some of the great things about this
mouse any whales for one thing it's
ergonomic and it's ambidextrous means
that you know you can use it with either
hand with your lefty or righty you can
use this mouse it's also programmable
with illumination up to 16 point million
color options in three different zones
it says instant effortless set up via
the built-in LCD menu of five giving
profiles and steelseries exact tech
precision settings LCD supports user
personalized bitmaps it also says w
mal speed with dots per square inch from
5702 1114 DCPI yowzer that's just
incredible so I'm going to take the
mouse out right here in kind of a google
thing here not quite an unboxing now
check this out this thing is pretty
bitchin looking right off the bat you
guys can see this ultimate killer silver
outside get the scroll button right here
in the center program button turn it to
the side you can see there are two
buttons on this side and also matching
two buttons on the other side which are
totally programmable and totally awesome
for like they said the ambidextrius'
person like I said before this mouse is
ambidextrous can use by a left-handed
user or a right-handed user has
programmable buttons has a bunch of
lighting out because you can program as
well with their own proprietary software
you can pretty much do a lot of
different stuff with this mouse here
we'll take a look at the bottom of it so
you guys can check that out now there's
no wait type of adjustment what you see
is what you get you can't change the
weight on it that might affect some
users but me personally I don't really
care too much about that you can see
they weigh a gold-plated connector so

before i'm still really sick we just
thought that we really need to get this
information out to you folks we still
film the video in the series that we're
doing we've also got another story many
people out there have been wondering hey
where the hell is has well we'll check
it out you guys know before I wrote an
article on some of the Haswell stuff
that got leaked by tom's hardware well
now we have all the pricing on these as
well now what's happened is we've got
pricing for quantities of five or more
all the way from their brand new latest
chip all the way down to their lowest
chip now what you guys are going to
really be surprised that is they've
actually reintroduced some of the six
series chips that were missing from the
ivy bridge and what this shows that
Intel's really focusing on the lower end
mid-range market where they're going to
compete and try to just totally
eliminate their competition in AMD and a
very thing goes with Haswell the way
it's supposed to this could really put a
damper and am these plans with their AP
use and CPUs but that's it folks all
these price and everything are they're
coming in at about three hundred and
twenty nine dollars for their top one
all the way down to the low hundreds for
their entry level which is just really
really incredible like usual all these
stories will be in the link in
description below where i wrote the full
articles and you can see all the pricing
and everything else over on WOWT cove
