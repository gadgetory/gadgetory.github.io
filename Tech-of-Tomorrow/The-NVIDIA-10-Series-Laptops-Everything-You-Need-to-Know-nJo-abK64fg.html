again on TECA tomorrow we've got some
awesome news coming from Team Green
today those fans the GTX 10 series video
cards you are in for a nice surprise
because now that entire series of video
cards is moving over to the laptop world
that's right so now portable gaming is
going to get complete GTX 1060 1070 and
1080 notebooks that's right and what's
the most awesome thing about this I
think is that gone gone gone are the
series of em that's right these are no
longer going to be mobile chipset
laptops you will get full Pascal that's
right baby everything that you got with
Pascal before Ansel all those special
features that they get are all going to
be in this new series of 10 gaming
laptops and there's just so many things
that have been redesigned about it to
make it really really appealing things
like overclocking directly out of the
box that's right in videos working with
their partners so that you're going to
get even more performance possibly out
of your laptop then you're going to be
able to get even out of your desktop
because there'll be a lot of different
things that are going on all of the
electronics everything that has to do
with the electronic engineering is being
completely done from the ground up
inside of these new 10 series notebooks
this way you'll be able to game and go
on the go gaming for a long period of
time even though i don't have
performance numbers right here in my hot
hands you guys have seen Pascal has
surely surpassed Maxwell in every
capacity and you're seeing about two
times better performance on the new
laptops then you were the previous
generation so that just means bitter
gaming all around another crazy thing
about this launch is nvidia is told all
of us that they have spent actually more
money on this launch than almost
anything that they've ever done before
they're going to be millions and
millions of laptops released and these
things will be released actually
tomorrow morning so if you guys check
back on the site tomorrow morning i'll
actually have links to all the products
and all these laptops will be V already
and some will be as thin as 18
millimeters thick and as light as four
pounds
plus with a bunch of new games being
released for VR the time for portable VR
is getting better all the time now you
can actually have a space battle while
sitting on top of Mount Everest in
previous generation laptops 60 Hertz was
basically the target that every was
trying to hit well guess what that's all
in the past now on these new series of
notebooks they're going to feature
g-sync and have a hundred and twenty
Hertz and even more refresh rate so
that's pretty killer in the desktop
world 25 x 14 monitors are very very
popular and now nvidia with the 10
series will be the first laptops in the
world to feature 25 x 14 displays and on
this screen shot right here you guys can
see the performance at both 120 hertz
gaming and at 4k gaming and even though
all the games aren't over 60 frames per
second and 4k gaming you can still see
there's some awesome numbers for
portability in the beginning video I
talked to you guys about overclocking
laptops well in the past everything got
so hot and everything that you could
barely even overclock the laptops to 100
megahertz but with Pascal laptops you'll
be able to overclock up to 300 megahertz
and maybe even more depending on the
configuration from the manufacturer and
that's what I think is just really
awesome manufacturers making complete
notebooks that are geared from the
ground up for not only running killer
but also to be overclockable on the go
okay so so far we can see that all the
specs and everything or looking killer
all the features VR works all that stuff
is all coming with this but what about
battery life because hey what we're
talking about here is portability and
laptops right well battery life has been
increased dramatically and NVIDIA is
going to release their brand new battery
boost now the previous battery boost had
some problems with it all the issues
were poor brought to their attention and
fixed and now tomorrow well actually the
16th there should be a brand-new
Patchett's come out which will fix all
that now what the battery boost does it
allows you to play your game and set
certain settings in the game to make
your battery last longer so say if
you're at home you know you play with
everything said it it's extreme because
you've got that plug from the wall but
you want to go on the road and still
play so what you can do is you can go
inside the game
and change the parameters of the game
and change everything in there to make
it so your laptop can play your games
and play them for a lot longer while
you're on the go virtual reality is no
longer something that people are just
talking about virtual reality is now
actually reality in gaming it's not
quite as far as like a holodeck and Star
Trek but it's getting there ever so
slowly and right now NVIDIA has 30 games
that they're working on for their VR
works program including this killer game
called raw data which I hear a lot of
people are playing and liking it also
people are asking hey will Ansel be
available in this yes I just want to
clarify this completely across the board
everything that you can get on the
desktop GTX 1080 1070 and take 60
everything from the GDR 5x memory to the
GDR 5 memory to everything like Ansel
which is Ansel is really cool you can
actually go into a game with ansel take
pictures edit those pictures and you can
go back into it in VR and even if you
didn't take the shot in VR you can see
the entire picture in VR which is really
really crazy and you can also go and
stop the game and while you're in game
you can stop it and cheat like hell move
your character around take a picture of
it and then adjust it and you can even
capture it in direct 360 mode so you can
see it in complete 360 so for those
people wondering hey am I getting a
laptop but am I getting cut short no
this is one of the absolute most
incredible features that I think about
the 10 series notebooks no more M
chipset when you buy one of these 10
series notebooks you're getting full
pascal full video card stuff and what
were you here is rumored is like i said
is because these things are going to be
geared from the ground up it's possible
that some of these notebooks will be
faster than even some of the desktops
that we see on the market now obviously
you're going to be able to build an x 99
giant system and they're not going to
have that but for anybody who's doing i5
i7 the competition is going to be very
very very scary and very stiff
especially for Team Red what do they got
for laptops
and last but not least before i bounce
out of here and videos claiming that
they now have a notebook for every user
and here in this very last screenshot
you can see the different specs that are
being offered on launch date which will
be tomorrow august 16 I'm elric you guys
been watching teka tomorrow they'll be
links below to some of the information
over the nvidia site and tomorrow
morning I'll have links to all these
notebooks as they get released around
the world we'll see you guys back here
on the channel looking forward to
getting me a hold of one of those uh ten
share your notebooks you know what I
mean know what I mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
