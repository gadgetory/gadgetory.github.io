cam now inside the box you'll get the
ring stick up cam itself the screws and
the anchors to install it also included
is a screwdriver and the Philips Pitt
you're going to need to tighten
everything down and you also get a drill
bit in case you want to install this in
something much harder than your wooden
door also included is a mounting bracket

to make sure that you install it
correctly and there's also another
mounting bracket that attaches to the
stick up cam itself inside the box

rechargeable lithium battery that is
internally stored there are actually a
few ways to charge up your ring stick up
cam the first is through the included
USB cable but there are also two other
ways to charge up your ring stick up cam
now the first way is through the
included waterproof micro USB cable this
cable comes in the waterproof hood for
the micro USB slot and the other end
simply connects to any standard USB
socket now the other way of charging it
the stick up cam is through the ring
solar panel the solar panel is a 7.5
inch by 6 inch by one and a quarter inch
weather resistant solar panel that comes
with an adjustable mounting bracket so
you can catch the Sun and continuously
charge your ring stick up cam it comes
with its own micro USB cable which
easily plugs into the back of the ring

set up things like motion alerts and
configure motion settings that work just
right for you you can set up instant
mobile alerts which alerts you when
motion is detected giving you the
ability to know what is happening on
your property all the time now some of
the options you can do inside the app
are turning off and on zones and
configuring the range of the zones you
can also receive alerts when motion is
detected in those zones and only those
zones if you so wish

smart alerts which is pretty much how
frequently you want to be notified of
