again on taking them out with buddy the
dog so check it out we've built a $650
entry level system for you folks and
we've also done a bunch of research to
bring you guys a full gaming thing for
under $1,000 as well so let's check out
the system and then let's check out
those options let's go so the icarus 650
starts out with a really nice corsair
carbide clear 400 C compact mid-tower
case now the reason I went with this
case over a lot of other cases gives it
as a very great and simple design and an
awesome window so you can see everything
inside the system it also offers a lot
of different options for upgrading
whether you need a bigger video card a
lot of space for multi hard drives or
multi SSDs the 400 C can handle it all
and with the carbide 400 C when you
install your power supply you don't see
it in all with that great big clear
window all your components can be viewed
to show off to your friends overall I
feel for the price of 96 99 that this
case just has a lot of features and the
looks to be a great addition to any
build the general rule of thumb that any
build is pretty much don't spend any
more money on your case they do in your
motherboard I try to keep these two
parts pretty much balanced and so we
will with the Asus m5 a 97 R 2.0
motherboard now this is an AM 3
motherboard with the 970 chipset has a
lot of great features I really wish I
could have found something that was in a
total red light theme I know this is
blue speaker going in tell its
apologized about that I wanted
everything read but for this price I
decided to stick with this motherboard
because there's a lot of options and
fits with this build very well in the
price range now for the CPU I chose a
CPU that had enough power that it
wouldn't be you know bottlenecking all
your cards but still was very affordable
so I chose the AMD FX 8 core Black
Edition CPU now the FX 8350 processor is
a really good processor it works great
with gaming and what's best of all it
comes with their brand new Wraith cooler
which actually keeps the system running
very cool as you guys will see when we
show those temps when it came to
choosing the memory I wanted to get
something that matched the a Zeus board
so I chose the PNY anarchy 8 gigabyte
kit of 1600 megahertz ddr3 this is
perfect stuff at a great price for this
bill
now as far as the boot drive and storage
option goes like I said we're gonna give
you guys a couple different option pass
if you want to go with to just the
entry-level system without an SSD we're
gonna show you that and that features a
blue Western Digital one terabyte drive
at 7,200 rpm but if you want to have an
SSD as well we've got a crucial drive
its 240 gigabytes that's also an amazing
price
so either way we've got you covered just
depending on what type of money you want
to spend now for the power supply I
chose the EVGA 430 180 plus certified
power supply now this thing offers 4 to
30 watts continuous power and a great
warranty but trust me this thing runs
more like a 500 watt power supply and it
powers all the video cards that we're
going to show you in today's bill and
what's cool is the case actually hides
the power supply completely sitting up
to see any of the power spike cables or
anything else you can build a completely
UNMISS a build now like I said folks
we're gonna give you guys a bunch of
different options in the standard build
we only have the one terabyte hard drive
and we only have this video card in it
currently this is the XFX double
dissipation r7 370 now this card is a
Triple X version overclocked features 4
gigabytes of gddr5 and has a lot of good
features for that person who wants an
entry level gaming card and doesn't want
to spend a lot of money but like I said
if you're a person who wants to have a
system that's around $1000 and have
everything then you can use the msi r9
390 gaming Edition card this is an 8
gigabyte graphics card and it's pretty
much double what the 370 is so if you
got more money and you want to build a
little bit higher expensive system and
use a little bit different parts then
this might be what you might want to go
with in your system I don't know if
you're like me but I use Amazon and
Amazon Prime to pretty much order
everything that I get and if I use
Amazon smile a little bit of my money
always goes to my favorite donations but
the problem is is sometimes when you're
working within that environment you get
kicked out of that now there's this guy
named Ivan who's embedded this brand-new
app that you can get and download and
make sure that no matter what you're
doing inside of the Amazon environment
you always stay inside of Amazon smile
and a little bit of your money goes to
that donations we'll have a link to that
app down below and I like to know what
you guys think about it
so let me know
like I said in the very beginning of the
video not only am I going to show you
guys a $650 entry-level system we're
gonna give you a bunch of different
options for making not only the system
better but also your entire gaming
environment and for the monitors we have
two really great 1920 by 1080 options
for you guys to choose from both of them
by aoc the first monitor up is the AOC
II 275 2 XI which is a 27-inch monitor
it's backlit with 2 milliseconds
response time VGA and 2 HDMI ports it
also features an earphone audio port and
it's a 1920 by 1080 resolution now
that's the entry-level option for $1000
complete desktop but if you're looking
for something even better let's check
out the free sync 1 the AOC G 24 60 PF
is a 24-inch free sync gaming LED
monitor which features full HD 1920 by
1080 resolution and 144 Hertz and a 1
millisecond response time this monitor
is wall mountable and it also contains
speakers so you don't have to buy an
additional speakers for your desktop
have you guys ever seen both a gaming
keyboard and mouse for under 25 bucks
let's check this one out from
Coolermaster it's very affordable I'm
talking about the Coolermaster
Devastator this is an LED gaming
keyboard and mouse it's the blue Edition
and like I said this thing is only 24
bucks really really cheap now that's the
very affordable entry-level way if you
want to have everything near system
monitor keyboard mouse and everything
under $1000 but now let's check out some
other products for the uber gamer the
street features 100% Cherry MX key
switches has gold contacts and is a
really awesome mechanical gaming
keyboard that delivers the ultimate
competitive advantage and for those of
you who even want the uber gaming mouse
how about the Corsair gaming m65 RGB FPS
pc gaming laser mouse in black now this
thing is a little bit under 100 bucks
but this is a totally programmable Mouse
that has three zones 16.8 million color
backlighting variations and just a whole
lot of features including 8200 dpi and a
laser sensor so if you're looking for
like a really super mouse the m65 just
maybe you're a ticket so that's the
build now let's rock out to the
benchmark song and
check out how this system performs
it's alright there you have it folks the
Icarus 650 on its own is an entry-level
$650 system or a bunch of different
options for your boot drive your video
card your monitors everything you want
for a complete desktop build right
around $1000 now if you're a person out
there you've never had a computer ever
before you might not have the Windows OS
there would be an extra hundred bucks
but I think that a lot of people out
there have it and if not you really know
where to get it for cheap you know what
I mean so like usual all the pricing
availability for all these parts will be
down there blue like button hopefully
you'll go Chuck Norris tile in a thing
you like this style of video like always
I want to hear you guys comments on
everything that we've talked about and
like I said if you're into using Amazon
and you like Amazon smile make sure you
guys download that app and check it out
