we're checking out something from Acer
the x34 curved IPS monitor let's go
the x34 predator features a curved
widescreen IPS panel this monitor
features a resolution of 34 40 by 1440
with an aspect ratio of 21 to 9 the
panel also features 178 degree viewing
angle and a 4 millisecond response time
the contrast ratio is a thousand 1 and
the brightness is 300 CD out of the box
the x34 only has a 60 Hertz refresh rate
so if you go in you plug the monitor in
and you go in your Nvidia control panel
and you're going to see that it only
does 60 Hertz well this can be changed
though by simply using the OSD on the
front of the monitor these controls are
very easy to use and inside there you
can go in there and overclock it to 75
or a hundred Hertz restart the monitor
and then you're up and going and you can
change it in the control panel to match
that setting the x34 printer also
features G sync technology which
eliminates any screen tearing during
gameplay
oh damn
some other cool features of the x34 arts
tilt abilities which can flex from five
to 35 degrees and a - just Minh of up to
130 millimetres as we flip around to the
back of the predator you guys can see
that there is a single HDMI port a
single display board there's also four
USB 3.0 connectors and I know you guys
can't see them but there's also two 7
watt stereo speakers
now these speakers may not be the most
absolute best sounding speakers in the
world but for gaming they are very very
adequate and if you're wondering how you
control the volume it's also in that
on-screen display located down there on
the front of the monitor so you just
click in there and there's all kinds of
different options you guys can see you
can change many of the things in here to
fine tune your monitor to suit your
needs a large concern that people have
about IPS backlit monitors is the fact
that some of that light bleeds through
and makes the screen very awkward to see
now the one that I got is absolutely
wonderful you guys can clearly see that
there's hardly any back bleed at all and
for me this IPS panel is really nice and
easy to look at IPS panels are also
notoriously known to not have complete
even colors across the entire monitor so
they're gonna be some places on the
monitor it's going to have brighter
places some place they're going to be
darker but overall when you're gaming on
it you really won't notice this
whatsoever now as far as productivity
goes if you're just doing light stuff
you're going to be okay if you're
looking to do really absolute Pro stuff
I don't know if that's actually going to
be the best on this type of monitor but
for middle-end and kind of easy
productivity the monitor works
absolutely fine if you're really looking
for something that you want to use with
like Photoshop and something that's Pro
End you might want to look for a
different type of monitor but for gaming
and light stuff this monitor is very
well put together and like I said
earlier it features G sync technology
now G sync technology is different than
motion blur and I see comments all over
the internet about this motion blur
technology is one technology G sync
technology is another but if you're
using the GC technology you really don't
have to worry about using motion blur
you can be saying hey you know disable
this and enable motion blur
need to when you're inside the game when
you set up the gsync and everything's
locked in you're getting the absolute
best gaming experience that you can get
your frames are all locked in everything
looks nice and like I said this monitor
over clocks to a hundred Hertz so that's
really incredible stuff when I was
looking at it 60 Hertz I could honestly
see the monitor like looking kind of
weird I first changed the 75 it looked
really good and I was like hey okay
let's change it all the way to a hundred
and you can really see the difference
big-time I can't with my eyes I honestly
in the old days I would have said hey no
way you know you can't see it but I can
see the difference between sixty and
seventy five Hertz there's an amazing
difference and from 75 to 100 it's even
better so these features are really good
about this monitor
since the x34 predator has a resolution
of 34 40 by 1440 that means you have
lots of desktop real estate you can help
multiple windows at a time
you can have up to three actually this
monitor and be looking and using those
all at the same time the text is very
clear
the monitors brightness everything like
I said it can be changing you through
the Nvidia control panel or through the
front OSD panel on the x34 predator now
for gaming though this is where this
monitor really really shines now the Z
35 that was a really nice monitor but I
gotta say the X 34 I don't know for
doing multiple things it's just a little
bit better so all in all at the end of
the day you guys can see that for gaming
this monitor is a really great monitor
the Z 35 it's a really nice monitor but
a lot of you guys out there said that
you guys did not feel that that
resolution was any good you guys are
like 1080p 21:9 it sucks but honestly in
game it really doesn't matter that much
this monitor though I got to say that
for overall working and playing games
it's just a little bit better if I was
strictly doing only gaming alone I
didn't care about anything whatsoever I
don't know the Z 35 is really nice that
screen is nice but hey x34 it's been
voted by almost every youtuber out there
as being the best gaming monitor that
they've ever seen
Paul's hardware said that Linus said
that many others have said that honestly
I can say it to this modern me I do like
just a wee bit better than the Z 35 I'm
Elric you guys been watching tikka
