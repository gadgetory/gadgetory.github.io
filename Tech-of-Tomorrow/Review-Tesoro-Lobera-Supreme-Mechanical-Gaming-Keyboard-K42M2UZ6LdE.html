tomorrow we're taking a break from
gaming again to bring you guys another
accessory review this time a keyboard
the libera supreme illuminated gaming
keyboard from Tesoro now for those you
guys that haven't heard of Tesoro
there's still a pretty relatively young
company as far as gaming accessories go
they've only been around since 2011 so
only about three years old and they're
based in the US and it's a bunch of
gaming enthusiasts that want to make
gaming accessories for avid PC gamers so
we're gonna take a look at their latest
keyboard the Loeb era and take a look at
how it performs how it looks and
basically just let you know whether or
not it's worth your dollar so let's
check it out today on tech of tomorrow
so this is the libera supreme for those
you curious about the name most
accessory companies have a habit of
using a theme for naming their devices
and tessaro's approach with their
keyboards is to name them all after
legendary swords in this case it's the
libera aka the wolf Slayer which was
wielded by saint ferdinand the third of
castile in the early 13th century so now
that we've had your little history
lesson out of the way let's talk about
the actual libera keyboard before we get
nolan nitty-gritty performance stuff
let's talk aesthetics the libera supreme
is a mid-sized keyboard with a
relatively simple and straightforward
design as far as gaming keyboards go
with the obvious exception of the fact
that it does have illuminated keys which
personally I really prefer I don't need
a keyboard to be flashy I just need it
to perform despite its relatively
compact size the libera is a
surprisingly hefty and solidly built
feeling keyboard you'll notice that on
the bottom it has legs that are just for
three separate Heights and the legs
themselves are rubber-coated instead of
just plain plastic so it's gonna hold
its ground a lot better in your desktop
not easily shift around so much as far
as the illumination options go there's a
large variety of colors to choose from
using the RGB scale it's not in the
millions but it covers all the important
bases that you'll actually need you can
even adjust multiple lighting settings
like having it pulsate or only light up
those keys most traditionally associated
with gaming like WASD and the number
keys the only aspect that bothers me a
little bit are the side lights which on
their own do look great but they always
add a violet of hue to things so you
won't notice it very much with red or
violet lights but if you're going for
green or yellow or just plain white
you'll notice the sides take on a
different color something you may or may
not like personally it bothers me a
little bit now let's take a look at
performance now to begin with the Libero
supreme comes in four different switch
types so this isn't one of those
situations where they're all red or
they're all brown it's up to you and
your personal preference to choose
between red brown black and blue now for
those of you that don't know the
difference between switches here's just
a really basic rundown of them red
switches have the lowest resistance of
them and are really popular in a lot of
gaming keyboards because you can just
rapidly press different keys and they'll
all read Brown switches of the second
most common which offer a little more
resistance but also have a tactile
response so every time you press a key
you really feel it now black and blue
switches are less commonly seen in
gaming keyboards and more popular
amongst typists but they still see some
use black switches are for the
resistance of the whole group so you
really have to press down for every key
press
whereas blue switches are still a
mid-ground kind of like the brown
switches but they also add on this
really loud clickety clack sound
whenever you press something which I
personally really like it's a good
midway between typing and gaming and I
like the sound that it makes but if you
have any roommates family members or
coworkers they might go a little insane
from all the noise now it's worth noting
that even though it uses the same
colored designations the libera supreme
does not use the industry standard
Cherry MX switches but rather another
brand that in all honesty I can barely
tell the difference from every now and
then I might notice that it feels a
little more resistant but never enough
to really impact my sense of control now
as far as special features go the Libero
covers a lot of the popular basics we
see in a lot of gaming keyboards the f1
through F 6 keys also act as media
control options you can switch between 6
key and n key rollover and the keyboard
has built-in pass throughs to hook up to
more USB powered devices an audio jack
and mic input and even a DC injected
charge or power some other devices and
the keyboard does include a USB 2 DC
cable to open up some more options for
that the Libero also has three
customizable macro buttons located right
below the spacebar at the bottom of the
keyboard now three macro buttons is a
little low compared to some of the
competing gaming keyboards out there but
with the ability to quickly choose
between five different gaming profiles
using the FA through f12 keys you really
have up to 15 different macro keys to
program which is more than enough for
most gamers now you can program these
macros one of two ways you can either go
the long traditional route of using the
Libero software and take time setting
them up and programming them or you can
use the keyboards instant record option
by hitting this little hidden record
button on the upper right side of the
keyboard blending in with the caps lock
light and others as well as another
slightly hidden switch that turns on and
off gaming mode recording with the
instant record button is a lot easier
and honestly much more preferable over
using Lovera software which is really my
biggest complaint regarding this
keyboard the libera interface is just
not that user-friendly and not very well
explained in fact I hadn't even took me
a long time to really figure out how to
change the color on my keyboard because
there is no color button or a button
that shows the current color I'm using
it's instead this random little silver
triangle without any explanation so I
just really feel like Liberec could have
done a better job making it much more
user-friendly
now one last important thing to cover
about
how this keyboard performs is that it is
a true anti-ghosting keyboard some
keyboards will say their anti-ghosting
but it's only that it covers certain
specific really common button
combinations whereas this one if you
have the N key rollover activated you
could fall asleep at your computer land
your face right on the keyboard and it
will read every single input which is
really important when you're playing
some games you have to try and do ten
different things at once so overall I
really like the Libero supreme gaming
keyboard the software interface could be
better and I am still a little bothered
by those side lights being a different
color but outside of that everything
else is solid at a common price tag of
130 $9.99 this is a great option for
those of you that want an RGB keyboard
with a large variety of colors not to
mention stable performance useful
features your choice of switch
preference or just a keyboard that just
looks great I really recommend it well
that was our review of the little bear a
