tomorrow we're taking a break from
gaming again to bring you guys another
accessory review this time a keyboard
the libera supreme illuminated gaming
keyboard from tesoro now for those you
guys that haven't heard of tesoro
there's still a pretty relatively young
company as far as gaming accessories go
they've only been around since 2011's
only about three years old and they're
based in the US and it's a bunch of
gaming enthusiasts that want to make
gaming accessories for avid pc gamers so
we're going to take a look at their
latest keyboard the la barra and take a
look at how it performs how it looks and
basically just let you know whether or
not it's worth your dollar so let's
check it out today on tech of tomorrow
so this is the libera supreme for those
you curious about the name most
accessory companies have a habit of
using a theme for naming their devices
and tesoros approach with their
keyboards is to name them all after
legendary swords in this case it's the
la barra aka the Wolf's Lair which was
wielded by saint ferdinand the third of
Castile in the early 13th century so now
that we've had your little history
lesson out of the way let's talk about
the actual Liberec keyboard before we
get nolan nitty gritty performance stuff
let's talk aesthetics the lobero supreme
is a mid-sized keyboard with a
relatively simple and straightforward
design as far as gaming keyboards go
with the obvious exception of the fact
that does have illuminated keys which
personally I really prefer I don't need
a keyboard to be flashy I just need it
to perform despite its relatively
compact size the libera is a
surprisingly hefty and solidly built
feeling keyboard you'll notice that on
the bottom it has legs that are just for
three separate Heights and the legs
themselves are rubber-coated instead of
just playing plastic so it's going to
hold its ground a lot better in your
desktop not easily shift around so much
as far as the illumination options go
there's a large variety of colors to
choose from using the RGB scale it's not
in the millions but it covers all the
important basis that you'll actually
need you can even adjust multiple
lighting settings like having it pulsate
only light up those keys most
traditionally associated with gaming
like WASD and the number keys the only
aspect that bothers me a little bit are
the side lights which on their own do
look great but they always add a violent
issue two things so you won't notice it
very much with red or violet lights but
if you're going for green or yellow or
just plain white you'll notice the sides
take on a different color something you
may or may not like personally it
bothers me a little bit now let's take a
look at performance now to begin with
the Libero supreme comes in four
different switch types so this isn't one
of those situations where they're all
red or they're all brown it's up to you
and your personal preference to choose
between red brown black and blue now for
those of you that don't know the
difference between switches here's just
a really basic rundown of them red
switches have the lowest resistance of
them and are really popular in a lot of
gaming keyboards because you can just
rapidly press different keys and they'll
all read brown switches of the second
most common which offer a little more
resistance but also have a tactile
response so every time you press a key
you really feel it now black and blue
switches are less commonly seen in
gaming keyboards and more popular monks
typists but they still see some use
black switches are for the high
resistance of the whole group so you
really have to press down for every key
press whereas blue switches are still a
mid ground kind of like the brown
switches but they also add on this
really loud clickety clack sound
whenever you press something which I
personally really like it's a good
midway between typing and gaming and I
like the sound that it makes but if you
have any roommates family members or
coworkers they might go a little insane
from all the noise now it's worth noting
that even though it uses the same colour
designations the lobero supreme does not
use the industry-standard cherry MX
switches but rather another brand that
in all honesty I can barely tell the
difference from every now and then I
might notice that it feels a little more
resistant but never enough to really
impact my sense of control now as far as
special features go the Liberec covers a
lot of the popular basics we see in a
lot of gaming keyboards the f1 through
f6 keys also act as media control
options you can switch between six key
and n key roll over and the keyboard has
built-in pass throughs to hook up two
more USB powered devices an audio jack
and mic input and even a DC injected
charge or power some other devices and
the keyboard does include a USB to DC
cable to open up some more options for
that libera also has three customizable
macro buttons located right below the
space bar at the bottom of the keyboard
now three macro buttons is a little low
compared to some of the competing gaming
keyboards out there but with the ability
to quickly choose between five different
gaming profiles using the f a through f
12 keys you really have up to 15
different macro keys to program which is
more than enough for most gamers now you
can program these macros one of two ways
you can either go the long traditional
route of using the lobero software and
take time setting them up and
programming them or you can use the
keyboards instant record option by
hitting this little hidden record button
on the upper right side of the keyboard
blending in with the caps lock light and
others as well as another slightly
hidden switch that turns on and off
gaming mode recording with the instant
record button is a lot easier and
honestly much more preferable over using
Lovera software which is really my
biggest complaint regarding this
keyboard the libera interface is just
not that user friendly and not very well
explained in fact I had even took me a
long time to really figure out how to
change the color on my keyboard because
there is no color button or a button
that shows the current color I'm using
its instead this random little silver
triangle without any explanation so I
just really feel like libera could have
done a better job making it much more
user-friendly now one last important
thing to cover about how this keyboard
performs
that it is a true anti-ghosting keyboard
some keyboards will say they're
anti-ghosting but it's only that it
covers certain specific really common
button combinations whereas this one if
you have the n key role over activated
you could fall asleep at your computer
land your face right on the keyboard and
it will read every single input which is
really important when you're playing
some games you have to try and do 10
different things at once so overall I
really like the libero supreme gaming
keyboard the software interface could be
better and I am still a little bothered
by those side lights being a different
color but outside of that everything
else is solid at a common price tag of
130 999 this is a great option for those
of you that want an RGB keyboard with a
large variety of colors not to mention
stable performance useful features your
choice of switch preference or just a
keyboard that just looks great I really
recommend it well that was our review of
