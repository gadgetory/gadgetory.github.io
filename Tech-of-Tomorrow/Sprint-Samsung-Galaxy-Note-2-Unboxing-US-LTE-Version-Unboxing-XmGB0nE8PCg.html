you guys have all waited for it now
today the US version comes out which is
available for Sprint and we're going to
do the unboxing and first look right now
so you guys get a general overall
feature about what this new phone is all
about so let's jump in
let's see some new features and what
this new Samsung is all about
we got it right here in front of me
Goodin go ahead and take it out of the
box now the first thing you're going to
notice right off the bat is the 5.5 inch
Super HD AMOLED screen this thing also
has a 1.6 gigahertz quad-core processor
it has a 8 megapixel rear camera and a
1.9 megapixel front camera also features
full HD video and one of the really cool
features about it is the new S Pen now
the new S Pen has lots of features that
you can use you can use it to operate
and navigate throughout your unit you
can use it to capture and and do screen
stuff like you can write a note Circle
it save it all kinds of stuff so this is
the phone itself let's also take a look
at what comes in the box itself beyond
just the phone throught the back we've
got our get started guide we've got it
also in Spanish vamos then we've got
this one right here now some of the big
difference between this one and the
European version is this one has LTE and
that one did not here go the headphones
they're very nice they have nice soft
little earpieces to go inside your ears
to be comfortable and they also have
switchable and removable pieces for the
size of your ear as well we've also got
all of the charging accessories
everything is all here that you need
including your wall socket and
everything else so basically everything
you need to go going is all right here
in the box
now this phone's going to be coming to
market at about 299 dollars if you have
a contract you'll be able to get it
without a contract depending on where
you're going and that's really about it
I just got this phone just a few minutes
ago so I'm just really learning all
about it but I'll have the full review
for you guys later and later on tonight
