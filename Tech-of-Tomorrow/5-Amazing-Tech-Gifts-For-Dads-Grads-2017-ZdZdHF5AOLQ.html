vision TV the way it was meant to be
seen now for that special dad or grad in
your life this is a very cool product
this is the core effects immersive
gaming best you can see it looks pretty
damn cool looks almost like a
bulletproof vest but kids please don't
try that at home
thing is takes batteries you guys can
see right here instead of having bullets
right here it's got batteries and what
it is it's basically a vest that works
with that haptic feedback stuff so
whenever you're in a game you're getting
shot doing a lot of stuff it basically
gives you vibrations and stuff and now
even though obviously this technology
you know isn't like the latest you know
invention of like inventing rocket
science it's still pretty cool I mean
instead of having a little game control
when you're handling mean buzzbuzz
buzzbuzz
whenever you get shot this thing sends
out a little little rumble so it's like
boom BAM boom boom and like I said even
though it may not be a rocket science
technology it's actually really fun and
it's pretty cool when you're gaming that
have that effect especially in GTA 5 so
with that said though let me put on the
vest and then let's check it out for a
second well Batman
he's got Alfred I get mr. G the Karen
been my assistant to help put on the
vest but I got to tell you this thing
rumbling on my chest even in the entry
screen to GTA 5 and it just feels shit
because it's like right by your heart
all that area so like I can't wait to
get in Doolittle gaming so let's get
this thing on all right come on Alfred
oh I mean mr. G hook the wheel hook the
hat take that stuff and by the way the
haptic vest can be done completely
Wireless by six battery six double-a
batteries the unit that's back over here
behind me that's how it connects and you
know make this handshakes you feel
everything but doesn't have to be
plugged in you can use the USB or the
batteries so one more little hook up
strap right here I feel like I'm going
to battle like a mote Roman soldier
putting on my vest getting ready to go
which to do hole with a barbarian of the
north all right then so give me a
secondary let me get in game
check it dude have you done this before
whoa saho did you get that in film oh
that was awesome I got random by going
up the hill alright so the thing I
really dig about this is that you can
totally feel the engine revving right by
your heart and everything
try not run the cops the faster the
engine goes the faster you can feel the
beat on your chest and is this totally
cool oh where am I going alright so I
finally outrun those pesky coppers and I
got just tell you guys gaming
with this best even though it might be a
little bit gimmicky is really fun it's
like under 150 bucks right now and if
you have a dad who's totally into gaming
and loves this kind of stuff I mean the
old days of having the feedback in your
little game pad thing that was cool but
now you can actually have both because
they'll both work together so if you get
an Xbox controller you can hook it up
right up to the computer play with it
and have this as well and I just got to
tell you it's pretty cool because as the
engine revs and the action is pounding
you can just feel it all inside your you
know inside your best right here you buy
your art so I got to say it's pretty fun
but let's move on to the next thing
because I get to go kill me some more
cups my Father's Day gift this year from
Dolby is totally sick I was so lucky
that they sent me a Vizio 55-inch M
series TV that has Dolby vision built
inside of it
Dolby vision features the latest
advancements in HDR technology and high
dynamic range TVs look the absolute best
and with Dolby vision you get the
absolute brightest colors the sharpest
contrast and the deepest darkest black
sis you can get on any viewing
experience in fact with Dolby vision you
can see things you've never seen before
on a TV and what's best of all there is
tons of content out there that you can
stream a featuring dolby vision
currently Hulu Vudu and Netflix all have
hundreds of different movies and TV
titles that you can stream directly to
your TV with Dolby vision dolby vision
is currently available on selected TV
brands and to find out more information
about dolby vision please check
- link down below personally I find this
next little product to be really really
cool
you need somebody to watch your back
Riley's your man dad with the new baby
Riley's your man somebody to watch your
pets while you're not around
Riley's your man want to talk to a
family member in another room Riley is
your man now do all pets like Riley and
Buddy wasn't very impressed at all with
mr. Riley but Riley security robot is a
pretty cool little thing now
Riley has a lot of little features I
think you're going to like like I said
if you're not around it's your house or
anywhere else Riley works either off the
Android app or it works off you know the
Apple stuff whatever those Apple guys
are doing you know and whatever you know
what I'm talking about kids run iOS but
this thing can be controlled from your
phone and it can be done
totally remotely like let's just say
this you're a dad you rat a night with
your wife girlfriend lover you guys know
what I mean
and you want to just check out your kids
at home well you could obviously set
Riley up in the kids room and let the
kids know that Riley will be there
watching over them like a babysitter and
you could monitor everything they're
doing through Riley at night if you want
a certain part of your house as you feel
is like the part where somebody's coming
in you can actually set it up by there
and if it gets any type of movement or
anything else
Riley water detect it and lets you know
so Riley does work there's little
security robot the only thing I think
that could have been way cooler is if
you could set it up to roam around the
house unfortunately all the driving and
all that stuff has to be done manually
but like I said you can talk to a family
member right through Riley communication
system so you could be downstairs and
you can have your old family member you
know your mom or somebody or you could
be a guy in a dorm was just trying to
talk to one of his cool buds and you
know you guys can be chatting everything
right to Rye and the phone and what's
cool is when Riley starts to run low on
battery
he'll automatically back to his little
charger it'll spin around and Riley go
back in there just like this little
robot you see in Tron and charge his
little self up at the end of the day I
got to say this thing this product I
mean Riley the security robot I think is
a really cool thing let me know what you
guys think down below
but I think any dad or grad would
totally dig to have the Riley for their
gift now most the dads and grads that I
would happen to know are probably all
Android type people but for those who
travel to the dark side and use those
Apple products these go to cool
headphones just might be the product for
them because they're actually very very
nice sounding they connect by a
lightning port so that obviously you
know made for Apple type devices you
know iPhones iPads I this I that but the
thing is they're about fifty dollars and
they really are very nice sounding they
have a great control units you can
answer your phone and do all that stuff
what I have to worry about it being
Wireless so if you want those people who
likes efficiency more than the
convenience of wireless and the doto
pools are actually a really nice product
because when you're using them you're
out working out or doing anything like
that you can easily answer your phone
it's simple and easy to change through
your music and all that stuff because
all the controls like I said are located
in this little bar and you guys can see
the buttons anything in this little bar
easily have to see an easing up to
control so it doesn't make them unuse
they're friendly they're very ergonomic
in fact so if you're on the go you're
working out you're doing that kind of
stuff and also I need to answer your
phone so if you got to freak out and go
hey where is it but now do I do it you
can simply do it to the doto cool
control bar so total cool headphones or
Apple Wi-Fi certified they fit very
easily inside your ear and they're also
very comfortable for hours of use the
dodo pools also have a pretty decent mic
inside and everybody that I've talked to
using them said they can hear me pretty
clearly so if you have to know one of
those dark side dad's or Brad's who just
wants to replace you the headphones that
they already have with a wry device or
they just want something cool to have
that sounds a little bit better this
might just be the a ticket for their dad
or grad gift this little device I have
in my hand is called the NARR box now if
you know a person who's constantly on
the go and they always have taking all
kinds of videos and everything to their
phone or to their camera and they're
having problems editing it the NARR box
just might be the golden device that
they're going to absolutely absolutely
I'm seriously loved some people I've
heard swear on this device and it's like
totally crazy about it and I got to say
for me if you're someone who's out there
who travels a lot you don't want to
cater right
giant laptop with you to edit and stuff
you can do a lot of different editing
features on the NARR box and you can
pretty much do it anywhere you can do it
on top of a mountain at the beach by a
stream and that's the beauty of it
because it works off an app that you can
use on your phone in conjunction with
the NARR box and do all of your editing
on the go the NARR box is really simple
to use all you have to do is plug in
your cameras cards with SD micro SD and
USB 3.0 you can backup any of your cards
to the gnar box or you can use a hard
drive or SSD next up connect the gnar
box to your Wi-Fi the gnar box use a 2.4
gigahertz 802 11 and wireless signal to
give you powerless streaming up to 40
feet away from your device next up you
open the app with the free apps in both
Google Play in the app store you can
download new updates as new features and
find all the tools you need to back up
edit and share your content from
anywhere the key features in our box are
you can edit 4k video manager all photos
backup at 4 gigabytes a minute it's also
rugged and compact so it won't get broke
even if you're out in the go it's
perfect for travel it works with both
Android and iOS it features a quad-core
CPU 2 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes
of flash storage and best of all the
gnar box is extremely extremely light so
it will fit easily into your backpack
easily into someone's purse it's totally
totally rugged like I said I mean these
things built like a freaking tank you
provide to smash the holy crap out of it
to be able to destroy it and it totally
doesn't replace your laptop I know that
there are more features you can do on a
laptop but for $300 and the portability
I feel the gnar box is a really kind of
really revolutionary product except all
kinds of different media into it you can
do your editing right through your phone
and like I said if you're on top of the
mountain you don't really want to be
carrying a giant backpack all the way to
the top Mountain do you you want to be
able to climb to the top of that
mountain its peak do all your filming
edit it and put it up online for your
phone so you're good to go wherever you
go and i think that's the absolute best
thing about the gnar box now although
this might look like the big brother to
you know this particular violin it's
actually the xeon smooth q3 access
stabilizing gym
that's right and it's pretty cool so if
you know somebody out there as a phone
if there's a lot of filming with stuff
and doesn't like the way it feels just
you know having the camera in their hand
all the time this is actually something
really cool inside the box you get the
gimbal the carrying case a nice strap
for carrying everything around the micro
USB charging cable the gimbal may look
simple but it's really much more than
that there is an external access to
balance the gimbal by one-step freely
switch to your phone between standard
and vertical shooting smooth cue also
has buttons to photo record zoom in and
out get rear camera selfie mode you can
also do all your transferring to a
button as well it has an updated app
that supports auto tracking time-lapse
and filter options the smooth cue also
has controls for pan roll and tilt and
they're all very ergonomic and operated
by these little buttons right here on
the handle and if you want to use a
smooth cube for many hours you can get
up to eight hours of use before you need
to recharge the device so if you have to
know one of those dad or grad use a
total film buff and use their camera for
almost everything this nuke you may just
be the device that changes their life
forever art everybody so there you have
it some really cool gift ideas for those
dads and grads out there and once again
before we bounce out of here a special
thanks once again to dolby vision for
making today's video possible i think
that all these devices have merit I know
the video seems a little bit salesy I
know but hey I'm trying to make
something for Father's Day gift so it's
got to be a little bit sales here it
wouldn't be a video about buying
Father's Day and grab gifts right so if
you apologize but offend you but that's
just the way things rolled around this
time so everything that we've done this
video will be down the bullet like
button please let me know what you liked
what you disliked about the video I
always want to hear your guys's comment
so if you guys want to check out one of
these gifts or check out even more
different things check out that link
down there and you guys can check this
stuff out for yourself like I said I
really feel the gnar box is a cool
product if you don't want to carry stuff
all the way around with you and that
kind of goes kind of also hand-in-hand
with the smoothie cube because if you're
up filming stuff on top of mountain have
this smooth too and all that stuff is
really cool because you can use your
phone for getting a lot of different
stuff capturing that stuff and using
that gimbal to balance everything out
and make everything look nice and with
the gnar boxing combination you can edit
that stuff wherever you
go obviously everybody will totally dig
Dolby vision on a TV so if you want to
check that stuff out like I said head on
down to your local electronics store and
compare it to other TVs and you will see
that there are TVs out there that are
much more expensive that don't contain
that dolby vision that aren't as
nice-looking what so ever and come on
Riley the robot come on he's a cool
little guy he's interesting and he's fun
to interact with the family and do all
that stuff at the end of the day so you
guys like the stuff hey check it out for
yourself give me some ideas for yourself
because you guys know I love you and I
always want to hear your input peace out
we'll see you guys here for normal tech
