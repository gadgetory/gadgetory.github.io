tech of tomorrow I'm Eric your host and
today we've got an unboxing and first
look of something really cool from the
people over at SteelSeries this is their
apex gaming keyboard now this thing has
a lot of cool features that are all
geared for the gamer you can do over
one-trillion possible color variations
that you can custom light so with that
said though let's jump in talk about a
little bit more about it and see what
actually comes in the box of the apex by
SteelSeries
all right folks so check it out here's
the box the SteelSeries apex gaming
keyboards now remember I said before
they have five lighted areas they call
their active zone illumination and you
can see here they have one two three
four five areas I mean for me I would
consider this all one area but I'm
thinking they're considering that the
fifth area SteelSeries engine that
allows you to program all your macros
and all that stuff and they actually
have raised macro keys which will show
you when we jump into it which allowed
you to jump back to the WASD Keys very
fast maybe in a dark room or something
that might help quite a bit you can do
over one-trillion possible color
variations and their active zone
illumination so I mean you guys can see
right here they show it one two three
four five areas ah so that's how they're
splitting it up so that's 1 2 3 4 and
then 5 so that makes sense then we'll
flip it around just show you guys the
back of the box they just show more
stuff about this I'm gonna go and pull
it out of the box and actually go over
more of the stuff with it this time and
actually plug it in but they have low
profile fast action keys choose from 16
million colors 88 more ways to when they
say thanks to 22 macro keys that each
feature up to four layers of
programmability Ray's macro keys so just
really cool stuff it's all geared
towards the gamer just from the side of
the box they just show some more stuff
and how cool licks lit up which we're
gonna actually see ourselves and with
that said I know you guys prefer to say
see things in action so let's create
some action go ahead and take the knife
here make a little quick little slice
here I'll set that off to the side
quit pop this out right here and that's
actually a pretty long keyboard box
inside the box we've got the keyboard
itself a lot of that long what else we
got in here
SteelSeries apex keyboard Quick Start
Guide little case logo badge right there
is there anything else in the box
folk-pop there's something in there what
do we got going on there all right ooh
all right some neat little rubber feet
that's why I think they are
let's let the Bucks off to the side and
then we'll go ahead and begin to go
ahead and pull the keyboard out sorry
about that folks
now I'll go ahead and just set the thing
down real quick and we can just kind of
go over it in fact you know what folks I
think I'll just go ahead and plug it in
so we've got it all plugged in you guys
can see it's lit up there's even an
underneath light right here and all of
these keys are programmable so you can
change them to different macros like I
said before the W you guys can see
there's two little dots right there I
mean how big of a thing that's gonna be
I don't know but they're saying that you
know if you're playing in sometimes in
this dark room you want to switch over
the keys you feel these little buttons
on there then you automatically know
you're back on your WASD thing you can
see there's a lot of room actually
between each key as well now they're
saying that it needs their SteelSeries
drivers and all that stuff it does not
come in the package so I'm taking it
that I'm gonna have to actually go onto
their website
download those type of drivers in order
to program everything up but this is
just the unboxing and first look I know
you guys are gonna want a full review so
I'll do all that and actually talked
about it so like I said before five
areas all different lighting across the
board clean their logo on the back of
the keyboard very simple you try to spin
it around you guys can see it two USB
2.0 ports so I mean that's pretty much
it now the thing is though if you're a
hardcore gamer and you want to have a
bunch of different macro programs each
one of these things has four layers so
for each game you can actually make it
custom and playable so for every game
that you go into you can have a custom
profile for what you're doing so there
you have it the apex gaming keyboard by
SteelSeries all kinds of really cool
stuff I mean if you guys are into custom
lighting all what you're gonna really
like this thing now it's not a
mechanical keyboard to membrane-based
keyboard but it's still really cool and
has lots of great features all that USB
custom lighting the way you can do all
the macros
I think mini gamers out there or looking
for something that's really easy to use
they can just jump right into this is
something you're gonna want to take a
look at now if you understood and
purchase things for yourself download or
blow the
like that much I know you're gonna hit
we'll be all that in the description
where you can buy it if you want to or
check it out or check out other things
about it it will all be down there if
you're not sub to TECA tomorrow make
sure you hit that sub button back there
and sub describe to the channel and
don't miss I don't mean to kill your
 going on here take it along see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
