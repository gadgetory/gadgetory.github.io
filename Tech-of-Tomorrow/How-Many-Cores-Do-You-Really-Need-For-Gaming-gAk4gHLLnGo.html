back once again to Tekken tomorrow I
work here glad to see you now lately
we've seen AMD release a whole bunch of
CPUs in fact they have an 800 X it has 8
cores 16 threads crazy ass CPU competes
pretty much almost like the i7 69 50
which is a great thing for AMD but my
biggest question about all this stuff is
is if you're a gamer and I mean strictly
a gamer you buy your system in you're a
gamer you don't do content creation
you're not doing streaming you're not
doing any of that stuff and you're
definitely not doing workstation stuff
for 3d modeling do any of those extra
cores do you one bit of good and how
many cores you actually need to play
games hmm hmm well I've been doing a lot
of research lately trying to check this
out and see you know where the actual
sweet spot is for cores and gaming and
what you actually need to be a
competitive gamer and I have to say that
you definitely do not need an i7 69 50
and you don't need an 1800 X all those
extra cores and stuff are really cool if
you actually have a program that takes
advantage of those things but at this
point in time there's no game on the
market that I could find that takes
advantage of eight cores and sixteen
threads
I couldn't even find a six core 12
threaded game at this point right now
the most you're going to be able to see
is 4 cores 8 threads with hyper
threading and that's pretty much the
sweet spot for gaming it doesn't really
matter whether you buy an AMD CPU or an
Intel CPU there's just no reason for all
those extra cores if you're just a gamer
and let's just face it gamers like their
game to look awesome so the best thing
that you can ever do is make sure that
you buy yourself a killer ass GPU and
save your money we've been doing a lot
of reviews and you guys can see from our
reviews of the 1600 x if you just
overclock it just a wee bit can totally
compete with the 1700 and 1800 X at a
much much lower price point let's just
face it the 1800 X is 500 freaking bucks
1600 X about 220 bucks big price
difference almost cut in half
and with the gaming numbers being so
damn close why would you pay twice as
much to only get a couple more frames
per second just have all these cores and
to brag about it
so let's touch upon that real quick of
course everybody says oh I like this
because it's future proof what future we
talking about man because honestly the
future is right now you're
living in the now you're testing things
in the now so what does it matter if
your CPU will be competitive more than
five years down the road because more
than five years down the road there's
going to be so many new CPU releases in
that time that these CPUs is all these
cores are just going to be like and it's
not going to mean jack in the end
and since many of you people don't even
use programs that access those cores
future-proof honestly to my book I mean
no offense to anybody out there is just
like words throw out there because it's
really not AMD obviously has come to
market once again with some new
technology and some killer stuff
just like they did when they released
the very first CPU that could support
64-bit windows ok that was
awesome cool but by the time that 64 bit
windows came out until already had a CPU
that beat that CPU across the board so
that's what I'm trying to say about
future proof is so you guys see the
trends in a year from now you're going
to look back and AMD is already going to
have new CPUs that are going to replace
those so you guys are going oh it's
totally future proof what's really not
they'll be new board chipsets they'll be
new technology and your so called you
know future proof CPU isn't really going
to mean anything in fact all of me is
that the few games that actually do all
of a sudden may take advantage of having
eight cores and 16 threads sure it'll
play them but is it going to play them
as well as the games that are coming out
now probably not to be truthful with you
from what I've seen if you have a
dual-core CPU and it has hyper-threading
you can pretty much play any game out
there and get great results now there
are a few games out there that are
starting to take advantage of those
multicores
so for me the sweet spot right now is
having a four core eight thread CPU
every game out there will be able to
play on this No
out there right now that I know of if
you guys do happen to know the game that
will take advantage of eight-six you
know all these extra cores please let me
know down below because I want to learn
as well but after going out and reading
a lot of articles and checking out what
people have to say around the world
pretty much having a dual core processor
with hyper threading will play all of
your games
there might be a few games where those
cores will you know pop in and help you
out but overall focus is going to do a
percentage the percentage of games right
now out there still only support greatly
two cores and hyper-threading obviously
the ones that do support more that's
going to be great but overall in the
giant big picture you just don't need it
so why waste your money buying all these
expensive CPUs with all of these cores
if you're a gamer save your money
get yourself a great GPU and CPU let it
be secondary because like I said man if
you can get ahold of yourself a nice
dual-core CPU that has hyper-threading
you're going to be ok obviously some of
the older you know CPUs that came out
there the 8350 and some of those they
bottleneck quite a bit in fact even the
i-5 and some stuff you're starting to
see it bottleneck but if you get some of
the latest CPUs you get an i7 7700 K or
anything like that you're going to be
playing games with absolutely no
problems whatsoever and in fact the 1600
X which I think right now is kind of a
sweet spot for all processors because of
what it's made out of and what it does
you can set yourself up with a be 350
motherboard cheap parts and have
yourself a great gaming system for a
very very low price so at the end of the
days how many cores you really need well
you definitely don't need six you don't
need a you don't need twelve you really
only need two with hyper-threading
having four is better but it's not the
breaking neck of anything whatsoever and
getting a cap of a few frames per second
big deal the name of the game is saving
money and getting the absolute best
performance you can get from that cash
hi my work thanks for putting up with me
we'll see you guys back on Tekken
tomorrow for more tech baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
