Monday morning I'm elric Ferris here
once again the teka tomorrow youtube
channel bringing you guys the unboxing
and first look at a brand new product
from the people over at coolermaster now
lots of people out there are always
looking for a high-end power supply for
their SLI crossfire or just their
standard system today we're going to be
taking a look at their new silent pro
platinum thousand watt power supply has
one hundred and thirty-five millimeter
fan it's got some good features it's
supposed to be modular were some really
cool cables so with that said let's jump
in and take the trusty knife which
flipped out that's when I meant to and
with that said let's take the trusty
knife and do the unboxing
alright folks so like usual you know
hope we got the box here so I'm gonna
take the trusty knife and just remove
some of this stuff here we go to rip it
off like a kid at Christmas time after
you get the initial rip what is it loop
it all off so we can see the box tell
you in boxing fans out there I'm gonna
like to looking at the box so we'll
start up at the front of the box we got
the cooler master silent pro platinum
thousand-watt you can see we got the 80
plus platinum over here it's the best
you can get five year warranty some
other details just flip it around to the
side right here this is probably going
to be one of the more important thing so
the Cameron zoom in here this tells you
the model number it's the RS dash a 0 0
SP PA you can see type is the Intel form
factor ATX 12 volt active PFC tells the
fan type again mean time between failure
100,000 hours all the different
protection modes that are involved in
the power supply the dimensions
ninety-two percent efficiency that'll be
in the back of the box here are the
connections you can see them right here
24 pin one cpu four plus four two PCIe
6-pin plus 2 pin there are six SATA 12 /
fuel four pins fluffy and finally a fan
cable three pins times too so flipping
around last leaf show you guys the very
back of the box here you see the fan
curve here's the efficiency curve
now we'll go ahead and we're getting to
remove out of the box pop the lens cap
here quit just take it out of the box
nice and simply like sooo take the box
and smack the camera over the head oh
yes you heard that huh he deserves it
don't ask me why there I know he's done
something I don't know / so let's figure
out this thing getting out of here so
nope not so there we go there's a piece
of rubber stuff right here which we will
watch the cameramen flip it around comes
you guys and see it wrap the bat we've
got a booklet with some stuff inside of
here it's the user's manual it shows
they have two models in the silent pro
Platinum Duke line which is the 550 wide
and a thousand-watt gives you
installation instructions stuff like
that important stuff go ahead and just
get that out of the way inside we've got
a bag of Seagram's 7 I mean I mean a
power supply looks like a bag of seagram
seven doesn't it go ahead and pop little
cap open here the nice a bag of tricks
here there we go handle didn't uh pop
whom so here's the bag you guys might be
able to use a further things you know
like put your magic tricks in there
you're golden they're tied to your waist
like you're some kind of funky
Renaissance man you know opinions vary
so will pop over here to the end these
are gonna obviously be all the cables
get this out
so here are the cables but first let's
actually look at the design of the power
supply so obviously as you guys know
it's going to be semi modular because
the power connections themselves are
inside the power supply so we'll start
off right there you guys can see there's
the 24 pin and the 24 pins that we
talked about before for the power
they're all right here things kind of
bundled up right there so unbundle it
for you folks try to get a better look
at it all right so there we go so now
that I've unbundle that we can actually
get these things up and take a better
look at everything so so let's begin
again with all the connections so these
are all the connections right here and
the first ones these are all the
different ones for your power here's a
24-pin as well so those are all going to
you know BB non-modular let me get those
out of the way we can take a look here
so here's the back of the power supply
now set it down so you guys can see it
everything's marked very clearly fan
controllers your pcie HUD say that
floppy tip around the side you guys can
see the nomenclature of the design then
I'm going to flip it around on this side
right here so that you guys can see the
back of the power supply here's the on
and off switch here's the power inside
you guys can see all the components you
can't see them totally clearly because
it's kind of thing on there but you guys
know what it is then here's one hundred
and thirty-five millimeter fan that we
spoke of earlier metal shield to keep
you from ever touching it probably you
should unless you get it on some kind of
open bench
the very back of the power supply once
you get it shows you the product number
so the camera will zoom in there you got
an see you give me 80 plus platinum all
right folks now we've seen the power
supply we've seen all that stuff let's
take a look at the additional cabling
that's going to come up like this little
blag right here so first off the bat we
have the power cable which we sell
assault the Cameron with and make him
hurt no we want that play hurt him keep
playing get some kind of internet lawyer
something yet I sue me so you hurt me
man it's all right here we go the ones
for your fan controllers right here so
these your fan control connections
screws to mount the power supply in and
then here goes this big bundle of cables
which after I take it apart won't be so
easy to put back together but what the
heck you folks want to see them so we'll
just start showing them to you or one at
a time so here we go these are the six
plus two said there were six of these so
here's one of the six two of the six
I don't think I need to show you every
single one of these folks you guys know
what there is I showed you how many
there was before everything will be
inside of the description so all you
gotta do is look at the link in
description below it will have all the
full details anyways but here are some
of the molex connectors now earlier when
they said that was the modular design
this is what I think is more important
we should talk about here to hear some
of the SATA ones you know but check it
out some people talk a lot of about
the flat cables some people really like
them some people say they're hard to use
it just depends on what you're doing
with it because the flat cables honestly
are made to sit in the back of your case
so if you don't have a lot of room back
there for cable management this actually
works very very well so so that's pretty
much it folks if you're a fan of
coolermaster you're going to really like
this power supply it has lots of
features that semi modular if you
looking for some it's fully modular
that's up to you you either going to
like or love the cables depending on the
type of build you're doing I prefer them
I think they're very easy to use like I
said before because when you're using
them in the back of a case and you're
looking for cable management having a
flat cable looks really cool and most
people these days do their own kind of
custom stuff anyways they like braid
them up their own way they cable them
their own way so there's all kinds of
custom things that people are going to
do anyways so that's it folks we'll see
you back here on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
