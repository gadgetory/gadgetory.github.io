tech land welcome back once again to
another edition to take a tomorrow where
we're taking a look today at the Asus
980ti Strix card now this thing has a
shitload of features comes overclocked
ran out of the box has its direct cu3
cooling and they even have this weird
thing called Auto Xtreme now which
basically automates their entire process
making it hands-off with humans that's
pretty impressive it uses all quality
parts so all these cards now basically
almost have no human involvement at all
it's all like robotic in the building
and that's actually pretty good and if
you guys have seen the back plates on
these cards they're really incredible
Before we jump in the features and all
that stuff let's real quick do what you
folks like to do let's take a look at
the box do the unboxing and then jump
into the meat and the potatoes is
everything else so right here obviously
here's the box I'm not gonna dwell on
the front of the back of it that much
you guys don't like that but obviously a
lot of the features I'm going to be
talking about are basically on the back
of this box all their stuff for tweaking
their GPU OneTouch overclocking all
kinds of stuff we'll get to that later
if it's on the back of the box so
nothing much more on the box beyond that
so let's go ahead I will pop the side of
it off right here pop this cap right
here open it up inside once again we see
the nice Strix nomenclature on the box
making sure you know what you're getting
okay and floor without hitting the
animals do you guys see on the floor all
the animals are down there surrounding
they all actually want their part in the
video but they're not the stars today no
the star is the Strix card so boxy we
got here box box box box box box box
inception box and box here we go
pop cap what do we got alright we got
this thing right here just more folded
stuff you like this one I thought the
cameramen missed him by that much I'll
try it better aim a next alright
once again more pocket foam oh yeah
right at you miss thing by that
no I'm just kidding all right inside of
here this will probably be all the
little accessories stuff you will pop
the cap here see what all comes in here
doo doo doo doo dah dah dah dah dah ho
he's bad everything else is that it
alright alright sorry dude that one got
him with hey what can I say alright so
basically here we go
get an extension cable dual molexes for
your power supply let's see here
these are a two six pins driver CD speed
setup unleash your gaming instincts by
the Strix gaming line now I don't you
guys know this but like Strix is an owl
right but actually Al's are mean sons of
bitches I thought okay Al they're like a
cool Bart would look them up no no no
these guys are predators owls or mean so
when they're calling this card the Strix
they're not trying to be saying anything
pretty they're trying to say this is one
tough mother oh you know what I'm saying
what's my name that's right all right
last but not least we get the little
Strix capable thing here that's the
contents and then we get to the card
itself boom ba boom now you guys can't
tilt the card to actually consists of
four separate pieces on the card for
complete separate pieces the top piece
this thing I hear is boom boom the top
piece features all of the Strix cooling
fans now these fans are all geared to be
zero noise that's right zero blad yeah
zero blade fan technology these things
are meant to ruin quiet and when this
thing actually runs in silent mode which
it does with some games like Starcraft
and others these things go completely
off people might be look at the car
going hey man my card it's broken the
fans aren't spinning but no that just
means that your cards running so cool
and so awesome that it doesn't even need
it so the first piece is this the fan
housing that has those three fans we
talked about then we see the heat fans
and the heat pipes then the PCB itself
and then the last piece is the rear
armor that protects the card against
static or their damage the direct cu3
cooling technology features two
exclusive 10 millimeter direct GPU
contact heat pipes that actually
transport 40 percent more heat
away from the GPU than standard heat
pipes so that's a really awesome feature
keeping the card cool is one of the main
things about this cooling and what helps
you in overclocking if you guys know
anything about the GPU boost the boost
works off how cool the card is the
cooler the card is the better the boost
is so this kind of cooling is going to
come in very handy in the overclocking
department and as we flip the card over
under one side we can clearly see once
again the Strix nomenclature which
actually lights up when the card is
running on another piece of the heat
pipe is sticking out right there as well
and here we also see the two eight pin
power connectors as I flip the card
around the back you can still see if the
heat fins that are part of the cooling
not much else there you can all see heat
pipe running around and as we flip it
around to the bottom of the card you
guys can still see some more of the heat
pipe technology you can also see where
the fans are plugged into the PCB itself
and as we finally put the card on to the
rear you guys can see on the bottom the
PCI insertion slot and then we flip the
card around just one more time we can
clearly see the very beautiful back of
the car which shows the Aizu Strix logo
the owl and this is actually one of the
most durable and nice things about the
card a lot of cards you can get
fingerprint damage on it by just
touching it and shocking it out or it
can be damaged by sending it down having
this excellent backplate to me is a
serious thumbs up on any video card in
aces they know how to do it right and
finally on the back of the card to wrap
it up there are two sli fingers this is
where you connect your sli connect home
we were very lucky that the people over
at the EVGA sena so they're really
awesome sli bridge for doing our next
system thank you very much jacob just
thought we'd put them in there real
quick once again back to the caramel
whoo
and oh you could hear that he got that
so pretty much folks this is what the
card looks like that's what comes in the
box let me touch over a few more
specific features that a Zeus has and
then let's jump in the test system and
the benchmarks another feature that
helps stability and the longevity of the
cards lifespan is a Zeus is 14 phase
super alloy power to super alloy power
to components greatly enhance efficiency
reduce power loss and provide two times
quieter electrical noise in standard
cards this allows the card to achieve
thermal levels that are 50 percent
cooler than previous generation cards
and another cool thing about asus is
auto extreme technology i talked about
in video what makes other cards
automated is actually uses 50% less
power than previously made cards so
that's a total win in the green factor
as well so people out there in the
environment that type of stuff hey this
is a solid green win for the people over
at a zoo so now is there's no automation
program make the cards much better you
know air free without humans involved it
also does it with 50% less power drain
so that's pretty awesome in itself from
an environmental standpoint that is
another feature of all the new Strix
cars are these three fans now these
offer a new wing blade design that's
totally patent by the people at over a
Zeus and offers a hundred and five
percent of static air pressure on the
card meaning that these fans are blowing
a lot of air against those heat pipes
and stuff to keep this card running cool
and like I said before in some games
like League of Legends and Starcraft
this card goes into complete silent mode
and these fans don't move at all so your
cards not broke it's just in silent mode
now last but not least in the card let's
flip the card around real quick let's
take a look at the rear i/o and on the
rear i/o we see a DVID connector three
display ports and a single HDMI
connector so you know this thing's got
enough connectivity to hook up to
multiple monitors and the gtx 980ti is
powerful enough to power up to three of
these things and still get decent
resolutions not at 4k mind you but pay
sacrifices must be made the Strix 980ti
has a power consumption of 375 watts and
will require that eight plus eight pin
power connector that came with the card
as far as dimensions go the card side is
in a 12 by 6 by 1.5 7 inches and for the
rest of the world thirty point five by
15 point 22 by three point nine eight
centimeters and for the overclocker you
get a sis's 1-click gaming booster and
there are three different ways that this
can be used there's the visual effects
mode which will boost your performance
by turning off windows and visual
effects there's a system services mode
which automatically or manually would
turn off windows services or processes
and finally memory defrag this will
rearrange and free up your system memory
for maximum gaming performance and it
will do so without shutting up any
ongoing processes and last up like all
Strix versions card this card has two
now you have the normal mode and the
normal mode runs the clock at 11:00 90s
at space clock and 1291 is a boost and
then you get the overclock mode in the
overclock mode offers a base clock of
1216 and an overclock boost of 13 17 and
the memories also overclocked to 7200
megahertz so basically everything's
overclocked about this car with that
said though let's real quick talk about
our test station I consider our test
system at this moment in time to be
pretty mid-level I know people are you
don't know it's high in but it's really
not there are many things below it and
many things above it so right now my
socket 1155 system has an i7 4770k it
slightly overclocked 16 gigabytes of
ddr3 memory we've got a 2 terabyte
Western Digital black hard drive and
that pretty much sums up that system so
without any further words let's rock out
to the benchmark and see how the Strix
does against the competition
all right folks so there you guys have
it
everything about the brand-new Asus 980
I Strix Edition card now this card even
overclocked as it is out of the box only
ran at seventy seven Celsius and that's
pretty good now previously the only car
we had in here they could actually beat
this thing and by a very small margin
was the zotac virgin and it actually ran
a little bit hotter about ten degrees
hotter under full load so that means
that this car right now has more
potential and more Headroom for doing
overclocking at that thing so think
about that even right now what it is out
of the box
you still have some moon because the car
can run obviously hotter because it did
of other cars and still perform even
better you get a lot of options with the
card you can sit up to exactly how do
you want to be you can set it up sort of
like runs like I said in its stock mode
you're not to overclock it at all and it
will last forever do you people have to
want to push the limits hey you get that
overclocking ability now this card's
gonna come to market about 670 dollars
you know it's up there with actually
this is you know probably the fastest
line of cards it's out there for single
GPU right there is right now so you get
the fastest at the risk and this card as
you guys can see it runs cool it
actually ran pretty quiet even the test
station we couldn't really hear it very
much so that's a good sign when you hear
the thing blowing in the background you
mean you're like wow it's that some kind
of like a lawnmower or something or wind
board you know you got problems I never
engage that at all with this and never
engage those type of levels so I think
that's a pretty solid deal obviously
it's a bit pricey but few folks out
there who want the best hey this is a
serious car to take a look at so hope
you guys like this video like user will
underneath that like button but you know
hopefully you guys know what to do by
this time we'll be all the information
you want to purchase one of these just
get more information we'll have a link
to their website and where you can
purchase one for yourself I'm Eric
thanks for watching deca tomorrow we'll
see you guys back here for more tech and
just let you know I know my videos have
slowed down just ever so slightly the
reason being is I've had to
health issues and I'm right in the
middle of trying to move and uh I'm not
trying to publicize it like others do go
oh my god I'm moving let's make a bunch
of videos but this shit's happening so
we'll see you guys later and uh pretty
soon you're gonna see me new location I
think I got like 60 days left</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
