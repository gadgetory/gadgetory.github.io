here once again at echo tomorrow youtube
channel bringing you guys another cool
unboxing and first look of a really cool
new product plus just to give you guys a
little bit of update because you guys
have made some concepts uploading videos
we're right now really working on
getting our website up and going so that
we can have a full-on full-blown website
to bring you guys even more product
reviews videos are cool but a lot of
people still like the old-school
traditional review that said with love
we're going to bring you our tech of
tomorrow website now today we've got a
really cool unboxing of something from
thermaltake inner ear headphones are a
very popular item people like them all
the way across the board these ones
actually work with your iPhone and with
any of those little portable devices you
got so they're pretty cool these are the
inner ear headphones I think they
pronounce these is souris these are
really cool they're coming to a market
at about between 39 and $49 be depending
on where you buy them but a level a lot
somebody mess with my words there you
guys know that but anyways right now
we're going to take a look what comes
inside the box here's the front of the
box and then here's the back of the box
it's exciting isn't it black box so slim
so trim so in shape this box must have
worked out alright anyways can I pop the
cap oh alright i guess about this inside
there get a little inside here too so
see how this thing's going to open oh
alright this is going to be kind of
interesting guys check this out Cameron
I want a little close upon this thing
doesn't be the first d burgeoning we've
done here on this one you guys ready
here we go we've diversion dit oh my god
we are now opening the box taking away
those boxes pristine virginity and in
essence to give you guys an unboxing see
what we do here oh it actually requires
two sides of stripping so I stripped one
let me try to get the other one this one
is not being as cooperative but alright
Oh another rip all right so it's simple
that just pops open like that so we can
see where the inside there you guys see
rob the bat comes the cool little
carrying case actually the headphones
are kind of already somewhat in this
little k
so let me go and unzip this thing so you
can see everything comes inside of here
there's actually inside here's some
extra little earbuds to you can see
these right here they've got some foam
extra little earbuds right here I'm just
going to set those down there there so
basically there's also another plug
inside of here turn adapter an extension
depending how you want to use it that's
there then you've got the nice case it
feels really nice to it feels like it's
made of pretty quality stuff get rid of
the trash up to the trash and then we'll
pull the headphones out themselves let's
see your else we got in here I guess
there's a little Pulis at the bottom
here there's a little TT sports thing
right here probably tells you all the
rest their products and then we've got
the headphones themselves and you pull
those out of here now those people who
are fans of AMD are probably really
going to like these because these are
pretty much in the AMD color scheme look
at these out here show these to you
right now they have some little rubber
ear foam pads on them let me go ahead
just put these in my ears not too bad
these wouldn't seem to be a little bit
ok there's how they go so sorry I had
been the wrong way the first time so you
can't head bang em so those guys are
going to a heavy metal concert you won't
be able to use these because if you know
if you raise your fist in the air and
headbang they fail the head-banging test
but they work pretty good and they're
pretty comfortable so basically this is
everything that comes in the box me grab
the box this has been the unboxing of
the new thermaltake is souris inner ear
headphones thanks for watching our tech
tomorrow youtube channel and we hope to
see you guys back here really soon on
tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
