we're gonna be checking out one of the
cases from the carbide Series from
Corsair this is the spec Omega RGB now
we've already reviewed the spec Omega
but this is a speckle make up RGB that's
right which means you know guess what it
has to RGB fans in it and the price
difference between the two is about
fifty dollars but if you buy the fans by
themselves they're about $60 so buying
it all on the unit itself is saving you
about ten dollars roughly which is still
pretty cool it's not like some grand
thing but you're still saving money now
this case is pretty cool-looking
the only real caveat that I have against
it at all is if they claim that the
airflow coming for the case is like
perfectly grand well the front panel is
non removable so there is going to be
some type of airflow restriction now how
bad that's actually going to be it's
probably not going to be that bad but if
the airflow is coming directly through
the entire case I think that would be
just a little bit better now this
particular version also has a tempered
glass window so the case is made of
steel and tempered glass it fits any
motherboard up to midday TXI so if you
don't really worry about what
motherboards are gonna fit if you're
trying to get some of those extended ATX
motherboards and stuff like that you
might want to choose a bigger case but
for most builds this should be pretty
cool and as far as the case expansion
slots you get seven you can fit a 370
millimeter length video card you have a
hundred and eighty millimeters as far as
your power supply goes and from your
motherboard to the window you get 170
millimeters of space which means you can
pretty much put any of the liquid
coolers from Corsair and their or
aftermarket stuff or most of the air
coolers will also fit inside it as well
as far as how many hard drives you can
stick in the system or SSDs you get two
3.5 inch bays and three 2.5 inch bays on
the back of the case there is adequate
room for doing your cable management
stuff so you don't have to worry about
that and
the rest of the case actually does
disassemble pretty easily I mean I wish
the front panel came off that would have
been totally awesome but you can take
off the top you can take off the back
you can remove the front all that good
stuff now when you buy this case
directly from the manufacturer it comes
with to RGB fans already built inside of
it one in the front one in the back
these are completely controlled with the
Q software and it's controlled by their
lightning note hardware so as far as the
lighting goes and all that stuff it's
pretty easy to use and you do get a lot
of different flavors now one thing that
would have been even cooler though is if
it actually came with lighting strips
inside the case but I mean that's
probably a little bit overkill the fans
themselves to say light up so bright
we'll probably be adequate to do all
your RGB that you're looking for the
front itself does light up but it's a
little bit different than having
lighting strips and as far as your fan
expansion goes on the front you can fit
320 millimeter fans or you can fit a
single 360 millimeter radiator on top
you can do two of those fans or a 240
millimeter radiator on the very back of
the case you can fit a single fan or a
single 120 millimeter radiator in the
past I've purchased cases that felt
really flimsy you guys know what I mean
when you're putting the case together
you're billing it just feels kind of
junky this doesn't feel like that
whatsoever and internally there are
absolutely no sharp edges at all that's
something that's a real Kabat to me I
hate working inside of a case and then
cutting my hand while I'm doing the
build because you just get frustrated
and pissed off when you're trying to do
the cable management inside of this
though is perfectly cleanly nice and
smooth you don't have to worry about
that whatsoever also many cases that
I've gotten in the past they just feel
like they're not really secure like when
you stand them up they feel like you
just barely touch it it's going to fall
over with the feet on the spec Omega you
don't have to worry about that
whatsoever this case also has a full two
year warranty so if anything happens in
that two years you guys need to get
yourself a new case now as far as the
air filtration goes on the bottom you
have a single nice little removable fan
on top you get very nice filtration and
in the front it's just kind of okay
another thing I do like about the case
design is the shroud that covers the
power supply
let's just face it nobody really wants
to see the power supply I mean unless
it's all flashy er looks like a piece of
gold it's just kind of there and a lot
of times as a bunch of riding and stuff
on it and it really takes away from the
beating elegance you know of your builds
look so having a nice route that keeps
it completely enclosed I actually think
that's a plus and when you put your
motherboard inside of the case you don't
have to worry about a bunch of weird
wiring because all the wiring comes
inside of the case and it hooks up very
easily to your motherboard and like I
said again I just want to reiterate this
is behind the case in the back there is
plenty of room for cable management so
you can get all your cables back there
tuck them all in nice and make your case
just totally clean so that all that
airflow just goes all the way through
unconstructed now I know some people
have said oh so-and-so from this site
said that that really doesn't matter
well I don't care what they say to me if
I have air flow coming through and
there's something in the way of it that
is constricting the air flow that's just
my opinion you agree to you don't but it
is what it is
all right folks sold there you have it a
pretty short video but you know it's a
case it's the carbide series spec Omega
RGB if you guys would like to check out
our og video on the spec Omega and we'll
have a link below for you guys to check
that out as well as this like always I
always want to hear your guys's comments
so please leave your comments
interaction down below we're an online
family so let's have a discussion peace
out we'll see you guys back here on teka
tomorrow for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
