tomorrow today we're gonna be doing a
traditional old-school unboxing that's
right taking the packaging all off
checking out what's inside that little
box and today it's a product from the
people over at Corsair we use a lot of
their products in our bills because
they're really cool people and they have
a lot of high quality products now today
it's the H 150 i RGB that's right an RGB
all-in-one liquid cooler that features
320 millimeter fans complete RGB
lighting for each individual fan like
you can change each fan of different
colors and it can all be controlled from
the environment of the Corsair system so
with that said let's jump in and let's
see what's in the box so like any good
unboxing let's check out well the box
itself in the front you can see all that
it says not much more I can tell you
there I'm going to spin around to the
back once again it just basically tells
you that works with Corsair link if you
guys know their products they have an
environment with software you can pretty
much control all the RGB lighting your
fan speeds all that good stuff on your
computer with that said that's pretty
much it though other than the
nomenclature right here it's a box
and let's open it up so first ones go
ahead and take this plastic packaging
here and rip it all off alright I admit
I cheated I stuck a key in there first
to make it easier but don't tell anybody
alright keep it a secret
pop this bad boy off now you really
don't see a 360 millimeter rad that
often I mean people make them but it's
not something that's like very very
common at all so this is kind of a
unique animal in that particular way as
I sit here and figure this out alright
so here we go so I'm gonna go ahead and
just pop the cap on this bad boy
I won't pop a cap on yo ass but I pop
the cap on this so right off the bat we
get their Hydra series this is you know
basically all their nomenclature are
gonna tell you how to install what it's
about I think the most of my viewers out
there know exactly what liquid coolers
are and how to install them inside of a
system and stuff like that you guys have
seen a lot of unboxing videos and you
guys have probably obviously a lot of
you built liquid cooler systems
liquid cooling systems like with a cool
system gorilla you know your stuff
especially the ones that are all-in-one
because they're the easiest to use so
let's just face that so now inside it
looks like there is quite a bit of stuff
so on
start down in this end and I'm gonna pop
this out this is one of the fans come on
come on out of there now all these fans
though also are the L l series fans so
that's for their lighting fans there's
three of these 120-millimeter fans that
come in the box and each one of them is
from that series if you guys have been
watching the channel we've actually had
a couple rollovers for this particular
product because they really wants you to
know about them they're really nice fans
and they run pretty much silence you
don't even hear them which is really
cool so there's the first of them next
up we have the mounting hardware and one
thing I want to let you guys know is
that regardless of what type of system
that's your building it doesn't matter
what system that you're building this
will fit your socket so currently any
socket out in the market you can be
guaranteed that this particular unit
will fit on your motherboard so no
worries there whatsoever let's keep
moving on with the unboxing so duduk
duty - alright so next we have the rad
itself give me one second let me just
move the box out of the way here folks
we can check that out now last but not
least we have the CPU cooling block and
we have the radiator itself this stuff's
pretty light so real quick I'll get the
camera to come on up here and so last up
we have the CPU cooling block you guys
can see it's got a nice copper base now
on the top it's kind of kind of a silver
color and this also lights up completely
RGB to whatever color you want to light
it up to to match your system which is
pretty cool
now the radiator I have to say this is a
very thin and very light radiator it
does have the corsair nomenclature on
both sides and this light you can see it
and it's also relevant on the other side
as well but this thing is very very nice
and light so i'm really surprised at how
light the radiator is in this unit i
mean you'd think something this big
would have quite a bit of weight on it
but it actually doesn't the cpu block
itself is the most of the weight now
there's also all these different
connections right here these are used
for not only monitor the temperatures of
how are things going but also that you
can change all the RGB lighting to
whatever you
one two so that's everything that comes
in the box this products not yet on to
the market it'll be coming out I believe
in December so I just want to bring you
guys a nice on box ambit we'll have a
full review with this built into a
system so we can tell you how well it
cools everything off but that's coming
up in the future
I'm Ella Rick you've been watching
ticker tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
