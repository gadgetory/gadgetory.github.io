guess what more tech now I know that out
in the market there are a lot of
wireless headphones I mean let's just
face it everybody in there
brother-in-law makes pretty much a
wireless set of headphones if they make
headphones but now Corsair has a brand
new set coming out the HS 70 they're
made of high quality steel and all high
quality products they're totally made
for gaming they do sound good with music
but as we get into it you'll see why
they're made for gaming so pretty much
with that said though these headphones
come to market at $99 and are very
competitive in their price range let's
check out the HS 70 from Corsair so
check this out these headphones like I
said are made of really high quality
products the band inside of here is very
comfortable on your head when you put
them on your head they fit very nicely
and you can actually wear them for hours
on end without feeling fatigued
whatsoever and something else that's
really nice is you don't really see is
that the ear cups are actually made of
memory foam you know like those beds
that you lay in and they adjust to your
body
well the ear cups are made of memory
foam just like that which is pretty cool
and the drives inside of them they're
tuned to 50 millimeter dryers which
means they're gonna bring a lot of bass
to the table and in fact the sound in
them is really totally geared for gaming
which means that pretty much bass heavy
and the reason for this is when you're
in game and you're getting explosions
and shots all that stuff if you have
headphones that aren't tuned for that
type of thing you'll actually get a
rattle kind of like if you've ever
pulled up next to somebody and they're
listening to you like crazy music in
their car and you hear the metal in
their car as their bass is going off you
never want to hear that crap in your
headphones and you don't have to worry
about that whatsoever with the HS
seventies now another thing that I think
is really nice is the microphone unlike
a lot of other microphones is completely
removable so if you're not going to be
in-game you're not going to be talking
anybody or anything else like that you
can remove it and if you're going to be
in-game you're going to be playing
something like pub G or anything else
like that fortnight and you want to talk
to a bunch of crazy people and talk
madness well you just plug it in it's in
there and away you go
now when you first open up the box
you're going to see there's not
a whole lot of stuff inside the box
there is however the dongle which
inserts into your PC charging cable USB
charging cable the standard stuff the
mic cable and that's what you get inside
the box so let me just set that stuff
off to the side now all of the controls
are located on the backside of the
headphones on the right you're gonna see
the power button and pairing button and
on the left hand side you're gonna see
the volume mute the power charging and
then obviously at the bottom where the
microphone goes in another nice thing
about these headphones I know people are
going to obviously they're gonna be some
debates and people are gonna have their
opinions about this they are 7.1 but
their virtual 7.1 so what exactly does
that mean well if you had a pair of
headphones and they were actually true
7.1 headphones all the rest of the
speaker's would actually be inside of
the headphone so you'd have your 50
millimeter driver you'd have your 5.1
and your 7.1 speakers now there are some
out there but they're actually much
higher than $99 they're like in a 239 to
$279 range and if you really really
really need that so bad you can buy them
but for a headset that comes into market
under $100 having virtual 7.1 is just
fine I mean when you're in game
I mean it's sure it's cool to be able to
hear somebody walking up totally behind
you but how accurate is that stuff
really anyways I mean back in the day
when creative had EAX and they were
really focusing on that stuff maybe it
would matter but honestly when's the
last time you've seen something out that
said hey this works with creative EAX so
this isn't really creating any accidents
not totally accurate how much of a
difference are you really going to hear
between virtual 7.1 audio and true 7.1
audio and Plus these headphones aren't
really geared to be watching movies on
your TV like for Amazon Prime and stuff
like that unless you actually have
Amazon Prime on your computer and you're
using your computer you know as your
media station most people are gonna have
a fire TV or Roku or something like that
and then the headphones aren't gonna
really work with that anyways because
they're made for your PC now real quick
though let's check out an audio clip and
let's
how these sound now obviously it's not
going to be the exact reproduction
because you know we're recording it here
and you're hearing it but still it does
give you an idea so let's listen
now real quick though before I bounce
headers too few more fun facts and these
are true 2.4 gigahertz wireless 16 hours
of battery life once you charge it
that's a lot of gaming if you can play
games for 16 hours straight man I salute
you hell my neck would be killing me by
that time ha be like after that and they
can go up to 40 feet so if for some
reason you want you know if you're
listening to music or whatever and
you're not playing games you can wander
around 40 feet which means you can turn
your PC kick back in your bed read a
book and be able to hear your headphones
with absolutely no problem now at the
end of the day I have to say though for
a product that's under $100 with all the
features that are in these I would
definitely give it an editor's choice
here on techo tomorrow because these
memory foam pads are really really nice
on your ear I have to say when you put
them on your ear they kind of just mold
there and they stay like I said the
headband when you're putting it on top
of your head you do not feel fatigue the
longest I've actually used these things
as for hours I haven't even gone past 8
hours because just because of my
physical stuff I can't play games more
than 4 hours but they sound great for
music they're obviously not audio file
type headphones and I explained that to
you guys earlier in the video you really
want headphones they're tuned for gaming
because when you're in game all those
explosions and shots are going up you
don't want any rattle and you do not get
that whatsoever these headphones plus
they're really made to last like I said
it's high quality steel high quality
plastic everything about the build on
these is very very nice I'm Miller ik
you guys been watching techy tomorrow if
you'd like to find out more information
about these headphones we'll have a link
to their website as well as a place if
you're interested in buying them you can
purchase them for yourself peace out
