YouTube channel I'm our Ferriss
editor-in-chief and today an Vidya makes
a new launch in their budget line video
cards
this would be their 450 line today we'll
be taking a look at the gigabyte version
of this the GTS 450 follow along as we
show the specifications how it compares
to the other cards in this gen of cards
and if it's worth your money at the end
of the day
currently most these cards are selling
about 129 dollars for reference based
design cars which this is one of those
cards so this should be about the
standard price for this check out what's
coming ok so check it out here's what
comes inside the box of the new gigabyte
GTS 450 what you guys you get the user's
manual you also get a mini HDMI the
standard HDMI connector a standard VGA
to DVI connector and you also get the
standard power to the 6 power power
connector to power your card ok so let's
go over some of the basic features of
gigabytes new GTS 450 first of all it's
based off of invidious standard
reference design so it has a 783
megahertz core and a 1566 megahertz
shader along with a 3600 megahertz of
memory so it also supports DirectX 11
it's based on the new 40 nanometer
fabrication process it has 1.17 billion
transistors and has a 225 millimeter to
die size this card is basically a
reference design card it supports all
the features from Nvidia it supports
Nvidia's CUDA it supports 3d vision and
3d surround using multiple cards for
gaming this card will be pretty good
especially if you use it in SLI mode two
of these cards in sli mode actually runs
almost exactly the same as a 460 card
okay so we get the end of the day with
gigabytes new GTS 450 well you know I
said the car was based off the reference
design well it pretty much is but there
are a few little things about the card
that do make it stand out one of the
things that I really talked about much
was there copper core which presents a
14% little cooler thing and supports
overclocking better so the card does
actually differ a little bit from the
reference design so I want to correct
myself there the card does sell for
about one hundred and twenty nine
dollars and it's a Grilli good card
there's going to be a whole mass of
these cards that come out in the next
few months how this card will compare
then we'll see but right now gigabytes a
strong company they have a good warranty
program good mr ma and good people who
work there so when you get the gigabyte
card you're buying more than just the
card you're buying the gigabyte name so
I say it's a good card for a reference
design card it does sound out ever so
slightly from just a standard card from
our friends at Nvidia so this has been
the launch of the new GTS 450 thanks for
watching see you more on tech of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
