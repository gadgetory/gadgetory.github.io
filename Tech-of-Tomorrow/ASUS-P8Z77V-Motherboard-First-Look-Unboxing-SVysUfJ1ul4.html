once again to the tech of tomorrow
YouTube channel
I'm Ehlert ferris your host for today
we're gonna bring you an unboxing and
first features look at the new p8z 77v
motherboard from the people over at Asus
now this is their entry-level
motherboard on the stack for the new z77
series this motherboard comes to market
at about 205 dollars and has lots of
great features one thing I just want to
note before we jump into anything if you
guys missed it check out a video that we
did over on motherboards are we actually
an interview with JJ from Asus and we
went over all the different specs but
for now let's jump in and let's take a
closer look at this new motherboard from
the people over at Asus
alright folks like for every good
unboxing we start off with hey a box
stop right here and show you guys this
PA z77
- V some of the features on there
there's smart digi e pu + TP which we'll
get to as we unbox the board obviously
this board supports both SLI and
crossfire and with the new virtue MVP
you can use your video cards in any
combination you want a lot of stuff down
here
Wi-Fi just it from the box stuff it
around just real quick show you guys the
back of the box for some deals maybe
boring I know
but other people like to see it so I'm
gonna go ahead now and just set the box
back down the table and begin the actual
unboxing on top here we have the
motherboard I'm gonna go ahead and pop
the motherboard out of the package so we
can actually see all of the content that
comes in the box there's actually a lot
of good content on there gonna have a
nice little box toss here whoo
alright cool so I'm gonna start off with
this is a little why five to go every
one of the motherboards and Asian's new
stack for the z77 includes Wi-Fi to go
now this is a really cool feature this
allows you to actually transfer all of
your files and operate from one PC to
another so you can actually take all the
music for one PC or a movie and play it
onto your laptop in another room it's
really cool stuff that's piece number
one then we've got two SATA cables go
ahead and set those down we have the
rear i/o here our Quick Connect these go
from all your wiring from your case onto
your motherboard make it nice and simple
to connect everything then we have the
crossfire cable here's the wireless
antenna this goes that little Wi-Fi to
go thing is the internet helps you pick
up all your signals set that down this
is the Wi-Fi to go fan expert to network
control USB charger fan expert to is a
really cool feature allows you to custom
control all of your fans in real time
whether in the BIOS or in the windows
operation network I control this is a
new feature that features on the Intel
network LAN that allows you to custom
configure 8 all your land features you
can pry
ties it USB charger 3 allows you to
quickly charge all of your stuff through
the usb on the motherboard or through
your case if you hook it up that way set
that up and give lots of good
explanations they're just version 1.4 3d
HDMI you guys know that HDMI provides
both video and audio signals then once
again we have a Wi-Fi to go card there's
a little card we showed you this is the
installation guide the users manual and
obviously insider should be the driver
CD voila we have the driver CD and the
case badge right there this would be the
bundles page and a review or they
content now let's move out of the
motherboard and go ahead and pop this
thing out go ahead and set this down off
the bat you guys can see this is a
standard ATX form factor motherboard and
I'm gonna do this little different than
I do most motherboard reviews I'm gonna
start out with the rear i/o this time
pretty some little different here we see
a combination port this is legacy
keyboard and mouse remember this is the
entry-level motherboard of the new asus
line so this board has legacy ports it
also features a standard VGA port now
before I thought this is what cheap way
to do it but actually this is part of a
pack a pack is for all the Asian
countries and for those countries that
want to meet the apex standard you have
to have one of these because those
people still have those type of monitors
here we have the USB 3.0 these USB 3.0
ports actually contain higher wattage on
them for charging your device's previous
generations only allowed you to charge
Apple stuff new generation stuff allows
you to charge PC and Apple stuff we've
got a couple standard USB ports next to
that we have display port HDMI digital
audio DVI another set USB 3.0 this is
the onboard intel lan which features the
eye control and then our analogue audio
inputs right there so did some different
their starter REO but it flipped the
board around we're gonna start talking
about fan headers this is entry a little
bored it has five fan headers in the
board the first two are located up here
above the ZIF socket this is a perfect
location for those because when you hook
your fan up right there you can easily
hook your connections up right there so
you don't have wires just strung out all
over your case so there's two here
there's an additional one right here
another additional one right here right
here lots of fan headers there set the
board back over here let's talk about
power here we have the eight pin power
connector locate the left and above the
ZIF socket then we have our 24-pin power
located over here and it bounced back
over to the ZIF socket this is still LGA
1155 but it supports both Sandy Bridge
and the new coming 22 nanometer Ivy
Bridge processors these will be out on
the 23rd which is next Monday
I'm gonna flip the board around show you
guys memory here we take a look at the
memory slots you can see that they are
color coded so you know it's channel
that they're in this board supports up
to 32 gigabytes of ddr3 memory so
brought over here right here we see the
mem okay button now the mem okay button
has actually a couple of different
features the mem ok button can be used
to view set memory near board and it's
just clocked too high you hit the mem ok
button it actually makes your
motherboard go but something that people
don't often realize is that this button
also allows in the overclocking
environment just go ahead and hit this
button to clear settings so you wouldn't
have to go back and reset everything in
your BIOS this will just clear those
settings you'd still maintain all the
other settings other than the
overclocking ones it's pretty good then
we have the digi+ vram a lot of people
asked what this is digital controller
means that you can operate your UEFI
bios the same way inside of the Windows
environment so what you've been doing
your BIOS you can do in the Windows
environment there are actually two
switches on here also the epu and the
TPU these two switches right here are
your EPU &amp;amp; TPU switches now a lot of
people just want a simple answer okay
the TPU basically is an instant
overclock button you want to have
superior overclocking you just click
that button on and away you go
now if your user you use the board in
standard mode and you just want to save
electricity then you want to use the EPU
switch pretty cool stuff
next let's talk about USB headers
external ones that is here on the bottom
we can see 1 2 3 4 USB connectors now
these connectors also have superior ESD
there are little chips behind each one
of these that allow for an anti-static
discharge to not happen now some people
in the past have actually plugged
devised into their USB ports and fried
their device by having static
electricity this board features superior
ESD and if that happens in this board it
has an off switch that does not allow
the current to go onto the motherboard
and fry it I think this is a very very
good feature and one that gets looked
over quite a bit here is another header
this is the USB 3.0 header now let's
talk about the cooling on this
motherboard you can see that all the
MOSFETs and everything are completely
covered up here and down here as well
it's all passive cooling but it should
work pretty well that doing that Ivy
Bridge isn't gonna be a super duper hot
solution as it is let's move over now
let's take a look at your PCI
expandability now this motherboard has
1/2 of the PCI x 1 slots we see two
standard PCI slots and then we see 1 2 3
PCIe slots the PCI slots are actually
separated by this this is a 16 slot this
is an 8 slot and this is a 4 slot if you
run the cards and crossfire SLI mode
these will be both times 8 if you use
the virtue you'll be using either these
cards in that or you can actually use
the card with the embedded solution of
the HD 4000 new Ivy Bridge processor
lots of good stuff there let's flip it
over now let's talk about SATA
expandability we have a couple different
controllers on this board we have both
the intel and the as media solution on
this motherboard we have both support
for standard SATA and the new SATA 3
connectivity last but not least I'll
just flip it around let you guys see at
the back of the board these things right
here actually help keep the board even
when even cooler and that's really about
it folks so hey thanks for watching
folks this has been the unboxing and
first features look of the new p8 z77 -
V motherboard come to the market about
two hundred and five dollars should be
available
everywhere next week see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
