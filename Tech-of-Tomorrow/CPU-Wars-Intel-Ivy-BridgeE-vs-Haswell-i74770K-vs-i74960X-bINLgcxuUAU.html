welcome to target
hello and welcome to techyv tomorrow
it's early morning and we're here to
bring you the Battle of the Haswell
versus the ivy bridge-e in a
head-to-head comparison video for you
folks that are interested so with that
said let's jump in and let's talk about
the differences between these two CPUs
and at the end of the day what they can
do for you and which one you should buy
depending on your needs let's dive right
so folks let's just talk about some of
the main differences obviously you have
the LGA 2011 platform that is what
you're going to be using for the Ivy
bridge-e 4 as well that is the z87
platform those are some of the
differences right there off the bat the
motherboards that you use will be the X
79 versus the Z 87 and as far as the
processors go the i7 4770k has was a
four core eight thread CPU that comes to
market at 3.5 gigahertz for the turbo
boost of 3.9 gigahertz now the ivy
bridge-e is a little bit different it
comes to market at 3.6 gigahertz and has
a 4.0 for its turbo boost now while we
can see that these two CPUs are
similarly clocked where things start
getting different is where we see the
six core 12 thread that is on the ivy
bridge-e now this is going to come into
play when you're wanting to use massive
amounts of lanes with video cards like
you're doing a quad SLI or a quad
crossfire system you want to do intense
applications for 3d rendering you want
to have the maximum available amount of
memory support that's when you're going
to look at the ivy bridge-e
now as far as the testing goes if you
guys happen to miss our test video where
we showed you guys both of our test
systems you guys can check that out
right here bounce over there and check
that out first then come back here and
finish the video if you guys really want
to do that now beyond that and we get
into doing the scoring you guys can see
that pretty consistently in gaming it
seems like the Haswell can go
head-to-head and actually in PC mark 7
oddly enough you see that it's really
strange that the has well actually
scores better than the ivy bridge-e
but when it comes to productivity saving
time crunching numbers and all that
that's when you can see in the test
scores that the ivy bridge-e jumps ahead
it has a lot better performance if
you're looking for productivity you're
looking to save time then you're going
to want to be looking at the ivy
bridge-e
for gaming and all that there's no
reason at all unless you're wanting to
have a quad SLI or quad crossfire system
why you would want to jump into ivy
bridge-e at all so if you're going out
right now and you're going hey man
I'm looking for a new system I'm really
trying to find out what's gonna benefit
me to most if you're not a gamer gaming
is like your secondary thing and you
only want productivity you want the
fastest productivity you also want to
look at the ivy bridge-e CPU part if
you're just doing standard gaming and
all that stuff
one two video cards 1080p monitor don't
waste your money jump onto the Haswell
platform you'll be doing just great baby
you'll be happy that you saved your
money obviously the ivy bridge-e and its
accompanying x79 motherboard are going
to be more costly due to the fact that
they have a lot more options on board
for you to do now on the other hand if
you use your computer to make money
video rendering 3d modeling CAD work
that type of stuff that differential
that you get in performance over time
equates to a lot of savings because time
let's just face it losing time is losing
money so if you can save time you're
saving cash i'm Elric thanks for
watching teka tomorrow if you guys
missed it the information about this
test ations or anything else it's down
that'll blow the like button you guys
know what to do there and all that
informations down there if you guys
missed the full blown review and you
guys want to just check out all the
stuff you can also check that out here
behind me or once again down below in
the description so I'm out of here enjoy
the rest of your day hope you guys like
this video we'll see you guys back there
on techo tomorrow for more tech goodness
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
