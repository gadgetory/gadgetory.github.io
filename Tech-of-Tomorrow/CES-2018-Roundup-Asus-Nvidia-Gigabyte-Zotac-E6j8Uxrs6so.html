we're back now that's right back to
filming videos and I spent my week at
CES so this is pretty much my CES
roundup of CES 2018 and honestly the
show went absolutely great this year we
made all of our meetings everything went
smooth had a great time my foot didn't
even bleed so hey thumbs up for that so
we start our day off at ZOTAC on Monday
and so tech had some pretty cool stuff
that they were showing a few guys no
ZOTAC they're pretty much famous for
making mini PCs and guess what that's
not changing they've got many more many
pcs that are coming out this year a
whole lot of different things and thank
you to chinny and to boo for happiness
the booth
it was very nice and what's kind of
really strange this year is nobody we
met with was on the showroom floor
everybody that mean Wentworth was
actually in a hotel suite which made
things a lot easier the zotac booth was
very nice it had a couple different
display areas one area was strictly for
all of the different types of mini pcs
some were for external video card
enclosures so if you have like a laptop
or something older that you really can't
game on one of these external video card
things can really improve your gaming
experience altogether
it's a box you can stick a video card in
it some come with cards some come
without but you can plug that into any
low end PC and be up and gaming with a
1070 or a 1080 video card and that's
pretty cool now another thing there's
otech booth that was really cool is they
had a back pack for VR that's right a
back pack so you could take VR anywhere
that you're going now
unfortunately the vibe of the oculus
either one of them doesn't work very
well on the Sun I was saying this thing
would be great for going out in the Sun
but you really kind of have to have a
darkened room for all the sensors
especially with the vibe those sensors
don't work very well whatsoever so we
got to go up and play around you know
using the vibe now this is actually the
old-school vibe because a brand new vive
pro is actually coming out and we'll
show you that in a little while because
we actually saw that over at Nvidia but
they had a system set up there and I got
to play a couple games it was pretty
nice I have to say that even though the
oculus usually makes me sick and makes
me want to puke honestly when I was
playing the vibe I had a much much
better experience I didn't feel like
throwing up
whatsoever though Tech's also releasing
a brand new line of PCs kind of like the
one from Corsair because it's it's an
all-in-one computer everything's all
inside of it you guys can see these
systems look pretty nice they're very
thin they don't take up a lot of desktop
reality and they have powerful graphics
inside of them to play all your games
now the last thing that we saw at the
zotac booth is this brand-new monitor
it's like a 38 inch monitor that they're
working with has everything built inside
of it and looks really nice I understand
I think they're partnering up with some
people probably like LG to make this
monitor but it's going to be really
nifty stuff so this year's ZOTAC has a
lot of stuff rolling out so be on the
lookout for their products cuz if you're
a ZOTAC fan all kinds of things are
coming this year next up in the
afternoon we cruised over to my buddy
Justin in and we saw the Corsair booth
now Corsair has a lot of products you
guys know this not a whole lot new
that's coming out this year but the
booth was really killer
they had spaces for both light they also
had a VR system going on with the HTC
vive and when I played this one I almost
fell down on my butt because it was like
this environment where I'm shooting Shum
in the shooting game type thing and
every time I like move that I almost
fell over cuz my prosthesis that I'm
that I'm wearing to help me walk there
pretty cool but as far as just balancing
when I'm inside of a VR room and trying
to look around all I almost fell on my
ass plenty of times and both Anthony and
Nick were both there to help me not fall
on my butt so that was pretty you know
pretty pretty fun my bed my book mr.
guys I was almost falling over and that
just kind of added a dimension to
something cuz I was like whoa what's
going on here now big things though are
there are a couple new pages that are
going to be coming out for the people
over at Corsair but a wireless keyboard
and mouse are the next products that you
guys are going to see from there coming
out they'll be out probably at the end
of this month and they're very very nice
they're very responsive there's no lag
we got to play some games in their booth
and everything is very very smooth I'm
working on another review with LG and
with Hisense on some TV stuff so you'll
actually see these particular parts
incorporated into my video because I'm
going to use these different parts now
all around
the Corsair booth there are all kinds of
different products that are there like I
said you folks who follow Corsair and
fans you guys know most these products
there wasn't really a whole lot
super-duper new there other than a
couple of cases in the wireless keyboard
and mouse because they did a lot of
product launches last year now there's
also that new triple RGB radiator and
that all-in-one cooling system we
brought the two guys a few months ago I
don't know with some really weird
confusion about an NDA so we had to pull
the video but the H 100 i RGB has you
know three fans on it it's 360 it's
really crazy so if you're looking for
something that's going to totally cool
your system and has a lot of girth to it
this is a product you guys are seriously
going to want to check out before you
guys actually see this video you guys
will see the video that I posted on that
products so on the link down below so if
you guys want to check out the unboxing
and see exactly what that product is you
guys can see what overall the booth was
very very nice that people were friendly
and it was just a great experience
overall and that's pretty much all that
we did on our very first day at CES we
just stuck to those you know to meetings
and held to it the floor is just huge
and I don't really want to risk ruining
or hurting my feet anymore whatsoever
than they are I had like a cut in the
back of it and it was bleeding really
bad and I just decided you know what
let's just skip the floor and honestly
I'm kind of glad that we did because
there wasn't really any companies out
there on the floor at all they were like
- you know it was like Edwin and one of
their company and everybody else was in
hotel so I'm kind of glad it and walked
the showroom floor anyways now on
Tuesday morning Tuesday is were things
for me I think got really excited
because we got to go first thing in the
morning to Nvidia now Nvidia had some
really killer stuff at their hotel suite
I just got to tell you first of all 65
inch g-sync
120 Hertz monitor that also has
everything that's in the shield built
inside of it so if you like watching
movies all your programs that has Amazon
Prime it has all that stuff that you
want everything that you want for
watching movies is actually built into
it so even though it doesn't actually
have a TV tuner in it who really needs
a TV tuner at this time it's got HDR
this thing is actually incredible we got
to play a lot of different games on it
and watch different TV programs and
streaming and I got to say that NVIDIA
has one killer freaking product on their
hands I cannot wait to get my hands on a
review sample of this because it is
crazy I've always wanted to have you
know a TV in my living room that I could
play games on and honestly I've been
seriously disappointed you know we saw
the brand-new TV that I got from LG it
wasn't a TN Panama's IP was excuse-me
IPS panel so it was a little bit slower
of a panel like it wasn't quite fast
enough didn't have any g-sync no free
sync nothing like that so honestly even
though some of these TVs that are coming
out can game they're not geared for
gaming whatsoever and let's just face it
we all know this but this product from
Nvidia is badass and it's gonna be made
by a SUSE Acer and a few other companies
so it's basically a 65 inch giant
monitor that features g-sync HDR just
everything that you'd want in a killer
performance monitor for doing your
gaming on and best of all all the colors
and everything on it are super freakin
incredible no honestly they're really
really incredible when you guys get to
see this in person and a store and it
finally gets there you're gonna be like
holy and if NVIDIA can get this to
the market and like the 200 you know
excuse me that $200 range slap snap in
the two thousand dollar range I would
definitely be recommending that to all
of you guys to buy because it's just
incredible and if you want a game and
you want a game on a big screen they're
actually calling this the big format
monitor like you know BFG which usually
stands for a big freakin gun but now
it's the big freakin g-sync monitor and
it is just incredible now there's also
something else coming out from Nvidia
that is simply simply amazing before you
could play some of your games on the
cloud and everything but you could only
kind of really do it on the Mac they had
a lot of Mac stuff for doing that but
now they've moved over to a lot to the
PC and you can take a two hundred dollar
laptop I'm not even joking whatsoever
a two hundred dollar laptop install
GeForce now on that laptop and you'll be
able to stream
games at 60 frames per second from the
cloud I actually saw a laptop that was
$200 playing all of their games very
very smooth now the only caveat however
that laptop I have to say is the screen
but we moved across the room and we were
checking out another laptop which is LG
which is a $400 laptop and it was
absolutely awesome so you can take a $40
laptop with a nice screen and everything
and play all of your games all from a
cloud through GeForce now and that's
just simply bad at so if you've ever
been wondering about you know playing
that or getting into it you should
definitely check it out now especially
if you have a lower end laptop but you
still want to get those nice frame
rights and nice graphics we compared it
to like a lower end laptop and then we
compared it to two total it's more the
$400 laptops and then we actually
compared to a laptop that had no GeForce
now nat whatsoever and the game was
literally getting on the same laptop
okay two frames per second versus 60
frames per second all from using GeForce
now and that's just simply incredible
stuff they also have some new technology
out for laptops which means that all
laptops now will give you an ultimate
gaming experience they actually you know
have a standard now or if you don't need
this standard of the laptop you won't be
able to actually use you know the
GeForce you won't be able to use the
g-sync all that stuff won't be included
because if you don't follow the
procedures for this for this new
technology you're not gonna be able to
make the laptop that's really cool now
another interesting thing is this thing
called freestyle and video freestyle so
if you guys out there you guys are
familiar with NVIDIA you guys know all
about using ansel taking pictures and
all this stuff but check this out
freestyle allows you to actually go
inside the game and change all kinds of
different things at the base level and
make different color changes different
hue changes you can literally change the
way the game looks as far as visually
and color goes to your preference so if
you're playing a game you're like go
board look it looks kind of cool but I
want to make this even crazier well
with freestyle you can absolutely 100%
and do that it'll be available for a
download so you can grab the download
and try it on your own system but I
think you'll be pretty impressed
especially in your planes the most
dungeon &amp;amp; dragon type games I mean
sometimes making it all purple and crazy
and blue or just making it all orange
you know actually looks really cool and
if you're a fan of Ansel and you like
taking a lot of pictures and doing this
this is a really really nice tool that I
think you're gonna be interested to
check out when it gets here and why
we're on the topic of Ansel one of the
very last things that we saw it in video
was going to be an update to Ansel 2 so
making that you know that environment
for taking your shots and doing all that
is never going to be better honestly and
Vidya had a lot of cool stuff at their
booth and it was the most impressive
tour that I took of the entire show for
some reason I had a meeting with
gigabyte schedule but they sent out a
media blast like basically canceling all
their meetings so I was kind of like
freaked out a little mad about that when
I got over to the booth in the morning I
found out that that was a mistake and I
still got to talk to everybody oh there
I got to see my old friend sherry Lee we
got to talk to Matt and these guys had a
lot of different rooms set up in their
booth in fact this was probably the
largest of one of the displays that I
saw in any of the hotels it was very
very nicely done all around their entire
suite is just a whole bunch of killer
products like you start off you come in
there's one room that's kind of like
dedicated to office space another room
that's dedicated to video another dino
room that's dedicated to like just doing
gaming they also had two different
virtual reality race games and I had a
hell of a lot of fun playing these games
because you're playing them and you're
literally just bouncing around in this
VR car and it was just an incredible
sensation if I had the money and I could
be a real spoiled biatch I would
definitely have one of those in my
living room as my racing thing I mean
honestly I love those things out of all
the gaming experiences are I have to say
I love racing games I always have and
being able to sit in a virtual reality
like simulated car and drive you know
drive and race was just a hell of a lot
of fun I played it and played it and
played it until I started getting a
little bit dizzy because like you know
if this this is well this was not the
latest vibe this is actually the oculus
and I started to feel a little bit
wheezy but overall it was a really great
experience now these guys also shared a
booth with a company called Enter
this company makes a lot of different
products they make cases they make
coolers they make all kinds of crazy
stuff and in fact this year they said
they're gonna be bringing a lot of new
air coolers to the market you know a lot
of people complain about AIO is breaking
down they're a pain in the butt so these
guys are going backwards a little bit
and making more high quality air cooling
products which will be really cool they
also have a lot of different stuff for
RGB and just all in all they have a lot
of nice stuff that's coming out in 2018
we spoke with a guy named Joe he was
really cool we got to check out this one
case and the case actually has a clear
front panel a lot of times when we build
cases anthea tell me dude why are we
using these expensive RGB fans in the
front of the case when you can't even
see them at all
with this new inter Maxx case you can
see all of your RGB fans they actually
have cool lights running up the front
and overall it's just a very very nice
case I have one coming in house for
reviews we'll build a system on that and
give you guys a full case review but
overall these guys had some pretty nice
products I mean they're not a giant
company they're not like gigabyte or a
Zeus or anything like that so they're
not gonna have that many different sin
variations of products but if you're
looking for cooling stuff looking for
stuff for like building your systems
they have a lot of different stuff that
you guys should definitely check out
after we got to see all the cool things
at the Nvidia booth just two floors up
was a Zeus I know you guys all know this
company now we met with Gary and Jeff
Jeffers from the tech report gary has a
long history in this tree is a writer
and just all kinds of different stuff so
both these guys not only in their
position or marketing have also been
writers and know what it's like to be on
the PR side of things now inside of the
Aces booth they had a lot of different
products that are going to be coming out
I didn't really get to see every single
solitary thing inside of the room but
they did have one thing that overall
completely blew my mind so check this
out we all like surround gaming with
three monitors but one of the biggest
things that's been a caveat to that is
that you have the bezel on the monitor
and the bezel always takes a little bit
of space so when you're hooking those
three monitors there's always this
little tiny space that has absolutely
nothing in it well using light
refraction technology they've been able
to develop a product that actually makes
the monitor completely completely
seamless that's right so you'll get a
completely seamless gaming experience
these through experience excuse me
through this monitor setup and you can
set it up a couple of different ways one
thing unfortunately though is if it's
not set up completely right it doesn't
function but when it does function
you'll be looking at it going wow how is
it doing that because of the light
refraction you can actually see the
entire screen as one solid screen and
another big thing is these guys are
making that BFG monitor I was telling
you about for the people over Nvidia so
we got to check out that monitor inside
of their suite as well I got I just
can't tell you guys how blown away I am
behind by this technologist overall it's
really incredible we were able to talk
to the guys and straighten everything
out so this year you're going to see a
lot of different stuff from a Zeus here
at Tecna tomorrow we'll be working
together closely with Gary and get all
those nice products in here and bring
them to the market the booth overall the
suite excuse me was nice it had a lot of
stuff out but it seems like a lot of the
products that were actually shown I have
actually already been released there was
only a very few things that were really
brand new and those products will all be
coming to us so as the year keeps going
round and round and round we'll bring
this stuff to you guys so you can see
all kinds of killer stuff from them I
wish I could have got a little bit
better coverage of some of some of these
Suites unfortunately though this time
around the budget didn't allow for us to
carry a cameraman and all that stuff for
the crew so I just went around with my
cell phone taking different pictures of
all the different things but I think
overall you guys get a good idea of
what's going on at the show now the very
last meeting I had at the show was with
NZXT and with vertigo
now for vertigo you guys all know that
company they're the chair that we just
brought to you that was the chair for
big guys and they introduced us to some
really even better chairs in their suite
they had a chair that was so smooth and
triple that it blew my mind and we
started asking about the wheels and even
the wheels on this chair are incredible
there are a hundred and twenty dollars a
piece just for the wheels that's right I
said it
a hundred and twenty dollars per wheel
but it literally slide it across the
carpet like glass and they're just very
comfortable the pl 6000 series that
means plus series they're also going to
have some new variations on those and
like I said before if your company out
there and you you know you're having a
gaming team or anything like that
the people at vertigo are really really
cool they can custom make a chair to
your spec so if you want a chair that
totally matches you know your gaming
team your office these guys are the guys
to contact to do it because they just do
a really great job now NZXT the biggest
products that they have our brand new
motherboards that's right motherboards
from a case company the motherboards
themselves are made by ECS you guys who
are PC diehards and old school you know
ECS is they're actually a giant giant
company overseas just over here we all
know the competition became you know
very stiff between msi gigabyte asus and
the rest of the company is kind of just
like faded off to the market as rocks
still kind of holding their own but many
of the companies that we saw back in the
day are completely defunct now one thing
cool about these motherboards however is
they're based on Intel technology and
they come in a couple different colors
but what's really neat is that they're
going to have accessories that can
change the color of the board to totally
make you were built so if you have a
green build you'll be able to change
that a couple different parts on the
board the heat sinks and make them match
your products so no matter what Co your
build is going to be they're gonna be
able to have a motherboard accent
that'll fix your build so it just looks
totally nice inside the case now a lot
of people complain about there's not
enough USB port so it's not enough fist
there's not enough that will really NZXT
took a serious look at this and got
together with DCs and this board has
plenty of everything
lots of USB 3 lots of headers everything
that you could pretty much want in a
gaming motherboard they analyzed and put
on this board so when they come to mark
which is in about two weeks we're going
to get our hands on
one thanks a lot for seeing you there
Wes it was nice thanks Shannon for
taking us to the booth we totally
appreciate your guys's time so that's
what we did at CES this year I just went
to meetings I had fun it was very
relaxing I didn't get stressed out at
all overall probably one of the most
successful and happy trips I've had
going to CES in year so I am here so I
have to say CES 2018 thumbs up thank you
very much to Brian and Brian I
appreciate you guys from Nvidia thank
you very much to Chinni and Tabu thank
you guys so much thank you to Justin
just honestly thanks to all those people
that made us feel so welcome and showed
off their products that this year's CES
I'm Elric you guys been watching taking
