techyv tomorrow we have what you have
all been waiting for that's right the
Metro nine three five build is here
folks that's right and we have a lot of
people out there including you to thank
for having this awesome system first of
all thanks to Anthea Reynolds he's our
in-house builder man thanks a lot bro
you did an amazing job on this Michael
wood from a hand dude you're liquid it's
looking badass in there - Snyder from
Intel thank you very much mark Trent
femicide love you brother
Rick oh man Rick I'm Corsair thank you
brother for all the parts that you gave
us for this and Gabe from Swift tech man
you know you're always in our hearts and
Rajiv from Coolermaster hey thanks for
the awesome case man so this is it man
the cooler master nine three five
ultimate built using obviously the
stacker case which you can season three
different components and this thing's
totally decked out and we're gonna talk
about all that shizmik but one thing
really cool about it is that this
thing's totally like you know operated
by remote control doing more control
things you know can do different things
in the system here and you change new
lighting even things like a disco light
but anyways it's totally remote
controlled the fans are all totally
operated by digital interface you guys
are gonna really really like this system
so instead of me talking let's jump in
and check out this system but one thing
before we do jump into the system I want
to give a special thanks to lynda.com
for making this video possible as well
they're today's sponsor for this video
and we want to thank them very much for
making it possible and bringing it to
you folks so with that said let's jump
in and let's check out the Metro 935 and
all its badassness so let's check this
out first let's do a spin around around
the outside of the case and just take a
look at all the aesthetics into what's
going on so right here as we start off
at the main visual side you can see we
have a totally custom window that's been
made and this thing's pretty awesome
it's got UV lighting in it so it lights
up with UV like an you put in a darkroom
the whole room like lights up with this
thing you guys can see clearly all of
the clean tubing and everything on this
side we have clearly all of our sponsors
edged out as well as the metro and the
tech of tomorrow logo then we're going
to move down into the very bottom of the
case now you can see down here folks it
does look a little bit messy but there's
a reason for this because the cables had
to actually be stretched from the bottom
all the way up to the very top of the
case and to do this we had to use a lot
of different cables now we use some mod
smart Cobra cables these the max
extension cables they were 16 inches
black UV yellow these the cables that
are actually running from the bottom and
going all the way up into the top of the
system where the other things are now we
pop the side panel off you can see there
are three 120 millimeter fans in there
and these things are really awesome
these things are by Coolermaster and
they're just rockin we also got a cooler
master v8 50 power supply a Western
Digital 2 terabyte hard drive and then
we have a corsair nutron 480 gigabyte
SSD really fast stuff now I know down
here it looks a little bit messy but you
don't actually see this part of the
system it's at the bottom and like I
said at the beginning of the video there
are three layers to this system this is
layer 1 this is base alike power central
so you don't see this stuff it's kind of
messy down here but hey that lens for
the rest of the system to look really
badass so in the front we'll start off
at the very bottom wall call Story 1 and
there we just have a single Aizu strive
we just did this down there to fill the
slot and so unclear know West simply we
could just use it there now sue hopes
the second story you can see there are
two 120 millimeter fans again bringing
air into the intake and one thing to
take note of is that anti Reynolds
actually custom painted every single one
of these fans in here so they look
pretty awesome and have weather
questions everybody asks is paying the
fans its way does it make them
unbalanced and make them noisy and the
way Anthony did it not
they still sound awesome and we even
turn them on high they just sound like
you know regular air from Hooters I
don't are making anything then as we go
up us a little bit further we see the
monsoon series too premium DDC MCP 35 X
dual Bay reservoir with quick change LED
controlled now this baby is matte black
with black trim now this thing has a
reservoir in the back and it's a Swift
tech X 35 you can't see it right now
this is actually installed behind this
thing one thing to take note of that's
actually really cool about the monsoon
is it as two controllers one controller
controls the brightness of the unit and
the other controls the color now you can
get some cool colors you can get green
you can get red you can get yellow and
you can get the combination now this is
pretty cool and in the dark it looks
even more bitching next up we see the
lambtron CW 611 band controller now this
thing has 6 channels and controls up to
13 fans now we're using and control all
of our fans in our system but one which
is located in the rear back on the top
now it controls all the fans on the top
there are three on each side and on the
bottom that controls three on one side
and one on the other there's also one
fan on the rear on level 2 that's being
controlled and two in the front all the
fans in the system are connected via
three pin four pin fan connectors and
split by three ways to connect via the
lambtron controller like I said we've
got it operating right now six different
fans inside the system and to operate
this thing it's really really cool with
one button you push and choose the
different fans that you're using then
you engage that and with the other
button you can change the speeds so
basically you click fan one change the
knob around adjust it from low all the
way to high and you can do that all the
way through the sequence of controllers
that they have on the inner it's
actually pretty cool and pretty
convenient of a very top on level three
we just slept that pretty much
completely Bank on the front side and
you'll see why later one thing really
cool about the back side of the case
though is
the total custom paint job now this
thing was all hand made by a guy who is
actually quite famous at doing this kind
of stuff now what if any of you guys out
there can actually guess will have his
name in the details down below then
after that we're gonna flip around to
the back side of the case first off we
will show you the single span that we
told us being controlled by the
controller and then we're going to show
you the fan that's actually not being
controlled then we're gonna flip back
down here we'll show you the rear REO or
you guys can see the right with the
motherboard you guys can see the video
cards and then finally moving all the
way down we see the power supply you
guys can see here is the on and off
switch you guys can see all the
components in it and now let's go back
to the side of the case and let's start
disassembling the Metro 935 so we pull
it off you guys can see the cable
management it's actually really nice and
clean back here you get it pretty much a
full inch to put all your cables back
there so there's actually plenty of room
in the stacker for doing this and we
also see this big yellow piece of
plexiglass stick and you guys are going
to hey what the frak is that big piece
of plexiglass doing there well that's
actually part of the mount for the
custom fans that Anthony mounted in the
front you guys are really gonna like the
way this looks and something custom had
to be made in order to make it look the
way it did and you guys can also see all
the cabling going up and around into the
system next up let's start taking the
system apart and showing all the
components that everybody really really
wants to see and that's the actual guts
of the Metro 935 so first I'm gonna
remove the side panel and as we move the
side panel you guys can see all of the
UV lighting and one thing really cool
about these UV lighting is they require
no ballast you guys can see that
everything inside this thing is all
based on the yellow and black theme
hence the
Sherwin to get the colors of that we had
to do a few different things the tubing
that we use was the Primo chill primo
flex advanced LRT tubing now this is
half inch ID by three-quarter OD and we
use 10 feet of this retail stuff it's
actually pearl UV yellow and the part
number is P then that's 3/4 - PU wide to
make the yellow even pop even more in
the system and we gotta give a very
special thanks to Michael Wood from
mayhem they kind of thought a heavy
metal band to me rock it out but we use
that mayhem paste this is their sunset
yellow concentrate and we also use that
mayhem UV yellow-green to make the
yellow really pop this is our second
reservoir you guys saw we had one in the
front well this is our second one and
this is the X SPC photon 272 glass
cylinder reservoir now this thing looks
really really cool you can also see a
lot of the parts curving around angling
up in the system now every one of these
different types of parts that have to do
with the cooling system are all made by
our friends over at swift tech Gabriel
Sean's been in the business for quite a
long time in fact he has brand-new
products coming out that we'll be
showing you guys and doing another build
on but all these parts internally except
for the ones that were noting are all
from Swift tech all of the barbs all the
quick lock parts the radiators the CPU
block and the GPU block were all
provided by Swift engine one thing
that's really cool about this system is
it has all these awesome put connect
parts now with these quick connect parts
if we want to change something out in
the future it'll make it much much
easier we're just trying to system over
that side with either and drain the
system or you don't have to but it
probably best to do that way then move
in the next part we're actually trying
to work with NVIDIA and get another card
and add that to the system as well by
the way thanks again to Bryant Elizabeth
Nvidia providing us the GTX 780 that we
use
you guys can see that inside of the case
though it's absolutely pretty much
flawless as far as the wiring goes you
guys can see this is an ultimately clean
bill on the very front of the case
do you guys concede that custom
configuration that I told you guys that
Anthony made using the plexiglass you
can also see two more of the jet flow
fans and these were also custom painted
yellow another thing that's really cool
is that Swift tech and their cooler the
video card allows you to custom shoes
the color that you can use and it's lit
up part and we chose to use yellow to
match the system I think that's pretty
awesome makes it very flexible for a
motherboard we use the MSI m power max
for our memory we use some serious
awesome stuff this is the Corsair
Vengeance we have 32 gigabytes of this
stuff in there and for our CPU we have
the Intel I 4770k thanks to Dan Snyder
at Intel Thank You sirs one at all now
hidden to the very top of the system are
two triple rads from Swift tech now
these things also have a custom bar
being used and we also have a
temperature gauge in here which goes
down to the lambtron
that allows us to actually see the
temperature of what's going on inside
the radiators here we can see some of
the half inch tubing going to the X 35
smoke technology like I said before the
system actually contains two of these
units this one you can see but the other
ones actually hid behind the monsoon but
one more time folks before I bounced out
of here let me once again reiterate how
important our sponsors are I want to
thank them all once again and you folks
