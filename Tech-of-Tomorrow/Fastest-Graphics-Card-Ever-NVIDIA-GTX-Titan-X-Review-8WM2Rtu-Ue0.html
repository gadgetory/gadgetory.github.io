world it's 6 a.m. here in Los Angeles
California
you're watching tech o tomorrow I'm Eric
your host and it's launch day for the
brand-new nvidia geforce gtx titan x
nvidia clearly states that this card is
not for those who aren't a meek budget
this is a card geared for those people
want to do overclocking and those people
who don't care how much the damn card
cost they just want the best fricking
 they can get their hands on at the
moment and it's looking like the titan x
is going to be that bad boy now
not only is this brand new GPU which is
by the way is the GM 200 it's replacing
the GM 204 I believe that was on the GTX
980 so it's a brand new architecture all
the way redesigned from the ground up
and like I said it's totally geared for
overclocking this thing actually has an
eight phase-- power converter built in
the car so you've got six phase of power
dedicated the GPU and another two better
dedicated to the memory so this is going
to be awesome
it's going to lie to get that thing pump
it up keep those voltages going without
doing a bunch of modifications to the
card so that's some pretty awesome stuff
also DirectX 12 API support across the
board and VX GI is as brand new
technologist coming out which is going
to allow game developers to do lighting
effects in real time so it means you
have to do your lighting effects all
canned and pre-rendered it means they
can be done pretty much like on the fly
in the game now I know the Unreal 4
engine is going to have this in them and
it should be something that everybody's
gonna want to check out because
obviously it's gonna look awesome and
bad-ass now with that said though let's
jump in and let's check out what the
card looks like the specs how it
performs in at the end of the day why
you as a gamer if you've got the cash
you're gonna want to get your hands on
the brand new geforce gtx titan x
visually you guys can see the card looks
pretty damn cool it's got a glass plate
window on the front kind of like a cool
case underneath that you can see all of
the heat fins and everything to keep the
card cool to the right there's a single
fan we've got the nomenclature of the
card titan clearly marked along the edge
of the card you also see the geforce gtx
logo on the side now as far as power
requirements go the card features a
single eight pen and a single six pin
connector it's also recommended that you
use 600 watts
more as your power supply as you went
the side of the card you see the two sli
fingers these are used to put your card
in SLI wood in case you want to do that
for getting even more kick-ass
performance as we move around the back
side of the car we can see all the
components and everything now being this
is a reference based card we don't see a
backplate protector now I know that
other companies who make these a Zeus
all the big companies they're obviously
going to make the card even more badass
than this but for now this is what it
looks like on the reference base card as
we flip around the back of the card we
can see the display outputs include one
dual link DVI one HDMI and three
DisplayPort connectors and last but not
least folks for those people interested
in what size this is it's 10.5 inches
long by 4 inches high by 2 inches wide
and that's pretty much it now a big
thing also about this card is it'll play
all of the latest for cams but it's also
geared to support all the latest TV so
all the latest state-of-the-art 5k TVs
this thing will connect to it and play
it the resolution that you want to see
on those TVs which is actually pretty
cool and with that said now let's check
out the speeds and feeds the beating
heart of the new geforce gtx titan x is
in videos latest GM 200 GPU and it's a
beast pixel vertex and geometry shading
duties are all handled by 3072 cuda
cores
well texture filtering is performed by
192 texture units texture filtering rate
is 192 Gigot texels a second now that's
over 33% higher than the previous
flagstick GPU the GTX 980 the GM 200s
memory subsystem is equally robust with
its 384 bit memory interface and 7
gigahertz memory clock peak memory
bandwidth is also 50% higher than with
the GTX 980 which ran at three hundred
and thirty six point five gigabytes a
second the GM 200 also ships with three
megabytes of level 2 cache and 96 Rob's
featuring a massive 12 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory gamers can now play the
latest DirectX 12 games on the GeForce
GTX Titan X at their very highest screen
resolutions without having to worry
about running out of graphics memory
which was something that happened in the
past the base clock speed of the GeForce
GTX Titan X is a thousand mega heard
the typical booze clock speed is a
thousand seventy-five megahertz the
booze clock speed is based on the
average GeForce GTX Titan X card running
a wide variety of games and applications
one thing to take note of is that actual
boost clock will vary from game to game
depending on actual system conditions
the Titan X's memory speed is seven
thousand and ten megahertz effective
data rate the card also has a TDP of 250
watts and is a thermal threshold of 91
Celsius this means that the cards
designed actually to run very very hot
now the boost clock speed the reason
they say it's going to vary between game
to game and system the system is because
everybody's system is different and the
way that that boost clock works is it
works off how cool the card is running
so cards that have these extreme
aftermarket cooling solutions or liquid
cooling are going to be able to
overclock much further than the
reference card is but the reference card
is a great starting point for those one
to jump in and just see how the thing
does one more quick thing also before I
jump into the benchmarks and let's like
holed out those dogs back up let's see
the benchmarks but this new GeForce GTX
Titan X is totally geared for virtual
reality and the oculus rift is actually
going to have a product that's going to
be working in conjunction with this card
very soon so not only you're going to be
able to get all this 3d gaming you've
got now you'll also be able to take it
to the next level whenever this new
product comes out so this thing is
totally ready for everything next-gen
like I said it's ready for next gen TVs
it's ready for next gen this it's also
ready for obviously Virtual Reality
through the oculus thing so that's
pretty cool stuff now if that said let's
jump in real quick let's check out our
test system and then let's check out
those scores and
all right folks so there you guys have
it pretty much everything there is to
know about the brand new NVIDIA GeForce
GTX Titan X now I know that I had a
limited amount of tests that you guys
saw when I release this review that
being the case I apologize for that but
a lot of my cards were actually lent out
of being used in systems that were
developing right now I apologize about
that I'm actually moving all the testing
stuff back here to my lab but built a
brand new test system here so everything
will be back here in my lab and I
promise I will bring you guys over
clocking tests against the 295 X and a
bunch of other cards right here in the
future but this is launch day I only the
card relate for about 4 days so I tried
to get as much information as much
testing done in this time period so I
hope you guys are you know pretty much
happiness and still hit the like button
I apologize but I may I admit it I just
had very short time I will do more for
you guys in the future but with that
said you guys can see that this card
really is kicking butt doesn't even
really run that hot 42 Celsius and her
idle 85 and her full load 91 is a
threshold that means this card has a
much much more potential that I even put
into it whatsoever now we did do the
test in 4k so you guys can see how it
does perform in 4k and we did some O's
tests in regular resolutions as well but
this thing really is probably the King
of the Ring right now and there's
probably nothing that can touch it as
far as single GPUs go at all as far as
single GPU cards go and video once again
has become the King of the Ring now this
is pretty much to be expected
I know AMD pens are gonna go the next
generation I know the next generation of
AMD card may very well kick this cards
ass that's the name of the game Nvidia
knows it just as well as I do and you do
so but for right now in this little
frame time before end time you want to
get a time capsule and come back to the
day that Nvidia reign for the today well
this will be one of those days cuz at
the moment this card is the King of the
Ring it's coming to the market at about
900 bucks so you know it's pricey like I
said early in the video this thing is
not for the meek of the wallet it's
meant for the gamer who wants to
overclock the out of his card and
just go crazy now me personally I'm
gonna be calling my friend Gabe or Swift
Tech seeing if I can take this card
stick a water cooler in it sticking in
my gaming system back here behind me
and I mean we're closing the video out
so I guess Mazel tell you the green
system find them yep
finds a good dive-bombing so replace
with this system right here we'll talk
about it later and you guys masking me
for a PC gaming tour I just want to say
guys those guys who have stayed along
this long I'm going back to my PC roots
so it'd be much much more PC stuff going
on so thanks for watching tikka tomorrow
I'm Elric like usual more information
about this car will be down there below
that like button hopefully you'll hit it
and I love you folks and hope to see you
guys back here on tech of tomorrow so
thanks for watching here on launch day
of the brand-new NVIDIA GeForce GTX</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
