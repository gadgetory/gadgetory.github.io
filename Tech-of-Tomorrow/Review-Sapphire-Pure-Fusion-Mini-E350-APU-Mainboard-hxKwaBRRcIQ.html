Ramirez and today we're looking at the
Sapphire pure fusion mini e350 mini ITX
motherboard this is the board itself it
comes with two SATA cables your mini IO
panel and driver disk and sticker this
is a really great board for those that
are just looking for a basic backup
system also modders love to use these
types of boards because you can put them
in just about anything even like a 1960s
toaster has a board like this that they
use to build a computer out of it does
use ddr3 so-dimm laptop memory on the
rear i/o you've got really good high
definition audio you've got VGA and DVI
you also have two USB 3.0 ports and
what's really cool about this is you
have also a wireless Bluetooth port
another neat feature of this board is
that you can use even a high end video
card with this it's got eight times
sixteen PCIe Express slot now this slot
does run at times for bandwidth so
you're gonna have some bottlenecking
occur but for those that just want to do
basic gaming this is a great feature
you've got five SATA ports that feature
the new six gigabit per second transfer
speed so this is a full-featured mini
ITX board you've got your 24-pin power
supply and four pin processor port so as
you can see this board does do just
about everything that a standard ATX
motherboard would do only on a smaller
form factor for those wondering about
the CPU on this board it does feature
the AMD III 50 dual core processor so it
does come with a really good built-in
processor as well so this board isn't
going to really appeal to those that
want to do some high-end gaming or video
editing but for those that are looking
for a basic backup system that they
don't want to spend a whole lot of money
on this is going to be
great product for you this is Brian
Ramirez with tech of tomorrow feel free
to subscribe to our videos and we hope
to see you again in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
