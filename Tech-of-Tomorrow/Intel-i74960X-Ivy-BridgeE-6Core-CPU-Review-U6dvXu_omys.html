all right folks it's 12 midnight
Institute of sleeping getting my beauty
sleep I'm up bringing you guys review of
the all-new ivy bridge-e i7 4960 xtreme
CPU that's right for those fans out
there who like really high-end stuff
this is the highest end you can ever get
so with that said with no more
let's jump in and let's start talking
about today's video the new Ivy bridge-e
49 60 X is a 6 core 12 thread CPU that
comes fully unlocked to the core clock
of 3.6 gigahertz and a boost clock of
4.0 gigahertz this is all done by
Intel's Turbo Boost 2.0 technology which
also enables automatic overclocking and
with hyper-threading technology 12
threads become available increasing
performance across the board with apps
that can use multi thread technology the
i7 4960 x has 15 megabytes of cache and
has an integrated memory controller that
sports quad channel ddr3 and 1866
megahertz Wafaa reference the Sandy
Bridge
II only offered 1600 megahertz 40 PCI
lanes ensures that even the most
demanding Quad SLI or crossfire systems
have enough available bandwidth to not
get bottleneck like the z87 platform for
better overclocking strapping is now
back and the BL CK is a just 1 1
megahertz intervals you can also
individually control the voltage of each
core and within Dale's new extreme
tuning utility you can easily see each
element of the CPU all current x79
motherboards will work with Ivy bridge-e
with a simple BIOS flash and with XMP
1.3 profiles you can have your memory
automatically set to its best
performance values those are all the
main features if you guys want to get

blown review we talked about all three
different SKUs of the new Ivy bridge-e
with that said let's now jump in
check out the benchmarks and lock
all right rocking out to the human zoo

jumping back to the conclusion of this
review and this thing we've only brought
you the comparisons between the Sandy
Bridge and the Ivy Bridge if you guys
want to see all the stuff about has one
stuff you guys can check that out in the
full review that's down in the link in
the description below so at the end of
the day though what do I really think
about this new CPU well bringing to the
table as far as performance goes it does
bring some performance increases it's
nothing to write home about and if you
already have a sandy bridge-e system
there's no Reese
go throw that on eBay and get rid of it
and upgrade now if you have a socket
2011 motherboard just waiting around and
your way to make a buying decision then
obviously if you want the best of the
best you're gonna want to get the core
i7 49 60 X because if you're doing
things like rendering video editing
music where you got to store all kinds
of instruments this thing is gonna
really kick ass if you're doing gaming
you've got three monitors and you want
to have full quad support and you don't
want to get bottlenecked at all then
you're gonna want to be looking at this
now if you're somebody else out there
and you're looking to buy with her
Haswell or you're looking to go this
direction you have to really just ask
yourself what am I going to be doing
with this system if you're just gonna
primarily be doing gaming very light
type editing and that type of stuff
there's no reason why not to jump into
as well now if you're somebody who use
your system and you want to make money
off your system mean that you need to
save time by having awesome productivity
then this is what you're really going to
want to be looking for out of all the
platforms that Intel has the high end
desktop platform is for those people who
use their systems for productivity
editing doing that type of stuff I mean
think about it the more memory support
you have high processor all those open
lanes when you're going in you're gonna
take a bunch of 3d modeling stuff and
you're gonna render that stuff out the
better the system the faster it's gonna
be getting done and with all the
features that you get with the new Ivy
bridge-e that's where this really really
shines and plus for you Matt guys out
there you guys all know that when the
new little trash can
Mac Pro comes out it's going to contain
this CPU so if you guys are into the
Intel platform but you like your
software brought to you on the Mac side
all you have to do is hold out for a
little bit longer and that Chizik is
going to be hitting the market so there
you guys have it now this CPU is gonna
come to market at about $990 I know
people are gonna scream yell scream and
yell scream yell but I'm gonna tell you
right now you guys know we bought that
FX 95 90 CPU okay it actually cost
almost the identical amount as this CPU
and I'm gonna tell you right now you'll
see there's no comparison
at all no way at all the CPU eats it up
spits it out and would make in do you
want to go crawling home just going what
happened here but that's a whole nother
can of wax so at the end of the day
folks if you're gonna jump into
something and you're somebody who wants
productivity this might be the system
you want to look for 1080p gaming save
yourself some money get Haswell also you
guys want to see the full in depth
review scores against as well and more
in depth information then check out that
link down there above the like button in
the description box we'll have all that
stuff for you so for those people who
like to read you'll be and I we also
have more videos will be bringing you
our test systems and they'll bring in
you another video of Haswell vs. ivy
bridge-e I'm Alaric

night with me and seeing these videos
