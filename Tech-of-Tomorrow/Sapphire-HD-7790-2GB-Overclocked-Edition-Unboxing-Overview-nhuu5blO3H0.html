and what would Monday night be without
more tech for you people here on tech uh
tomorrow we're always bringing you tech
now what's up well check it out just a
week ago we brought you guys a card from
the people over at sapphire this was
their new HD 77 ninety and this was
their one gigabyte edition now they
loose the 1 gigabyte edition they went
back they reflected and they were like
you know what since NVIDIA has a 2
gigabyte edition card out we should
probably come out with one as well now
this thing still has 800 nice extreme
processors has one gigabyte of gddr5
memory 128-bit memory interface all
basically the same features as we saw in
the previous card only this one is the 2
gigabyte edition so with that said let's
do the unboxing quick overview and then
we'll link over to the full review
afterwards with that said let's check
out the box
all right folks we'll check it out you
got the name you got it right here
sapphire HD 77 90 then right over here
we move cloth duty nice breasteses you
can see the pair of those there along
with some weaponry and a mask you know
so she'll come to your house she'll get
you turned on then she'll kill you with
their m16 you guys since these two
gigabytes of gddr5 it's the overclocked
version now I understand that this card
does come slightly clocked lower than
the 1 gigabyte version I don't know why
that is but we'll get into that later
HDMI all that good stuff you guys know
about AMD and all their stuff flip it
around real quick to the back of the box
supports three monitors so you guys can
have that I Finity display 28 nanometer
and architecture gddr5 memory AMD
eyefinity 2.0 AMD crossfire X PCI
Express version 3.0 it's got its AMD
apps
you also got DirectX 11 support HDMI
support and some HD 3d support right
down there at the very bottom so with
that said now let's see what actually
comes in the box alright folks so now
we've got the stuff out of the box you
guys can see right here we get the
sapphire graphics card quick
installation guide we've also got this
standard DisplayPort cable
crossfire cable DVI to VGA and then
we've got our molex to 6-pin power
connector this is everything that would
come in
the bundle and now let's actually move
on to the card itself alright so now
let's take a closer look of the card
itself we're at the bat we can see the
rear i/o where we see a single dvi-i
single DVID HDMI and a standard display
port it what's really weird about seeing
a standard DisplayPort and AMD cards
usually see these on and video cards do
you usually see them on a and B type
cards this card's also dual slot design
you can see a fin right here some of the
heat is going to be pushed out of this
when you have it inside your system we
also see a single fan design right there
black all the way across and the black
card goes all the way to front and back
so if you're looking for a system that
matches your mod this will be a good car
because it is black and black the card
size is in it 9 inches long by 4 inches
high by an inch and a quarter as far as
the thickness of the card goes now down
here we see our pcie 3.0 interface I'm
gonna flip it around that you guys see a
close-up of the back of the card where
you guys can see right here this is like
a Hilo heat bin right here now one thing
that's really cool is that this card
actually has cooling fins on the memory
unlike some of the other cards let me
flip it around the back right now you
guys can see black on black and it's
even got the rear cover which I really
like that way you can set the car down
and everything you don't have problems
with the card makes it a lot easier for
testing and stuff like that and the PCB
you can see is completely black
underneath it as well over here we see
the single crossfire connection this
will do a dual crossfire mode only gonna
flip the card around again to its side
we're underneath here you guys can see
they have some of their vapor x-type
cooling in there you can see the two
copper heat pipes going there so it
basically happens is the heat from your
GPU gets sucked up into heat fins then
into these pipes and the rest of the
heat gets blowing out additionally
through the rear of the card here's a
single 6 pin power connector
you've had 114 watts and it suggested to
have at least a 450 watt or better power
supply to use this card
if you guys it's a nice thin real quick
looking there so you guys can see some
more of the cooling so there you have it
the brand new well newer the new I guess
the second version should be kind of the
2.0 that's right the 2.0 version because
it's got 2 gigabytes of gddr5 instead of
one this is the sapphire HD 77 92
gigabyte edition which has pretty decent
cooling and everything and I know a lot
of you folks are going hey where's the
review we'll check it out if you guys
want to see the review over on our
website and wwq tomorrow I have the full
written review with all the specs and
