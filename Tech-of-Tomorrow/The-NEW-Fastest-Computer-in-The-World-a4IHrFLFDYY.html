back once again to Teton tomorrow we're
bringing you all the tech all the frack
in time so what's going on today well
you guys all know about AMD's series of
AP youth their latest ones are really
kicking ass in fact the a-10 6800 k was
able to be overclocked by this guy named
stilt to 8.0 gigahertz now that's pretty
crazy Nick now guaranteed though
that sky only had a couple of cores
running I think to get this 8.0 he only
had two of the cores actually running
and he used some incredibly crazy liquid
nitrogen system to do and cool the
entire system so there's just totally
crazy stuff it does show however though
that the AMD APU series are seriously
overclocking killers I mean look at that
 8.0 gigahertz I don't care how many
cores you got going it's still really
really cool now also you guys heard a
few weeks back we named it out the Titan
it would be Fox's computer in the world
in a big biggest balls well guess what
it's been overtaken by China that's
right
china now has the world's fastest
supercomputer and let's talk a little
bit about that this beast has three
million processing cores and a petabyte
of memory this thing is called the new
ty n2 and it comes equipped with 16,000
nodes each with two Intel Ivy Bridge
processors and three xeon phi processors
for an amazing combined total of three
million 120,000 computing cores it is
really truly one powerful and amazing
machine equipped with 32,000 Xeon
processors and 48,000 xeon phi
accelerator processors the machine also
has twelve point four petabytes of
storage and consumes 17.8 megawatts of
power you can have a whole city block
there for power now check this out the
way this thing is cooled it's cooled by
a custom air cooling system to Eskimos
and a penguin named Joe who works for
raw fish and fresh water so it's a
pretty good deal for the penguin right
anyways you guys see it and one thing
about this also China comes this about
two years ahead of the game that's right
so now if these guys come and kick ass
they came way ahead of schedule which
shows that China is a very very serious
competitor in the technological age we
should really be paying serious
attention to this so instead of being
the leaders we're now seriously
the followers last up on the news now
you guys all know that when they
announced the Xbox one there was a lot
of about it that just made
people cook and there was reason for
that it be connect to the internet had
almost bullcrap but you want me to play
certain type of games all that stuff
though now has been changed that's right
they've sucked back their words
and they've changed the entire thing and
actually people who order this thing
have had their order automatically
upgraded so if you're somebody who
actually pre-ordered on this you'll
actually get a free thing from Amazon
saying hey we have upgraded your Xbox
one so all that bullcrap before is gone
you don't have to be connect to the
Internet you're not having that checking
type of stuff yeah you can use you use
games all that good stuff
they've retracted it so now maybe the
Xbox one may have a slim tights in hell
of coming to the table but hey that's
cool stuff hope you guys like all this
and last but not least folks before we
close out of here we're going to bring
you guys the deal of the day
what is the deal of the day this time
well since we're on the subject of AMD
they have the 810 5800 K on sale right
now for an amazing under two nine
dollars and this thing actually runs a
lot cooler than 6800 K and it's just a
little bit slower now like usual folks
