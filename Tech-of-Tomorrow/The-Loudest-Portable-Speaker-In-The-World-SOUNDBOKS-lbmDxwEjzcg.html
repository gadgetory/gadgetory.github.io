that you are holding in your hand don't
be holding much longer because it's a
little bit heavy because it's so freakin
durable what this is man this is the
sound box be most loudest the most
rugged it's rain resistant it's crazy
it's just an insane Bluetooth frickin
speaker and it's not for the meek at
heart either because this thing freakin
rocks so let's talk a little bit more
about it because I gotta put the
down that is 31 pounds of bad ass
speaker I mean I got to tell you guys
we've all tried out Bluetooth speakers
some of they're pretty cool they're kind
of loud but the sound box is something
that is honestly it goes so loud that it
could like almost fill a city block and
start a city block at maximum volume
with sound man it's so loud it goes all
the way up to 119 dB
so you know this thing's like right at
the pushing point before the speaker
starts to crackle up and get breakage
and let me tell you even at full blast
the sound box still sounds amazing the
clarity still there and there's even a
boost button which you can turn on to
boost the sound which brings out even
more highs and a little bit more bass on
it so it's just really crazy it's kind
of like you know having a BB X maximum
vector on your voice let's hit that
things like go just a little bit more
and one thing I gotta say we'll see how
many people get the reference out there
is you know most dams out there are just
big pussies but all they do is go to ten
so everybody goes to ten sound box this
baby goes to 11 which kind of reminds me
of a certain movie which you guys
probably know spinal tap because in
spinal tap how many's app went to 11
because it much more knowledge L had the
best of the bunch you know what I'm
saying if you can see the numbers all go
to 11
I'm from that age that movie was funnier
than hell so you can actually turn the
sound box up to 11 that's right now the
amp features two crazy different drivers
so you have two of your low frequency
drivers that are running at 96 DB and
you have two high firing drivers your
speakers which are running at 98 DB
inside power in the sound box are 442
what digital amplifiers
also have a boost mode which altogether
is just incredible now the sound box
sizes in at twenty five point six by
seventeen by thirteen inches or sixty
six by forty three by 32 centimeters one
hundred and sixty-eight watts of power
inside of the unit and what's really
amazing is you can either plug this unit
in or there are two batteries that come
inside of it and you could literally be
a deejay or some band somewhere and play
anywhere in the world it's true to fully
charge each battery it only takes 3.5
hours with the batteries charged if you
use it at a low volume you get a hundred
hours of power at medium volume thirty
hours of power if it's super high volume
which is blaring a thing as loud as
it'll go eight hours of power per
battery so pretty much if you invested
in a bunch of different batteries you
could literally go on a week's vacation
up to the mountains and you could use
the sound box for your entire vacation
for a lot of people and you could even
get two of these and you could have an
outdoor festival that I guarantee
anybody would be able to hear which is
really incredible now the price on the
package that I got is about eight
hundred and seventy five dollars because
it comes with two of their giant
batteries but if you want something like
I said which I do and my plan what those
modules tell you is is I haven't really
filmed too many music videos or done
music a lot of people that's why it's
because I had like some serious health
issues but I'm going to tell you right
now I'm getting ready to go as crazy
assed massive diet and start filming my
music videos again and one thing about
the sound box is that I can go to any
sound set I could anywhere outdoors
anywhere I want to do plug in my music
into the sound box and then film my
video so I can hear you know what I'm
doing to do my vocals over what's going
on it's kind of stay there little T stay
there so like I was saying we can go
anywhere and film my music videos and
with the sound of this it fills the area
up well enough so that anybody's in the
bank and like you know play their part
to the music which if you don't know is
how most music videos are filmed anyways
people are usually actually playing
their instruments it's usually just a
set and they're listening to music and
for this what I'm doing is absolutely
perfect now if you're a DJ like I said
it we're band and you want to go out and
play anywhere you want to go it might
be nice they have actually a pair of
these now you think about it that's
going to cost you about probably sixteen
to seventeen hundred dollars but here's
the thing back in the day the police
like toured the entire world on old
school equipment with this and your band
done right you can actually go out and
be a deejay you can play on the top of a
mountain you could play on the moon you
could play out in the middle of the
ocean and run some the sharks you know
I'm saying and that to me is what's
really cool now thing is durable as all
get up like I weigh 250 pounds and I'm
able to get up I tried to stand on the
thing and up cutting my leg pretty good
but that's because this thing's so
durable it's made of birch wood and it's
got killer aluminum all around the
outside solid steel frame front
protecting it it also is completely
completely water resistant not
waterproof because you can't dump it in
the water it's not meant to you know
make aquaman have music underneath the
water
but I took a hose sprayed the hose on it
try to stand up and like I said I
kneeled on it thing works completely
fine without any problems whatsoever
you've got just a single set of two
controls on the side as long as excuse
me as well as the hookups on the side so
it's very very easy to use and if you
have access to electricity which you
know playing city gigs and doing that
kind of stuff you'll know you're going
to have you know access to power so you
could really be a DJ get a couple of
these things you could be doing a
professional gig down in Hollywood
wherever there's something the actions
going on wherever you guys live like we
live in LA so Hollywood's like still
kind of thing
there's Vegas you know those places you
could literally jam out do your stuff
absolutely anywhere and I think that's
really why the guys kind of developed
this product in you know in Danish land
sorry the Danish folks are the folks who
like invented this I think it was kind
of recreation because if you know back
in the day you know the Danes always had
a lot of outdoor festivals a lot of
dancing all those kind of stuff and I
think that the idea behind this
completely is for that so that you could
be outside enjoying your life enjoying
your music or whatever your needs for
the sound can be and that's a great idea
because there are many many things that
are outdoors summer is coming up so if
you're a person out there and you're
like into entertainment or music and you
want to just have something around it's
awesome think about it pool party
instead of asking to worry about
anything you
take the speaker out put it out by your
pool hook it up to your Bluetooth and
listen to all the music on your phone
and everything out there and you can be
up to 60 feet away from the speaker and
still get Bluetooth connectivity think
about this if you're just like person
who wants to get into like doing
deejaying stuff or weddings I'd even
think about this one weddings you can
actually use this product for weddings
you can get you all your songs for the
wedding and everything on your phone and
then go there hook it up and away you go
hands-free and wireless so I really like
this product a lot I understand that
eight hundred and seventy-five bucks
maybe you know a little bit of you know
money for a lot of people but it depends
on what you're doing obvious not really
a hobby thing since it's made like a
freakin German tank even though they're
Danish it's just made like a German tank
I mean it's tough it's reliable you can
smack the thing stand on it if it rains
you don't have to worry about you know
taking out the rain you can leave it out
in the rain still play it so it's up to
you but if you're looking for honestly
the most loudest and I do mean the
loudest Bluetooth speaker that there is
it's also probably the biggest the
toughest most reliable and it doubles
the chair and if you can't get something
you can always stand on like a little
leaning ladder you know I'm saying so
that's it folks sound box like oh by the
way tier here's what the batteries look
like the batteries insert on the side
you just plug them in and I take it your
battery power but you just said rare one
here in hands I'm sure I've got some
nice fuel this too but has a new nice
battery smell but they're pretty cool
and also these are completely
military-grade products so they're
durable and they're made to last and
they don't take that long to charge
either so that's the last thing there
folks I'm Miller Q can also plug it in
like I said via this power plug and a
that's it man so if you're looking for
like what I said before and you like the
idea
hey sound box may be just what you're
looking for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
