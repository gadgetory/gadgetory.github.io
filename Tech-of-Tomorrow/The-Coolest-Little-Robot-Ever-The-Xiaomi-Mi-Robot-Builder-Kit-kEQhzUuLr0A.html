by Corsair if you are looking for a nice
set of wireless gaming headphones that
will not break your piggy bank and still
have a lot of nice features the Corsair
hf 70 s may be just what you were
looking for with features like true 2.4
gigahertz connectivity a removable mic
easy to adjust controls and solid sound
these headphones are perfect for their
price range the HS 70 headphones work
with your PC Xbox or Playstation 4 and
come to market at under $100 check them
out and see what you think alright so
lose some pretty cool headphones if you
guys happen to miss the video that we
did of them we'll have a link down below
you can check them out now today's video
is about a product that is honestly for
the person who is like the habitual
builder like are you a person who likes
to put together those like giant puzzles
with 500 pieces do you like to build and
build and build and build and build but
because today the video and then with
product we're gonna be showing you is
all about a person who was totally like
into Legos as a kid well this is like
Legos on drugs because it's just insane
almost a thousand individual parts have
to be put together to assemble this and
it took actually it took to use the
camera a couple of days to build this
bad boy it was not easy i sat and looked
at it and it was just literally bags and
bags and bags of little parts so first
off if you have any small children
anything you should not have them around
this is it this is geared for kids that
are ages 10 and up but honestly this is
the my robot builder kit and this thing
is pretty trippy because it can actually
be built three different ways you can
build it into a robot guy you can build
it into a plane or you can build it into
a dinosaur or you can build it into this
silly little dog right here you can
build them into this guy no I know you
can I'm just kidding
but honestly this thing is like really
super crazy intense as far as putting
together so let's jump in and let's
check out this robot and all the
different things
that you can do with it because honestly
it's not only something cool to like put
together if you're like totally into
that type of stuff it honestly it has
some really cool features and does some
nifty stuff that you're gonna go hey
that actually is pretty cool for
something that's 135 bucks so let's
check this out you guys will see
that right when you open the box there's
a main engine as well as to high speed
brushless motors the main engine is
powered by a cortex MX 32-bit processor
with a battery life of up to 12 hours
and thanks to the inverted pendulum
algorithm inside the robot can keep
itself upright and balance as well as
move and turn forward and backwards then
right off the bat you're gonna see nine
hundred and seventy eight parts that's
right nine hundred and seventy eight
individual parts that need to be
assembled and like I said this took to
use the camera meant a couple of days to
do now there's nothing really extremely
hard about it there's like great
instructions you get a full-on book on
doing everything so it doesn't leave you
going oh my god what do we gonna do it's
just very time-consuming which is what I
said the very beginning of the video if
like you're a person who really likes
putting something together and then
seeing the end result you're gonna
really like this because honestly that's
exactly what this is really all about I
personally think there's a lot of cool
features after you put it together but
for people who like to put stuff
together and see the end result I think
that's what this product really stands
out
and you guys can see that even when the
filming is sped up it still was very
time-consuming
now once you get done building your
robot however installing the app is as
easy as pie you simply connect via
bluetooth in the app and you can pick
from a couple of different options first
you have the path mode where you can
draw a little path on your screen and
have your robot follow it then you have
rocker mode no I don't mean rocker moan
like giving you the Devil's horns
rocking out but this lets you control
your robot with two buttons you get
forward reversed and turn left or right
you also get a little rocket button
which makes the robot turn and rotate
its missile arms look out you can also
control your robot with gyroscope mode
now this is a little bit more difficult
to do but if you keep doing it
eventually you'll get it right now
probably the best feature from a
thinkers point of view is the ability to
code within their coding algorithm and
when you learn that you can pretty much
make your robot dinosaure or your
airplane do almost whatever you want
almost within reason be reasonable they
also have tutorials so if you're totally
new to the coding game when you're like
oh my god I don't think I can do that
don't worry man they got you hooked up
with this easy instruction that you can
follow and get up and coding within
their system very easily the interface
is pretty simple as well with
drag-and-drop code blocks you'll have
your robot learning new tricks in no
time and all from your phone now for
some reasons robots aren't your thing
why wouldn't it be I don't know but if
they're not your thing and you want to
build the dinosaur or you want to build
the airplane you can download those
instructions right from within the app
as well you guys can see the my robot
builder is something really cool for
those folks who like putting stuff
together and seeing the end result and
I've stressed that throughout this
entire video because that's the kind of
person I think that's truly going to
enjoy this the most the way that the
robot can stand up on its own and
around is actually really cool haven't
seen that on really any other products
and the fact that you don't have to
build the robot and you can build a
couple different things that's also
pretty cool something I haven't seen now
the price is a little bit pricier it's
one hundred and thirty five dollars but
like always you get what you pay for and
if you learn how to code and you take
the time you know learning to code can
be actually a pretty fun thing if you
really want it to be because if you want
to take that robot and make it do
whatever you want it to do all you have
to really do is just spend a little time
in there with that and you know you can
make it do all kinds of different stuff
so if you're totally into customization
and doing that stuff you can jump right
in and start doing that if your person
who's like really new to code and just
want to see what coding is all about you
don't want to invest and really go to a
school or anything like that but you're
still like hey I'd still kind of like to
know what it is this is your perfect
opportunity to do that like I said it's
for ages 10 and up so if you have really
little kids you probably don't want them
around this particular product because
little pieces could get stuck in their
throat or they could chew on them and
swallow them and you don't want any of
that happening all you really want to do
is have a whole lot of fun now it took
geeze the Cameron a few days to put this
thing together I personally don't have
that much patience I would prefer to get
the end product and just have fun with
it that's me like I would really want a
hand build my own amp either I'd rather
buy an amp that I know just works really
good you know that's the kind of person
I am but hey he sat down listen to some
tunes and put it together and as you
guys can see it's a pretty amazing
little robot so if you guys want more
information about this I'll have a link
down below so you guys can check out
more information or purchase one for
yourself this company didn't pay me any
money for this whatsoever they just gave
me the robot and told me to tell you
guys what I think and beyond the time
consumption for putting it together
that's the only thing that I could say
is a caveat which that would be to some
people who don't like doing that kind of
stuff but if you're the type of person
who likes doing that then honestly for
the price I don't really see it having
any caveats whatsoever it's a very nice
product it
it's honestly really cool it's the
coolest little robot that I've ever had
in a house so far we'll see what the
future has to offer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
