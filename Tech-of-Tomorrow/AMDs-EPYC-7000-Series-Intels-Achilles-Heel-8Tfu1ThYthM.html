search for both the iOS and Android
environment now I know that many of us
use lots of different apps and search
engines to search the internet but what
about one app that searches them all
saving you both time and energy and
phone storage all to boot smart search
the one app that searches them all tech
fans what is going on if you guys been
following the channel you guys know that
lately I've been covering a lot of
things that have to do with a nd because
let's just face it in the last few
months AMD has made a lot of strides
into the gaming market they've really
punched a hole through stuff with their
rising CPUs their new video cards and
with Vega right around the corner you
guys can see that AMD is seriously
gunning for the top notch as in my other
video I told you guys it by 2018 and
he's probably going to completely rule
the mainstream market but what I really
wasn't expecting was for AMD to all of a
sudden come out with stuff to dominate
the enterprise market in the server
market because that's just an area where
Intel if it all has pretty much decades
has dominated there's been nothing that
touches intel on the server and cloud
platform but now AMD is released their
brand-new 7000 series CPUs called epic
and these things are just totally
totally crazy coming in the market about
$3,400 you're gonna have a lot of
different choices but these things are
just made to totally process all of your
information out in the cloud and what's
really cool about these processes that
they're made to actually work together
that's right they contain four chords
and they're connected via their infinity
fabric and they're just incredibly crazy
well we get to the specs part that you
guys are going to drop your jaw just go
holy crap because like we've seen thread
Ripper we've seen what the prices are
what's it's competitive this is going to
be against Intel but Intel right now
their highest in processor which is like
an e5 2699 a it's like $6,000 very
expensive CPU and pretty much the leader
of what Intel has out there right now in
the server market but we're seeing
that's been announced is the epic 70601
is actually totally kicking ass I mean
really kicking ass on that CPU and this
may well be the start of the Achilles
heel of Intel because if AMD can totally
dominate in the mainstream and
dominate in the server market well that
means they have their bases covered
through every market and that's really
going to be putting a hurt on the people
over at Intel because let's just face it
traditionally like I said they've
dominated this entire market and there's
like just trillions and trillions of
data information going through every day
so many bites and bits of information
that would blow your mind and honestly a
lot of this stuff has been happening in
just the last two years where there's
just so much going on in the cloud as
cloud technology advances you're going
to need a faster and faster platform to
totally make this information move and
that's where Andy's latest 7000 platform
comes in it's going to be very
competitive in price it's made to run
cool so that runs nice and steady and
let's just face it folks everybody out
there is looking for latest newest stuff
and most people like the underdog to
come and rule the world so real quick
though before we check out the specs of
this incredible 70601 let's check out a
word from our sponsor Smart Search if
you're like most people out there you
use a lot of different apps and a lot of
different search engines to access all
of your information on the internet from
Facebook to Google there are lots of
things to search through but what about
an app that can search through them all
seamlessly and save you time energy as
well as space after installing the Smart
Search app you'll see that it's very
easy to use with a single swipe you'll
have access to a lot of different things
no longer do you have to install
different apps to actually access them
if you have the app installed on your
phone smart search will take you
directly to where you want to go and if
you don't have the app installed in your
phone it'll take you directly to the
website so that you can make your moves
from there some really cool things about
Smart Search is that you have the
ability to block those annoying ads and
it's also comfortable and really easy to
use plus you can download videos from
YouTube on your Android device and watch
them offline at any time and if the text
is too small on the screen guess what
with smart search you can increase the
size of the text so you can see anything
anywhere searching within the app is
very easy a simple swipe left to right
gets you on your way
all right so smart search it sounds
pretty cool right one app to search
through them all well if you want to
check it out for yourself we'll have a
link down below
now the AMD epic 70601 this
is the flagship CPU from these guys and
it's made for speed it has 32 cores 64
threads 128 PCI 3.0 lanes 8 channel ddr4
memory and up to 3.2 gigahertz of a
precision boost now one question you may
be asking yourself is why aren't there
256 PCI lanes
well the cpus actually split them so
each CPU gives you 64 pci lanes with a
total of 128 now the specs of the 70601
just sound incredible right you're with
me on this but what about the actual
performance scores because there's a few
that have been leaked by AMD now I don't
know if these are actually totally
totally accurate I mean most things when
it comes to the company you should take
with a grain of salt but if they pan out
to be true it's just incredible and
their performance is totally kicking ass
on intel's 'if i've $26.99 which is a
$6,000 cpu so let's check those out in
the 2p integral performance benchmark
you guys can see the epic 70601 getting
a score of 1390 which is actually 47%
higher performance than its Intel
counterpart at 943 now in floating foot
performance using the 2p floating for
performance benchmark you can see the
epic 70601 getting 75% higher
performance with a score of 1330 versus
Intel 760 score and that's just amazing
memory bandwidth is also something very
important your talk about processing
tons and tons of information now we can
see in this stream triad benchmark that
the epic 70601 gets 2.4 times the
performance of its counterpart in the
Intel world so that just means the
memory bandwidth in this thing is
incredibly fast and should process
everything faster than ever seen before
ok so there you have it folks pretty
much the basics of what's going on with
that book now most of the people out
there that are watching this video today
are gamers now you might not see this
performance directly but when you're
accessing your games up there on Steam
and all these different platforms as
they enveloped this platform from AMD
end of them you should see better
performance faster access to your data
and everything should just be totally
smoother so let's just face it the epic
CPU is made for the server market now
there might be some people who have home
servers but for the most part I think
that my audience is a gamer audience but
the
big thing about this is is that AMD is
just taking leaps and bounds totally to
take over different markets you guys
have seen like I said the very beginning
of the video that they are totally
getting ready to dominate the entire
mainstream market which means that most
people will be buying that for stuff its
budget and basic stuff now the
enthusiast market we know that NVIDIA
has not had an a CLIA yet they're still
going strong we don't know if they're
going to like mess up or whatever that
future will have to be seen but I don't
really think they will but for now you
guys can see that a and B is totally
dominating markets from around the world
and if everything pans out to be true
but epic honestly I mean I can say it
will be honestly epic it's just
incredible the specs and everything the
pricing should be very well very very
well set they're going to be separate
people to buy in and like I said the
performance numbers they showed right
now I don't know if they're totally
utterly accurate they're probably I mean
I would usually think people going to be
looking on the more positive side of
their own product but if they're even
really close to that it's going to be
something that's going to seriously hurt
Intel in a market that they've ruled now
for decades if everything pans out to be
true they're going to have a totally
totally totally competitor in the new
epic platform the flagship 70601 which
is a cpu that they've just announced is
really geared to dominate the server and
enterprise market and I hope that AMD
does this I wish them very much success
it will be very very nice to see
competition I know that Intel is
probably going damn you why are you
making all these videos saying this
stuff but the bottom line is Intel
sometimes all of us sit on our laurels
and when people start to sit on their
oils they rush stuff mistakes are made
we've seen it with the INX $2.99 now
until is going to have to totally
reinvent themselves again in the server
platform market if everything turns out
to be true
so I'm Network you guys been watching
tikka tomorrow because around the corner
I know that most of us probably won't
use it directly in our lives but trust
me on the fringe of our lives we'll
definitely be seeing different things
because like I said if you can process
all that information faster everything's
going faster that means that you can
access it faster on the web no more
sitting around waiting for things to
load when you get your information it
should be snappy snappy snappy like
usual if you guys want to find out more
information about this I'll have the
link down below like button you guys
know what to do if you're not sub Hey
the channel because we got great videos
coming out almost every day see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
