brand new Alienware steam machine is
here but the big question is is it out
of this world
let's check it out let's see
so rap the bad anyways here's the box
there's not much to it the specs are on
the side of it you guys don't really
care too much about it but I know you
guys do care about what comes in the box
so let's go ahead now I'll spin the
little box around from the alien head
and we shall pop the cap here right off
the bat inside we get a little alien
wear thing you know says alien wear how
to hook it up and all that good stuff so
that's that we'll just set that off to
the side so first off in the box there
is an HDMI cable always good you're
gonna need that for going to your TV and
all that good stuff a lot of people own
these already at home but the very fact
that it does come with one is pretty
cool next up we've got the power cable
and then beyond that we have the power
brick itself nice little thin one looks
like anything that you use on a laptop
or anything else
obviously plugs in the back of the unit
pretty simple stuff so that's all the
power cable stuff then from over on the
other side we have the USB to micro USB
connector inside over here I also
believe there are some batteries so here
are the batteries these are for
obviously powering the controller now
basically this cable right here plugs in
to this little dongle this is your
wireless receiver now big question
people are gonna ask can you use more
than one remote control and the cool
thing about this is is hell yes you can
you can use up to four different
controllers that's right I don't think
the Xbox one control right now is
support it but the Xbox 360 one is fully
functional so you have a couple wireless
Xbox 360 controllers you'll be able to
use them which means that four members
of your family can all get together in
the same room or you would do for your
friends and you guys can all go at it
and it's really cool stuff so I mean I
don't know but most you guys me I have a
lot of games that are already that I've
bought an off steam and since the steam
OS supports many many of those games I
don't really think there's gonna be too
much confusion with using your steam
games you have now with the machine but
if for some reason they don't you can
always actually take your PC and hook it
up and actually use your PC through
that's right through this little
Alienware thing so that's cool so this
steam machine from alien where you can
stream your PC through it and that's
really cool so let me pop this out and
then let me get to the remote control
it's
now a lot of people gonna say okay big
deal or remote control what the heck you
know what the heck it's a controller
you know joint pad mouse pad controller
where you want to call the or not a
mouse pad I'm just kidding but you know
it's a controller but the thing about
this thing is it's totally geared to
replace your keyboard it's actually very
ergonomic as well I can tell you that
putting in my hand right now it actually
has a really really nice feel to it the
toggle switches right here you have one
giant controller on one side one
spinning type on the other buttons here
and actually buttons all the way
underneath the controller so it's kind
of crazy even on the bottom of the
controller there's buttons so it's
pretty badass and like I said this
thing's meant to totally replace your
keyboard and your mouse obviously so
those people who are used to playing you
know games and using a keyboard mouse
they've tried to make it as economical
as possible if you actually be able to
use this and still be able to play your
games I really can't wait to try it's
really cool stuff actually four buttons
right here on the front so four buttons
here in the front to charge the
controller you guys can see that the
micro USB connections right there in
front also if you're a person who's not
quite familiar with like programming or
remote control or programming your
controller there'll be all kinds of
people uploading their own profile so
you'll be able to download those
profiles yourself and instantly be up
and gaming with a profile that will
match your gaming style most people
probably asking hey how do you put the
batteries uh put the batteries is really
simple there's a little click switch on
the back you guys can see here that
little pop that pops the backplate off
very easily and then you just take your
batteries and install them in there and
then we put the backplate on now little
pops kind of cool too I hope you guys
heard that in the film because it
actually does make a pop in fact let me
see if I can get it up even more the
microphone make a better pump for you
guys
heck yeah it pops just like a poptart
baby alright moving on so now we get to
the heart of the matter
this steam machine itself alright I'll
spare him that today so pull this bad
boy out
now obviously this thing is meant to sit
on a shelf next year PlayStation 4 next
all that stuff and it's really
cool-looking I mean the internet
actually folks is really not much bigger
than my hand and it's about I don't know
uh maybe about two inches thick so it's
very very ergonomically spaced it's
gonna sit pretty easily now we take a
look at the front we considers a little
logo then we've got the first of the USB
ports there's two of them
then we have the power on button which
actually powers up blue when you turn on
the little alien logo shows up the
slides are really nothing they're pretty
much plain and simple
we get to the back we have a lot of
different connections we have a
connection to the far left for the power
port then the first of two HDMI
connectors then there's a Phillips
digital connection for your audio a LAN
cable N and then another two USB ports
those who are wondering if the second
HDMI port is for its for daisy-chaining
another device into the steam machine
things such as your cable box or your PC
and this way you never have to leave the
steam environment now I know one
question that all you guys out there who
the PC master-race you guys are going
okay man how upgradeable actually is the
Alienware steam machine well inside this
thing you've got the latest Intel
technology so it's got the latest Intel
motherboard that you can upgrade to any
of the CPUs that are currently available
on the market so if you want to use the
latest i7 you can stick that bad boy
inside of here now currently there's 8
gigabytes of memory haven't seen
anything that says you can upgrade that
comes with a one terabyte 2.5 inch drive
but you can upgrade that either to an
SSD you another HDD so it's pretty
upgradeable video card however is
soldered unfortunately to the board and
it's based off something like a gtx 680
or 860m I believe so I think it's a gtx
860m is currently what it's supposed to
be there's no actual real technical name
for that but we're in the briefing
that's what they said it was like this
it was like having a 2 gigabyte gtx 860m
so for you guys out there winning well
what exactly is it well look at that and
that's what it is so that's how gradable
this little bad boy is now I know some
people are out there gonna say well it
doesn't have wireless connectivity well
to be honestly know they didn't even
bother wasting their time with that
whatsoever because action
the people over there at valve said the
best connection is a solid landline
wired connection so therefore they
ignored that feature all together so
right out of the gate as soon as you buy
the Alienware steam machine you get $200
in free games it's like for game pilots
it's like payday 2 there's a few others
you guys will want to check those out
but they're all free so if you've never
even done anything with steam and don't
have any account whatsoever as soon as
you buy this all you have to do is go
start an account and you get those free
games now real quick before I bounce out
of here there will be great news for a
one lucky person who subscribe to tech
of tomorrow and that is I have a code to
give you guys the $200 in free games
that's right now in the description
there'll be a hashtag all you guys got
to do is leave your comment down below
there and be subbed to the site and you
are in the code will be sent to you and
you will be the winner so with that said
let's conclude today's video of the
brand new Alienware
steam machine alright folks so there you
guys have it the brand new Alienware
steam machine coming into market at five
hundred and forty-nine dollars so the
big question is though do you guys out
there is like PC enthusiasts do you guys
feel this is like a worthy product with
an i3 processor that 860m
for this GPU eight gigabytes of RAM the
one terabyte hard drive all in this
little tiny steam package because I mean
it's a little bit pricey but the really
cool things about it is the way that you
can program that total remote control
man so that controller is so cool that
you can map it to anything that you want
like a keyboard and in fact this entire
entire Alienware steam machine is pretty
much they said is pretty much a PC it's
not a PC replacement though it's like an
addition it's kind of somewhere kind of
ugly kind of almost a hybrid type of
thing it's in between you know like
having a ps4 or an Xbox but it's also
you know its own because it's a PC like
I said you can update most of the stuff
in it you cannot upgrade the graphics
card whatsoever the graphics card in it
like I said it's an 860m pretty much
that's what they said it was
that's not upgradable but you can put it
to the latest CPU you can put a bigger
hard drive in it you know I believe a
gigabytes of memory that seems do where
it's locked out about singing where to
upgrade the memory right now maybe you
if I'm wrong there I guess we should
I'll find out as we continue setting
this thing up but I'm Network you guys
been watching tikka tomorrow and by the
way this OS is still beta I believe
until November 11 so after that it's
gonna come you know it'll change it'll
be a lot more stuff out there but with
1500 titles right now that are all
supported by the steam OS that's quite a
lot of stuff and being that it's let you
know it's gonna be very very stable and
it's gonna be very intuitive just the
people to use so if you're like a gamer
out there you like console stuff but you
like also the ability to have a PC hmm
feeling where steam machine may not be
out of this world but it's still
something cool that you want to check
out although the information down the
bullet like button so if you guys like
what you see you know what to do
you've been watching tech go tomorrow if
you guys want to see more sub I'll see
you in your inbox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
