was a lot more competitive and doing
better than they're doing right now and
I know that a lot of people were very
excited to taking that hey Intel's gonna
be bringing a discrete graphics card to
the market won't be well honestly I
don't see that happening I'll let you
know why but real quick before we jump
in in today's video let's hear a word
from today's sponsor 0 &amp;amp; 9 if you're the
type of person who builds a lot of pcs
or just changes the parts out inside
their PC quite a bit
having an extra Windows 10 Pro key can
be a lifesaver especially if something
happens and all of a sudden your
registration isn't working and right now
at 0 &amp;amp; 9
they have Windows 10 Pro for 16 dollars
now this is like 84 percent off but with
a coupon code that we're gonna share
with you you'll be able to get the same
code for 13 dollars that's right Windows
10 Pro for 13 dollars we'll have a link
down below where you guys can check us
out on their website and one thing
that's really cool is you can buy as
many keys as you want in the current
state of things Intel is honestly
struggling very much as a company
they've made a lot of mistakes over the
last few years they've gotten to markets
they probably shouldn't have gotten into
and didn't into markets that they should
have now it seems like Intel wants to
jump into the discrete graphics card
market but there are a few things that
are really going to hold them back and
probably not make it a viable thing to
ever actually happen that's right I'm
saying it now we'll see what happens but
I don't think that Intel is actually
ever going to get a discrete graphics
car in the market that's going to be
worth beans for one thing the company
currently is struggling trying to get
everything down to the 10 nanometer
process now this has been something
that's now late 10 till and it's
predicted that not Nenita that it might
not come out until 2019 or 2020 that
very fact alone and the fact that other
video card companies by the time that
Intel rolls
to have this technology will be way
ahead of the curve
not just something that's going to
happen because let's just picture it two
years from now until all of a sudden
gets to the ten nanometer process they
release their video cards out to the
market and at this same time think about
this Nvidia and both AMD are going to be
competing this whole time and by the
time that probably Intel gets their 10
nanometer process to the market these
other companies are probably going to
already have achieved that goal and have
cards that are far superior which means
that even if Intel launches their video
card right as it comes out of the gate
it's probably going to be defunct that's
right because of these companies that
are already so far ahead and Intel
barely jumping on the bandwagon it's not
going to be that good plus there are
some other reasons in the background
such as deep learning and other things
that Intel just doesn't have a hand on
quite yet and before they get you know
their hands on this other technology and
wrap it themselves around this they're
not really going to be able to compete
with these other video card
manufacturers whatsoever now another
thing is does Intel really plan on
competing in the desktop gaming market
this is a big question and I honestly
don't feel that that's really where I
could see Intel going Intel's always
been a company that likes to make money
in the server workstation market that's
very important to them I'm sure they
want to really hold on to that very very
tightly and to hold on to that very
tightly means a thing to have graphics
cards of their own that they can put
into those systems and that would be the
smart move for me for Intel to do what
they should do is really concentrate on
making like Quadro or fire cards of
their own this would help Intel quite a
bit and I know gamers be like oh hey man
that kind of sucks because you know that
would really help us whatsoever but
honestly that's the market that I think
Intel should go into and I believe that
they will go into I don't think that
Intel is going to try to jump right off
the bat and start competing with Nvidia
and am
I think they're gonna try to shoot for
the workstations server type stuff
especially embedded type graphics if
Intel can start making servers that have
such great you know built-in graphics
cards in them that they're really cool
they're quiet and they function properly
this would be a big step for Intel
especially with AMD creeping down with
them with the epic CPUs epics becoming
more and more popular as Andy gains
ground in the server market there you
know Intel really need something that
will offset the market and actually put
them back in a power place but as it is
right now I really don't see Intel
coming out at all with the discrete
graphics card the chips are honestly
stacked up against them pretty hard from
one thing they don't have all the
technology needed in-house to make these
graphics cards for another thing the ten
nanometer process still seems to be
something that's out of intel's or
region even though they're working
towards that goal
they still haven't met it and in fact
even in the chipset market I haven't
really seen anything from Intel and
probably the last seven years and maybe
go whoo Wow alright great every launch
has just been a little bit different and
since single core performance honestly
is probably the most important thing
getting more and more and more cores on
ships as a cool thing but if you still
have slow single core performance you're
going to start lagging behind and this
is where AMD is definitely catching up
with them and will probably surpass them
and in 2019 unless there's some drastic
things by Intel we're probably gonna see
AMD start to dominate much more of the
market and with that said Intel being a
newcomer into the graphics card market
they'd release their card for one thing
nobody even knows at this point about
Intel making graphics cards right nobody
knows so even if Intel does come out and
release some graphics cards it would
take at least probably six to eight
months possibly a year for people to go
oh hey yeah Intel actually makes a
graphics card and on the gamers side of
things you really have a lot to prove
because
gamers are the ones who pretty much
pushed the industry these days and if
you're gonna enter to that market
you better enter it with all guns
blazing you better have all of your
tricks in your magic bag ready to rock
and roll entering that market
prematurely and not being ready would
only kill until further with all the
money R&amp;amp;D research that it's going to
cost to get into this I see that Intel's
discrete graphics card market as being a
complete failure for them at this point
now like I said maybe some things will
change maybe will Intel will pull a
magic a rabbit out of their hat and all
of a sudden be able to do something
drastic we're like oh my god this is
amazing
but at this point in time I think it
really is too little too late if Intel
one to be a discrete graphics card
manufacturer they should have jumped
into this five or six years back you
know and it would have been a lot better
time period of them to gear up to where
things are now because like I said as it
is now even if Intel works full throttle
and finally gets their video card here
by 2020 in 2020 Nvidia and AMD solutions
are going to be so much probably farther
ahead that it's just going to be a moot
point for Intel right off the bat which
is why say that they would probably
enter their server market and doing
stuff like that first I don't know this
for sure but I could definitely see
until doing that like usual I always
want to hear what you guys have to say
the audience because everybody has
different opinions different insights
and stuff like that and I love getting
the conversations with you guys down
below by the way just to let you guys
know we have started our patreon site so
for you folks who like to support the
site you can do that also buying
anything from our Amazon affiliate links
that really helps the site quite a bit
plus if you guys would do me a great
courtesy of liking and sharing this
video that would mean a lot to me very
much so this is my take on what's going
on man Intel discrete graphics cards
like I said it is too little it is too
late but hey who knows maybe Intel will
put some magic
in the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
