of tomorrow we're talking to Tony @pv
about some of their latest wireless
speakers so Tony tell us what are some
of the great things about these new
speakers alright well we have a couple
different wireless ranges of speakers
this is our BTS to point to BTS for
Bluetooth speaker what's cool about the
speaker it's actually a two-way speaker
it's a left and right two inch driver
but it also has a passive 2 inch
subwoofer now not only will your
Bluetooth connect to it but the speaker
itself will control settings on your
iPhone or iPad such as your volume or
track but what makes a speaker really
unique is the in out patching capability
it'll play an SD card it'll play a USB
it's charged by a mini USB that controls
the the alkaline battery inside it's got
an analog input but one of the coolest
things about it it has an analog output
1/8 inch mini plug output so let's say
you're taking this outside to your deck
and you're playing your iphone through
there and you just jam it along then you
want to come inside and hook it up to
your main home stereo system your bigger
more powerful audio system coming out
the analog input into an input on your
home theater system disconnects the
internal speakers and now it no longer
is a wireless bluetooth speaker it's a
wireless bluetooth receiver so you can
turn any body larger audio system into a
receiver and control it anywhere in your
room that's pretty incredible stuff now
the bigger brother to that is a
three-way system it's called the BTS
5.35 it's a 35 inch 3-way system there's
a 5 inch subwoofer on the bottom rear
firing a side port and then a left and
right mid-range and tweeter and working
vu meter that also indicates when you're
in the Bluetooth mode
now this speaker also has bluetooth
inputs as well as analog inputs and
output so you can daisy chain this two
additional speakers
like multiple change the speaker capsule
is exactly rightly so this could
actually work out pretty good for like a
restaurant or somebody like that and
even better than that though is our new
wireless systems this is the wfs 3.7 oh
now these are Wi-Fi and airplay speakers
these operate in three modes wired so
you can just hook up your audio source
via cable into the speaker it'll operate
in airplane mode so that means you can
just take your Apple AirPlay device and
connect directly to the speaker but the
coolest aspect about this is you can
hook them up to any network no bridge is
required if you have a wireless router
in your house all you need to do is put
it into the setting tie these into your
router connect any incoming audio signal
then that's in your house to the router
and you can named each one of each pair
of these speakers so let's say you put
one in your kitchen one in your bedroom
and one in your living room each one is
named separately so any audio source
that you have in your home network on
the wireless router can be assigned to
any one of those rooms you don't even
need it this hooked up hooks up directly
to the router via any external device
such as your iPad iPhone or even your PC
computer Wow and then like what are the
price ranges on these things feel like
swearing this one the small one retails
at eighty nine ninety nine then we have
the three-way system bluetooth at one
nine nine one ninety nine ninety nine
and then the the wireless airplay
speakers these are three ninety nine
ninety nine for a pair
now are these things pretty much studio
quality and range yeah their studio
quality but they're really great for the
hope for home applications of business
applications anywhere that you want
compact unobtrusive music alright folks
so there you guys see it three new
speakers from PV Tony here was gracious
enough to give us the rundown look
forward using these products on techo
tomorrow in the future we'll see you
guys back here on the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
