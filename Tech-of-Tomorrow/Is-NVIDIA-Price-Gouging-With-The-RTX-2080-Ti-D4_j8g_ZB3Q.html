finally upon where we're gonna see
reviewers having the 20/80 cards in
their hand to do the actual testing and
show the number but the biggest
complaint that everybody has and through
all my videos I keep getting like people
saying you're paid off your invidious
shill that's just crazy if you ever
watch the video I'd never ever have once
suggested buying these cards all I ever
do is bring guys the facts and tell you
stuff but you seem to I don't know
miss miss get the information in your
head of what I'm saying I do not say oh
go out and buy the r-tx 28 or the horny
hei or the 27 me I've never said that
I'm not endorsing that now I think the
big big problem here though is
misconception and this is completely and
videos fault for not being more direct
with the public and video I'm there
Alicia showed a lot more scores of what
the cards were doing instead of leaving
this giant open gap for speculation for
people to talk crap and just throw
stones and honestly Nvidia this is a
beautiful for not giving information
like a lot of times people just don't
know what is going on now
here's what I think is going on let me
just rewind just a little bit here when
a 1080 first came out the founders
edition was about six hundred and
ninety-nine dollars and when the video
card craze went with all the minors
those cards are being sold for about
1500 bucks on eBay and selling like
hotcakes
gamers couldn't get their hands on a
card whatsoever you guys know it I know
it everybody made videos about it we
made videos about it you also endorse
those videos so that you guys agree that
that was a really crappy thing that we
couldn't get these cards for
affordability but now we're seeing the
twenty eight the standard version coming
out to market at eight hundred dollars
okay so let's just stop right there
the 1080 at launch $6.99 twenty eighty
founders Edition at launch Leclerc by
that founders Edition is $7.99 so
there's really only a hundred dollar
difference between the 1080 launch and
the 2080 launch people are freaking out
about the numbers going oh my god and
video menu are the fucking devil man oh
my god the prices
check this out how much did a TI card
cost $12.99 correct even when they had
the aftermarket ones with all the Star
Wars stuff and all that stuff
they were $12.99 well the thing is
Nvidia I believe is phasing away the
Titan the 20 atti is pretty much going
to become the Titan Edition the only
difference is instead of waiting to
release stuff everything is just pretty
much being thrown out almost at the
exact same time which is very very
strange so if you look at it from that
aspect the 20 80 TI if it's replacing a
Titan at $12.99 you're basically getting
a Titan at $12.99 there's a lot of
misconceptions going out there people
are like oh my god Nvidia is robbing us
and ripping us off but if you really
look at the numbers it depends on how
they're gonna correlate to the products
being released now if later on down the
road these guys at Nvidia and release a
Titan card and try to even up the price
that to me will really really be the
severus slap in the face for gamers
because let's just face it at $12.99
only elitists gamers and those type of
people are gonna be able to buy these
cards because let's just face it at
$12.99 most people around the world
can't afford to buy that type of video
card that type of video card is at the
very top of the price range I mean if
you're a developer you buy a quadrille
card you see these cards are three -
fucking $10,000 lots of money so at
$12.99 if it's going to replace the
Titan then that's not bad
but if Nvidia is going to have that
really as just the TI and then release a
Titan later on that's really going to
suck but as it is right now what I'm
kind of hearing is that the Titan is
going to be phased out and so the 2080
you know the r-tx 20 80 TI is pretty
much the new Titan so instead of being
titanium Edition or whatever it'll
probably just be the Titan Edition now I
don't know this for an absolute fact
because like I said stuff's constantly
coming out more informations constantly
coming out the cards are just coming out
right now like I said the reviewers will
have them in their hands we're gonna
have lots of tests for you guys lots of
games lots of comparisons and different
stuff to show you exactly
these cards are about will see if you
know ray-tracing actually really does
make a big difference but first you have
to get those cards in hand now I don't
agree with the pricing I want to be very
clear about this
if the TI is just a TI if the 2080 TI is
just a TI card it's not a replacement
for the temp for the Titan then I think
that's really shitty and piss-poor of
Nvidia because it's going to make the
gaming world really expensive to get
into but if you look at the other skews
the 2080 the 2070 these cards aren't
really coming to market that much more
expensive than the previous generation
it's about $100 more and you guys are
such a thing called
inflation so the more expensive that the
die is to make the more expensive the
cards are to get to the market it's been
2 years you don't think that electronics
parts that better up that are like
high-end R&amp;amp;D stuff aren't gonna cost a
little bit more they are and when you're
looking at it from that aspect and you
only see you know $100 difference
between the previous generations release
and this release that's not really that
much money
now the TI at double the price of a
1080i yes I agree completely if that's
how things are that's really crappy and
shady of Nvidia I don't agree with that
whatsoever
I will be making negative videos about
that but I'm really hoping is what I'm
really hoping for that these will
actually be the Titans 2080 I hopefully
will be the new Titan hopefully we won't
see a Titan only time will tell but as
far as pricing goes right now the lower
end cards are not even the lower end
cards the newer card is a 28 at 2070
their prices are not double what they
were on the previous launch by any means
they're like $100 more the only card
that is so outrageously priced is the
r-tx 2080 TI and if that card like I
said will be replacing the Titan and
that's not a bad price point whatsoever
that's exactly where Titans were sold
before so that is actually right in the
right around price range like I said a
lot of misconceptions going on Nvidia
should have been a lot clearer with
where these cards are gonna be placed
what markets they're going to be into
the touring technology for me this
entire release I don't know it just kind
of feels weird I don't think the stuff's
even going to be around that long
whatsoever
plus there is the very fact that in
video last year made a shit ton of 1080
T eyes and cards hoping the miners would
buy those cards up well check it out all
those cards are pretty much still out
there
so if NVIDIA makes the cards a little
bit more expensive and people want to
pay that well then hopefully they'll go
back and buy all those previous
generation cards and clear and video
stock off the wall that's probably a lot
of that going on as well a lot of things
mean you just plain and simply don't see
from our end we just see the prices the
video cards and we want him to put in
our systems and that's kind of where
we're at in our world wants sitting on
the board we don't know the cost of
bringing those cards for the market we
don't know any of that stuff for all of
us it's just a lot of speculation so
where Nvidia really messed up they sure
showed a lot more scores during the
launch people all this is crazy this big
giant vacuum which has been filled by
rumor after rumor after rumor I mean
like I said my last video some people
even told me there's no such thing as
ray tracing I was like okay it really
was stuffs getting really really crazy
when there's no such thing now is ray
tracing so some people are on the
friends they don't really know what's
going on they're just really angry about
the prices honestly if the TI ends up
being just a TI at 1,300 bucks I'm with
you man that has a complete ripoff and
not worth your cash whatsoever but if it
is a Titan replacement then the price is
pretty much aligned in what it should be
so hey thanks for watching the video
like usual I always want to hear your
guys opinions down below so let's
clarify real clearly I do not agree with
the high price of the 2080 r-tx Ti right
now don't agree with it the only thing
that'll make it better at the end of the
day is it is a tight replacement if it's
not then hey and Vidya is kind of
sucking right now peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
