tomorrow channel I'm milk your host
where we have all the tech all the time
now everybody's always looking for a
killer gaming system and most people
don't have a big budget now this system
you can look at one or two ways if
you're a person who goes out there and
you already have your OS then you can
consider this basically a little bit
over six hundred dollar system if you're
a person who insists that the OS is part
of the system or just not complete like
a damn Nazi well then it's a seven
hundred dollar system depending on your
point of view but anyways I've designed
one all the parts are readily available
and this system will play any game at
1080p with great frame rates that's
right any game on the market today this
thing will run cool quiet and perform
very well today's system when we talking
about is based off the AMD platform and
so with that said let's see just what
this shiz Nick's all about alright so
let's start off with the motherboard for
the motherboard I've chosen the biostar
990fx motherboard this motherboard is
about 130 bucks you can get it cheaper
if you really look around we've got a
link to where you can get it for about
that price now I like this board because
it's shown to be very efficient good
sound and very decent overclocking for
the price for the CPU I've chosen the
AMD FX 6100 this is a very good
processor will play any games are out
there and even do decent number
crunching this thing comes in at about a
hundred and ten dollars you guys can see
the links below you might be able to
find it for somewhere cheaper look
around next up we have the memory
corsair vengeance 8 gigabyte kit this
stuff's on sale right now for $45 once
again you may be able to find this stuff
for a little bit cheaper but 8 gigabytes
is totally enough for a gamer and works
very well in the overclocking
environment as well for the video card
this is where I had to make a lot of
decisions because the video card really
is the crux of this entire system you
want something it's going to play all
the latest games be able to pay him in
1080p and not break the bank so what did
I do instead of using a 7 series card I
chose to use a
xseries card so the sapphire HD 6950 two
gigabyte card is a hundred and fifty
five dollars and is perfect for this
build as far as the power supply goes I
wanted something that would suit this
build but also still give you a little
bit of flexibility in upgrading so say
you want to go SLI in the future or
something like that I want to make sure
that you could do that so i chose the
thermaltake this is the TR to 600 power
supply comes in to market about 60 bucks
will have the link below you might be
able to find it for cheaper but there's
a very good deal now for the case
everybody is very very picky so when it
came to choosing the case I looked
around at one that had a very good price
but also very good ratings from all the
users around the world I wanted all
kinds of different forums checked on
what people have to say and at the end
of the day the CM storm enforcer my
cooler master seemed to be a very very
solid case it looks well supposed to
have great performance great cable
management all in all a great case this
thing's $75 you guys can see the link
below on that as well now as far as the
optical drive goes these come in at all
different price ranges is just a gaming
system so really all you really need is
probably just a standard DVD ROM these
come in to market at about fifteen
dollars they're readily available
anywhere so I there you have it this
system will play any game that's out in
the market today at 1080p with great
frame rates it's based off the AMD so
those people out there who love the red
and black attack you're going to be
digging this system as well it also you
know for the holidays it looks pretty
Christmassy to you know red it's very
Christmasy so it's a Christmassy system
like I said in the introduction if you
don't have to buy an OS which most of us
don't I have lots of OS got bottom four
other systems you're not going to have
to buy the OS but if you have to buy the
OS then this things about the seven
hundred dollar price range if you don't
need to know s well you guys see it it's
a little bit over six hundred personally
I feel this is a serious winner of a
system because it will do what it's
supposed to do and it'll do it for a
very very good price I know you guys out
there gonna say I would have used this I
would have used that I would have used
that that's ok you guys welcome to say
that that's what it's all about so tell
me what you guys think of my sis
bill I think this one is actually pretty
damn good for the price let me hear your
thoughts let me hear your opinions hit
that like button show me some love
because I'm about to show you some love
you know it is the 12 days of Christmas
LA and I oh I can't say this one I'm not
to have Cameron sheet and hand me the
damn paper mm-hmm all right I wlu I i
will Louis sir 77 I will put it down
right here or somewhere like we're happy
you guys will see this is Nick behind
anyways buddy you're the winner like
usual folks please bug the crap by this
guy so he contacts me back so I can get
him out of his prize I hate it when I
announce it and nobody claims a prize I
hate doing redraws they're paying the
ass so let's make sure this dude claims
his prize like always make sure you're
subscribed because if you're not
subscribed that I won't be picking your
name because you're not on my panel to
pick that's just how it is so anyways
see you later peace out it's Christmas</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
