like most folks you've got a lot of
remote controls littering up your table
but with the race super remote you can
have one remote that controls them all
all right folks so let's first check out
those specs and then let's check out the
functionality inside powering the Ray we
see a dual core ARM Cortex a9 one
gigahertz CPU with one gigabyte of ddr2
sdram and eight gigabytes of flash
memory storage
another feature about the Ray that I
think most folks will really like it's
it's pretty much the same as any
smartphone it's got a 5.5 inch height
2.5 inches width the depth is only a
half an inch and the weight is only five
point seven ounces the Ray features a 21
to 9 aspect ratio 4.8 custom screen with
up to 16 million colors it also features
a resolution of 1120 by 480 and the
touch screen itself is made of very
durable Gorilla Glass it'll take a
lickin and keep on tickin and if you're
wondering what's in the box well you get
the Ray super remote the charging stand
the wall adapter the power cord and the
manual the Ray also features a fully
rechargeable lithium ion battery that
they say that depending on how much TV
you watch can last up to one to two days
the Ray can also be used up to 180
degrees and from 33 feet away which is
not bad that's quite a bit of space I
think most people are actually much
closer to their TV 3 also has 7
transmitting LEDs and over 1200 brands
and thousands of devices inside its
Universal IR database another nifty
thing about the Ray is its ability to
learn new Aero code so that means with
new devices come out this thing can
actually learn them on the fly and since
they're updating their database all the
time eventually with enough customer
response they'll have every device
that's out there all capable on the Ray
if you're familiar with using a smart
phone then you will be right at home
using the Ray because it has the same
functionality and features as most
phones do as far as the interactivity
goes it's got a sliding screen all on a
touchscreen you slide or tap and that's
the way you navigate
if you do want to use some buttons there
are a couple that are pretty nifty on
the side you have just a couple for
raising your volume control which is
really awesome because if you're in a
movie or something you don't want to
actually have to go back into the device
to lower your volume so a very very
ergonomic feature is the volume control
located right here on the side there's
also a mute button and asleep and wake
button as well located on the side for
your convenience you might think that
setting this up is a live-work it's
actually not a lot of work at the
beginning it may be a little bit
confusing just learning how all the
menus work and how to get all the
programming going but as you're going
through it you guys can see it's very
easy to use and navigate through we were
very easily able to set up the LG OLED
TV the Nvidia shield and my Yamaha AV
receiver now there was a couple of
caveats that I must mention if you're a
person out there who has any of the Sony
Playstation stuff at this time the REA
is not supporting it they're promising
though by the end of the month there'll
be a little bit of support and by the
end of the year full support now
unfortunately for me I have a
PlayStation 3 but I also have an Nvidia
shield and with that product it worked
really well but as far as setting
everything up you guys can see it's very
easy to use and navigate it's basically
just clicking a couple of buttons
accepting and saying hey yes it worked
and then finalizing the command and then
you're up and going and if you really
want to get in depth you can go inside
and change a lot of different parameters
inside the Ray it's got things for all
the buttons on different types of
remotes as well as some different
controllers like the Xbox and the shield
controller which we did today but how do
you access the remote control feature
well it's really easy from the home
screen down the right-hand side you just
click a little button and it brings up
the remote feature the remote feature
operates just like I said like a smart
device it's done by swipe and touch
there's also a button on the top of the
remote screen which allows you to see
all the remotes that you have programmed
into the Ray the power button option on
the left hand side of the screen gives
you the option of individually turning
off all your devices or turning them off
all at once so okay you've got your Ray
all programmed you
all your remotes all in there and
everything's working flawlessly
but hey Elric does it actually work very
well well check it out it really does
like I said before if you're used to
using a smart device and you use that
slide in touch you'll have no problem at
all using the Ray and when you're inside
of your different devices you guys can
see it's very easy to scroll up and down
into whatever menu you want to and if
you want to watch whatever you want to
watch you just simply click it and
you're often going honestly folks it
really couldn't get any simpler the home
screen also offers some pretty cool
functions right the bed it says hello to
you being nice to you it tells you the
temperature you get a search feature a
TV feature on demand your best of TV
sports even direct access to your Nvidia
remote and the settings it even has
something for the kids another really
great feature about the Ray is that
regardless of what type of TV you own or
what type of cable box you have it will
double as your TV Guide and information
highway to all those different programs
you can see what's going on the future
and what's going on right now alright
folks so there you guys have it the Ray
super remote by Ray now this thing's
really really easy to use it's got great
functionality and gone are the old days
we had to take one remote push into the
other one and sit there and try to give
them to make handshakes to program it
none of that fumbling is happening with
the race of free mode this thing is very
simple to use like you guys saw you just
do some simple click commands you're up
and going navigating simple it's light
weight the side buttons for your volume
your mute and for your screen are all
very well placed now this thing costs
two hundred and forty nine dollars but
you got to think about it do you really
want a bunch of remote controls just
littering up your table plus they've all
got all those click buttons the
batteries run out all the time all you
got to do is make sure you put this
thing in your charger keep it out there
and you're up and going and it lasts for
one to two days depending on how much TV
watch now probably obviously you sit in
front of your TV 24/7 those numbers may
be a little bit less but for me it's
lasting about a day and a half so at the
end of the day the bottom line is if you
want one remote
like I said to rule them all this is the
remote the race super remote just might
be the last remote control you'll ever
have to buy like usual all the
information about this product will be
down there below that like button hope
you guys like this video in this product
and I'll see you guys back here for more
tech uh tomorrow but - I'm off to watch
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
