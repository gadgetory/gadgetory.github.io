hey what's going on tech fans I work
here once again with buddy the dog
bringing you guys three gaming monitors
for under 150 bucks so if you need a
monitor do your gaming on and you ain't
got the cash I think you're gonna like
these so let's check them out
first up the HP 22 CWA the HP 22 CWA
features a 21.5 IPS panel with a
resolution of 1920 by 1080 and a 16 by 9
aspect ratio another contrast ratio even
as an IPS screen is actually the lowest
of the bunch only being 8 million to 1
in the contrast ratio the response time
from gray to gray is 7 milliseconds it
is an LED backlit monitor one thing I
think that everyone's going to like
however about this HP monitor is it's
virtually bezel as you guys can see
there's virtually no bezel around the
edge making it so you all you get is
screen and if you're doing three
monitors and surround this would be an
absolutely great monitor for doing that
because hey having bezels you know kind
of shows a separation so if it's bezel
less it's going to be a better view all
around now one caveat I don't know how
it's going to affect many people out
there is there is no base of mounting
however with this model so if you're
looking to put it on a wall you won't be
able to do it with the 22 CWA the HP
monitor does however have a pretty clean
look to it all and all and if you look
around the back and you see the
connectivity you can see there is one
VGA connector and one HDMI connector
there's also a d-sub connector but I've
never used it you probably won't either
the HP has a pretty easy to use
on-screen display and all you need to do
to access that is hit a little button
that's located underneath the right-hand
side of the monitor and you can navigate
through everything you need to operate
and control your monitor and next up the
BenQ 2460 now the BenQ is our largest
monitor out of the bunch coming in at 24
inches but this is a TN panel and it
does have a base amount if you want to
mount it on a wall the screen resolution
is still once again 1920 by 1080 and it
features two built in one watt speaker
so if you want to listen to music you
don't have let you buy speakers hey
you're covered there and as far as a
contrast ratio you get 12 million to 1
contrast ratio on this bad boy so that's
pretty killer and as far as the response
time from gray to gray it's 2
milliseconds
the BenQ is also a backlit monitor that
features a 16 to 9 aspect ratio just
like all the others but it has something
really unique which is reading mode and
if you engage reading mode it takes out
all the different colors and makes it
very easy on the eyes
you actually see the screen and read it
without going a bunch of glare or not
being able to read it at all if your
person you search the net and does all
that kind of stuff you read stuff online
this could be a great feature for you I
know me I surf the net all day long and
well if you're watching this you're
surfing the net accessing the on screen
display on the BenQ is different the
other two models because it's controls
are located on the right hand side of
the model solar access you're on screen
display you just simply click the
buttons on the right hand side and you
can be in your control panel and
controlling the monitor now as far as
the overall look of the BenQ 2460 it
pretty much looks like all the other
monitors out there it has a pretty small
bezel but it's the 24 inch that's the
biggest of the bunch and if you spin it
around in the back you guys can see the
connectivity involves one DVI connection
and a single HDMI connector there's also
a VGA connection for your old-schoolers
as well as a audio out and a mic jack
and like I said with the BenQ 2460 you
can mount it right on your wall because
it has a base amount and last up the a
zeus v x2 38h now the asus v x2 38 it
features a 23 inch TN panel just like
the previous model also features 1920 by
1080 resolution 16 by 9 aspect ratio and
also 21.5 watt speakers so you don't
have to buy any speakers if you don't
want to they're built into the panel
now the contrast ratio here is the best
of the bunch
80 million to one and the response time
is also the best being at one
millisecond it's also a backlit panel
and features a Zeus's splendid
technology now what splendid technology
is is it means you can go into the
monitor right in the control panel on
the front there and you can set it to
different type of modes now you can do
all this stuff manually but if you're
someone who just wants to do something
quicken on the ease they have a bunch of
different modes for you to choose from
like gaming night time just a whole
bunch of different stuff for the lazy
guy just wants to hit a button and go to
access the on screen display on the asus
is exactly the same as on the HP the
controls are all located on the bottom
right hand side of the monitor
but one thing cool about this is like I
said before is a Zeus features the
splendid technology so you can scroll
through all those different features
here access them and engage them as
needed and being that this particular
monitor is white it looks really cool on
a lot of different desktops and it looks
great and film as well now the overall
design though of the vx2 38 it does look
very fashionable as well as we spin
around the back you guys can see it as a
single DVI connection and two HDMI ports
there's also a mic jack and audio jack
and also a vga connector alright so
there you have it three gaming monitors
all under a hundred and fifty bucks with
a bunch of different features as far as
a special stuff go so if you like BenQ
obviously you're probably going to want
to go with that if you're on a zeus fan
you're going to go on to go with that
and if you're at HP fan hey that's
probably going to be your choice but if
you go buy features alone that's going
to be a pretty even thing there although
I was kind of surprised at the IPS panel
seemed to have a little bit less overall
great features than the other two
monitors but if you're looking for an
IPS panel that a the HP is going to be
your dog so I'm Mel arc and this is my
dog Buddy and if you want more
information about this pricing
availability all that will be down there
below that like button hopefully you go
Chuck Norris tile on it we will see you
guys back from the channel lots more
video card stuff coming up so stick
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
