those folks who likes to take your
laptop with you everywhere and just game
anywhere and everywhere that you can
well if so check this out NVIDIA has
great news coming to the table in the
form of laptops that are not only
totally geared for the overclocker
they're actually made with superior
parts including desktop graphics cards
that's right so let's just start off the
bat with the great news NVIDIA has now
announced that they're going to have a
bunch of new laptops with a bunch of
different companies like msi gigabyte a
zu s-- and a few others and the big
focus of all of these new laptops is
they're totally geared for the
enthusiast gamer on the go they feature
980 desktop graphics cards inside them
that in the scores that we saw are so
small and difference between the numbers
that it's almost not even worth
mentioning on things like 3d marking
stuff we're seeing only a hundred points
less than the score than an actual
desktop card and that's incredible
in the past we've seen a lot of laptops
come out and they say ok you know
they're made for overclocking and
they're this and that but they're really
not none of the products that have been
made in the past really were geared from
the ground up and engineered to be
overclocked but these laptops are
completely new breed the CPUs have all
been cherry picked all the video cards
have been cherry picked in fact pretty
much every component inside these
laptops has been cherry picked to be the
absolute best of its type so that brings
you incredible performance so for the
first time on a laptop you're gonna see
incredible things like the ability to
run surround monitors that's right
surround monitors all off the graphics
inside your laptop now that's pretty
cool you're also going to be able to at
some laptops with SLI on them so fans
out there want to get super duper beefed
up laptops you'll be able to get some
models with SLI versions of 90s inside
that bad boy you guys out there know a
pair of 9s will power anything including
4k at great resolution
for many of us virtual reality is still
kind of a dreamed but for those folks
out there who have been doing the
circuit of all the computers showing the
stuff you guys know that virtual reality
is gonna be a home thing very very
shortly and taking that in mind
Nvidia brings the first laptops to the
table that will totally power virtual
reality me and G's the Cameron had a
great time playing in this virtual
environment we just put on the old
oculus rift headset there's a little
thing down the table that reads all the
center's and everything that you're
doing and you're inside playing the game
and let me tell you man it is really
cool this is most definitely the future
of gaming a we're sitting there talking
for so long and just man how can we try
to film this and bring this true to you
but there's really nothing like actually
experience it I mean it's kind of like
virginity you know I could tell you how
great the first time that with that girl
was but you know you'll know for
yourself when your first time and it's
really that big of a deal really
incredible stuff you can get in here
totally look around the environment it's
completely 3d you feel like you're a
meshed in it took my eyes and my body
basically a couple of seconds to adjust
to it but once you adjust to it it is
the most incredible thing ever and the
most fun I've had in a long time is
loose themselves honestly has some
really cool laptops coming out now check
this out they're gonna have an SLI model
a standard model and even a model yes
hold your breath for a second with
external liquid cooling check this
out man this laptop has its own totally
external liquid cooling kit it can be
hooked up a mantle laptop when it's at
your house or on the go or you can just
take your laptop on the go and use your
internal cooling but either way the
cooling inside the laptops already
geared for doing overclocking and for
doing all that cool stuff but now if the
ability to add a water cooling system
this is going to take that to a
whole another level another thing you're
gonna see with the raw out of all these
laptops is that all these companies
right now have their own overclocking
software but these laptops are so
different that every company that's
involved is rewriting their overclocking
software specifically to be used on
these new laptops so that tells you how
much
planning Nvidia and all these people
have done behind the scenes to get these
things out to the market and bring you
guys killer gaming laptops that'll now
play games just like your desktop will
overclock like your desktop and
you've even got one that's got a liquid
color on the outside so that's it folks
that is the awesome news from the people
over at Nvidia like usual all this
information will be down there below
that like button which hopefully you
guys will hit like Thor's hammer
now if you're looking to get yourself
one of these these things will be coming
out later on this year that people would
have Nvidia if it guaranteed us that we
will have cement house so you know we
will get those bad boys game them
overclocked them and beat them to death
and bring them to the table for you
hi Meldrick you've been watching Tekken
tomorrow we'll see you guys back here
for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
