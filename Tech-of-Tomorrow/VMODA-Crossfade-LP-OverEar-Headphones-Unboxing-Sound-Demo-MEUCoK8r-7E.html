here once again the tectum our youtube
channel where we bring you all the tech
all the time now today I've got
something that I feel is a very very
interesting product what is this product
well these are the crossfade LP
headphones from v-moda now these things
usually sell for around 200 dollars
online but every so often you get really
lucky and have an amazing sale on these
headphones so when these things drop
down to a low price I picked them up
right now you can get these headphones
on sale for 80 bucks on Amazon it's a
great deal just look at the reviews 500
reviews with almost all of them being
five-star so I'm really looking forward
to seeing these now the biggest thing
that I've heard from every other
reviewer and person I've talked to
though is Elric don't judge them by the
sound initially so we're not going to do
that I will play you the sound through
them today but I've been told by others
that they definitely need to be burnt in
for a minimum of 24 hours to get the
sound going good so we're gonna unbox
them we'll give you initial sound check
today and then we'll come back to in a
couple days after I burn them in and
we'll reel issen to them and see how the
change is so with that said let's change
angles and let's take this pre little
thing out of its pretty box
all right folks now let's jump into part
two we take a look at the box here we
can see the front of it we have the
crossfade LP over here noise isolating
metal headphones the sound is phenomenal
and actually from everything I've read I
actually believe it I think that's gonna
be the case here you can hear have a
lifetime warranty on some of the stuff a
one-year warranty and others the v-moda
logo now the version I got are white I
thought these ones look really really
cool and they happen to be the ones that
were in sales so that was good as well
show you some more parts of the box
right here I know some people could
really give a rat's ass about this but
other people do so I'm going to show it
because those people who do care I don't
want to cut them out of having the
experience and that's what this is
really all about the experience of
getting the package seeing what the
package is and then unboxing it it's
pretty much an experience type video
I hope you guys do understand that so
here we're gonna go take my new trusty
knife now you guys have also been asking
me where I've been getting my knives
well I found a place in the point eight
hills mall here in Hacienda Heights
California and it's called pure blades
and they sell so many different kinds of
knives great sales that that's just
where I'm going so we'll go ahead and
take it out go ahead and take a small
incision right here in the front very
simple one that's taken care of okay
button see the blade make sure you push
one thing about this blade to that you
don't put it the right way hit don't go
and there we go so flip it around they
actually a little thing here to clip
open pop this open right here this is
the most radical tape I've ever seen on
any unboxing and I can see actually here
folks that the whole inside thing is
actually solidly sealed so I thought it
was gonna be nice and easy but it's not
I'm gonna have to cut this as well so I
guess it's not meant to totally come out
that box stays in I'm just gonna leave
it in I guess you're not supposed to
take it out so my bad on that so
anybody's gonna buy these remember you
don't need me to cut that it's not even
part of it it's just the external box so
everything else dumps out on the table
we'll start out right here so here we
take a look at some of the nomenclature
that comes inside it says crossfade
customs now you guys can go online and
the little shields on the headphones can
all be changed to custom colors I
actually ordered some red ones they'll
be coming in I'll change that in another
video you can also change out get boom
mic you can get different cushions all
kinds of different stuff here's the back
now this right here to me is a complete
total ripoff now I'll tell you guys out
there if somebody can tell me what this
is and what this is a ripoff of I'll
give you a free prize cuz this is
definitely a ripoff guy singing a chair
wind blowing by them let's see how many
of you guys know what the hell I'm
talking about set that off the side now
we get into the nitty-gritty so check
this out
the whole headphones come in this really
cool package if you look at the detail
real close you'd honestly think this is
something might belong to spider-man I
could actually see these headphones
being part of spy gear you know when
somebody wants to rock out my use
web-spinning around New York I can see
that happening can't you
you know spider-man's real right yeah
come on all right in here we got the
little cleaning cloth and everything
that's come to the side here go ahead
and just pop this out of here
hi he's plastic there we go
all right get that then we've got the
paws please do not return to retailer so
basically if you have a problem with
these headphones it asked you to not
return them - you bought them from but
to return them directly to the
manufacturer it's just some paperwork
not too much to it the cleaning cloth
and now we'll get into the actual heart
of the matter the headphones themselves
so let's unzip this thing no pup little
clam shell open oh man this looks nice
I'm actually even thinking about me even
changing my thumbnail now this this
actually is it looks really cool inside
of here check it out accessories up here
on top let me go ahead and just pull
this out a few folks now the cabling and
everything on this very very well made
I'm trying to this in for close to the
camera gold-plated on the ends
fully braided cable got your volume
control pause and mute all right here
you guys can see that
very very nicely done on this definitely
a thumbs up so far go ahead we'll pull
this here's some more accessories inside
of here I'll go ahead and pull this out
you get another wire right here and then
you get your adapter jack so this one
right here this is your 3.5 millimeter
those are going to most your common
stuff and you've got your large one your
quarter-inch in case you're using home
recording equipment or stuff like that
so you get both another braided cable
cool stuff then we get to the headphones
themselves now come on folks these
things look awesome
you pull the plastic off the side here
get a really nice close-up there you may
be one second bear with me folks I try
to rip the plastic off all right here we
go
check this out man
I mean that is bad ass I don't care who
you are
that looks freaking awesome that is just
totally cool-looking metal all up here
metal screws metal
again metal on the plate heavy-duty
plastic the rim very stretchable inside
you guys can see the cups they're gray
speakers back behind him
all right folks one thing to take note
of is inside the headphones you can see
they tell you where left and right is a
lot of headphone companies don't tell
you this they just let you assume how it
is this one shows you what is right and
what is left then they go on my head
very very comfortable very nice on the
ears night this bar on top my head feels
really really nice the adjustment as you
can see is right here so for bigger
heads or smaller heads these feel good
so now I'm going to take these things
plug them in and we'll give you what we
call sound test alpha non broken in
headphones let's jump to that next
alright folks so here we go let's take a
listen these and remember these are not
broken these are straight out of the box

the base and really heavy on the treble
