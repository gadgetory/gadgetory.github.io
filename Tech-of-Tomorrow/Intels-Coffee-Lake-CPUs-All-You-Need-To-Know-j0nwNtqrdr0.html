again to the channel now unless you've
just been gone or not paying attention
intel has finally released the launch
dates and all of the new SKUs for their
eighth generation of desktop processors
that's right so now we finally see the
launch of coffee Lake now we all know
that cabi lake really sucked and kind of
made Intel really look bad for the first
time honestly Intel look just really
really crappy now will coffee like fix
all of these things I really hope that
it does now there are some caveats
however to this launch you won't be able
to use the motherboards that you're
using with Cambria Lake whatsoever so
you're gonna have to get brand new 370
motherboards which means you know
another investment you're not just gonna
be able to take your old board and slap
this processor on there and that kind of
sucks but we've seen this happen many
times in the past is they change around
the architecture to get us to buy
another motherboard with our CPU but
these CPUs from what I hear are running
very very fast they got nice TDP on them
hopefully we're gonna see across the
board that coffee lake is just the
newest and latest greatest thing from
Intel but also something that makes
Intel look really good as well so with
that said though let's jump right in
let's talk about those different SKUs
and what hopefully we're gonna see with
the new 8th gen processors the six Q's
that in devs going to be dropping on us
on October 5th will be these at the
bottom of the list we have the i3 8100
now this has 4 cores 4 threads a base
clock speed of 3.6 gigahertz and
absolutely no turbo whatsoever 6
megabytes of level 3 cache it does have
a nice low TDP however of 65 watts and
hopefully we're gonna see this processor
come to market at about 117 dollars on
top of that we see the i3 8350 K once
again we see four cores four threads a
base clock of 4 gigahertz but absolutely
no turbo once again 6 megabytes in the
level 3 cache and a TDP of 91 watts this
one's gonna be coming to market at about
a hundred and seventy dollars now as far
as the i5 s go and the entry-level i5
will be the i5 8400 six cores six
threads a base clock of 2.8 gigahertz
one thing to take note of the turbo on
this is a little bit different with all
the cores we see a turbo of 3.8
gigahertz but with a single
core we see four gigahertz nine
megabytes of level three cache it has a
TDP of 65 watts and a price tag of about
a hundred and eighty-two dollars next up
in the i-5 lineup is the i-5 8600 this
is actually the CPU that I currently
have in-house for testing once a game we
see six cores six threads a base clock
speed of 3.6 gigahertz all cores engaged
4.1 gigahertz one core engaged 4.3 Gertz
on the turbo nine megabytes of level 3
cache a TDP of 95 watts and a price of
about 260 dollars and the
top-of-the-line SKUs we see the i7 8700
a 6 quart 12 threaded processor with a
base clock speed of 3.2 a turbo boost
with all cores at 4.3 and with a single
core at 4.6 gigahertz level 3 cache is
at 12 mega bytes and the TDP is 65 watts
with a price tag of around three hundred
and three dollars and then last up the
i7 8700 K between 6 cores 12 threads a
base clock speed of 3.7 gigahertz
all-court turbo at 4.3 single core turbo
at four point seven gigahertz 12
megabytes of level 3 cache TDP at 95
watts and a price tag of around 360
dollars
intel says that the i7 8700 K will be
their absolute best desktop gaming
processor to date offering 25% better
frames per second and 45% better
multitasking than the previous
generation CPUs so that's really really
cool it's also the very first time that
we've seen Intel have a four core i3 and
a six core i5 in terms of sheer gaming
these new until six core CPUs have a lot
of potential they're gonna do very well
in multi-threaded applications they have
higher clock speeds much better
overclocking potential so I really think
the 1600 X is going to find their
competition with these new CPUs alright
folks so there you have it but I think
the biggest question on all of our minds
is will Intel redeem themselves after
such a crappy a scabby lake launch I
mean that was just a disaster in fact I
gotta be honest with you folks so far
the year of 2017 has been the year of
disappointment
disaster we've just seen it with all
kinds of releases taking forever to come
out from both sides from both AMD and
from Intel we both see them kind of
lagging putting stuff out that's just
kind of lackluster I'm really really
hoping though that coffee leak will get
rid of all those problems and bring
Intel back into the limelight with a
smile on our faces now I can't actually
bring you my test results as of yet but
back behind me on this little test bench
back here we'll bring a video guys and
show you guys what all that we use for
our testing and everything for these
current tests that are coming out but
right now it's looking really nice we've
got our 8600 on the board I'm going to
get my i7 but what we're seeing so far
and what we're hearing though is that
the i7 87 or K is really going to be
real competitive price-wise to the 1600
X and that's really you know how I do my
testing I like doing dollar-for-dollar
testing so we'll be testing the 1600 X
against Intel's latest i7 8700 K and
seeing who the real winner is at the end
of the day for your money so what do you
guys think are you guys looking forward
to coffee like and going yeah hell yeah
or are you kind of like going on man I
gotta buy another motherboard and
that'll again you just like kinda like
yeah forget about Intel where's your
guys's mindset cuz inquiring minds like
mine I want to know so like usual leave
a comment down below tell me what you
guys think I love to hear your guys
opinions because hey I'm here to learn
just like you peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
