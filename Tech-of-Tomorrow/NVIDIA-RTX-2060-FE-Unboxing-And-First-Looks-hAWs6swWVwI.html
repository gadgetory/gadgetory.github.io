hit the market now this particular card
is the brand-new r-tx 2060 founders
edition coming to market at three
hundred and forty-nine dollars so let's
real quick though let's take a quick
look of the card and also that comes
inside the box not really a lot I don't
think it's going to come into the box at
all considering this an you know a
review sample from Nvidia probably when
you buy something from the retails are
probably you include more stuff but
let's open up the box and let's check
out the car because it does look pretty
mean so let's go ahead and just take the
cap off set it over here take a nice
close look at the card you guys can see
it has a really nice design to fans in
the front the card is actually nine
inches long by four inches high
obviously it's a two slot design card
very nice card very powerful card I love
the fact that it has a great backplate
on the back of it this is completely
wonderful as far as I'm concerned all in
all this card looks very nice single
eight pin power connector on the back of
it it's recommended that you have at
least 160 watt power supply to power
this bad boy we're gonna do a whole full
review on that so we'll talk about more
of that stuff later right now we're just
showing you guys a quick unboxing here
you guys can see where all the
connectors go on the card pretty simple
stuff the same as all the other cards
we've seen in the r-tx series all in all
just a pre coolican card now as far as
the box goes contents not really much at
all you can see there's not much there
there's this little tiny little box
right here and I will go ahead and pull
this little tiny box out for you guys
the last time we saw one of these all it
contained was manuals and yeah it looks
like this is pretty much going to be the
same thing there's nothing else inside
the box this is empty compartment so we
just have you know pretty much too
little manuals and I think that pretty
much all the people that are watching my
channel probably would never even look
at these they know how to hook up a car
to install all that stuff but the really
big news about this product is it's an
entry-level card
it's $349 supposed to be able to play
battlefield 5 on Ultra settings
including all of the new features and
everything all turned on the DL SS you
know so we will see that when we do the
testing but for now
here's everything that comes in the box
of the r-tx 2060 founders edition not a
lot but hey at $349 we're gonna have to
see how it really does against the
competition so stay tuned and check out
our next video where we bring you guys
all the fun facts about this card peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
