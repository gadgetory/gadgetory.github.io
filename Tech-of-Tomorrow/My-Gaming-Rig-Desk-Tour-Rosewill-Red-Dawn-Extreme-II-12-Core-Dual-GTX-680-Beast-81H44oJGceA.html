Ark here once again the ticket amor
youtube channel now I get lots of
questions all the time from people what
do you use for your hardware now for
some of you people that have probably
been around the block a couple times you
know I'm talking about you may have seen
this before if not let me introduce you
to my gaming area and my system the
Rosewill Red Dawn extreme - that's right
it's invigorated it's faster it's better
it's stronger it's more mighty than the
previous version
hence number two so anyways we'll start
out on my desktop gaming area we're at
the bat and we go over here we can see I
have my keyboard now this keyboard right
here is very cool this is cool master
just trigger I love this thing it's
great for typing great for gaming next
up we have their mousepad and on top of
that the Sentinel Mouse that's right all
pretty cool stuff for my speakers I have
the alt text e11 said these things are
very nice I know people talk a lot of
 but I love them for my monitor I
have the Dell this is the u3 0:11 the
30-inch monitor you guys have all seen
it at many many places now with that
stuff said that's all my stuff on this
particular place I have like three or
four different areas I have in the house
where I do different videos and show
different stuff but for this one this is
my main personal gaming area and to be
honest with you lately I haven't been
playing high tech games I've been
playing this game called torchlight 2
but with that said now let's jump in
let's turn on the Red Dawn - here behind
me and let's talk about the specs of
this badass machine or everybody let's
start off with the outside so as far as
the case goes I'm using the Rose will
Black Hawk ultra now this case has been
custom painted by a friend of ours you
can see it has a really like blood-red
color so we'll start off right at the
front and we'll begin with some of the
cooling products by our friends at swift
tech we have the Malstrom this is their
totally nice reservoir you can see
inside of it it's got colored fluid
inside of it this moment will probably
change that for something different
above that we have the Asus this is the
DVD RW Drive above that we have the roll
little card reader so now let's move
around to the back we can see we have a
custom grill by Bill Owens here in the
back of the case nothing else to modern
out about that we'll go around the side
here you can see we have a clear window
here so you can see right inside of the
case now let's talk about all the parts
inside of the case we have the SRX
motherboard from EVGA that is the
backbone of the system then we have two
five 2600 CPUs these are the Zeon's we
have two of those both being cooled by
this latest Swift Tec Apogee two drives
you can see both those things in there
they light up they're pretty cool we're
using a lot of different custom cooling
components all the way including up at
the top we have another component that
we have from Swift tech which is the
radiator for our main boot up drive we
have the Revo drive 3 from OCZ you can
also see we have 128 gigabytes that's
right of Patriots latest Viper memory
these are all eight gigabyte sticks all
the way across the board pretty
incredible now as our main storage
drives we have two of the latest hyper X
drives from the people over at Kingston
that's right these are their 480
gigabyte versions we have two of these
in raid 0 now as far as video cards go
you can see we have a matching pair of
EVGA geforce gtx 680 s we're running
these in standard sli mode there's also
all kinds of custom cabling to the
system but another really important part
is the sound card we're using the asus
zone our essence STX this thing's really
incredible provides excellent sound for
either gaming music whatever you want to
do so alright fans there you have it
this is my primary gaming system now
there are going to be some changes being
made to the system
me and my hookup guy Anthony we just
haven't been able to get together and
get it together but basically I'm gonna
be changing out all of the tubing in it
to all red tubing going to be going back
and using some different Swift tech
stuff for the in
side cooling and that's about it as far
as the changes go we're just gonna be
redoing the cooling system as it is
right now though even with the stuff
we've got in there it's Windows now
booting up you guys all recognize the
friendly sound of Windows right anyways
that's it booting up I've got some of
the components over here right to the
side that I actually used in the
builders that I just throw them out
there because I have extra ones these
particular ones but if you guys like
this video I hope you do if so hit that
like button you guys also saw we have
the 70,000 sub contest going on so make
sure your sub the channel so you don't
miss that shiz neck like usual you can
buy any these components and put them
together yourself you can actually even
buy a custom window set and put it in
yourself it's about 40 to 50 bucks just
takes a little bit of time and effort
but it can be done even by somebody at
home I know you're saying yourself how
can I do that but believe me with the
right cheap tools you can become a
modder in your own garage how do you
think people like Bill Owens got started
they didn't start at the top of the
world
they start out probably in their garage
and then move to the top of the world
you know I'm saying
so anyways I'm Eric thank you guys I'll
see you guys back in the channel and
we're going to reiterate all of the
performance of the system I will go over
video cards the hard drive speeds
everything else that's in the system in
future videos I'm also going to bring
Brack another video the black samurai
with features dual kimono cooling
systems from the people at swift tech as
well so with that said I'm gonna go back
here and do probably goof around so see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
