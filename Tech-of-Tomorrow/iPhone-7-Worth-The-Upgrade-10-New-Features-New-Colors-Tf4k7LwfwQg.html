here once again now i know that most of
my audience is pc enthusiasts and so you
guys probably didn't even go check out
what was going on today over with apple
and they had a lot of stuff that they're
releasing and talking about their new
iOS iOS 10 talking about a lot of stuff
they're doing including a brand new
watch and obviously the brand new iphone
7 and iphone 7 plus finally officially
here in all the news what's really cool
though is that i know that even though a
lot of my fans are pc guys you guys do
have apple watches and you guys have
iphones just the fact that's why
sometimes in my head you guys hear me
called new Apple phone the i7 because in
my head units apple iphone 7 i 7 may it
makes sense to me I just kind of combine
the two and throw it out there so big
news though for a lot of people out
there who into gaming and obviously
Apple is gearing everything with their
new iphone and their new watch towards
gaming fitness help all that kind of
stuff they're actually trying to change
more than just the device apples really
trying to like make their device be a
part of like your life and interact with
your life there are really some cool
features about the watch that I think
that anybody out there is going to
really like and what's really amazing
though is that a few years ago before
they release the Apple watch if you go
and you look at the sales and all the
companies that were doing business in
just 18 months later Apple is only
underneath Rolex in renal Rolex you guys
all know is like that's like you know
the rolls-royce of watches it's the
absolute best so the only company
actually selling more watches than Apple
prick and rolex so that's just like
really crazy crazy stuff and there's two
types of watch that are actually going
to be coming out one that's from Nike
that's totally geared for running people
which has features that are all geared
for them and it's more than just like
capturing the metrics and stuff it
actually gets to know you and measure
your stuff for you personally which is
really kind of cool and I have to admit
it when these things come out I'm going
to buy one it's just it's just that
badass now for gamers out there and for
fans of Nintendo oh man here let me give
my honor straight up oshiro
because like Nintendo when I was a kid
that was this the Zelda all that
stuff and now Nintendo that's right it's
coming to the App Store so you guys will
be able to buy stuff from the app store
including two new games that they have
out one of them called Super Mario run
and the thing that's really cool about
the game is everything can be done with
one hand because the character is
constantly running so basically instead
of have to push a button to make
yourself run you're always going to the
right so all you do is let's move around
and tap the button and the taptic button
on the phone is so responsive that
you're able to play mario with one hand
so you could like basically eat a
cheeseburger and playing mario pick your
nose and play mario scratch your butt
play mario do all kinds of stuff all
with one hand and it's going to be
pretty dang cool stuff that's going to
be operating on your iPhone so any of
those device out there your iPad your
iPhone man I don't know if it's going to
work on the new the new watch but hey
it's really cool stuff so if you're a
fan of Nintendo and you like Mario any
like you know the idea of doing
something one-handed other than jerk and
often hey you can now play Mario so all
right the new watch is coming out now
this is the new Apple there there what
is it there Apple watch series 2 and
their series ones products are actually
going to go down in price and include
the new dual core processor that's
inside of their new series to watch I'm
going to go over everything the people
over at Apple did because I know my
audience isn't going to care about all
that but this let's say this everything
on the new Apple watch it features their
new watch OS three so this is going to
be all their latest technology and
everything about it is geared towards
your life it's towards fitness keeping
healthy monitoring what you're doing you
know just that's really it's like I said
before it's meant to be a part of your
life and the prices on these things are
not all that expensive you can get the
entry-level models coming in at about
three hundred and sixty nine dollars and
what's really cool is they have new
colors and this new totally ceramic
finish so they have one made out of
aluminum and now they have one that's
made of a completely new technology
that's a ceramic finish and it looks
really cool with a bunch of different
bands so if you're looking for something
that's going to be a watch
not only going to just tell you the time
it's really being integrated in your
life this is it there's a new thing
coming out that's called it's a home app
and it's going to be pretty cool
basically when you walk in your home any
device out there that has this little
logo on it from apple will be able and
you can control your entire smart home
through your new phone or your new Apple
watch so to me that's actually pretty
innovative because you guys seem we've
talked about smart homes here on
technical manager or midlet we excuse me
we've talked about smart homes many
times here on Tekra tomorrow my old
place you saw we insult cameras we
installed all kinds of ring doorbells
all kinds of stuff you know leading up
to a very new smart house now the house
we moved to is much better has much
improved alarm security features and
with these new features that are in the
new watching os3 I'd actually be able to
buy products that as soon as I walked
into my house they would automatically
sync up with my watch on my smartphone
and I'd be able to control all those
things from the simplicity of either one
of my smart devices and that's just
really cool stuff like I said before
there'll be two versions they'll be the
standard watch that you can get and
they'll also be the Nike version of the
watch now the nike one like i said
before is geared totally towards
runner's people that are doing running
type stuff it's totally modified to
learn about you and show that stuff so
we'll get past the watches if you guys
obviously want to see more you can
search that information on the internet
but now let's really talk about where
we're here to talk about I know so many
people out there do have an iPhone my
mom has an iphone most of my friends
have an iphone but me and G we're still
on our s5s I guess we're old-school but
now let's talk about the top 10 new
features about the apple iphone 7
feature number one the apple iphone 7
features a new innovative design that's
unlike any other iphone that you've ever
seen with the recess camera recessed
button and features that just take it
above and beyond anything you've seen
before you guys can see that the entire
thing is made of sleek sleek nice
material and it's one of the most
beautiful pieces of phones to ever hit
the market to achieve the brilliant and
smooth exterior of the brand new iphone
7 Apple uses a series of new techniques
to achieve this first of all they buffed
the phone with the new polymer that
actually becomes part of the phone and
they use a series of
different buffing processes that
actually make the phone not only look
nice but make it actually more dust and
water-resistant and they also feature a
stainless steel Apple logo feature
number to an improved home button which
actually features improved sensitivity
and the latest epic engine now this
taptic engine can be programmed by
third-party vendors to make their apps
work they're absolutely best through
your home button so now the home button
is going to be simpler than ever to use
and the way that it responds to the
touch of your thumb it's going to work
really well in all kinds of different
gaming's we require multi tapping and
things like that so for those people who
really use the home button a lot which
is something I think almost everybody
does the new iphone 7s home button will
be the most ergonomic and responsive of
any iphone to date now feature number
three of the iphone 7 is a brand new
enclosure that is not only
water-resistant ip67 it's also dust
resistant now this feature is great for
you swimmers klutzes or drunks who might
just happen to like fall in a pool drop
your phone in the toilet or do just
something silly unlike diving into the
ocean with your phone so beyond going
deep-sea diving I think you're good to
go feature number four to me is honestly
one of the absolute best things that
it's getting updated on the new iphone 7
there are going to be two different
versions of cameras on both the iphone
and may i phone plus i'm talking about
iphone 7 versions obviously there'll be
a 12 megapixel back camera now the big
between the plus and the standard camera
is on the plus you actually get two
different lenses you get the standard
lens plus you get a 12 megapixel
telephoto lens on the plus now the plus
is going to be the absolute most
incredible thing that I have ever seen
on an iPhone I've never purchased an
iphone ever before but I gotta say on
this round with the watches and the
phones I'm actually going to go ahead
and take the dive I'm going to buy one
the iphone + 7 version is just amazing
new image stabilization 1.8 aperture
lots of true tone color stuff you can
actually do all kinds of editing and
crazy stuff on the phone it's so
powerful the camera features are just
incredible you also get a
megapixel you know selfie camera on the
front and the really cool thing though
is just how well the camera works in the
low life you can see that when they are
taking pictures with this camera it just
looked incredible and I can't wait to
get my hands on them personally just to
do a video for you guys on the camera
features of this new iphone 7 so new
iphone 7 new iphone 7 plus brand new
camera brand new features lots of
editing tools just really killer stuff
will be doing a totally separate video
talking about all the cameras stuff
showing you how it's using all that but
that'll be for another day today we're
just talking to you about the top 10
features and like i said to me the new
cameras are the shizz nick and i think
you're going to like him even if you're
not an apple fan feature number five is
basically an updated HD retina display
it's not reinventing the wheel or
anything but basically they're just
taking advantage of features and using
them they're absolutely best capacity
now the new iphone 7 will feature quick
touch and quick touch live and you can
use quick touch live for something like
instagram stories which is pretty cool
so it's really just a much better screen
and I don't know if I mentioned it on
the video but obviously they'll be on
the phones two different versions.the
4.7 inch screen will be for the iphone 7
and the 5.5 screen will be for the
iphone 7 plus but obviously all this new
technology of new HD retina screens will
be included in both of these models the
new Retina screen does offer something
that's actually an improvement and
that's a 25-percent brighter screen so
if you're in the daylight and stuff and
you can't really see something having
25% brighter screen will be something
that'll definitely be an improvement
feature number six for you audio fans
out there this is going to be a big one
because that's right the new apple
iphone 7 has stereo speakers one located
at the top one located on the bottom for
perfect stereo separation and it's
rumored that these things are going to
sound really really incredible so if
you're at the gym listen to Spotify and
just jam into your music you no longer
have to listen to headphones to get
stereo sound it's all going to come
direct from your iPhone feature number 7
so we were right now rumor
video gone are the days of an analog
audio port this has been replaced by the
lightning bolt connector but the
lightning bolt connector is much better
provides power and all kinds of stuff
and there are just many devices around
the world that use this including new
products from Apple that you'll be able
to charge off that lightning port so
bye-bye to the old analog port but the
good news is this if for some reason you
have an old pair of analog headphones
you lose the ones that come with your
new iphone 7 because they're coming with
the set of new headphones so what you
know is without ding ding ding you'll
have a little adapter that comes inside
the box so that you can actually use
your old analog headphone so whoo even
though you can't actually plug it
directly in if you're still get your old
sponge Sparrow Square Bob cheap ones you
got from Kmart you can still use them
feature number 8 Apple airheads now i'm
just joshin apple air patna water air
pods now air pods are the latest and
greatest development from Apple
regarding wireless technology in their
headphones these things are completely
redesigned from the ground up and they
feature apples brand-new w1 wireless
connectivity which means that these
things are going to connect you're not
going to get that drop out and
everything like that because it's
hardware based technology which means
you know if you like before when you had
drop off and things cut off all that
stuff should actually be eliminated by
their new w one chip now these things
are going to be sold separately they're
not going to actually come in the box of
your iphone 7 that's kind of a bummer
right there you do get headphones in the
box but you won't be getting these
particular ones but as far as sound
quality goes there supposed to be
completely redesigned and what's really
cool is that they only activate when
they're put inside your ears so by
infrared when you put them inside your
ears that's how they're activated and to
connect them there's not a whole bunch
of series of steps there's just one
simple step you hit a button called
connects and that's it you're connected
no searching through your devices
looking for things you put it next to
your phone put it next to your Wi-Fi
boom you're up you're going a couple of
more cool things about the air pods
you're going to get five hours of
continuous playback time and you'll also
get an option for doing a double click
to contact Siri when using your
and the best thing of all is that the
battery and charger are all inside the
case you can take it with you on the go
anywhere you go now I know most the PC
crowd is all into the paypal scene but
Apple pay is actually growing growing
growing it's going worldwide that's
actually soon going to be in Japan so if
your folks out there you use Apple pay
well Apple pay will be even more better
and more integrated in iOS 10 feature
number 10 last but not least but in my
eyes the most important of all other
than those film features and that is the
performance now the a-10 fusion process
that's coming out in the brand new
iphone 7 is going to be the most robust
and fastest processor that will be on
the phone market ever ever ever now will
somebody come up with something fast in
the future who knows but for now the
brand new a10 fusion processor is a
64-bit four core processor that is
definitely going to be kicking ass
across the board and it's done in a new
and efficient manner there's actually
two cores that are high efficiency cores
these run at one-fifth of the power and
then you will have two high-performance
course that run at forty percent faster
than an a nine and two times faster than
an a8 now along with all this stuff is
going to be improved stuff across the
board in gaming and actually it's going
to help in some ways in your haptic
sensitivity and that home button because
you're going to get something like force
feedback so when you're playing a game
and you get shot and stuff like that you
will actually be able to feel that
through the home button just like you do
to your force feedback joystick which is
pretty cool another thing that's really
cool is that the brand new a10 fusion
processor is a hundred and twenty
percent faster than the very first
iphone ever released with these things
are going to include improved battery
life and just improve performance all
the way across the board one thing
that's really cool that I'm seeing with
the a-10 fusion processor is the ability
to use Lightroom right on your phone now
this has never been able to be achieved
before but now with the new a10 fusion
processor you'll be able to actually do
that kind of processing power right from
the palm of your hand with your brand
new iphone 7
and like i said before folks battery
life is definitely improved on the
iphone 7 you get two additional hours of
usage than your iphone 6s and one hour
additional usage on your iPhone 6s plus
as far as pricing goes the iphone 7 will
be 649 and the iphone 7 plus will be 769
there's also some pretty cool things
going on for those people looking out
there to use the upgrade program apple
offers an upgrade program so for those
people who joined in you'll be able to
trade your I 6n and get a brand new
iphone 7 that's pretty cool stuff also
if you're looking to have a carrier here
we show you a bunch of different
examples of how much the cost is going
with your local or your standard carrier
providers onboard memory is also getting
a boost with the iphone 7 and iphone 7
plus gone are the days of 16 gigabyte
entry-level models now we're going to
see 32 gigabytes 128 gigabytes and then
256 gigabytes which is just great and in
fact the iphone 6s are now going to be
changed and their entry-level will now
be at 32 gigabytes as well which is
really cool so I my tech fans there you
have it the top 10 reasons why you're
going to want to check out the brand new
iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus now those
earbuds or air pods as they're called
are going to be coming into market at
about a hundred and fifty dollars you'll
be able purchase them separately on sep
