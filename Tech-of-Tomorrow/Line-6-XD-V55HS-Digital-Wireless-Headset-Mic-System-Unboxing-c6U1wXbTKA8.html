TECA tomorrow once again now you guys
missed it we showed our band practice
this weekend some of you guys liked it
some you guys hated it hey if you guys
get mad about comments let me just tell
you this I don't care if you say my band
sucks I can take that all day long but
when you start telling me what videos
and what I can and can't post on my
channel come on you're way out of line
do I go to your channel and tell you one
know what to do no I don't I don't go to
your channel and tell you what to do you
come into my channel tell me what to do
even though you're my subscriber is kind
of rude I appreciate all my subscribers
thumbs up you guys know I give you guys
prizes and all kinds of all the
time to thank you so a mellow out you
think my band sucks you know like heavy
metal I can deal with that honestly lots
of people think we suck we do suck so
what we have fun doing it big deal so
check it out today we're gonna be
unboxing of something really cool back
here I got the xdv 55 HS now there's a
totally wireless headset from the people
over at line six it's coming to market
at about $450 to $500 where you buy it
at now when you guys saw our last video
nobody was singing but me but actually
everybody else in the band actually
sings the drummer sings the bass player
sings a to guitar player saying we used
to have enough microphones so now we've
got enough to at least get the drummer
which is this bad boy B hence the
wireless and we've got two others for
the other guys now I'm gonna take a
quick drink of my apple juice here and
then we'll jump in this unboxing
all right so like usual and the unboxing
we got a box that's right every good
unboxing has a box I wonder why that is
I guess they kind of go together hand in
hand mutual symbiotic relationship right
on the cover they show the receiver the
transceiver and the headset not much in
the box take a look at the back of the
box we can see it says digital wireless
headset microphone system now the X DV
55 HS it offers something different it
offers digital wireless most of the
other ones that you see out there use a
type of broadband radio frequency thing
which can get interrupted this is pure
unrestricted sound just like it says
says 2.4 gigahertz broadcast worryfree
license-free true 24-bit performance 1
step set up fourth generation digital
wireless there's a lot of their stuff
right here I know you guys hate to read
the box so I'm not gonna read it I'm
just gonna have a cameraman focus in
there and I'll just leave it there for a
second you guys can just check that out
some take it down here flip the cap
we've got a cardboard container here
which I'm now going to cut the Camerons
head off with no I'm just joking it
didn't cut his head off
bummer no I mean I mean thank God all
right here we go
I'm gonna open it up here are the two
little wireless antenna goodies these
are gonna pop on to the receiver so you
can get the reception there right up
here on top now I just want to show you
guys folks that these things also if
you're in desperate need of martial arts
weapons these things can become weapons
in case of emergencies like right now
watch I'll poke the Camerons eye on it
he'll scream see it works no these
things screw on they're flexible they
move around they're gonna sit like it
you know this other thing and bite and
put it together but they're gonna be
like this or you can hook them on just
like this take me to your leader he's
just being a crazy man all right we got
that we've got all the warranty stuff it
was updated in 2005 hmm quite a while do
you think needs to be thinking changes
to 2012 that'd be better register online
little sticker right here some more
stuff you guys really don't care too
much about that stuff
here is the xdv 55 digital wireless
pilot's handbook that's right man
de piel Asajj pillow Tynan han buck
pre-law tenon handbook manual del buy
lotto and I hope I said those right if I
didn't I apologize hey we get a little
DC charger right here the line six DC
one that's right it's the DC one so like
a plane go ahead and get that bad boy
out of there it's gonna plug in the back
of your unit this is gonna pull into a
power receptacle or into a little thing
with two rats that generates electricity
depending on with you know sentry you're
living in it's out of the way two
batteries these are going to go
obviously and this right here so I'm
gonna skip to that here is the little
transceiver it's actually heavy little
bastard this one had great ratings
though hence the reason why we got it
the Rings this were totally awesome so
let's see here here's the batteries go
I'm gonna set this down ones positive
ones negative this one's positive the
ones the farthest out you can say put a
little thinking we did with the nipple
you wouldn't want to have it that way a
little perverts now I've turned it on
you guys can see that it's on channel
one blue light indicates the power cool
stuff nope just click to the left or
right on this side turns it off sorry
don't mean to be boring there folks for
a second just trying to make sure
everything's cool now this headset is
gonna go on my drummer's head and it's
pretty interesting the way that it works
it's very very lightweight you can
hardly even feel that you're wearing it
whatsoever
it sits on right here now I know the
microphone is like off to the side not
really in front of your mouth
it probably picks up more jaw tone but
we'll have to see that it might be more
Majesta ball but it's very comfortable
you can't even feel it on your head
whatsoever this parts going to plug in
to this and you're going to hook this up
to your body so you're gonna plug this
into this and it's gonna go in your body
and that's how you're gonna send your
trend signals for your vocals now this
thing looks like it's somewhat
adjustable for the microphone part
that's the part a lot to be looking at
more because I know my drummers going to
want it more to the front of his mouth
but we'll get him that later after he
puts it on his head but should be pretty
cool it's very lightweight then last but
not least
we have the receiver dun dun dun dun dun
dun dun and there it is it's back in
black this is the front of the unit so
you get your channel control right here
very simply choose your power on and off
button of a dynamic filter here did you
click that on/off spin it on the back
now maybe we talked about those two
original antennas so then basically to
put these on it's very simple you just
click it on here and just slides right
on very easily you can lock it or unlock
it depending on how you want to be but
there you go so on the back of it you
can see there are three separate plugs
one for the power in one for balanced
XLR and one for unbalanced quarter-inch
the only one I'm gonna be using is this
one because we're strictly using this
thing for the background vocals so
that's it folks
hey look for this thing we're gonna be
using it so you guys can actually hear
the sound quality next we can record our
next band practice then you guys can
check it out then thanks for watching
this has been the unboxing of the new XD
V 55 HS from the people over at line six
