Squarespace
fans friends welcome back once again to
TECA tomorrow we're bringing you all the
tech all the time so what tech is on the
table today well you guys all know that
AMD's released a lot of new video cards
lately to get your money now everybody's
been talking about the 290x it was
supposed to be you know by the fans I'll
say this the fans claimed it was the
Titan killer it wasn't quite but it was
still quite a damn card for the price
range but there's another card that came
out from these folks that's even better
and seems to be the absolute sweet spot
what card am I talking about I'm talking
about the new r9 290 this thing's priced
at about 399 dollars it's based on the
Hawaii and actually the Hawaii Pro
chipset it's gonna have 2560 stream
processors you know four gigabytes of
RAM all kinds of killer stuff is on this
card and it runs just a wee bit cooler
then it's big brother the 290 X and a
little bit quieter you know it's not
like the Sun and Moon but there is a
difference in it now instead of bringing
you guys a traditional unboxing today
I'm just gonna show you guys everything
that comes in the box without actually
taking it out of the box so let's pop
back behind me you guys can see
everything that comes the card the Box
the driver the warranty product guide on
and power supplies two cables for your
power supplying so you guys can see all
that instead of bringing out of the box
it's much simpler you guys can just see
all that it's quick easy no bullcrap so
with that said though let's actually
jump in now see the specs of this card
see the performance the heat and then
see at the end of the day why the new r9
290 is a card seriously worth your money
alright folks so let's first off talk
about the visual looks of the card now
you guys can see this thing's using a
reference cooler dual slot design ten
point eight three inches or 275
millimeters long now let's talk about
the speeds and feeds now this card has
2560 stream processors that's right 160
TM use
sixty-four ROPS and 40 compute units now
this thing comes to market with a core
clock speed of 947 megahertz with a
boost core of twelve hundred and fifty
megahertz the card also features four
gigabytes of gddr5 memory with a 512 bit
memory bus and a band with the 320
gigabytes a second it also has a memory
clock of 5000 megahertz effective the
card has a total TDP of 250 watts
it supports DirectX 11 point 2 opengl
4.3 opencl 1.2 and shader model 5.0 as
far as the rear i/o the car goes it
features two DVI ports a single HDMI
port and a single DisplayPort there you
have it all the technical details about
the new AMD XFX r9 290 now if that said
blitz us in the benchmark song walk out
and see how this car performs to get to
the competition
nope you guys are back alright sorry I
was rocking out there anyways why do you
guys always ask okay what is that song
how can I get it well that song is
called the human zoo it was written by
myself and my friends over at TLD we
combine up and wrote that song for you
folks and a lot of people go hey where
can we hear this thing hope you guys can
hear it over tech up tomorrow music calm

to the card you guys can see the 290
really kicks ass for how much it cost
versus the other cards like I said in
the beginning of the video which I kind
of gave it away guess this is the sweet
spot for the AMD card I gave my full-on
thumbs up editor's choice for this card
it's priced right it's fast it's still a
little bit hot still a little loud but I
know there's gonna be all kinds of cards
coming with aftermarket cooling so as
soon as those arrive this card's gonna
be just absolutely perfect and it's
gonna be worth the nine to twenty
dollars you guys paint for the extra
cooling this one right here they have it
