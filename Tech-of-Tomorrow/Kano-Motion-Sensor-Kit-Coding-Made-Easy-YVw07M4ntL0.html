who's always wanted to mess around with
coding even if it was in its simplest
form but we're just too afraid to jump
in or didn't really know how to jump
into it well today's video is brought to
you guys by a company called Kano and
they make great educational tools you've
seen a lot of videos here previous in
these my mom actually built an entire
thing she's 80 years old she put it all
together started coding having fun with
it today we're gonna be taking a look at
the motion sensor kit now with the
motion sensor kit obviously it's a
motion sensor so you're gonna be able to
use your hands to do all kinds of things
including doing your own custom coding
and building your own custom apps which
can be really cool plus this is rated
for ages 6 and up which means that a
small child all the way up to an old
child like myself can have fun having a
lot of different things going on whether
you want to play games mess with your
music I mean there's just let's just
jump in let's do the unboxing let's see
how we put it together and then let's
show you guys how you can code and how
much fun this can be either for a small
child or for the whole family because
let's just think about it you could
literally have family feud with the Kano
that way everybody in the family can be
coding and having fun at the same time
Kano says that this is pretty much one
of the simplest coding kits that they've
ever had and before and it's only $30 so
let's go ahead and just check out the
front of the box real quick you guys can
see it the back of the box we're all
begin doing the unboxing let's go ahead
just wish I had some longer nails
sometimes but hey can't have everything
okay so now we're gonna pop it open it
pops open like this on the front you
guys can see it says right here let's go
so I'll go ahead and pull this stuff out
of here just as so there so it's going
to come out up here's some cool
interesting little things in here as
well and they pull these out of here so
you guys can see them a lot of different
stickers and stuff kids love stickers so
it comes with some stickers this is
obviously gonna probably be the
installation put together guide
hopefully I can just figure this
my own butt though will seem so let's go
ahead and remove that now here is the
motion sensor kit itself so let's go
ahead and rest remove all this stuff out
of the box you've got a suction cup on
the bottom of here this is obviously
going to be the base yep it's nice and
snug on there
we've got see what's this going on this
this should probably be one of the
cables you the USB cable yep this
particular device is the USB cable and
then last but not least we have the
sensor unit itself putting together the
motion sensor kit is honestly easy-peasy
anybody can do it you have the base you
have the USB plug you have your sensor
you simply just plug your sensor in
which is really easy to do just plugs
right in on the bottom you'll see
there's two little buttons right there
you put those on there and then wallah
your sensor is ready to use and now all
you have to do is plug this into either
PC or Mac install the software which
will show you and then you can program
so let's go so after that easy assembly
which honestly a six-year-old could do
no problem next you need to go over to
their website and download the app now
one thing that's really cool is that
not only will this work with the sensor
kit it'll also work with the pixel kit
as well so you get multiple kits to
choose from when doing your programming
you guys can see that I set the sensor
right here on the laptop just making it
very easy for my hand to get over it
we've already installed the app so let's
go ahead and let's open it up it's gonna
ask you an - to put in your name and
after I put my name and I'll just go
ahead and continue all right so it says
nice to meet me Elric pic kit so you
guys can see that has pixel kit no
active kit it says motion sensor kit no
active kit you can code without a kit
there's also a camera kit which is
coming soon and a speaker kit which is
coming soon so that's kind of
interesting so let's go ahead and let's
jump into the motion sensor kit first
off
it's gonna go to tutorial nice little
introduction showing all the different
things that people can do in different
places you can actually set the motion
sensor pack that was trying to lick it
that was pretty funny alright so next up
it says were connected it's alright I'm
glad to be connected so let's continue
again now let's get my training started
ok well let's go ahead and continue move
my hand up and down just above the
sensor so even the tutorial is actually
pretty cool because look I'm already
making music
yeah even that alone is kind of fun
let's go ahead and continue and keep
programming
swipe my hand from left to right above
the sensor like a cruddy chop wax on wax
off wax on and wax off
no music with this one just some cool
effects so that was pretty simple and
painless let's continue now wants me to
create a Kano profile so now that we've
trained the motion sensor create an
account and all that good stuff it says
our training is complete and it's time
to jump in it says let's go so let's go
you guys can see it there are actually
quite a few different challenges and
meet this motion sensor I did one out of
four in another dimension has three air
guitar has four build a retro game has
five and last but not least something
called lerp II also has another
additional three challenges let's check
out the air guitar though because that
sounds like something I'd be into ask me
am I ready to rock I'm always ready to
rock
now starting off coding may seem a
little bit tedious but as you go along
you learn where everything goes and the
process becomes much faster so as you go
along you'll start recognizing all these
different symbols and things to do and
you'll become a coder in no time
one thing I have to say is really nice
is that sing something that you created
from the ground up actually work is
pretty cool and I know that kids who do
this will be very very exciting so
they'll be like hey check it out this
actually works and that's something
seeing that smile on their face and that
joy of them learning is something that's
completely priceless now I admit I'm an
adult I've seen other coding stuff but
this is pretty interesting in itself
everything is actually really easy to do
and like I said as you learn you're only
going to get better so eventually all
this stuff's going to become old hat and
you'll be doing it like it was
yesterday's news
and right now there are thousands of
ready-made creations ready to be remixed
by anyone if you're one of those people
out there who really loves puzzles and
challenges and you have a child who
feels the same way the Kano motion
sensor kit may just be right up your
alley and like I said before it'll work
with many different products in the Kano
universe doing the programming is also
very very easy one word I definitely
have to stress though is that it does
require a little bit of patience because
as you go through and you learn how to
code you get faster and faster and
faster one thing I would definitely
recommend is doing the challenges first
if you buy this because the challenges
give you an insight on how to do things
and how to do things more quickly
because after time as you're working
with the Kano system you'll understand
okay this goes here this goes there and
all the questions that you had in the
very beginning will be gone and you'll
find yourself coding faster and faster
and faster as you go along they also
have a lot of tools for doing building
stuff as well as all the projects that
they have in the challenges so if you're
looking for something educational
something that's really unique and that
the whole family can do together the K
no motion kit is definitely something
that would be up your alley and right
now for the next 30 days at checkout you
can use the code text number ten and get
10% off this already incredible price so
like I said before you love to build you
love to learn this is something that the
entire family can enjoy like I said the
age group is from six all the way up so
even a little tiny child not a baby but
a small child who's learning can get
into this graphs this and learn how to
code from the ground up and you as
parents you can get involved with this
as well and the whole family can sit
around and have challenges with this and
have a lot of fun together so like usual
have all this information down to the
like button so if you like what you see
hey you can buy one and get one and get
your family into coding see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
