it's Friday and like usual here at 2nd
tomorrow we've got something cool for
you guys that way you know if you're not
not going to a party and crazy you can
be putting the information into your
head so you guys know launch date of the
new haswell-e and the x99 platform all
coming out today now unfortunately for
us until this time in order to avoid NDA
held everything very very tight to their
chests and so well to have all these
systems put in there we're bringing to
you guys look at a slight beyond the
curve love a full system everything for
you guys just a day later which will be
tomorrow on ma√±ana for my latin fans
now with that said though today we're
going to talk about what exactly it is
what it's all about and what it's going
to be bringing to the table for you then
you can sleep and dream about and then
tomorrow you wake up you can come and go
oh wow
hey that's what a system did so instead
of just actually just putting a board in
the test system this time we built two
full-blown systems stuck to Windows 8.1
them both ran the tests comparisons and
we're gonna bring all those numbers to
you now before we go into the video why
not just send a special thanks out to
the people over at audible.com and if
you guys want to get your own personal
audio book for free
just go over to audible.com forward
slash tomorrow and check that stuff out
with that said let's jump in and let's
see what intel's brought to the table
with haswell-e and x99 so the first
thing to talk about is this is intel's
very first 8 core processor that's a not
isaiah 9om defencemen oh yeah AMD's had
it but for Intel this is their first
Nanjiani 8 core processor which means
that you can have 16 threads running all
at the same time and that's what
actually this processor comes into play
because in the hyper 30 and all that
kind of stuff is what this thing really
flexes its muscle gaming with this yeah
if you're gonna do a bunch of video
cards x9i is gonna be your band baby but
if you're somebody who's crunching
numbers doing all kinds of intense
application type things
that's where x99 is really gonna come
into play the workstation slash gaming
arena a key feature for enthusiasts out
there is these things come made to
overclock that's right these things are
geared to overclock it says right on
there
description overclocking enabled so you
people out there who wanted to get all
intents and do overclocking this is
gonna be a CPU you're gonna want to be
looking at on top of that x9 is also the
first desktop platform to bring ddr4 to
the table we have some Corsair 21 33
megahertz stuff that we've gotten ours
in its some seriously vengeful memory
now for you PCI Express enthusiasts out
there x99 offers 40 lanes of PCI e 3.0
availability now this thing's pretty
incredible because you can use four
discrete graphics cards in this and get
no bottleneck whatsoever in your CPU
which is what everybody's trying to
avoid so if you're looking to do that
Quad SLI or quad crossfire configuration
X 99 is which you're gonna be looking at
if you like that kind of stuff let's now
take a break from our regular scheduled
programming and take the trip back in
time to the earlier days we've now
arrived in 2003 where Intel had a single
core cpu with 1.7 million transistors
and was based off the 130 nanometer
process as we jump forward in time at
2005 we see the first dual-core CPU
based off the 19 an ohmmeter process a
year later in 2006 the first quad-core
CPU based off the 60 nanometer process
we jump ahead four years in time for the
first six core CPU based off the 32
nanometer process OOP all right now that
we've arrived back in 2014 with Intel's
latest haswell-e
which is the 8-core processor version we
see 2.6 billion transistors on the 22
nanometer process so you can see things
have come a long way baby now just to
clarify for you net pickers out there
this history lesson was based off of
intel's extreme processors real quickly
let's touch upon the cpu that we're
using an our test setup
this is Intel's latest Core i7 59 60 X
or extreme edition processor this is the
top of a line of the three that they're
releasing on this launch now taking a
closer look at that die we see the die
sizes 17 millimeters by twenty point two
millimeters it's 2.6 billion 22
nanometer
I hate 3d transistors and 20 megabytes
of Intel smart cache few folks out there
who kind of knew what is Intel smart
cache
essentially it's 20 megabytes spread
across all the cores for faster access
now with this launch there are three new
SKUs and let's check those out first up
we have the entry-level Intel Core i7
5820k this features six cores and twelve
threads it has a 3.3 dirty rats base
clock and 3.6 gigahertz herbo boost it
features 50 megabytes of cache 28 PCIe
lanes and retails at about $389 u.s.
next up is the mid-level Intel Core i7
59 30k this one also has six cores and
twelve threads the clock speed however
in this is boosted up it's at 3.5
gigahertz for the base and 3.7 gigahertz
for the turbo boost this also features
15 megabytes of cache and 40 PCIe lanes
and retails at about $583 u.s. now last
but not least the top-of-the-line Intel
Core i7 5960 extreme with 8 cores 16
threads base clock however is a lot
lower the base clock is 3.0 gigahertz
with a boost of 3.5 gigahertz I know
some people out there gonna go what oh
my god it's gonna be slower but no it's
not because those extra cores are gonna
pick up all that stuff and make it even
faster when it's processing information
the next feature is something that also
separates the 59 60 X from its two
brethren and that is this one comes with
20 megabytes of cache and retails for
about 999 dollars also real quick
because I know people are going to ask
this yes all three CPU SKUs use ddr4
memory they also all have a TDP of a
hundred and forty watts and all use
Intel's latest 2011 b3 socket alright
folks so as we slowly wind this video
down let's take a real quick look at
what the differences are between X 79
and X 99 the X 99 offers eight and six
core CPU support versus the six and four
on the X 79 the X every nine features up
to 20 megabytes of cash versus the 15
megabytes on x79 the
99 features for channel ddr 2133 memory
verses for child ADR 3 1866 memory on
the X 79 now the X 99 TDP is also
slightly higher at 140 watts versus 130
watts on the X 79 there's also a maximum
of 10 SATA 6 gigabits a second on the X
99 versus 6 on the X 79 Thunderbolt 2
support is also available on the X 99
while the X 79 offered no Thunderbolt
support period now for those of you who
are not familiar with Thunderbolt 2 it
offers 20 gigabytes per second of
bi-directional bandwidth which is 4
times faster than USB 3.0 and 20 times
faster than firewire you can daisy chain
up to six devices via a single port
which includes 4k displays 2 DisplayPort
1.2 now last but not least though before
I bounce out here I want to give another
special shout to the people over at
audible.com now I know a lot of folks
out there have been giving me a lot of
positive reinforcement by comments below
saying hey dude we noticed you've been
losing weight and all that stuff well I
have to actually give thanks though to
an author named David Perlmutter
now his audiobook just totally opened my
eyes to how eating a bunch of different
food can affect not only your diet but
how you actually think this book is
called grain brain and it talks about
all of these new grains and excess of
sugar and how they affect your life
basically bringing you down making you
feel slower and sluggish and by just
basically cutting these foods out of
your diet it can literally change your
lifestyle you would be just amazed on
how cutting these foods out of my diet
has improved my lifestyle quite a bit so
if this is something that sounds good to
you and you're a person now that you're
going hey man I like what you're doing
our work I'd like to change my life as
well or hey if you're ready for the
change check it out and you can do this
very easily by just going over to
audible.com forward slash tomorrow help
out you helped out me help us all out
and improve your lifestyle all in the
same bucket all right folks that wraps
up today's video and that's based like
all the Nitty Gritty stuff that you
really need to know is the layman about
x99 and the new 5960 Xtreme process from
the people over at intel like I said
earlier our systems were almost complete
be on the lookout for those video
is very very soon like usual all this
information will be down below that like
button and hopefully my fans know what
that is down there below all I got to do
is click me show more and all that
information to be down there I still get
emails going hey I don't know what to do
so for you guys that's where it's at go
down there look at the show more button
I'll be down there pricing availability
so do you folks out there looking to
jump in a new platform well if some
stuff listed down there including a
couple motherboards and all of the CPUs
also we have a lot of stuff going on
giveaways and all kinds of stuff for our
subscribers so if you're not subscribed
and you like what you see then hey you
know what to do Elric techno tomorrow
