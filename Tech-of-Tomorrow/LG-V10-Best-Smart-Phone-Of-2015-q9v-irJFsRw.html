the way past 2015 it's 2016 and for the
last two months I've been trying out
this new phone that I got the people
over at LG and this is their brand new
v10 phone this thing's actually pretty
awesome I've had a lot of different
phones over my time and all those ones a
little bit bigger my hand it's almost
like having a note it's still a really
really awesome phone that has a lot of
nice features that I think that you guys
out there who are fans of phones you
guys are gonna think these are really
pretty cool I know that I'm not the
biggest phone guy out there are a lot of
guys out there they specialize in phones
they know every detail like a watch I'm
not that up on running more about PCs
and that type of stuff but a what the
heck I know what I like so let's start
out real quick let's talk about the
specs some of the features and then I'll
tell you guys what I think of what my
top five things that I like about the
v10 under the hood of the v10 for the
chipset we have the Qualcomm Snapdragon
808 now as far as CPUs go this is a
pretty interesting thing it contains a
quad-core 1.4 gigahertz cortex a53 and a
dual-core 1.8 2 gigahertz cortex a5 7
the v10 is also made very rugged
it features 316l stainless steel sides
and it's wrapped in this entire dirt
grip coating that makes the thing very
easy to hold on to also under the hood
we see 4 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes
of internal storage and right now this
thing is running on 5.1.1 lollipop but
they are promising the upgrade to
marshmallow very very soon now some cool
things about this is the back is
completely removable and underneath
there you guys can see the battery and
an SD card slot now for those fans out
there who like the option of removable
battery LG is one of the only companies
out there that are still doing this and
that makes it really cool because if you
actually have another battery instead of
worrying about charge times you can
simply change it out and actually have
zero downtime and be up all the time on
your cell phone you can do the charging
with the fast charge later so those are
pretty much the basic specs if you guys
want all the specs I'll make sure I have
a link down below for you guys who are
diehard you guys can check
out now let's talk about the design of
the phone and some of the external
features now obviously the very first
thing you're gonna see when you look at
the LG v10 is this screen but this
screens not only one screen it's
actually to the main screen is an IPS
display that features 2560 by 1440
resolution which equates to 551 pixels
per inch if you're into that kind of
stuff now it also has a second screen
which you can use for you know getting
alerts with your notifications doing all
kinds of stuff like that and a cool
thing about it is is that even when your
main screen is off you can still access
this you can also customize what the
name of it is put your signature on
there or something like that if you so
desire to do so and like you guys can
see right here my phone is called TECA
tomorrow now for you fans out there
who've been following and using LG
phones you know that usually they have a
curved design the v10 though offers a
completely flat design so it's something
different and I gotta be honest to you
this screen is really great it offers a
nice viewing area which is clean bright
even in daylight it looks good and this
is great when you know we want to check
your email watch videos and do all that
kind of stuff so overall I have to say
that the screens on here pretty cool now
because the phone is so big operating at
one hand is a little bit difficult you
guys can see I mean I kind of got short
as I can't get my thumb's around there
so as far as one-handed usage goes I
don't know if it's gonna be all that
great but you know it's okay now that
secondary screen it's cool it's in a
weird place I wish you could kind of
move it around and do whatever you want
with it but the very fact that's there
it's kind of cool I think you guys know
that the Samsung they have their edge
whatever it's kind of similar to that
same type of thing only it's located in
the top instead of on the edge but
overall it's a new feature and it's
pretty cool although I have to say in
all fairness having that secondary
screen is really cool for accessing and
going through all your apps it makes it
really easy to do makes it simple you
not to go through a bunch of you know
it's very straightforward so I have to
give credit to LG and the v10 on that
aspect because it's something that is
very easy and for those people out there
who like simple pay simple is the key
with that sec
sprained the back of the v10 is also
something very cool not only does it
have that nice durable surface which
allows you to hold that phone and hold
it you know quite nice without falling
out of your hand it also has the 16
megapixel camera the power on button the
volume control and also the flash now
some cool things about this are is the
on button also doubles as a fingerprint
scanner that's right so if you guys want
to keep that feature on your phone and
lock people out this actually works nine
times out of ten so it's actually pretty
cool and this is one of the very first
phone some people over and LG to
actually have this on it and another
cool feature about the power button is
if your screens off you can just simply
tap that bad boy and your screen comes
back on you can actually do that with
the screen itself and you can set up
multiple different ways to tap on the
front of the screen to access your phone
you can also set up the volume control
so what when you double tap it it can go
directly into an app so that's another
cool feature that's on the LG v10 on the
top we see the second mic and the IR
blaster which use for controlling your
peripherals and on the bottom of the v10
you get the 3.5 millimeter audio jack
now this audio jack is something totally
different than most phones out there if
you use your phone for audio and it's
your main source of audio you're going
to love this feature it's a full-blown
digital audio converter that's right
this is no joke it's a nice piece of
audio equipment so if you want to listen
to this through your headphones or run
into speakers now your phone can get up
there and have nice high-quality audio
through that we also see the last of the
mics and the microSD slot which are all
located on the bottom of the v10 okay so
those are pretty much all of the fun
nice facts that people want to know
about the phone like I said before if
you guys want more in-depth stuff
obviously you guys can get down to the
link below obviously things 4G and all
that great stuff you guys come to love
about phones but I want to talk to you
guys about the top five things that I
just really dig about this phone after
having it for two months and the first
of those is the camera just kind of say
this camera is probably one of the best
that you can get on any phone out there
right
now obviously coming up to CES in a week
there might be some even cooler stuff
coming out there but right now the 16
megapixel camera on this phone is just
incredible it offers many features that
make it rival a DSLR that's right so if
you're a person who uses your phone for
videography or you use it for just
pictures and your phone is your main
like audio and video source you're gonna
be very happy with some of the features
that come with this so like I said folks
my number one favorite feature of the
v10 is the 16 megapixel lens that's the
rear camera now this thing features an
f-stop 1.8 aperture it also has optical
image stabilization which means if
you're taking pictures and you're
shaking a little bit it'll actually help
balance a picture and make it look
clearer now some of the absolute things
about this that make it stand out like I
said and make it more like a DSLR are
the fact that you can manually adjust
almost everything on this camera which
gives you you know so many different
things that you can do that you've never
been able to do on a phone this thing is
the closest that I've ever seen to a
DSLR because of those things it works
fairly well in low-light sometimes some
of the features about it in low-light
make it stand so it's not the best but
you can adjust it any way you want to
keep making the picture better and
better but even the automated features
on the phone using them makes it a
really good camera but if you're a
person out there and you like getting
all in depth you're going to love these
features there's also another feature
and you can only do this in 1080p and
below and you're filming but there's
actually when you're filming you can
make the image more stable so it looks
like you're using a tripod which is
really cool because you know holding the
camera in your hand and filming then
that can be a little bit difficult using
a gimbal or something like that makes it
much more simpler and with that
particular feature it just makes this
thing stand out quite a bit
now obviously you guys know I mean we
have a camera we use all of our stuff
but for portability and doing a lot of
stuff especially at CES you guys are
going to be seeing me use this a lot and
I do mean a lot now there are also two
other cameras on there are actually two
five megapixel cameras located on the
other side and
cool thing about this is there's this
new feature called multi-view and you
can actually use all three cameras at
the same time and you can get some
pretty crazy stuff using the multi view
it's something that I don't think any
other phone out there has there may be
like I said I'm not the biggest bone guy
in the world
but I haven't seen it yet so one cool
feature about the front 5 megapixel
cameras is that each one is different
and offers something unique the first is
an 80 degree standard lens and the
second is a hundred and twenty degree
wide angle lens and the cool thing is
that you can toggle between the two
within the software obviously the camera
on the v10 is just amazing
the ability to operate everything the
white balance features just meant
honestly the camera itself could be a
total review and maybe I'll come back to
that because the camera itself offers so
many things on here that I could
probably do a whole standalone video
just showing you guys screenshots
showing you guys video now obviously
sharing huge large files on social media
is going to be a problem but with the LG
v10 you get editing software and
everything that's already built into the
phone so you don't need to download
another app just to do this and the v10
has some of the coolest editing software
I've seen yet so whether you want to cut
that thing down change it around a lot
of things you can do all within the
confines of the v10 and this is
something for those people out there
like I said who use their phone for
videography or pictures and it's their
main thing this can be a second camera
that really kicks ass for multiple
reasons as you guys can see my second
favorite feature of the v10 just has to
be the main screen this main screen is
so clear and so bright and like I said
before it offers 551 pixels per inch so
you guys know it has a nice dense clear
picture now if you use your phone all
the time for watching videos and doing
that kind of stuff you will really
appreciate this 5.7 inch screen it's
also made of that really tough you know
Gorilla Glass 3 so you know it's going
to be tough stuff and also with the
resolution of 2560 by 1440 you can watch
all of your favorite stuff in
Chris PhD my third favorite feature is
the battery and the battery life as well
as the quick charging now the battery
inside is a 3000 milliamp battery so you
know it's going to last a pretty good
long time but honestly my result from
you know using this thing daily is that
in the middle of the day time about 4
hours into it I'm having to recharge the
phone if I'm watching movies and doing
all kind of stuff I gotta say the
battery life mmm-hmm it could be better
but if I'm just using it as my phone and
not doing all that stuff
oh yeah it'll last all day all the way a
little bit actually into the next day
but if I'm using as a multimedia device
I gotta say that really limits the
battery time but the fact that you can
remove the battery and put it another
battery come on buying a secondary
battery is not that much money and like
I said before you have that one on hand
you can slap it in there and you have
zero downtime also it's a little adapter
right here
look away from you guys a little fast
charger in 40 minutes your phone can be
50 percent charge so and I've seen it
doesn't like basically maybe maybe like
an hour hour and 10 minutes you can have
your phone completely charged and up and
running again so that's really cool
there's also things out there like if
you get your little battery charger you
can always have your secondary battery
always charged and with you but I have
to say though the battery the ability
remove the battery and the way you can
fast charge are all great things about
the LG v10 okay so now my fourth
favorite feature is the fact that this
thing is very well built it actually has
a military grade of 8 10 and the 810 is
basically their shock resistance which
means that this thing can pretty much be
dropped a little bit without breaking a
few go throw on the phone or dropping
off any high-end thing all that
stainless steel and the dura grip and
all that stuff won't mean anything but
it's a pretty well-built phone all in
all you're gonna have to pretty much you
know drop it pretty far like dropping on
the floor dropping it like this sorry
stuff like that even dropping on a wood
floor standard stuff like that I've
dropped this thing a few times it keeps
going the cool thing is though is I
actually
really a high-end case so now I'll
enclose this great built phone inside of
some armor which will make it even more
durable so at the end of the day two
layers of glass stainless steel frame
duraframe back all in all the v10 is
pretty damn tough and the last but most
definitely not the least favorite
feature is that second screen now some
people out there I've heard that they
say that they feel it's a little bit
obtuse 'iv but me I like it I wish there
were a few more other features about it
I wish you could move it around and all
that stuff but the ability to access all
your apps to be able to see your time
and date and all that stuff will happen
actually turn your phone on is a pretty
cool thing it also saves battery life
and you know I guess in essence with the
5.7 inch screen and the secondary screen
I guess all together you could say you
almost have a 6 inch screen right kind
of that way but that secondary screen
like I said is very very convenient if
you're out and about you don't want to
use your battery even see you're running
out of battery life a lot of the things
that you can do you can do all right
through that top secondary screen and
that's something cool so I don't know
what you guys think but if any of you
guys actually own this phone you have it
I think you guys know what I'm talking
about the great camera the great build
quality the battery life I mean all
these things at the end of the day just
make the LG v10 a pretty awesome phone
and a feature I just really want to
stress upon one more time before I
bounce out of here is that this 3.5
millimeter audio jack with that built-in
high-end audio DAC is really really cool
I don't know if any other phone like I
said out there has it but um for audio
files like myself and for people out
there you have a nice set of headphones
with the v10 you're actually going to
notice that I'm Eric you guys were
watching teka tomorrow the next video
will be at CES so peace out we love you
and we'll see you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
