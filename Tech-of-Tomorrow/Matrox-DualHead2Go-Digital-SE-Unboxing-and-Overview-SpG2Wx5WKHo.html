again detector tomorrow you guys know me
I'm Mel Eric your host behind the camera
we got Jesus point Oh now Matrox is a
company that back in the day I used to
use the out of their car dude
before the big 3d gaming rage came on
matrix was one of the most highly
respected and actually biggest video
card companies in the world so pre
Nvidia days you know was back in
everybody is doing stuff like rendering
movies odd stuff this company was huge
they still make cards but you only see
these cards now in very very expensive
machines but they're in the market with
a really neat product and this is their
matrix dual head to go you guys are
probably asking what the heck's a dual
head to go do I get two heads on my
shoulder you know walking evil man no
it's nothing so cool like that but it is
pretty cool what it is is basically you
take you to your laptop or your PC and
you can use two monitors off this box so
if your card already had like you had a
flex card you had five monitors out of
it you could hook up to this another two
monitors and increase your monitors also
it supports monitors up to the new 4k
resolutions you get 4096 by like
twenty-something resolution it's
incredible
all you really do is you plug it in and
then it splits the monitor it's like if
you had a laptop you can put your laptop
in the center take two 27 inch monitors
on the side and then have 3-way monitors
all from your laptop so let's check it
out I don't know there's two really too
much to unbox I think there's just one
little seal here so I'm gonna take my
trusty little knife click it open take a
little incision here all very simply
done there don't want to wreck the bolts
the walks make my incision throw the
knife at the cameraman but did that
whatever lookin camera man i'ii be dead
yes sometimes man's got to know his
limitations and mine is stabbing the
cameraman he told me wouldn't take that
pisses me off you should take it in
stride but nope so check it out two
cables DisplayPort huh little end cap
off DisplayPort cable
I was that same connection on every end
bloodied up but that little plastic
thing back on there it'll go on there
there it goes okay and then we got the
USB cable so these two cables right here
they're going to plug into the back of
your system one into your video card and
then one into your computer actually
this is your power then obviously and
then we have a little box right here I
think that I will show you then a second
TZ TZ TZ and then we have the matrix
graph expansion module this is the
drivers all that stuff says made in Hong
Kong by Hong Kong Phooey
do you guys remember him give me a
thumbs up it shows your age of doing
long time buoy is though so I'll take
this first two items and we will go
ahead I will sit them back here in the
table behind me we thought you guys were
getting bored of doing the three monitor
videos so we thought we've changed up
and give you guys something else but
there's an instruction guides all the
way through here how to hook up your gxm
product and all that stuff so it's all
in there and then last but not least we
have the little box itself that little
looks there ain't a bin quite a boom all
right yeah no no new car smell plus the
box and let me get it by the camera so
you guys can see this so we'll start off
and show you the top then we'll turn
around we'll show you the connection the
back you can see this is where the two
DVI connections are flip it around the
other side
there's your USB in the DisplayPort and
the nomenclature and everything is on
the bottom
and that's pretty much it folks I mean
it's a pretty basic product it's $180
you can buy it anywhere out there and
it's a really cool product more I think
for somebody who is traveling a lot and
wants to use like monitors all the plays
you like plug into a TV that's why I
think it's more about better for like
you know if you were like good a hotel
room or something you travel a lot you
could pop it in you could use their TV
and use another monitor I don't know
it's got its uses the DisplayPort having
DisplayPort connection means that not
too many laptops right now are going to
be geared to use this on Macs they're
using the new you know Thunderbolt and
most the pcs at HDMI but almost every
single solitary video card that's in a
computer is going to have this type of
connection so 280 bucks you want to hook
up more monitors to off of this you can
use whatever existing monitors off your
card and you're good to go
dual head to go display by the people
who are matrix will check you brothers
out here later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
