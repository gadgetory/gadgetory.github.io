around the world I'm doing pretty good
just chillin in my wheelchair bringing
you guys another video so check it out
when nvidia z' latest RT x cards came
out everybody was really expecting just
massive frames per second that was the
big deal you know 4k at 60 frames per
second and all this stuff when you know
really the RT x thing kind of hit people
with like what the heck is going on here
because RT x ray tracing d LS the
advanced adapted you know shading all
this stuff
none of that stuff when the cards first
got released was actually being used in
the card so how people are like what's
what the heck is going on here in video
why would you release cards that don't
support all the technology we'll check
it out
the technology is about to be full on
that's right so two games are coming out
today or they're not coming out today
but the patches for them will be coming
out today and actually let me rephrase
that one game is coming out today
battlefield 5 i just got it
he'll be downloading this afternoon it
supports full great racing features
that's right there'll be a patch for all
the ray tracing goodness we're just
gonna make games look unlike they've
ever looked before you will really be
blowing i think when you see how much
ray tracing actually does so for people
out there at the cards are gonna be like
holy crap Batman miss Shea's looks nice
because it is going to really improve
the way games look a lot more natural
you'll just see when you do the patch
now also at the same time today there'll
be another patch coming out and this is
for the latest Final Fantasy 17 so
you're gonna get with that all DL SS
features that'll all be available today
so on November 14th which is when you're
watching this video which is today all
this stuff will be happening now on
November 19th you're gonna see new stuff
coming out the adaptive shading and
stuff is going to be on Wolfenstein that
this is the new Colossus basically
Wolfenstein to just you know Wolfenstein
on steroids and it's gonna have all the
adaptive shading features on it so
basically November is going to be the
month where you're going to see the r-tx
stuff actually take off and start
working with your video card so
everybody out there right now as an art
2x card is pretty happy with how it's
working as is we'll be even
more happy once all of those r-tx
features are actually being implemented
which means that when the games are
coming out in the future they're working
with the game developers these games are
gonna look a lot nicer now I know a lot
of people are thinking you know oh my
god when you turn on these features all
of my numbers are going to go down well
let me tell you that's not what's going
on the whole reason behind ray-tracing
is is that if you can get everything to
be raytrace SuperDuper fast it's going
to be less of a load on your GPU
all-around which means that when you
turn up all this stuff and you have
these features in your r-tx card it's
not really going to slow your card down
at all maybe a little tiny bit but not
much that's really what the whole thing
about you know our TX and touring is is
being able to bring you all this
lifelike stuff making the games look as
best as they can without sacrificing the
frames per second which has always been
kind of what's going on now you guys
have follow the challenge you guys have
seen that we've done some videos now the
RT x 2080 TI you put two of those cards
together the numbers are simply off the
hook for the games that support it now
there's not a whole lot of games that
fully do support that yet but for the
ones that do you guys could see the
numbers were off the hook if you guys
happen to miss that video I'll put a
link down below where you guys can check
it out but 228 ET is really is a lot of
power even a single one is quite a lot
of power and I don't know how exactly
the 27 T is going to do with all the
Arctic's features once they all come out
we'll be going back and re showing you
guys those cards with those games and
seeing how the excuse me how the
performance is actually affected you
know with turning on all the goodies and
turning them off and see if hey you know
is it really what it's hype to be does
Nvidia storing and ray tracing does it
actually make your games look a lot
better without sacrificing frames per
second well guess what
November 14th the day is today the door
has been opened I'll know you'll know
all within a few hours from now
so I'm Eric you guys been watching
Tekken tomorrow we'll have links down
below to where you guys can purchase
these games if you want to get them for
yourself and if you have yourself an AR
TX card then you are in the money and if
things pan out or this is really the
coolest shiz neck on the planet then
you're probably going to want to
re-evaluate why you didn't buy a little
video
big one maybe I should yeah food for
thought
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
