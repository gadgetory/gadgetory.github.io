back to the channel so check this out
most the time the zotac epic stream card
is usually the best the second card that
you can get your hands on so we were
able to get our hands on the brand-new
1080 TI version of the app extreme this
is one badass card to be exact pricing
not exactly sure but you know it's going
to be like you know arm leg Plus being
here definitely over 700 bucks but with
that said let's check out what's
in the box now for all you boxing
enthusiast and I'm not talking about
Sugar Ray Leonard I'm talking about
boxing the beloved Li things this is the
GeForce GTX 1080 TI ZOTAC amp Xtreme
featuring ice storm for fishing cooling
and max performance spectra for all your
lighting needs free so your cartridge
makes absolutely no noise when it's in
idle mode and also Firestone if you want
to overclock the out of this thing
nothing really too much on this side and
nothing too much on this side either and
then the back of the box just has those
things that I pretty much told you told
you guys about a second ago so with that
said though let's start taking it
actually out of its damn box so first
off what's a pop a cap in it or pop the
cap on it another go ahead and do that
go like this
go ahead empty that thing out on to the
table once again we see a box in a box
and we'll try to move that so don't go
slamming into the microphone and scaring
the show you people so we'll get that on
I won't touch at the camera today I'll
be a nice guy will be nice to the
cameraman so first off obviously the Box
in the Box box option is once again
happening and that's it so there's
another little thing to pop up here on
the top so I'll pop the cap on that as
well and we shall figure our way around
the box couple me inside inside there's
really nothing but the box this looks
like the driver and manuals so let me
pull it out and make sure it is what it
is and so I'm not just talking mad
all rights alright there's a case logo
in there obviously a CD users guide
quick installation guide where the hell
you want to call it something about
unstoppable free what lets these VR go
so this must be virtual reality on the
ghost little thing in there not going to
go on about that
you
by the card so let's check it out let's
get that crap out of the way because
it's pretty much unimportant Lee soon as
we pop the cap in the box again we got
this and oh yes you can throw that the
camp what will bounce back at me traitor
ooh I'm missing my head now as far as
other accessories go I can see there are
two bags in here so you take these
things out okay both of these things
right here are let's assume you take
shirt here okay both of these are dual
six pin to eight pin connectors like I
said dual six spent eight pin connectors
so that with your power supply doesn't
have the proper a pin connectors as long
as you got those six pin bad boys with
these two things you're set to go
now I think that that's pretty much it
as far as the accessories go it is
looking that way so let's go ahead and
let's jump out and let's take a closer
look at the card itself big old giant
ecstatic bag and holy freaking moly is
this card fricking huge wow look at the
top of this thing it's incredible there
are 390 millimeter fans on top this
thing that's just incredible man whoo
remove this before you first use because
if you don't see they're going to suck
that sucker through and your cards into
hopefully not though but you guys can
see this thing's built really heavy it's
like a little mini tank video card it's
got all kinds of lighting features in it
as well so you can light this card up to
whatever color you want to and change
your bill to look as pretty as you want
that bill to look and damn is this card
frakking huge I mean look how big this
thing is it's not only a 2 slot size
card it's 2.5 and that's pretty much
going to take up three slots in your PC
so be aware of that also if you're
wondering okay what are the exact specs
of this card am you well Rick well it's
325 by 148 by fifty six point six
millimeters or twelve point eight by
five point eight thirty times two point
three inches the main thing about this
card is it's huge amount of CUDA cores
it's memory bus its video memory and
obviously the engine clocks which are
overclocked on this branded card so you
get 3584
of course eleven gigabytes of gddr5 X
memory and the memory bus is 350 two-bit
now the amp Extreme Edition it's pretty
much the badass of the badass cards
that's right take a shot right now it
has a base clock of sixteen hundred and
forty five megahertz and a boost clock
of seventeen hundred and fifty nine
maegor's so you know this Dan's going to
be great in the overclocking department
right out of the box the amp Extreme
Edition also has a memory clock of
eleven point two gigahertz PCI Express
3.0 features all the latest things
you're going to want in a car including
HDMI 2.0 now you guys can see the
backplate is incredible this is their
like ultra armor so this thing is tough
and smack on it beat on it hit it with a
frickin hammer it's not going to go
anywhere you see these two chips right
here these two chips are actually good
chips for doing your overclocking so
these things are part of the technology
this card helps with the overclocking of
the card and actually looks kind of neat
too it's something different you don't
see on many other cards and that is
their power boost now taking a look at
the side of the card you guys can see a
few of the heat pins on the side there's
also two sli fingers over here that I
only talked about when I showed you guys
the back of the car but you guys know
what those are those are the SLI fingers
for doing obviously focal SLI now as far
as the power requirements go there are
two 8-pin connectors on here now ZOTAC
recommends a 600 watt power supply
because this thing sucks 320 Watts from
that bad boy so a lot of power this
overclocking beast here you guys can see
the end of the card not too much to talk
about there it's pretty minimalistic and
then down here at the bottom we see the
PCIe interface now last but not least we
have the rear i/o of the card the card
features 31.4 display ports HDMI 2.0 B
and the DVID port plus it features quad
monitor right out of the box
alright Tech fans so there you have it
everything that was inside this
beautiful little box by the folks over
Ed's otech the 1080 TI and pretty
extreme which is usually really the
fastest fricking cards we usually ever
test right out of the box results may
vary very slightly but I'm telling you
folks this card is fast its badass

full review in just a couple of days but
