edition of tech o tomorrow I'm Al Roker
hosting today we're looking at another
product from the people over at gigabyte
this is their wind force edition of the
GTX 980 now what's the wind force well
the one force is basically their a high
end overclocking card you can see the
car that's sitting back behind me it
obviously has three fans right in the
front and it's totally black black in
the front and black on the back because
it's got a solid grille which you guys
are gonna like I know one of the things
that people like out there about cards
when they had that nice shield in the
back hey gigabyte did an absolutely fine
job with this card I think by now that
most people know most of the specs of
the GTX 980 this one features a twelve
hundred twenty eight megahertz standard
clock with a thirteen twenty nine
megahertz boost obviously the three fans
it's got dual BIOS it has their flex
technology which is for all the monitors
you're gonna cut by a ton of
monitors with this card so for those
people out there or looking to use that
type of technology to have multi
monitors hey this card is equipped to do
that and since the way it's made it's
made for overclocking so let's take a
closer look at the card right off the
bat you guys can see there are three
fans on the front like I said they all
say gigabyte on them underneath that you
can see the total cooling apparatus you
can see all of the Heat fans you can see
the copper heat pipes all that stuff is
very prevalent when looking at the card
you flip the card over to its side you
can see the pcie 3.0 interface and once
again you see more of the heatsink
flipping the card over the backside you
guys can see that there are five of the
heat pipes they're all copper and you
can clearly see them you can count them
out from left to right one two three
four five pretty interesting design flip
the card around to its other side
you guys can clearly see it has the wind
force nomenclature right on the side of
the card and you can see some more of
the aluminum heat fins right there then
we see the power connections there are
two eight pin power connectors for this
card now since the card has a dual BIOS
I was looking around to see if there was
a switch or anything to flip between the
two BIOS is but I couldn't find that
anywhere on the card up along the card
and again we can see the two sli fingers
and as we flip the card around in the
back you can see the very tough back
shield and you can also clearly see both
the PCI interface and the
my fingers once again as well as the g1
gaming and last but not least the rear
aya which features a single D VII a
single DVID you see there's three
standard display ports and a single HDMI
connection as far as the major specs go
though for those who are actually our
new cards based off the 28 nanometer
process has a memory clock of seven
gigabytes per second four gigabytes of
gddr5 memory with a tune and 56 bit
memory interface supports DirectX 12
opengl 4.4 the maximum resolution is
4096 by 2160 and the card size is in at
312 millimeters by 129 millimeters by 43
millimeters this will be translated into
inches for us here in America the power
requirements for the card are 600 watts
and those are those two 8-pin external
power connections that I showed you
earlier in the video so that's what the
card looks like and all of its basic
specs now this is the wind for 600 out
Edition card and with that said let's
jump in let's check out the test system
and then rock out to the benchmark song
and see the schoolers
all right folks so there you guys have
it everything to know about the
brand-new gtx 960 win for 600 our
edition from the people over at gigabyte
now before we bounce out of here though
I have to give a special shout out and
thanks the people over Harry Shave Club
for making today's video very possible
now you guys might be asking yourself
who is Harry Shave Club
well Harry Shave Club is pretty much
kind of an online deal where they ship
everything out to you now most of us
guys don't really like to go shopping
admit it we're kind of lazy we're just
kicking at home and we're shopping hey
honey can I pick up some razors some
people more picky but most people have
that gene in this want to kick it
Harry's makes it very very easy to
actually get your raises laughs and go
there and deal with like stuff behind a
plastic counter that you can't get to
have to go bug people and get people to
bother them this is just so much simpler
and one of the cool things about Harry's
is that all of their stuff is made in
Germany it's German engineered and this
stuff is really really good for the last
few months I've been used my Winston kit
and I gotta say I am impressed the
razor's Flex I've got one of their kits
right here and I think it's kind of safe
folks it's a very interesting thing now
this right here this is the Winston kit
they actually have three kits that you
can get your monthly subscription they
have one for 15 one for 20 and one for
25 bucks this is the top of a line one
due to the fact that it comes with
everything including a very nice razor
let me pop that little bad boy out of
here let you guys actually see the razor
now let me get over there to you guys
here's the razor now the razor flexes
though actually bends so when you're
shaving and you're on your face the
razor meets your face it makes for a
very very close shave and due to the
fact that these things are German
engineer they're made of high quality
products a razor can last two to three
shades I mean if you're a person who
shaves every day you practice change
your razor at least once a week but the
razors are very very nice and they have
a bunch of different programs you can
actually go on there and get on the
monthly subscription program where it's
only like $15 and you're getting old
enough razors and your shaving thing
right here
to shave with so it's pretty cool like I
said Harry shave club sends everything
through the mail now you guys can see
the kit that I received this is the
Winston kit it contains three razors the
shave gel the handle and everything you
need to get started except for obviously
the water your shower and your beard so
it's a pretty cool thing and it's all
packaged really quite nicely but if
you're actually thinking about we just
want to check one of these out and see
what it's like you can save yourselves
five bucks right now just go over to
Harry's comm place an order and inside
there place the coupon code tomorrow and
save yourself
five bucks now for your German fans out
there I got one thing to say about this
kit and that is sign I know this product
all right folks thank you guys once
again for watching tech of tomorrow for
those up there who didn't get to see the
video for some reason missed it this
thing under full load was running at 72
Celsius when it was idle it was at 36 so
the cards running pretty cool now
everything to do with the GPU boost for
NVIDIA has to do with how cool the cards
running so obviously with this type of
cooling and everything in the card it's
going to have the ability to be able to
overclock even further the reason we
don't do a whole lot of overclocking
stuff is because everybody's results are
going to vary depending the type of
computer they have what type of cooling
they're using how their system is
everything is going to vary so I could
show you mine and then be pretty cool
but then your results at home might be a
little bit different so for those
looking to buy this card or more
information down the like button
there'll be a thing called show more
just click that and we'll have all the
information down there including where
if you want to buy one of these you can
pick one up for yourself they're going
for about five hundred and seventy nine
bucks right now but it is a high end gtx
980 card currently the top card in the
single GPU ring from the people over at
Nvidia I'm Eric thanks for watching
ticker tomorrow once again don't forget
if you want to get five bucks off you
can head over to Harry's shave club and
enter the code tomorrow to get five
dollars off and clean yourself up in
fact I think I probably need to do that
myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
