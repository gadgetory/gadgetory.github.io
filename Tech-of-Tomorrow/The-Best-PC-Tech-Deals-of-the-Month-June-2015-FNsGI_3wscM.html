welcome back once again to the channel
where I'm here with my favorite mammal
mr. buddy the dog it's the end of the
month and we've got those top 10 deals
once again for you lazy folks who just
like to go and say hey Wow cool stuff
without to go do a lot of work and in
that essence let's check out the top 10
deals of June now this deal has like
four thousand customer reviews all
positive this is the logitech wireless
combo MK 270 with keyboard and mouse
currently this thing's 1999 so for 20
bucks you get yourself a totally
wireless keyboard mouse that's a winner
next up we have the EVGA 80 + 500 watt
three-year warranty power supply now
this thing is currently 44 dot 41 cents
I know this thing won't power super
duper huge systems but hey for entry
level systems and for those requiring
not a giant power supply 500 watts 44
bucks not a bad deal everyone needs a
screen these days and big screens are
getting bigger and bigger and bigger so
how about a bank 24 inch monitor for 149
bucks now this is almost a hundred bucks
off I'm talking about the benq GL 2460
hm this thing's an LED monitor coming at
24 inches and like I said it's a hundred
and forty nine bucks a savings at $99
now this next product is a little bit of
a controversial thing is people out
there scream all the time oh my god
elric it's the Kingston v300 and
Kingston are the devil's ah gotta be
honest with you yes there was something
with Kingston at one time about this
because they change the controller or
whatever but for the price that these
things are they're pretty damn reliable
there are people that go oh my god
there's this one test that sucks on but
I've given two friends you guys have
bought a bunch of and we bought season
before and if you get them to use means
you start up drive they are not bad at
all I'm talking about the Kingston 120
gigabyte SSD this thing's only 5499 and
for 120 gigabytes that's still quite a
savings actually at this time point most
of the kingston drives on sale and you
can add
get yourself a 960 gigabyte dry for
about four hundred sixty three bucks
will have all the links for all them
down below just so you can choose are
you a fan of course there are cases but
don't quite have the my to buy some two
hundred dollar case check this one out
the corsair carbide series spec 01 mid
tower gaming case this thing is
currently 4999 so for fifty bucks you
get yourself not only a stylish case you
cure self a case that's really well
Christ AMD fans I know you guys will
like this a 64 processor the FX 6300 for
only 99 bucks so if you're a fan of AMD
looking to build yourself that budget
entry-level gaming system this is a CPU
that's actually been very well received
by the market so if you in those AMD
fans and you're looking to grab this
thing check it out ninety-nine bucks get
you a six core cpu which will get right
into your game up next up we actually
have a pair of headsets one's wireless
and one is wired these are both by
logitech and let's real quick question
first up is the logitech wireless gaming
headset g930 was 7.1 surround sound now
this thing's currently 8999 which is a
savings of 71 bucks which is pretty damn
cool i think so if you're looking for a
wireless gaming you want 7.1 surround
sound this could be your a ticket
there's also the wired version of this
this is the logitech g35 7.1 channel
surround sound headset these aren't
wireless and they're also 7999 with a
savings of 50 funds so whether you like
to get your game on wireless or wired
logitech gives you a choice now this
next product I've naturally never heard
of the brand but I got admit what caught
me honestly was the visuals now they say
you can't read every book by it's cover
but this product actually looks really
cool this is from a key and let's check
it out now the aki is a 4000 DPI high
precision programmable laser gaming
mouse this thing has adjustable DPI six
programmable keys six color breathing
LED lights and five feet as well as a
tangle free cable and best of all it's
only twenty bucks so hey eat lunch at
McDonald's for a day
that nice place and last but not least
who cannot use more stores right I know
I couldn't for gaming for music for all
that kind of stuff having extra storage
is great right now you your hands on a
western digital blue one terabyte drive
for 50 bucks that's a really great price
now the blue drives aren't the most
outstanding of the western digital
drives there in between the black and
the green but they're still great just
for storage so if you need storage you
got 50 bucks check out the WD blue one
terabyte baby so there you have it folks
