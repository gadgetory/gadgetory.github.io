that's actually worth a let's check
out the key ingredient and find out so
the key ingredient what is it you guys
go it looks like a little tablet sitting
down on it that's what it really is it's
a tablet that is totally geared though
towards people that are using it in the
kitchen has a lot of other uses but its
main gear and functionality though is
for people in the kitchen because it
gives you how to do your meals you can
take pictures with the camera add your
own meals to it like take all those old
granny recipes throw them in there plus
you get access online very easily to a
zillion recipes out there so basically
this thing is really geared for that
it's also hands-free so when you're
cooking it'll actually give you
instructions on some things on how to
cook and how to do these things ain't
have to worry about going up and
touching it and getting it messy
whatsoever now but that's not all that
it does though it's also an android
tablet four point four point four and it
can support a bunch of different games
and things like that you can do all the
stuff like Google you can do YouTube
Facebook you can do all that kind of
social media stuff as well and I mean
this thing does not have the greatest
specs it's got a 7-inch screen 800 x 480
that you know some of the hipsters gonna
go like yeah what if bro but like you
know for family people who don't have a
lot of money 99 bucks is a pretty fair
price and actually I believe there are a
lot of incentive programs out there you
could actually hop into one of these
things for no money you just got to look
around the net and find incentive
programs to do it but like the one that
we have you guys can find the
information down below this one's 99
bucks but it gives you access to free
online stuff all you do check it out you
go on here you log in put your email
address on got to make sure your online
so you're going to first want to go into
your wife Isis you can see here you just
go into the settings button go into
Wi-Fi you guys can see we're hooked into
tech tomorrow obviously you hook in your
home one you go back out click on the
email thing register your account and
you're up and going and register with
these people at key ingredient which is
pretty cool and like I said you know
what moms in the kitchen and she's doing
that cooking and stuff the kids can take
this thing and they can play games now
one thing about this thing I really
is the stand it's got a stand that both
has two different types of stand you can
set it flat down like this and you can
play games on it why it's flat down
which is pretty cool so it's not flat on
the table and gives your hands like a
little bit of a resting way to play
games and stuff like that which is
really cool for the kids or just
reviewing stuff and for mom in the
kitchen you know we're doing other
things you can just pop it up and once
again put it on its stand so I don't
know 99 bucks I know hmm hey what does
it get you I think actually for the
price you get quite a lot all the online
functionality you can hook up speakers
so it's another thing about it you can
be in your kitchen with your Bluetooth
hook up your speakers and so you could
be in the kitchen doing your cooking
listen to all your music it's also got
an SD card slot up to 32 gigabytes you
can put in you can update it so you can
obviously put all your music on there
stick it in there and be rockin out the
32 gigabytes of music or put pictures
have pictures on it honestly for 99
bucks is pretty flexible I know that
some people by go out you know like
Kmart or Big Lots they can get one but
it's not going to be this cool it might
be a tablet but it's not going to have
all the great stuff that this has in it
especially all the recipes and cooking
stuff so for those people out there you
know you know you have your mom or you
have some grandma or some person you
know who could like this kind of product
you should check it out because for 99
bucks I think it's actually worth the
money let me know what you guys think
down below I know this isn't our normal
tech of tomorrow type of video but if
this is tech of tomorrow think about it
in the future you just go into your
kitchen you go into this and you're like
hey what's for dinner computer it tells
you the ingredients are there you know
what I mean hey this is the beginning of
the new wireless future kitchen it
really is it all starts with this type
of product eventually your whole kitchen
like whoa eventually your whole kitchen
might be completely automated and
that'll be really cool now I got to make
sure I hide this thing though because my
mom's been trying to steal it from me

walking around and like saying oh I want
