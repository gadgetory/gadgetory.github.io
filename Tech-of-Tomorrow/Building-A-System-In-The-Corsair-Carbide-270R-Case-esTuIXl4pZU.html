again to Tekken tomorrow this time we're
doing an awesome build in course there's
latest case the carbide 270 our let's
check that shiz Nick out the carbide
series 270 our is a windowed ATX mid
tower case inside the box you get the
accessory kit the warranty and a little
bit of support information now the case
itself from the outside is pretty
minimalistic they call it the carbide
series just by the way it looks and
supposed to be made of like the
absolutely best materials you can get
and for those things I think it works
out very well you guys can see the
window on the left-hand side it makes it
very easy to show off all your parts and
your build so people can go by and go
hey that looks bad ass if you're
wondering well my motherboard fit inside
the 270 are well it supports ATX micro
ATX and mini ATX all the way up to 272
millimeters the 270 are sizes in at 509
by 210 by 460 millimeters the biggest
video card you can stick inside the 270
R is 370 millimeters so that's quite
long so you should feel fit pretty much
any video card that's out right now with
no problem the maximum CPU cooler now
this is the height between your
motherboard and the glass that's 170
millimeters so you should have no
problem there with any water coolers or
pretty much any of the air coolers that
are out there I don't think any are
really gonna be that high there might be
some but not many as far as what power
supplies will fit inside you can fit any
power supply up to 225 millimeters
internally there are seven expansion
slots to 3.5 inch hard drive bays to 2.5
inch hard drive bays and as far as the
cooling layout goes the 270 R is made to
have maximum airflow going through the
system that means when the air is being
pulled to the front it's being maximized
with that air flow going all through the
system and blown out the back now when
you first buy the system it comes with
120 millimeter red LED fan which is
pretty cool but you can also put 320
millimeter fans or 240 millimeter fans
in the front if you want now on the top
you can also fit 220 millimeter or 240
millimeter fans and on the rear you can
stick a single hundred twenty millimeter
fan which is also included nowadays I
think that most PC enthusiasts like
liquid cooling and since you can get an
A i/o for dirt cheap in there
easy to install a lot of people use them
you can either use single dual or triple
rats now on the very front of the 270
are you can fit up to a three hundred
and sixty millimeter rat now on the top
on the front you can also fit a two
hundred forty millimeter rad or on the
very rear you can fit a single hundred
twenty millimeter rat or you can pretty
much anywhere you want in the system fit
120 millimeter rat which is pretty cool
and last but not least the front IO
panel includes two USB 3.0 ports a
headphone and microphone jack power on
and the reset button so that's the case
in its specs but I want to talk about a
few of the things a lot of case that you
buy out there when you put your hands
inside of them and stuff you can cut
your hands up it's just nasty stuff
everything inside of the Corsair carbide
270 are is completely smooth you can run
your hands around all the edges work
inside of there and it's really nice
it's also very well made for cable
management much easier than that whole
glass case we did got to say that and as
far as putting in any of our radiators
ring thing or putting the i/o systems we
had absolutely no problem with that at
all and when we did the 570 X you guys
saw we had a little bit of difficulty
with our 3.5 inch hard drive but with
this system we had no problem whatsoever
and it mounted perfectly so my take for
under 100 bucks the 270 R is a badass
case has a lot of features but now let's
get to what you guys really like to see
let's check out the build since we still
had some parts lying around from AMD we
decided for the last build of the year
we'd stick to an AMD based build so for
the motherboard we use the as rock
fatality 990 FX killer motherboard this
mothered adds a lot of features great
overclocking and just looks great inside
the case for the CPU we went the AMD 4
gigahertz FX 83-70 octa-core desktop
processor with the Wraith cooler
although we didn't use the rate cooler
we use our own as you'll see in a second
keeping it red we chose the Kingston
HyperX fury set now this is a 16
gigabyte kit of ddr3 running at 1866
megahertz for boot drive we wanted to
have something fast so we got one from
Intel now this is a 730 series SSD this
thing's very very fast it's 240
gigabytes in hell I just like the skull
don't you
as far as storage goes I figured hell
we've got it around here so let's use it
we use the Seagate constellation
this is a two terabyte 7200 rpm Drive I
think it's perfect you can store a lot
of damn games on a two terabyte hard
drive unleash the Kraken that's right
once again we use the NZXT kraken this
time the x61 there's the 280 millimeter
all-in-one cpu liquid cooling system
which works really great and was able to
fit inside this system without any
modification or any problem at all now
real quick bar on that though I want to
make a note to you folks in the very
beginning we started filming all the
b-roll we actually had an X 31 but for
some reason we opened up the box the box
was empty so somebody was pretty damn
shifty you know over at Fry's for the
power supply we went with something once
again from Coolermaster we use the v5
15s an 80 plus gold modular power supply
has plenty of expansion options and 550
is perfect for the bill that we're
looking at today for the video card we
wanted to stick with AMD as much as
possible for this one so we want the XFX
rx 480 now this is a really cool video
card because it has the addition of
doing the hard swap fans if you guys
missed our video we'll have a link down
below but this is a really cool feature
you can change out the fans very easily
they just pop off the card you pop on
the color you want you move on with your
build this is really good especially for
people who are doing color based theme
builds I mean face it you don't have to
go out and modify everything if you can
just pull off a fan and make it all nice
and snappy I like it this card came
overclocked out of the box is pretty
incredible 1288 megahertz I'm sure we
could push it farther but for today we
were just trying to get the build
together to show you folks how nice
everything looked inside of the 270 are
due to the holiday season really coming
up upon us we didn't get a chance to
fully test and you know use this system
but if you guys want to see us run a
test named this system and bring a video
back showing you how it runs please let
me know by your comment down below and
we'll be happy to do so for now we were
just trying to show you the build
alright Tech fans there you have it our
build inside the corsair Carbide series
- 7 dr i think it looks pretty cool and
i just want to state for the record that
we weren't trying to come to any kind of
cost thing or anything like that we just
grabbed parts that we have they've been
submitted further builds on the reviews
and we put them all together and we
brought this build to you i think the
price comes out just a little bit over
$1000 so i mean if you wanted
this bill you can I know is like the
other goal I can build one for cheaper
and do it go ahead I don't care means
nothing to me I'm just making this case
look awesome because it's a cool case
like usual if you guys wanted more no
details about this stuff more details
about Lea stuff all you have to do is
check down there below like button
hopefully you guys will Chuck Norris the
hell out of that and we'll move on
with our day we're gonna bring you more
videos few more for the holiday season
before we take our vacation so stick
around because there's more to come and
if you don't know every day until
Christmas were given killer away
we'll have the link down below that for
well as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
