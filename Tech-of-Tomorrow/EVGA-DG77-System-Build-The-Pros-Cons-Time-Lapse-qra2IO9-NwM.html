here once again few folks who follow the
channel you guys know that a couple of
weeks back I did the unboxing and the
first look of the DG 77 case by the
people at EVGA and there are a lot of
mixed feelings from people about that
case and obviously you know there are a
couple things about it that really kind
of really don't make that much sense but
with that said we did a full build
inside of the DG 77 now I want to say
that this particular video is not about
the build we mean that it's not about
the parts inside the build this video is
strictly about all the different aspects
of building a system inside of the EVGA
DG 77 case that's what it's about
because a lot of the parts that we use
are very high-end that I'll tell you why
a friend of ours is Mart poppin he runs
this site called babel tech reviews and
men it's crazy this guy has been hit by
a bus not once but frickin twice and he
can barely walk man his hip his knee or
almost to be as I can and everything but
this guy loves to test stuff so we
matched up our test system exactly like
his so that we could share that scores
back and forth between us so this system
was really built to match exactly the
parts that he has in his test bed so
instead of building a test bed we
figured hey let's just build it inside
the DG 77 because there's plenty of room
for any video cards we've got the power
power supply hey what the heck let's
roll with it so real quick let's check
out the parts that we use in the build
and then let's show you guys a
time-lapse video as I talk about the
different aspects about this build the
pros the cons and the hey whatever let's
go the EVGA DG 77 alpine white mid tower
case was the case we used the
motherboard this build was also provided
by EVGA wanted to get as many EVGA parts
inside of as possible so they provide us
with one of their brand new Z 370
motherboards this is the FTW edition the
8th generation Core i7 87 Eric a
processor is powering this baby and we
also use 16 gigabytes of Patriot ddr4
memory that we have clocked at 3300
megahertz
keeping that CPU running cool is the
corsair hydra series h a div to extreme
now this did not come with an RGB fan
but we change it up for
the ll series just to make it look cool
for the boot drive I wanted something
that was very very fast so I chose a
really fast SSD this is a four Navy
gigabyte one from Corsair it's called
the neutron XT now for the storage drive
I also wanted something very fast so I
chose one of those hybrid SSD drives
from Seagate it's a 2 terabyte fire CUDA
this is made for gaming 64 megabytes of
cache all in all it's pretty fast and
was honestly pretty well prices on the
89 bucks when I got it
beyond the fan located on the radiator
there are also five other fans inside
this system now on top we have two of
course there's LL series RGB fans on the
front we have three the fans that we got
from EVGA I know that video card prices
right now are almost a joke but we still
have to put a video card in the system
so we chose a pretty good one we used a
Founders edition GTX 10 atti from the
people at EVGA
powering up this system is the EVGA
supernova 750 g3 power supply now this
is the center and 50 watts it's gold
plus certified and is fully modular so
those are the parts and yes we'll have a
link down below for you check them out
and let me just tell you right now these
parts are really expensive in this build
it's not really meant as such as a build
for us like I told you the very
beginning this is our test system as
well so all the video card testing and
stuff that you'll see in the future will
all be done in this system now another
thing is you can buy these parts at
different places we'll have links to
Amazon I think we'll have some links to
new way but I'm sure if you look around
and scrounge you can probably find stuff
for a little bit cheaper that it will
almost match this system but with that
said though let's check out the
time-lapse video let's check out Anthony
putting together the system and let's
talk about the good and the bad about
putting this system together in the DG
77
one of the first things that we noticed
when we started doing this build is that
the lights weren't working at all
there's a light in the front which I'll
talk about a minute which is kind of
weird and then there's the side light a
lot of you people actually when I did
the unboxing so that you guys did not
like this light whatsoever you can
remove it or like Anthony was saying you
could make your own modification and
change it so we're actually going to be
changing that logo to t ot in the future
we'll bring that video guide to you guys
as well but those two things are there
so right off the bat these lights from
working
we got the system finally built and
everything and I install the software
and they still weren't working we found
out though that even after our buddy at
EVGA send us replacement parts we found
out that it actually neither one of
these lights was actually connected to
the controller don't ask me why
they just weren't connect to the
controller so right off the bat that was
kind of the first thing that was kind of
a pain the but he was like hey why
aren't these lights working but we did
finally figure that out and get past
that now the front panel is kind of in a
way ridiculous I will totally admit this
to you guys that we did the build
because there's an EVGA logo behind that
that the solid glass you can't even see
it so what's the point of even having a
light there it's kind of just like
wasted wasted electricity because it
makes absolutely no sense it would have
been better if they would have had it
less so that the bottom where the fans
were at had kind of a mesh so it had
better airflow and then left that part
wide open so that people could have seen
the logo so that in itself is kind of
like an also the back window is also
completely nice glass but they colored
it which means if you're trying to do a
build and show off all your cable
management and stuff well if you're not
gonna really be able to do that Plus
this stuff's also very expensive some of
the things that could have been cut
corners of this could have brought this
case probably from one hundred and $69
down to around probably the hundred
dollar level and I think people would
have been a lot more receptive to that
you know if it would have been that
price point a lot of people like $169
for this case and there's all kinds of
different things going on with it that
are just like yeah I don't really think
I would want that now the airflow
through the case I have to say
it the way we built it it actually does
have really nice airflow through the
case everything's running really nice
the CPU even under full load is barely
getting over 32 Celsius so it's running
very very cool
the liquid core obviously is doing its
job
another thing that kind of made me a
little uh was that it says that you can
mount a radiator on the top well let me
just tell you unless you've got some
really SuperDuper thin radiator it's not
gonna work it's going to hit the
motherboard that's what we were gonna
originally put the radiator and we
couldn't put the radiator up on top
because of that fact so it was like uh
okay fine so we moved it to the very
back we used a single a single one that
we used like you know we could have used
a bigger one a dual 240 or even the
triple but for some reason the way this
particular case was made I couldn't
really do that unless I wanted to put it
in the very front and we needed that
airflow so we built that particular way
now under weird thing a lot of people
said that the you know the airflow was
completely restricted well the airflow
is not completely restricted there are
vents on the side for the air to blow
through and with those fans all blowing
air out of the system the air really
does flow through there kind of nice
another thing you guys were saying that
because the card was kind of lip up
against the glass that would get no
airflow whatsoever no is crazy well
actually there's about I don't know
almost in probably out three quarters of
an inch distance between the glass and
the card so there is room for the air to
circulate through there plus there's all
that air circulating through the system
to also keep that card running cool I've
seen other reviewers say that they
really didn't think that the cable
management ability on this case was very
well whatsoever and honestly I have to
disagree with that now maybe it's not
just like you know really super
childishly easy to do it but with the
right time and taking care you can see
that Anthony was able to get the cable
management very easily those little
rubber slots and all the stuff in there
sometimes those things are a little bit
hard to work with but if you spend the
time and energy and you pay attention to
what you're doing you can see that
really good cable management can be
achieved in the D g77 without a problem
look we did it if we did it you can do
it you guys can see that this bill does
look very nice we've actually tested a
lot of different video cards in the
system
unfortunately for SLI there's no way to
do the vertical card so we have to move
the vertical card out when we're doing
SLI testing but it does power to 1080 is
without a problem so that's pretty cool
so that means we'll be able to do all of
our testing inside
of the case without issue so let's just
go over a few things I like you know I
know people like me to sum everything up
at the end of the video so and a hundred
and $69 I feel that the DG 77 is a
little overpriced for what you get like
I said the glass black panel it doesn't
need to be colored it should be clear it
doesn't need to be that high-quality for
this unless you know especially if it's
not going to be clear the front panel
makes no sense there could have been
some design things to make the air flow
a little bit better through the case
like I said you cannot mount any type of
you know big sized radiator on the top
whatsoever or it hits your motherboard
so you're kind of limited you're either
to using that you know the back place we
did it with with a single you know a IO
or you're talking about using the front
depending on how you want to do your
bill but if you put it in the front well
then obviously your airflow is gonna be
different you're only gonna have like a
single thing and then two fans on top to
get the air to move through so I think
the way that we did it with the three
fans pushing the air in and the other
fans taking the air out I think that's a
much better way for building the system
and keeping the airflow going through it
honestly as far as the build goes and
working inside of the case you won't cut
yourself up or anything like that at all
everything is you know it's made so that
you're not gonna like rip your hands up
and all that stuff so those the things
about it that I think you guys I want to
hear you guys opinion below and see what
you think also I know it's a lot of
people said they really hated the DG 77
marking on the case I personally don't
have a problem with that in a way I
think it kind of looks kind of cool like
almost like robotic I know other people
disagree but if you really want it off
of there you can just scrape it off
easily with the razor blade and it's
done and gone and it can be you know off
the case same thing with the EVGA logo
that's down there on the side you either
take that off or what it'll be really
cool if you just to modify something and
make it your own personal thing that way
it's not the EVGA logo it's your own
logo so I'm a lark you guys been
watching Tekken tomorrow like usual all
the parts that we use this bill will be
down below like I said in the very
beginning this is just our particular
build you can build whatever you want
inside of it this video was about using
the DG 77 and it's fun facts of building
a system in it so peace out we'll see
you back here on the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
