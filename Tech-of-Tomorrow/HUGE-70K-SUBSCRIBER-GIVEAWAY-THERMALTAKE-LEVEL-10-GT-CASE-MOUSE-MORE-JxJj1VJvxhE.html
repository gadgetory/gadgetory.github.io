monday edition of tech of tomorrow I'm
elric fairest your host and like usual
we have something interesting we told
you guys there was all kinds of killer
stuff going on so over on our facebook
and our twitter account we've got all of
the latest greatest deals for you guys
here on cyber monday for you tech
addicts and hardware junkies out there
in the world but why are we here today
well like I told you last week that's
right we have an awesome giveaway coming
up this is for our 70k subscription
count we're only about 8,000 away and
with you guys we can be there relatively
in a couple of days now this thing's
totally sponsored by thermaltake it
includes for first prize you get the new
level 10 m gaming mouse a level 10 GT
case and a keyboard second prize winner
wins a soprano case and a mouse and the
third place winner wins a mouse and a
keyboard so this is really cool stuff
there is one drawback don't start
throwing stuff it's not my fault it's
for America only due to the fact of
shipping restrictions trying to ship
this stuff overseas ends up costing
thousands of dollars and makes it
impossible to do these type of things
now I know you guys always get mad but
just picture this thermal takes already
sucking it up by eating the product
money you know the mouse has got to cost
you at least a hundred bucks two cases
there so altogether that's three or four
hundred dollars you're talking five or
six hundred dollars just in the prizes
then if we to ship this stuff
internationally should be a case
internationally is about 200 to 300
dollars believe it or not for the weight
and that's the reason why so I apologize
you guys know I love you but
unfortunately this one is for United
States only uh but I apologize for that
but anyways it's cyber monday all kinds
of killer deals do you guys did like the
video hit the like button if you guys
want to be subscribed please do so
because i'm going to be announcing the
winner of this on twitter and facebook
