folks is tech channel on the planet tech
of tomorrow I mean my pet Wilbur is all
right now I'm just messin y'all what's
going on glad to see you guys back here
once again on tech of tomorrow Elric
euro host now what's going on today got
the Silverstone SS TFT o4b which means
black with window now this is a pretty
damn cool full tower case it's made of
jet aluminum all on the outside interior
made of solid good solid steel that's
right steel like soot better man because
he's super you know I'm saying it's just
all in all it's a really cool case now
you guys are gonna go hmm very
interesting stuff now this thing's not
really totally geared for doing like
water cooling you guys will see that the
back doesn't have like the little round
holes and stuff for putting all the
tubes through that everybody uses that
but still usually cases that are geared
towards I'll do that but you can use an
all-in-one system in this pretty easily
which we actually do we were able to get
a hold of one from Silverstone and we
installed it inside the case quite
nicely this thing's pretty expandable
it's about 200 bucks it's got a window
um I think you guys are gonna like it so
with that said let's jump in and let's
take a look at this damn thing so let's
just start off right here on the front
well we can see that everything
externally is made out of black aluminum
now this is aircraft aluminum it's made
of very high-quality material on the
internal the actual chassis itself is
made of steel now you guys concede they
have their little snowflake will go up
there on the top as we Traverse over to
the right side we can see there's two
USB 3.0 ports a microphone port and a
headphone port now as we also Traverse
back to the left hand side we see the
start to reset button and then here's
just a full-blown side shot of the side
of the case right here you guys can see
here is the manual and the accessories
box the little black things you see
inside of here these are actually to
hold in your extended video card you can
use up to 13 and a half inch
do cards and these things are used to
hold them in all their screws and
necessary parts are also located in the
side of this box so now we're taking a
look at the back now here at the bottom
you can see there is a single slot right
here for 120 millimeter fan also to the
right of that that's where your actual
IO is gonna be a rear i/o of your
motherboard because silverstone does
things a little bit different they
actually turn these things upside down
so it's quite interesting as we move up
the rear of the FTO 4b you guys can see
there's eight expansion slots and then
above that is the power supply now one
thing to be noted that it says that it
doesn't matter what length of power
supply you want to use this case will
accommodate it here we take a quick look
at the bottom of the case where you guys
can see there's four rubberized feet and
all the little indentations and things
that you see are actually for the inside
of the case where you can actually fit
for 2.5 SSDs in the bottom down there or
hard drives whatever you want to choose
taking a quick look at the top of the
case you can see at the bottom of the
picture that this right here is the vent
for the power supply is going to be and
up at the top and the left hand side
there these are your power on and your
HDD light okay so now let's move back to
the front of the case now we add the
door slightly ajar right here and as you
guys can see there's actually foam
padding all along the inside of the door
there's also a dust filter and currently
there are two 180 millimeter fans now
these are their air penetrator 182's you
guys can also see that the wiring
harness for this is very simple and easy
to use and on top of that you have the
two external 5.25 bays so i've now
removed the back panel to the case and
we're gonna start disassembling it
slowly before we put everything back
inside of it now right here you guys can
see there's plenty of space for all of
your cables and everything to go in and
out of the case and be routed quite
nicely also all the parts everything
back here are very nicely made there's
no sharp edges nothing to cut your hands
on and nothing is actually too flimsy at
all to make it junky now let's take a
closer look at how much room we're gonna
have to do the cable management as you
guys can see from our measuring tape you
get actually about one inch of room in
the back to do your cable management
now this should be optimal room for you
guys to be able to hide all your cables
and do all your cable management
properly to have a nice clean and
elegantly built system so now it's
looking straight into the case we can
see that we have the 3.5 a hot swappable
drive bays at the bottom and to the left
of that we have a drive cage for an
additional five now on this Bay you
could fit up to five 3.5 inch hard
drives we can also see the complete wire
harness located here including
everything for your external USB your
speakers your microphone as well as the
fans like I said though before we
actually build the system inside of the
case we're gonna basically gut it so you
guys can see at this point we've gutted
out all of the drive bays the only bays
that are available are the 2.5 which are
located on the very bottom one thing
that is cool about this and Rodney
Reynolds you'll definitely gives us a
thumbs up is yes hoorah the motherboard
tray is removable and as you guys can
see it's very clearly marked about the
different types of motherboard that
you're going to put in so there's no
guesswork whatsoever depending on the
size you want to use it's clearly marked
and the FT for OB will use up to
extended ATX motherboard so we use all
with the mini ITX all the way up to the
big bad boys real quickly let's bounce
back to the front of the case we've
removed the dust filter and you guys can
see the 280 millimeter air penetrator
fans installed we've also removed both
of the drive bays from the 5.25 there on
the top another thing that's really cool
about the fortress FTO 4b is its ability
to be pretty much stripped down all the
way to nothing as you guys can clearly
see we've stripped this thing down to
pretty much totally bare-bones system
now one of the key things that these
guys have talked about in their build is
the chassis out it's made of really
high-grade steel and the external is
made of that high-grade jet aluminum you
guys can clearly see the foam that's all
along the front panel for sound
reinforcement this same foam is located
on the side panel of the case where the
window is located and on the back these
are all made to keep the case running
very very quietly so now that we've tore
the system completely apart let's start
put
back together so let's start off by
installing the two SSDs and on the
bottom you can use up to four 2.5 inch
SSDs we're only going to use two in our
build because we've got some other plans
for that space now for our purposes
we've reinstalled one of the hot
swappable 3.5 bays this is where we're
going to keep our Western Digital hard
drive now even though we're not going to
configure the system this way we thought
we would show you guys what it looks
like anyway so here's the standard 3.5
inch drive bay reinstalled into the case
just so you can see it so here's a real
quick shot of the top with the power
supply installed with the Silverstone
750 watt version it fits in there pretty
good it's not that long and it actually
fits really nicely now as we move back
to the front of the case we've used one
of the five point two five Bay's to
install an optical drive you guys can
see here's who you access the CPU from
the rear of the case and as we bounce
around you guys can see the rear i/o and
this motherboard mounts upside down and
a lot differently than other standard
cases one thing silverstone is known for
is their unique way that they mount
motherboards inside of their cases so
here's what the motherboard looks like
just mounted inside the case we had no
problems at all installing the
motherboard we use an r9 290x video card
for our build and obviously we had to
remove some screws and a couple brackets
from the rear expansion or for the car
to fit in there now like I said
previously in the video you can use up
to 13 and a half inch cards in this
thing so that's pretty incredible if but
thirteen and a half inches long and up
to six inches high so pretty much the
hugest biggest most craziest video cards
in the world are gonna fit inside of
this case so now folks is where things
get a little bit interesting now
previous in the video I told you that
you could use a different type of
configuration with the fans and so we're
here to show you that now
we used the tundra series TV o2
all-in-one Silverstone liquid cooler for
this build and that has two of its own
120 millimeter fans built into the rad
now on the bottom we have a single 120
millimeter fan now that's moving the air
through the system now one thing to take
serious note of is that the tdo - didn't
just mountain
in here we had to do some slight
modifications to make this bad boy fit
now this wasn't Inc Mitch you got to go
out and do any type of crazy mods for
but we did have to use long bolt and a
nut to be able to make it to work we
didn't have any two screws that could
screw on there so taking a look inside
the case you can see that everything is
very very easily and simply installed
now we've also moved some stuff around
like I said we were going to include and
keep one of the hot saw Bowl 3.5 inch
bays we've now moved this over to the
right hand side and we've moved the two
SSDs over the left hand side that's
right we shook up the boat but beyond
that you can see this thing's very very
cleanly laid out as we open the door you
guys can see clearly there are two
indicator lights located on top one is
for the power and one is for the HDD the
FTO 4b also comes with two fat
controllers which are located down below
the two 5.25 external bays the one on
the Left controls the intake the one on
the right controls the outtake or you
can reverse these if you so choose the
case door locks and unlocks by a set of
magnets located on the right hand side
of the case alright folks so we did this
something entirely different this time
never actually did a case review this
way before we thought was pretty
interesting we hope to actually improve
upon it so right off the bat I want to
say a thank you guys for you know
sticking around to watching to the end
and let me hear your comments and stuff
down below if you guys liked this let us
know by hearing that like button below
if there's things you didn't like go
ahead and please leave your comments and
stuff like that down below because we
always wanna hear well anyways VAR she
blows sure mom I mean I mean the case so
that's pretty much it a little bit over
200 bucks full Tower lots of expansion
you guys can see you probably fit
probably three cards in SLI or crossfire
mode in there whichever way you guys
wanted to choose you can use a big ol
huge power supply extended ATX
motherboard so pretty much all the
motherboards out there gonna fit inside
of it overall I think this thing is
actually a pretty nice product now some
people around unboxing they're like whoa
200 bucks but hey when you're paying for
high-end jet aluminum like hey it's very
expensive stuff I mean this thing
actually is very very nicely built and
that's one thing I want to really
mention when these guys set up to make
this case they were trying to hit three
markets at one time they were trying to
get good looks they were trying to get
excellent cooling and they were also
trying to get it to be very silent hence
all that foam packages on the doors in
the back of the sides of the cases and
all that stuff and those respects
they've succeeded so make sure before
you complain and go ah take a look at
all the different things that they were
trying to hit upon and I think they
succeeded now is it like the Mona Lisa
of the most you know interesting thing
in the entire world no but is it very
elegant simple and nice yes it is
everything's very easy accessible the
door very easily opens all your reset
and power buttons all stuff from the
side so at the end of the day I got to
say I like this case hope you guys too
want to see your comments down below
once again if you're interested of
making a system like this all of the
parts that we're using this system will
be listed down there below in the
description so you hit that little show
more button down there it will pop on
down where you guys can see links to all
that stuff the case all the parts so if
you want to mimic it hey you think the
thing you can peace out look at see you
guys back in the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
