once again to the channel now we all
know that Computex 2019 just ended and
pretty much the most exciting news at
the whole show obviously was what AMD
announced Nvidia Intel their
announcements were kind of like ho-hum
and it kind of really seems to me like
Intel's kind of in a desperate State
because they're showing things in doing
things at Computex which to me seemed
kind of strange for one thing in 2035
I honestly personally don't think video
cards are going to look anything like
the standard video cards that we see now
I've said it before and I'll say it
again I feel that video card should be a
chip that you just change out so you'd
have to keep buying a new video card
over and over again and I think as we
see technology emerge it's going to be
that way but anyways Intel has a bunch
of different cards that they put out
that they say hey this might be our card
in 2035 and another thing is is if
Intel's really not getting into the
graphics card business till 2035 Intel
I'm sorry ma'am but you are a day late
and you're seriously a freaking dollar
short but anyways let's take a look at
these cards and let's just see what they
proposed what stuff might look like in
2035 as if one thing to take into
consideration however I guess Intel says
that these aren't necessarily going to
be their cards but they're just cards
that are being conceptualized for the
future and why they're even doing this
at all I don't know it kind of blows my
mind but hey here it is first up we have
the Andromeda and you guys can see this
card it looks pretty much like the cards
that we have on the market today really
look at a lot of the zotac cards they
have a similar design so if in 2035 all
we're gonna get is a little bit of a
more a blue LED light yeah I'll go ahead
and pass but I mean it does look cool
but in 2035 I would really think that
things are gonna be much different 15
years from now than they are now next up
they have the gemini card and you guys
can see this card's kind of interesting
the
design is a little bit different the way
that it's designed is you know slightly
bit different but still it's just the
same video card it's a three fan design
obviously the fans look different
they're you know obviously future fans
will hopefully look different so they
can provide air but to me it's still
just a standard stick in video card and
I really don't think we're going to see
a PCI interface in 2035 but hey there
you go
it's the Gemini next up we have the
Oblivion now right off the bat when I
see this what comes to mind is steampunk
I mean really this card looks like it
came out of a steampunk movie which is
kind of cool I mean out of the ones so
far I mean I think this one at least
looks really cool it doesn't really look
like your standard video card whatsoever
I kind of like this design I don't know
man um it's really hard I think to even
conceptualize what's gonna be going on
in 2035 because things are gonna be
different so I think what these guys are
doing are there just conceptualizing
what cards you know might look like
periods in the future 2035 I don't know
but anyways at least this one looks cool
the Oblivion out of all of them to me
looks something out of a steampunk movie
and if you were doing a steampunk build
this car would definitely fit in there
without a problem
next up we have the prometheus and right
off the bat when I see this card I
instantly think phasers this looks like
a card that a Zeus would make right now
so why they're saying this is gonna be
something 15 years from now I don't know
hey Zeus already has cards that look
similar to this that are on the market
today in 2019 I mean it does look pretty
cool the designs cool and all but this
could be made right now so to me that's
really no great jump in technology or
design and then last up we have the
serious now looking at this card what
comes to my mind right off the bat is
Tron this definitely looks like all the
Tron stuff that I bought back in the day
it looks like the mouse and keyboard the
color scheme is exactly the same
I'm if you guys have ever seen any of
the Tron stuff that came out in the past
you'd agree this really looks like
something out of Tron even the movie
it's very Tron --is-- and one thing
about this card is it does look a little
bit different than the others you don't
see a PCI insertion piece on the bottom
so this card at least out of all the
cards has something that conceptualizes
past your standard PCI slot you know all
in all I know this is a pretty short
video I don't even really know why intel
is doing this it kind of just seems kind
of like a desperate move on Intel's part
just to get people involved with them I
mean why would Intel even care what
other people's cards look like in 2035
this would have made a lot more sense if
this was geared towards their particular
card but just saying hey everybody join
our program and tell us what you think a
an XE car to look like in 2035 I don't
know it seems kind of like a waste of
time to me I'd like to hear what you
guys think as well I think that most of
us agree at this point that Intel is
falling behind the curve and it's pretty
much they're doing a desperate grab in
any direction that they can do to bring
some attention over to them but instead
of focusing on stuff that's complete BS
and it has nothing to do with the
industry they should be focusing on
themselves and making their hardware and
all their stuff that they have a lot
better but unfortunately at this point
it seems like Intel has really stagnated
out but hey if you want to see some cool
designs of what you know people think
cards might be then hey check these out
you know and you might be like hey
that's cool but most of these designs to
me all seem like they could be done
today
all but the serious one that doesn't
have a PCIe slot so all of these other
cards could literally be made right now
if somebody went to their company either
a Zeus gigabyte MSI EVGA any of those
companies that make things P&amp;amp;Y
any of them said hey we really want you
to make a car that looks just like this
they can make it right now why would
they have to wait till 2035 anyways you
guys been watching Tecna maro there's a
pretty quick video here but like usual
leave your comments down below we'll
have links down below so if you guys
want to check out or join this
initiative program for some reason
you're born ain't got nothing else to do
with your life than hey you can do it I
know Eric you've been watchin tech go
tomorrow if you want to support the
channel you can sub the channel hit your
notification so people know what's up if
you like the music we've got links to
our music and all that good stuff
we've got patreon Instagram oh all that
stuff so if you want to follow us there
