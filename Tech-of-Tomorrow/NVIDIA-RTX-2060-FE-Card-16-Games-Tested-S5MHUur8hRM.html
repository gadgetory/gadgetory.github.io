date of the brand-new Nvidia RTX 2060
founders Edition card come in to market
at three hundred and forty nine dollars
if you happen to miss the unboxing video
we'll have a link down below you guys
can check that out not a lot came in the
box but you guys are into that stuff
check out that video now today's video
we're gonna be showing you how this card
runs all of its nice fun facts and if
it's actually worth your money at 349 is
an entry-level r-tx card so let's real
quick what's jump in and let's take a
close-up of the card talk about
everything it's inside of it and then
move on to the test system and then
those scores with the benchmark song so
let's jump right in take a look at the
top the card you guys can see it clearly
says our TX 2060 on the card features
the two fan design and these fans are
designed to provide a lot of airflow
against the components underneath there
which is all the cooling apparatus
they're also made to be very quiet if
you've seen our other reviews all of
these new r-tx cards have been running
really cool and really quiet across the
board if you look down below that you
guys can actually see some of the heat
fins that are part of the heating
apparatus or rather the cooling
apparatus of the card take a look at the
rear of the card these guys are doing
something very interesting with the r-tx
card and I think it's a really great
design they have all the power
connections at the very rear of the card
making for cable management to be better
now this particular card takes a single
8 pin power connector it's recommend
that you have a minimum of a 160 watt
power supply to power up this bad boy
now taking a look at the top of the card
one thing you guys are gonna notice
right off the bat is there's no envy
link on the 2060 r-tx card now it's kind
of sad it would have been really cool to
be able to put two of these together and
get better performance but for some
reason NVIDIA has forgot to put that on
there either forgot or just outright
said hey screw it we're not going to do
that but you guys can still see more of
the heat fins and everything that
happens to it the cooling apparatus
obviously the GeForce r-tx on the top
and on the back of the car I think it's
really nice because they have a very
good heat shield once again we just see
the RT X 2060 they're gonna put this all
of the car making sure you know exactly
what card this is if you were to want to
change the cooling all of these screws
and everything in the back can be easily
removed so you could put on a liquid
cool
anything else after market if you wanted
to now the things that you can't see
about this card is that this card has
240 tensor cores and it delivers up to
52 teraflops of power it has 1920 CUDA
cores 30 RT cores 120 texture units 48
ROPS 37 r-tx sobs it has a boost clock
speed of 1680 megahertz it has 14 Giga
bits a second of memory data rate it
features six gigabytes of gddr5 bit
memory interface and 336 point one
gigabytes a second of memory bandwidth
one thing nice about this card is on the
input part of the car which is what you
see on the back your case it's all black
which looks pretty cool it also has the
nvidia logo we see a single DVID
connection a type c to display ports in
a single HDMI port for your connectivity
alright so those are all the fun facts
about the card the card is also 9 inches
long by 4 inches high and it features a
dual slot design the card looks really
good for the price $349 everything looks
good on paper but how does that
translate you know into real numbers at
the end of the day well first let's
check out our test system and then let's
check out those performance numbers with
the benchmark song now as far as our
test system goes we have an Asus raw
Maximus 10 motherboard we have an i7
8700 K we have 32 gigabytes of gddr5
memory we have two different hard drives
for the storage these are both C gates
or two terabyte drives and for our boot
drive we have a single SSD drive now as
far as all the drivers go we use the
latest drivers available at the time of
the testing and we have Windows with all
of the latest updates that are available
at the time as well now with that said
let's check out a brand new benchmark
song from my band seven deadly sins and
let's check out those performance
numbers
the card got as hot as 72 Celsius under
full load which is really not bad at all
plus the car does run very quiet even
when the fans are running at full load
alright so there you have it folks the
entry-level r-tx 2060 from the folks
over at Nvidia now the big strong point
about this card obviously is that it's
three hundred and forty nine dollars
making it very affordable for users out
there but the biggest push about this
and the thing that Nvidia really wanted
to get across was its performance in
battlefield 5 that's a game that's being
played a lot right now and you guys can
see this card gets crazy performance
even with ultra settings on we're
talking about over a hundred on 1080 at
1440 we're seeing 77 and just a little
bit under 60 on 4k for a car that's
three hundred and forty nine dollars
plus the card runs pretty cool it's not
loud whatsoever at the end of the day I
have to say it an Nvidia hit a real home
run this particular card for gamers out
there who wanted to get really great
performance they want to have a car
that's future proof for all the r-tx
stuff and everything that's coming to
the market this is definitely a card
worth checking out at the moment
unfortunately AMD doesn't really have
anything that's competing with this on
the market hopefully we'll see Nabi and
other stuff coming out in 2019 that will
do that but for now for the budget cards
I have to say that the 2060 r-tx
Founders Edition is an editor's choice
and a definite win in the budget choice
take it easy I'm Elric like usual we'll
have a link down below where you guys
can check out one of these cards or
purchase one for yourself if you so
choose peace this week we're at CES so
there's lots of exciting stuff coming to
the channel so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
