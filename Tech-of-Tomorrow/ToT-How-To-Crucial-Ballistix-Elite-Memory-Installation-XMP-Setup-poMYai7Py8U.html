current echo tomorrow and today we're
going to show you something I get a lot
of questions on I get many emails from
people and messages saying hey man I
drew a spot new memory but when I put it
in my computer it doesn't show up at the
right speed well there's a reason for
that most of the time your computer just
defaults at whatever its standard memory
clock speed is so if you see the board
and says 1300 and that's what it's gonna
be at when you boot it up now with that
said though there is a way to engage
your memory and make sure you're getting
the maximum performance out of it now
today I'm using this new Crucial
Ballistix this is the ballistic elite
memory it's 1866 megahertz it's cast
nine 1.5 volts now what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go in and set the extreme
memory profile on my asus motherboard
now I have the maximum for extreme
motherboard back behind me on a test
station first I'm going to show you how
to put the memory onto the board and
then we're gonna jump in the BIOS and
I'll show you how to make sure that your
memory is running at all the correct
speeds so with that said let's jump over
now and let's first install the memory
onto the motherboard alright folks so
here we can see we have the z77
motherboard on the test station
I'm gonna go install the first set of
memory sticks you can see that back here
this is locked this doesn't move at all
so you're gonna want to make sure that
you have a little notch in here that
matches up to the notch in the
motherboard so inside the Lane I'm gonna
go ahead and put the first stick in and
I'm going to very gently push the memory
down and then lock it into place I'm
gonna do this four times until I get all
four sticks in the slots so just keep
doing this one at a time I'm kind of at
a weird angle when I'm doing this I
should rip I stood up for this video but
here's that here's a third slot here
and last but not least we have the four
stick we have all four sticks of memory
in place so now I can go ahead and
replug back in the 24 pin power supply
now I'm gonna go ahead and set the test
station back to where it goes and we're
gonna boot it up into the BIOS okay
folks so now I'm gonna go ahead and
start the system up and when you start
the system up the very first thing
you're going to want to do is to the
Delete key on your keyboard you're gonna
see a little screen pop up on the window
it's gonna ask you to do that I usually
just start biting the Delete key anyways
you can see press delete dinner the BIOS
now this is the latest cat BIOS from
Asus works very very well works with
very many different mice I tried a bunch
of different ones working really good
now you can see when you first come in
here it is the target DRAM speed of 13
33 megahertz now that's not the 1866
that this memory was geared for so many
people just go ahead and start the
computer up leave it in there and don't
do anything so we're gonna go down here
through different stuff don't do this a
lot of people just go in here and they
change the memory frequency to a high
rate this can sometimes result in your
system being overclocked and being
unstable you want to find the XMP
profile that's what we're gonna do now
what you want to do though is you're
gonna want to go in here to where you
have your AI overclocked tuner inside of
here
you click a button you know it's Auto
manual and XMP so you're going here you
enable the XMP profile you can see now
it says XMP ddr3 1867 and all the castes
and rafts values are all there including
the correct voltage so after that all
you do is you go up to the exit screen
Save Changes in reset hit yes and now
we'll watch the system reboot and you'll
see that the system recognizes the
memory that's correct values it's very
easy to do but so many people forget to
do this ok everybody I really hope that
that helps it's a very simple thing to
do but it's
important to do in many other
motherboards it may look a little bit
different but it's gonna be also very
similar just gonna want to make sure
that you happened the BIOS and make sure
you engage your XMP profile the extreme
memory profile is there for a reason
make sure you use it now on the screen
behind me I have a shot of CPU ID where
it actually shows all the different
memory timings and all the things about
the crucial memory as well here you can
see all of the cast and Rass values you
can see there's also a bunch of
different settings into the far right
you can see the one that we're using
which is the one that's the next MP
profile so that's it folks tell us what
you guys think of this video should we
do more how-to videos we were thinking
about doing how to install a video card
how to install sound cards let us know
what you guys think your feedbacks
important peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
