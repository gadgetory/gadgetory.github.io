Halloween did you guys can see it's
December 31st here in the United States
and I know other places in the world
that you're not you know celebrating the
same thing but here the United States
today is our owl Hallows Eve our
Halloween and what better to bring out
the 390x devil card from people over at
power color whoo-hoo so what is this
thing okay
it's a 390 X so it's got all you know
the basic things that three Navy X has
based on 20 enemy to process it's got
4096 stream processors comes out of the
gate at 1,100 megahertz and as far as
memory goes you get eight gigabytes of
gddr5 with a 512 bit memory interface
with that said though let's jump in and
like check out this card open I guess
really the big thing about it is this
card is actually a dual thing it's a
card that um has two modes it's a hybrid
it runs on an air cooler that's actually
a smart cooler so that means that if it
gets cool it just turns off and it also
has water cooling so whatever type of
cooling you need this card actually has
it on it which is really really you know
pretty cool type of thing it's pretty
you know what's weird before ingenuitive
not sent the word exactly yeah
but I like that word ingenuitive
ingenuitive you guys know what I mean
that it was a great idea to come up with
something like that because nobody else
is really doing that even though you
know might not be there like they
totally like you know breaking the moon
it's still pretty cool stuff that power
coolers doing breaking out a card like
that a lot of people may not know who
power color is they're like you know one
of them or you know I would say like you
know offshoot brands but they've been
around for years and years and years
doing this they have great warranties
and this card since it is totally geared
for overclocking and everything is made
with the absolute best components that
they can get their hands on so you guys
know I'm talking about any of the
high-end cards from any other
manufacturer you buy if they're pushing
at it as an overclocking card they're
using the absolute best components now
this card supposed to be able to run 20%
cooler than any of the other cards that
are out there and um I guess we'll see
that we actually get into testing so for
those of you really care here's the
devil box the front of the Box not the
end of the world here is the back of the
box and let's go ahead now and don't
worry
would you guys hear that that was pretty
awesome I thought so anyways alright so
we've got the
hardness box here once again the Box
ception box inside of a box and I will
pop the cap here
dun dun dun dun dun da da alright so
what comes in the box so let's see here
we've got a little power cable adapter
right here then we've got anything else
in there oh yes we let's see what we got
in here ah yep we've got some different
types of screws and stuff this is
probably for changing the hardware
that's what's usually for one set of
cards like this nature and that will
pull the card out of here but boom boom
boom boom okay now I pretty much think
that's it so let me just see if there's
anything else in here nope I don't think
there is once again
we shall take the box and we will kill
that cameraman with it missed him by
they have much heat back there laughing
but I came close alright so check it out
folks this is the car so that's pretty
much everything that came in the box now
let's set this bad boy up here and let's
actually take a real close look at the
card so they take a look at the top of
the card now you guys are gonna see that
there's a shroud that's covering it now
this particular shroud though I've got
to say is it's kind of plasticky and
kind of flimsy I think other people have
kind of felt the same way
I mean to me it's not the end of the
world I mean all the modern cars and
stuff today many things in your house
are still made of plastic you're not
going to keep your video car for 20
years so probably by the time this
plastic goes bad you're gonna be moved
on to another card anyways so even
though it is kind of funky and it's not
the coolest thing in the world I know
some people said it's ugly but I
disagree with that I don't actually
think it's ugly whatsoever do you think
it's ugly gee no it's not ugly it's it's
it's different looking I'll give you
that you know it's got a single fan
spinning around right here
silver is mixed in with the look you
guys also see the devil now also I
figured since the car was a devil card
me personally I thought what I had more
you know features that were like red
themed you know hell devil and a little
horny guy he's already got a pointed
tail I noticed that many of you
motherfuckers out there familiar with
this guy so you guys know who he is
so anyways we'll take a little quick
look at the side of the card you guys
can see some of the components all going
through there underneath
the fan housing and you guys can see
there's actually some room between the
fan housing and the car which is
actually pretty cool because it actually
gives a fan a little bit of room to get
that air moving before it goes in it to
the PCB so I give thumbs up that design
on the bottom you see the PCI slot
that's where you stick the card in your
motherboard I think all of you guys know
that by now
and as we spend the card around the back
you guys can see a little bit of the
cooling solution you guys can see part
of the heat pins right there that's what
helps keep the card cool as well then
we're going to flip the card up on top
and you guys can see it clearly says on
top hybrid which I told you guys I'm
against a hybrid card and as we move up
the card real quick you guys can see
that there are two rubber hoses that are
going out into the fan now this is
bringing the liquid to and from the card
keeping it cool and as far as the power
requirements you can see there's a
single eight pen and a single six pin
power connector on the card as far as
connections go you get two DVI ports an
HDMI port and a display port and getting
back to the liquid part of the cooling
solution you guys can see that there's
an external radiator and a fan now this
can be mounted anywhere inside of many
cases it's not very obtrusive so you
guys should have no problem mounting
this just like you would a fan inside of
many different systems so that's pretty
cool now the back of the car now it's
pretty interesting now we're starting to
see the devil in red and black I know
you guys hate that write your
Congressman or I don't know tell Mom
maybe she'll come over and spank me I
don't know maybe I was a bad boy you
guys let me know I mean it's Halloween
all things are possible so anyways
that's pretty much the card guys you
guys have all seen the 390x it's been
out in the market for quite a while now
um you guys are any you guys are
wondering why my little review is a
little bit late the original card I got
was actually so damn fast that it just
kept having problems so I had to flash
the BIOS get a new BIOS try it until I
finally got a car that's actually stable
and very fast now as far as the
overclocking goes like I said this thing
is a live another maker it's out of the
box but this thing will go to 1215
megahertz no problem this boots and I
think you guys are going to be pretty
surprised at how cool this card runs I
actually really was surprised so with
that said let's real quick let's check
out that test system
let's rock out to the benchmark song and
then let's talk about what this card is
at the end of the day and why you might
want to get it for your system
all right folks so there you guys have
it water-cooled 390x double edition from
the people over power color now you guys
can see it this card runs amazingly cool
even when this thing's pushing its
maximum it was only at 58 Celsius that's
a very very cool running card so
obviously the water cool and this
hybrids cooling solution is really
working very well and having the smart
fan Edition 2 is pretty cool because if
your cards running and you want to be
completely silent that FAL just shut off
and you'll have a completely silent
running system so few people out there
who don't care about overclocking you
only care about silent this car will
fill those shoes just as well now as far
as gaming goes you guys can see that
this card does really really well it's a
4 to $99 car but at least it does have 8
gigabytes of gddr5 memory me personally
I would have liked have seen the fury
series with gddr5 memory you know and
just seeing what the card would have
been combined with that figi chipset you
know that just would have been really
really cool but as it is this is a
killer card I think it's coming to
market at about $500 I mean if you guys
want me to find something to complain
about I mean I guess you know that is a
slightly kind of high price you know 500
bucks for a video card you could
probably get one this you know a little
faster if you want to pay more money but
there are a lot of really cool things
about this card I like it if you guys
are an AMD fan out there and you're
looking for a card for your system
that's really not over-the-top expensive
runs really cool it still gets you some
great gaming performance of 1080p this
is a card you should seriously be
looking at now as far as 4k goes I mean
this card will do for cases it does have
the 8 gigabytes of memory it'll do it ok
but really I don't think any card right
now is really totally ultimately geared
by itself to push 4k at great
resolutions just the way things are give
it a gear and the entire market will be
completely changed but for right now
that's just what it is so I'm gonna lurk
you guys been watching tikka tomorrow
you guys want to get more information
about this card you guys can see it down
there but like button you guys know what
to do if you guys want to buy one Hey do
so I'm sure that day you'll love this
card in your system
peace out we'll see you guys back here
on teka tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
