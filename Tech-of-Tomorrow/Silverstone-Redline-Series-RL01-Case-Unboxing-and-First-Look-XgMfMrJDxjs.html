take in a more YouTube channel trying to
beat the frickin heat we just got back
from meeting at Nvidia in downtown LA
and dude it was 110 degrees outside we
stood in alive at Pink's to get a hot
dog and I swore to God by the end of it
I felt like I was the fucking hot dog
they should just slap my ass in a bun
through chili on me and served me up man
can't believe me I was hot and sweaty
but anyways that's not what we're here
today today we're gonna bring you guys
an unboxing and first look at our new
case in people over at Silverstone this
is their our lo1 case now those things
come into market about $80 so it's very
affordable and should have some pretty
cool features so that said let's dig in
and let's just see what this case is all
about
alright folks we want to start off
showing you the box because it's an
unboxing so you'll see the damn box
right so here it is is one of their red
line series cases the rlo one nothing
much on the front of the box but as we
spend the box around you can see that
all the features are actually listed you
can see them all here at the different
types of fans everything's in the case
is pretty much listed right here we're
gonna actually delve into it but anyways
you guys can just see this stuff right
here to read about it now when you guys
are doing the comments please don't tell
me why didn't I build a dam system it
this is the unboxing and first look so
we're just going to show you it talk
about some of the features that's about
it so here's my little trusty knife yep
it's a little tiny blade very small
maybe too small for this job I don't
know but we'll go ahead and and we'll do
some incisions here I take my knife I'm
gonna do a real quick
slice I'm gonna take a slicer inside
right take in to this slice over here
like it's gonna be pirate on this game
cries you guys can see little snowflake
logo all prevalent there in the case so
I go ahead and turn the table around now
do you guys have you for some of the
specifications the material is
high-strength plastic and meshed front
panel it uses micro ATX standard ATX
motherboards it's got three 5.25 drive
bays 13.5 and finally an internal bay
that can be there were 3.5 or 5.2 5 now
as far as the system fans it comes with
one front 120 millimeter red intake fan
120 millimeter fan slots in the rear
there are two top matted 100 millimeter
fans with an option for another one and
the bottom has one 120 millimeter fan
has seven expansion slots and some USB
3.0 on top to put that all sit with it
let's actually look at the damn thing
find the firm ago I just pop it take
this off
start taking all out alright one piece
at a time you get this stuff a lot of
here throw it the cameraman whoa all
right I'm sorry cameraman dude all right
so let's start off why not on the top
okay now it says that it came with 220
millimeter fans I don't see any fans at
the top of this case whatsoever so
they're obviously at optional things
they're not there but there's space for
two of them up around the front I've got
a little tape here protecting these USB
3.0 headphone mic one two three five
point two five Bay's the internal down
here check smooth stuff let's see if
there these are Bay's nope they're not
and this is the on button here little
flower nice little flower little thing
there your reset button is actually a
weird fucking location right here this
is your reset I think that's just a
weird weird location for a reset button
it's actually kind of weird hard to push
into I'm not liking this design you
can't even push it with your finger I'm
not liking that you guys not kind of
like that either that part of the design
actually sucks
I'm sorry Silverstone I like you guys
but this sucks
I came and pushed that with my normal
finger so that's the for the case so
it's spinning around let's take a look
at the bottom see at the bottom has to
offer
on the bottom you can see you have
removable mesh right here the cut slides
out you can clean this off if you need
to inside of a fountain or anything else
we needed to no problemo once again room
for two 120mm your fans and it comes
with none that's why I see no fans and
ears of yet one two three four little
rubber feet pretty easy they pop on and
off those aren't too bad so let's go
ahead and remove the front panel now now
I can't totally offer you the front
panel so I tried you guys any brand over
here if you guys can see it but there
there's too many wires connected for me
to remove it everything's wired up so
even though the front panel gets removes
you can like take on these drive bays
out like so you just pop the case front
back on it's really not that big of a
deal okay
spinning around you see we had one side
wind on the side it's got plastic both
the front and back let's go to the thumb
screws on the back let me move it around
here for you folks here on the back you
can see we have four thumb screws we
have two holes in case you want to use
liquid cooling they're pretty small so I
don't think they're gonna work with any
of the half-inch stuff but some of the
smaller stuff it about me okay
had no problem getting these off by the
way no problem you moving the side panel
so let's take a look at that here's a
side panel I'll go ahead just put that
up to the side let's take a look now at
the internals of the case all your drive
bays are lockable right here all these
are removable right here these are which
drives in you put your drives in and you
use these little things you put them
back in here and clip it away you go so
inside right here we have all the tapes
accessories I'll go ahead and remove
those out of there these little twist
tie they're moving out got all kinds of
stuff in here and clean two users manual
I'm go ahead and pull that will push for
you guys to see turn it to bad just shut
Red's
sometimes easier said than done but
though this is just a really small piece
of paperwork so not much here whatsoever
small piece of paperwork the rest of
your system parts another filter screen
you've got your USB 3.0 connections all
the rest your connections for the front
all right here for your motherboard now
there's no removable motherboard tray
there is plenty of room though on the
other side to get your CPU so let's get
to that part - as we finish this up also
on the back here you can see there's
also room again for another fan your
power supply mounts down here I stated
earlier you have water cooling
accessories here and seven slot base for
your video cards so you know for a mid
tower case it looks like it's got you
know quite a living room cable
management in this is going to be pretty
mill flip this around and show you guys
kill madam in this case there's no room
you at your hands back behind here so
only the flat type cables even be able
to lay in there whatsoever so there's
not a lot of cable management
plenty of room though for your CPU
access so that's pretty much it man one
down the front is all that comes with it
so you get a single 120 millimeter fan
that's all that comes stock and that's
it guys I mean this is the silverstone
rlo one come into the market at $80 look
for the full review and slideshow coming
