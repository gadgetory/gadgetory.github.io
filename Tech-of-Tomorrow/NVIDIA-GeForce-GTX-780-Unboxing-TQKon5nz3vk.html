in sunny Southern California and you
guys and let's you've been living in
outer space know that today is the
launch date of the new geforce gtx 780
rumored to be the new king of the ring
as far as single GPUs are concerned now
this puts AMD in a really kind of
difficult situation I don't think
there's really any way for them to win
right now unless they use like that
time-space continuum thing and you know
travel back in time with the spaceship
er
so here we have the box that was given
to us in our reviewers sample kit from
Nvidia you guys can just see it simply
says GeForce GTX got their little logo
on the side of the box nothing else to
talk about there so we're not gonna
waste any time with that we will just go
ahead and start taking it out of the box
get out little clips here come on here
not too much this so go ahead and open
it up though so check this out folks we
open the box right off the bat we can
see we get a special edition collector
sticker this is NVIDIA GeForce GTX
that's right here it's actually a pretty
cool case badge is what it is and that
can be used for putting on the front of
your case if you want to show off that
you're using the Green Team inside your
system so let's get that out of the way
now here's the card a lot of times with
the reference samples that we get they
don't come with really anything else at
all and this pretty much seems to be the
same they pretty much figure if your
reviewer and you've been reviewing video
cards close to your life that you have
these parts yes we do so now here we see
the card we see it's got this little
anti-static label there we'll go ahead
and pop the cap on that let me move it
out of there a little anti-static bag
there but it'll be safe then sorry so
let's get it out of our bag there okay
now show you guys the black back of the
PCB first and so we have it there now
this card size is in it 10.5 inches by 4
inches high and it's a dual slot design
you guys can see there are four screws
right back here if you actually want to
go ahead and try to remove the shroud
which I wouldn't suggest up here on top
we see the two sli fingers so you can do
Quad SLI configurations we also see the
pcie 3.0 flip the card around so you
guys can see the front side now you guys
are gonna notice right off the bat this
thing looks just like a Titan has the
same shroud the same cooling same
everything what I actually think would
have been really cool is picture this
if they reverse the color scheme so this
part right here would be silver like
this but the rest of the car would be
black I personally think that would have
been pretty badass now here you can see
the nomenclature gtx 780 right there so
it seems like some of the leaks that
came out were true that one panned out
to be one of them here's the nvidia logo
back down here on the end see a single
blower design all the heat fins and
everything are underneath there like I
said it's a two slot design card very
very nice looking and very clean looking
now show you guys the back side right
here here you can see some more of the
heat fins this is part of the cooling I
will flip it around one more time to its
side where you guys can see it requires
one six pen one eight pin power
connector and clearly has the GeForce
GTX nomenclature there now one thing I
want you guys to take note of so check
it out this is this card and here we see
the previous generation reference card
this is the reference gtx 680 so good
just set that back there set that there
you guys can see them right next to each
other totally different cooling solution
all the way around
I really think Nvidia did an excellent
job with changing out the cooling
solution now last up before we get out
of here we'll just show the rear IOT's
of the card and see if there's any
difference there I don't believe there's
gonna be too much difference at all and
as you can see the difference is none at
all still to dvis signal DisplayPort
single HDMI alright so there you have it
the brand new geforce gtx 780 unbox now
I know this wasn't any retail box
product but so many people out there
want to see unboxings in we don't want
to miss out on those folks and we didn't
want them to miss out on us either
bringing the unboxing plus we have all
kinds of great stuff that's gonna be
going on today during the day today
we're gonna have all the performance
benchmarks whenever gameplay videos
we're gonna have shots of our test
station just all kinds of killer
goodness all about that now if you're
impatient and you want to see the
performance scores and everything right
now well then click on this link right
here and you guys can go check that out
for yourself I'm Elric thanks for
