hey what's going on tech fans welcome
back once again to the channel today
we're going to be checking out something
really cool from the people over at
Corsair this is their scimitar Pro now
they have their version but you know
what I've got mine now if you're a
person out there
you play mobile games you play MMOs this
is the type of mouse that you want why
well because a lot of those games out
there require that you do these multiple
button things to like throw a spell or
do those different things well with this
mouse you no longer have to do that
because you can program everything into
this Mouse
take it with you wherever you go and
play your heart's content with all the
buttons you need to cast those nasty
spells and kill the enemies with that
said though let's jump in real quick and
let's check out the scimitar Pro and
what this bad boy is all about the
scimitar Pro actually comes in two
different colors there's a yellow one
which absolutely looks badass and then
there's the black version which we're
checking out today now like I said the
absolute best feature in my book about
the scimitar Pro is the fact that you
can program all 17 buttons through the Q
software now when you first buy the
mouse it comes pre-programmed with a
bunch of buttons so you can get up and
going but if you want to customize this
thing to your exact specifications just
hop into the Q software and you can
program it to anything you want no
longer you have to hit three keys to do
a spell two keys to hit a spell heck no
now you can just hit one single key and
be up and killing your enemies in-game
now some of the buttons are really cool
there's twelve of them located on the
left hand side but the really cool
feature about the scimitar Pro and the
buttons that are located on the left
hand side is that the module can be
moved to the front or to the back
depending on where your hand feels the
most comfortable that makes it a very
ergonomic Mouse all around looking at
the top of the mouse you can see there
are a few buttons right in the center
now the scroll Mouse it's click and roll
but down below that you get buttons for
adjusting your dpi and you also get
three different profiles that are
programmed into the mouse and you can
change this to your own specification as
well so that no matter what game you're
playing you just hit your profile and
you're ready to rock
and because the Scimitar pro has
built-in memory even if you unplug the
mouse and take it on the go it will
remember everything that you've
programmed in it
you can game wherever you are you also
get the normal to click buttons right
and left on top the mouse and then on
the right-hand side there's a nice
little resting place for your finger
which is made out of soft rubber another
really nice feature about the scimitar
Pro is the way that it actually detects
your mouse pad and sets the sensor level
to exactly what you want it to be that
means that no matter what mouse pad
you're using you set the Scimitar Pro
down you use the software you spin it
around in a little circle and when you
do this your mouse is automatically set
to the perfect sensor reading for the
mouse pad you're using I like that
because let's just face it there are a
ton of mouse pads out there and having
to do that pretty much on the fly for
you is pretty excellent stuff the DPI
settings on the Scimitar Pro can go all
the way from 1 all the way up to 16 K so
regardless of what you're doing with
your gaming whether you're playing on
the Internet you can set that sensor in
minut levels all the way to suit your
perfect need the Scimitar Pro also
features 4 zone RGB and what this means
is you can custom set the colors to
different places on your mouse to
anything that you want and what's even
cooler is the buttons themselves on the
left hand side light up so this thing
not only plays games it also looks
pretty damn cool to the Scimitar pro
weighs 147 grams so if you like a little
bit of a heavier Mouse I think you'll be
very happy with the weight on this one
now features and all those things
they're great but when you're playing a
game you want the mouse that you're
using to be very comfortable and
ergonomic so that you're not getting an
ache in your hand or getting black
called game fatigue after playing for
hours on end the Scimitar pro is very
well made it feels nice in your hand I
have a medium sized hand and it fits on
my hand just perfect I think it's
someone has very very large hands this
might not be the perfect fit but if you
have smaller hands or medium sized hands
the Scimitar pro is going to feel really
nice the button configuration the left
hand side is really really important to
those gamers out there who want to get
the kill shot or they just want to be
able to make sure that they can activate
their spell or whatever they're doing
automatically and not hit the wrong
button the Scimitar pro is very easy to
use in that respect all the buttons like
I said earlier are located right down
below your thumb and they can be moved
to the front or the back
so that no matter where your hand fits
on the mouse it'll be easy for you to
click on
and kill your opponent overall with all
the features and a comfort level I have
to say at the end of the day the
Scimitar Pro is one seriously badass
Mouse and you guys know I like stuff
that's badass
so take a shot all right so there you
have it the Scimitar pro from the people
over at Corsair like I said before if
you guys play MOBA games you play those
games that are online and require a lot
of buttons and spells and all that you
want to waste your time clicking through
a bunch of keys to get there then this
is the perfect thing for that because
you can program it to whatever you want
it to be and then BAM get in there and
kick ass on your enemies now is it the
actual best tool to bring to a battle I
don't know because I think my scimitar
can do some damage anyways you guys want
