junkies it's me el Ark your host here on
the tech of tomorrow YouTube channel
bringing you guys something really cool
from the people over at Thermaltake and
no it's not the dog you know he has to
be a part of every video this is
actually the new smart series of power
supplies from the people over at thermal
tech I've got the box right here behind
me just gonna go and bring it out you
guys can see this is this one right here
we're looking at is the smart 630 watt
one that's more looking at today has a
five year warranty it's 80 plus
certified you see in the back of the box
everything in there and so really
without much further ado let's actually
jump in and unbox this bitch yeah okay
so here we move on to the actual
unboxing you guys see I got my trusty
knife right here there's a nice plastic
cover all the way around this so I'm
gonna go ahead and just make a couple
little slits in the plastic go ahead and
just get this stuff take a nice good rip
on it no reason to take care with it at
all
now you guys are wondering probably what
exactly the smart series is well I
talked to thermaltake and they told me
that basically this is a power supply
that's basically guaranteed to work
they're gearing this for the workhouse
market basically the guy told me that if
you're out to build a system and you
want to make sure your power supply is
gonna work this is gonna be it
he said they're not really geared for
super duper high-end systems mean that
they're coming in it like 630 watts and
seven and 30 watts but they're very very
stable that said let's just pop in guys
and see everything is all packaged in
here the therm we'll take English manual
power supply is non modular you can see
that here's the power cable you guys
will don't need me to take that to bag
you guys all know what a power cable
looks like at least I hope you do if not
I apologize let's move on
ooh I can smell the nice new computer
smelling this thing already oh yeah
let's see you guys can first off take a
look here's the front atx12v 2.3 EPS 12
volt you guys can see all that flip the
rounds let you guys see another side see
the back on/off switch
no problem this is actually kind of
different it's on the bottom so
Thermaltake you can see that
here's the bottom fan that's space with
that stuff so now we got that let's take
a look at all of the connections here so
got the 24 pin power right here
tell your power stuff right there VGA
power more VGA power lots and lots of
more power for all of your SATA devices
or whatever right here including the
little mini power port if you need that
as well so it's actually there's not a
whole whole lot of connections on here
you go back and look at these looking at
all the connections it really looks like
you're probably only going to be able to
use one video car with this power supply
it does not look like it's going to
support multiple cards due to the lack
of connections got lots of connections
for the SATA and stuff like that and you
know some of the motherboards actually
have the power onboard this will go into
that side as well to give you extra
power to the motherboard so this is
basically it everything just comes in
the box I mean it's the smart 630 watt
power supply series from Thermaltake
it's very low priced it's 80 plus
certified five-year warranty it's got
plenty of cables for a simple system and
I think that's what the people at
thermal take are trying to do they're
trying to ride you guys as a simple easy
solution that they guarantee to work
that's about it thanks for watching the
unboxing we'll see you back here on Zeca
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
