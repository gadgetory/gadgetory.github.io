Ferriss editor-in-chief here on the tech
of tomorrow YouTube channel okay well I
have a t-mobile cell plan so for those
you hate t-mobile go get those who are
like eh but anyways I have a team old
plan had it for a while now one of the
latest phones to hit the market is the
new htc mytouch 4G phone so even though
I wasn't really due for an upgrade I
really hated my click because that
Motorola blur stuff that makes me smart
mobile but no so I finally got these
suckers to upgrade my phone so I got the
new HTC mytouch 4G let's do an unboxing
of this thing and see what actually
comes in the package when you get this
from the folks at t-mobile it's a nice
4G phone which you can do the
face-to-face talking you know lots of
good stuff here I'll actually do a
review this later and show you all the
features right now I'm just going to
like kind of the unboxing show you what
comes in the package so we got this then
we're going to open this and toss it
aside and it comes in a nice little
carry case so it's got a little logo
right here and it's actually you know
pretty durable if you wanted to and you
wanna have a portable little phone case
you could take this with you wherever
you want to go so we'll open it up it
has a nice little unzipper everything's
pretty secure in here as you can see
even if I shake it nothing really comes
out but the phone all your accessories
are good on this side so first off I'll
go ahead and pull out the phone this is
the new htc mytouch 4G phone it's very
thin very lightweight features an
Android operating system and has many
many apps that is kind of comparable to
the Apple phones now the folks at Apple
will always tell you their phone and
even my producer he loves a Zeppelin
he'll tell me to jump off a tree but
this phone has really nice features it's
a very thin as I said has a very nice
3.8 inch digital screen everything on
the phone is touch there's no actual
keypad so when you turn the phone on
everything's right here and it's very
nice to use nice phone notes move on to
the accessories package where there's
actually quite a bit comes in here in
the left in the pouch I have my little
SIM card gave me a brand new SIM card
has a little getting started guide some
terms and conditions you know basically
threatening you if you cancel their
thing and you know is your SIM card that
stuff then we're gonna move along over
here we have some other pouches and we
have a lot of stuff in here let me go
ahead and pull it out okay
get all the stuff out of here make sure
there's nothing else in there alright
let me just move this out of the way so
you can see it now we've got a really
nice little power charger here which
works USB then we have little USB cable
now it's kind of strange that you
absolutely don't get any kind of just
plug in your wall kind of charger
luckily I have one and almost all the
charges these days are based in this new
USB design so it's not a problem but it
is kind of strange then you get a pair
of actually pretty nice headphones
they're not junk they're probably not
dr. Dre level but they're still pretty
nice especially since they just come in
the package and then you get a little
bit of earbuds and a little thing here
as lapel to clip to you so overall
you're not a bad package you get all
this and let me go back over here and
you get the phone so this is everything
that comes in the box of the new
t-mobile
