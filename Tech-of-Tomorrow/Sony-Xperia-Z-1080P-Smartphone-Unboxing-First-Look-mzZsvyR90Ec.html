here once again on our YouTube channel
here at tech of tomorrow now check it
out we all know that mobile technology
is the most popular stuff on the planet
everybody wants the latest and greatest
stuff and we have to be fulfilling your
appetite today with the Sony Xperia Z
this is their brand new smartphone
that's come onto the market it's about
seven hundred ninety nine dollars right
now has even really come out in the
United States for contracts but it'll be
coming soon so let's start off and we'll
do the unboxing so here's the box right
here you guys can see the front of it I
don't believe there's really much to the
back of it just talks about their bravia
engine to their ex armor RS technology
optic contrast panel has Wi-Fi certified
full 1080 that's right we'll talk about
that a little bit more so now let's
start the unboxing let's go ahead and
remove the top let's get the phone out
of here now look at this plastic
packaging off the back thanks what
around the whole thing okay let's go
ahead and get all this stuff off here
and then I'm going to start talking
about some of the features just pull
this stuff out and now let me hold it up
to the camera so you guys can see right
off the bat this thing has a 5-inch
full-hd reality 1920 x 1080 screen 440
pixels per inch density features a
Snapdragon s4 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor and the Adreno 320 GPU also
features two gigabytes of internal
memory now on the back there's a 13
megapixel camera that features their
Exmor RS technology mobile sensor they
also have a lot of technology in this
phone for HDR and all kinds of stuff so
this thing can double up not only as a
phone but as a video and photo camera
all and won a lot of phones out there do
this but these guys are really really
pushing this quite a bit on the side
here we can see the control buttons
flip it around the bottom
kind of interesting right here we have
all this thing charges and everything
the battery that's in it as well is not
removable the battery it's in it is just
the way that it is now let's talk about
some of the other features as far as
taking pictures and video this camera
offers true screen intelligence which is
the mobile bravia 2 engine offers
real-time contrast controls to the
sharpness enhancement you get better
video noise reduction when streaming a
low quality video and an improved new
sharpness filter that increases the
overall detail level in the image the
image is very bright and can be seen in
broad daylight with the brightness set
to maximum but you don't want to do this
with the Sun reflecting off your phone
because you know the direct sunlight on
you're not going to be able to see it
that's all there is to it as far as
connectivity goes we get ultra fast LTE
4G connectivity they also add something
from Sony called one touch connectivity
that features backup mirroring OneTouch
listening and sharing all from a single
touch between the various devices now
let's go on let's see some of the rest
of stuff that comes in the box we'll go
ahead and pull it out they actually give
you a scream so you get your protection
screen and all that stuff that's inside
here so you're not to go out and
actually buy a separate one
you also have the cloth in there to
polish your lovely phone up back and
front so you get protection from both
back and front it's kind of cool not bad
at all there's also a little thing right
here too you guys can see this this
little thing right here is part of that
one touch connectivity I talked about
going to be putting up to other devices
then coming away you go so let's see
what else in the box right and I open it
up we get the Sony startup guide for the
Xperia Z the model numbers another thing
it says important information here we
get the charger the USB go ahead and
just take this stuff out of here here
are the headphones I've actually had a
chance to listen to these headphones yet
but I have heard really good things
about them that a pun I don't know but I
just heard that these things sound
really good I'll actually get to that as
well later on but there are the
headphones well their control and
everything right there comes with extra
pads charger will be plug into this now
you guys are going to notice something
right off the bat it's got the european
plug in there this was the european
version of the phone let's go over here
and let's look where the charger goes
alright folks when I notice that I
couldn't see anything very easily when I
tried to plug in you know obviously the
charger I went back and I read the
manual before I could even see the
headphone jack everything this phone to
be honest to you at this point as far as
it goes I think is a pain in the ass
honestly you got to pick all this stuff
off pop all of it off I'm not too happy
with it so right here on top here's your
headphone jack
right side of the phone microsd
left-hand side micro USB memory so i'm
going to do just basically plug this in
and once you plug this in and you can
see them trying to plug in this thing
keeps wanting to flap into it this is
totally totally not user friendly I'm
not digging this at all something I am
not liking so that's how you plug it in
so beyond that let's go ahead i'll go
ahead and put this stuff and all its
seal stuff back and even reuse sealing
it is actually kind of a pain in the
butt it's not all that user friendly I
mean it works but not too happy with it
so now here we see the phone on you guys
can see the screen got no service and
everything you guys can go in here to
your settings screen and make all your
changes you guys can see all that stuff
throughout their very very similar since
it's running jellybean it's very very
similar to actually need the Samsung
phones at this point very very similar
to what's going on looks like we got
something going on here
when control
here's the volume full blast you guys
can see the clarity a video I'm here is
really excellent now some of the
problems I've been hearing about is that
the contrast on this is a little odd and
depending on the angle in how you look
at it it's kind of a little bit wacky if
you're looking at it straight on it
looks really good they're probably
working on this kind of technology I
also heard that there are some issues
with some of the software but overall I
mean come on it's a brand new phone it's
a boom tube Lambie and away we go out of
that so art folks I mean that is pretty
much it i'm going to polish this thing
up so it's got some more fingerprints on
it than anything else I've ever seen in
the world clean that phone up there I'm
not doing very good there but to go
ahead and just set that down show you
guys all the stuff that comes in it if
you guys like this video make sure you
guys hit that like button and let me
know it if you're not subscribed to take
her tomorrow please make sure you do so
because we bring you all the tech all
the time see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
