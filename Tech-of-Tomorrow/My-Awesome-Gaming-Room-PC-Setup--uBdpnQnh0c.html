creative soundblaster ex katana welcome
strangers to my gaming crystal come on
in
so check it Tech fans you guys who
follow the channel have probably seen
this room before because I have filmed a
few videos in here but what you probably
didn't know this is like my main gaming
area this is where I spend all my time
Epona play games and do that stuff I do
it in this room and it's a pretty cool
room right now the walls are kind of
bare but I'll tell you a little bit why
I have that that way because it has to
do with Mike Mike totally night lighting
effects which I think you guys are going
to think is pretty cool now first off
obviously I got a big giant desk I don't
know where the heck I got this damn desk
at I believe it was at one of those like
Office Depot places like that but there
are many other desks that are pretty
similar to that so the desk is kind of
irrelevant but what's really relevant is
the cool badass stuff I have in here for
gaming now the system I have is by main
gear and this is a totally crazy awesome
build you guys can see the system
features the custom of everything inside
of it and much much thanks to the people
over at main gear for kicking me the
system I mean I got to tell you folks I
am so thankful for this I just want to
kiss them because the system's amazing I
mean dual Titan XP cards x99 motherboard
5960 cpu I mean everything inside this
system is just the best it's got an
intel 1.2 SSD I mean let's just face it
folks this thing is a gaming monster has
plenty of life inside of it it's also
green matching the nvidia themes has
Nvidia video cards inside of it and all
in all we'll just play any game that
there is without a problem I mean really
now as we bounce around to the desk
where I game you guys can see right off
the bat that I have a giant monitor the
ex35 monitor it's an Acer predator
amazing monitor you guys have seen our
videos on it we'll have some links below
on my desktop you guys can see that I'm
using a couple products that we've
actually reviewed because basically what
I do is when I get new stuff in I keep
it and try it until I actually find
something better so I'm using the glaive
mouse by Corsair and I'm also using
their k63 keyboard you guys have seen
these things reviewed they're very nice
products for my sound I honestly would
have never thought that I could have
used a sound bar that impressed enough
with it to replace my speaker system
that I'm using you guys have followed
the channel you guys know them into
audio I like
high-quality audio products but the
katana and honestly blew me away and I
like the way it sounds if you've ever
had a chance to actually hear one in
person I think you guys would really
like it as well now before we jump into
the features and everything
check out this graph where it shows the
entire katana broke apart in CAD like
fashion I just thought it was a really
cool thing that you guys would like to
see it as well now you guys can see the
katana fits really nicely underneath my
monitor fit really nicely under your
monitor and one thing that's really good
about that is it saves you guys desktop
space instead of effing worry about the
wires stretching out to put your you
know stereo speakers out and everything
like that with the katana it just sits
nicely tucked underneath your monitor
and you guys see it looks very cool as
well it's got a nice sleek design on top
of all the operating function buttons
you also have two of the speakers there
there are two speakers underneath that
as well we'll talk about the speeches in
a second and then on the bottom
underneath my desk is actually a
subwoofer so you not only get the sound
bar you get the sound bar and you get a
subwoofer so your speakers don't have
that lousy no-ball sound you guys know
what I'm talking about a lot of speakers
out there don't offer you you know a
full dynamic range both the katana
believe me it's great for listening to
music great for playing your games great
for TV and let's just talk about those
features the katana also has the Aurora
reactive lighting system so if you're
into RGB it's here as well so katana is
lined with 49 programmable LED lights
from edge to edge and if you're totally
into a customized lighting environments
the katana also comes with five
different lighting modes the katana
delivers its sound from two up firing
midbass drivers to high excursion
tweeters which are located in the sound
bar and then one long Thor driver in the
subwoofer now each of these drivers is
totally individually chambered and
powered by its own DSP controlled
amplifier to deliver ultra precise audio
to every speaker I know you guys don't
want to hear like a spec perspectiva
thing but I just got to tell you guys
that all the different speakers inside
of the katana
from the sound bar to the subwoofer are
all tuned to be optimal I mean you get
totally thumping bass to this driver
that's housing a carb compliant MDF
cabinet with a flared port now this
allows increased airflow
I'm telling you folks the bass on this
thing really thumps and even at maximum
volume you never get that weird sound
where it sounds like it's just too loud
or trying to put too much energy into
the speaker they are so well designed
that even at full volume all the
speakers still maintain a really nice
sound that doesn't sound like it's
straining itself to be heard the katana
is a breed of its own it utilizes a tri
amplified designs with a total output of
75 rms with a 150 watt peak power and
like I said this is room-filling very
clean sound now beyond powering the Tri
amplified design the katana also
features a proprietary multi-core DSP
that is capable of producing 24-bit high
resolution audio and to get totally
immersed in your games and your movies
the katana is also Adobe Digital decoder
that converts analog sound from an
optical source into digital 5.1
configurations and through the USB port
the katana can also double as a sound
card which supports a virtual 7.1
channel audio you can control the katana
by two different ways either by the
included remote which makes it very easy
if you just want to kick back and relax
and do everything by the remote or you
can use the buttons on top now on top of
the katana we feature a power Bluetooth
button audio up and down the source
button and then last but not least is
the SPX profile button the katana also
supports bluetooth 4.2 now this gives
you a connection range of up to 10
meters so if you don't feel like Tunisia
computer on you can still enjoy all the
convenience of great audio wirelessly
without your system and if you're one of
those folks that has a lot of music on a
USB Drive you can simply plug the USB
Drive into the back of the katana and
you're up and going and you still don't
have to have your PC turned on and with
the headphone and microphone jacks you
don't have to wake up the entire house
to be a late-night gamer if you're
looking for true Dolby certified 5.1
audio all you need to use is the optical
end also located on the back and lastly
there's a micro USB port to connect to
your PC as well now the very last thing
I have inside my gaming area folks is my
HP Officejet Pro 8740 now this thing
does absolutely everything I need is
kind of a little bit in the way but a
lot of times I'm printing out numbers
and doing stuff for my business so I
just find it kind of convenient for it
to be in here all right everybody
so that's where I game once again a nice
shout out to the people of it creative
labs for kicking down the katana and
sponsoring today's videos you guys could
check it out now a lot of the questions
I'm going to get I know we're going to
be about the lamps in the back they're
from Ikea they're really cool I'll see
if I can find a link but if not well you
know where to get them you get good idea
check them out
you're probably bev on their website now
also my mousepad
this thing is so super thin this is the
Roccat zero I don't know if this is
still available or not I'm not really
sure but I like it because it feels
really really natural now as far as the
katana speakers go the sound bar I
honestly thought honestly I kind of
mocked it my first fear because all the
other sound bars I've ever really heard
unless they had a separate subwoofer
that you plug in them and stuff they
honestly just didn't have that great of
a sound they were almost Bhalla the
biggest thing I got to tell you guys I
like about the katana be honest looks
and that stuff is like I said you can
turn the volume all the way up on it
this room we filled with frickin
earth-shaking bass and sound and there's
no distortion at all and I just got to
say that I really like that quite a bit
some people out there made you know
different you know I have a different
opinion if you guys do definitely let me
hear your guy's opinion down below if
you haven't ever heard the katanas you
guys should at least take a listen to
them because they're under 300 bucks
right now and I think it's a really good
price range for what they are
you can operate them you buy the remote
or directly on it you can listen to all
your music all that good stuff so it's
just a really cool thing all in all
about those speakers I'm going to put
some in my living room in my living room
I had the Bulldog system I have my giant
huge TV it's really fast so I'm going to
put a set out there as well I mean
normally I don't think that creative
like gears these things towards the TV
as much you know because they don't have
all the features connect just buy your
TV like through a USB connection excuse
me that USB connects to an HDMI
connection so if you have the ability to
use the HDMI connection to be that way
but since I already have everything set
up inside of my Bulldog in the living
room these things are going to be
awesome so I'm going to buy another set
that just tells you how much I actually
believe in them I'm going to buy another
set and put those in my living room
and get rid of the soundbar I have there
its Yamaha it's just honestly just it
isn't that great and has no balls so at
the end of the day hope you guys like
the video it's Kai to mix my gaming room
mix and we know in was something that
you guys would find interesting a lot of
times I have the ad you guys tell me hey
we really like the add more than that
thing you were doing so well today if
you did that why I hope you do then then
thumbs up and then last but not least
there's copy Texas going on they've won
a lot of awards already there this year
at the show with the katana do you guys
want to check those out I'm sure their
stories all over the place about it I'll
also see if I can get links to that but
it didn't today folks yeah this is where
I do my gaming I also want to put
something upstairs for doing smaller
stuff like castle defense and stuff like
that doesn't take it you know great big
huge amount of power but at the end of
the day my area is pretty cool
the walls are bare I know you're kind of
going wide at the balls bare let's check
this out the reason that the walls are
there excuse me for a second is because
I have a complete cool nightlight system
in here so real quick let's just check
out the room with no lights and check
out the lighting effects I mean it's
really cool I can only do two colors
right now you know the green and the
blue with this one by order some other
ones and the lighting effect in here
we're gaming with all these different
little things going around the ceiling
stuff is actually pretty damn cool so
I'm Miller you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow like usual down below like
button we'll have all kinds of
information about all of these products
my gaming products all that good stuff
and we'll see you guys back here on teka
tomorrow because we've got a brand new
video card at brand new 1060 featuring
new memory and we'll bring that to you
