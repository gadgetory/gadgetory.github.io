back children of the tech hopefully
you're not as crazy as children the corn
because there's crazy out
there so hopefully you children of tech
are much better so what's going on
welcome back once again a tech tomorrow
I'm Eric your host and we've got some
news for you folks it seems like some
overzealous sales people in other
countries have started selling that's
right there risen five CPUs and there's
been some stuff leaked that's right so
now the 1600 has been tested by some off
the wall side i'm not exactly sure of
who they are I can't really endorse
their test scores but if you guys are
interested in just seeing some early
results from you know kind of a site
that's out there then this is your
chance now techpowerup the site out
there ran by this guy named wizard he
like actually posted up the news of this
so I saw it online actually contacted a
beam was like what the hell these guys
are breaking NDA what the heck's going
on and real quick if you guys don't know
what NBA is NDA stands for
non-disclosure agreement and there was a
lot of confusion on my rx 40 that
thought that I had broke in da now I
admit that I ended up breaking NDA but
as you can see i'm getting the test kits
it was unintentional i apologized AMD
and i apologize to you folks I honestly
thought that the NDA was at 12 midnight
and after looking at the paperwork and
everything and be agreed as well and so
that's why I'm back on the test system
now sure I'd like to buy all my own
stuff but if I can work with a company
and get the stuff and do a completely
legit I'd rather do that it's better for
me it's better for you but if you're a
person out there and you just want to
see hey man what does somebody have to
say about the 1600 well there's been
some people that are posted reviews web
links down below to them now it does
seem know like the risin five is
performing exactly kind of what we
thought it was going to perform like a
little bit lower than the high end I
sevens and a little bit lower than the
high end I five but still a totally
competitive cpu for the price ranges I
think it's going to be selling at I
think it's going to be something great
so for those people out there i have to
say just from initial results and if his
results are actually true it seems like
there isn't five is a damn good cpu now
me being under NDA I cannot give you
guys any scores whatsoever until the
eleventh when the time arrives believe
me I'd like to
bring you those things now AMD has told
me though that the 1500 x + 1600 X CPUs
are not for sale or not sampled anybody
out that we're breaking NDA so if you're
looking for the actual scores for those
two CPUs which I think you are you're
going to have to wait for the release
date but for now if you're an early bird
and you want to see the information like
I said the 1600 has been leaked I can't
endorse the site but hey they might be
totally legit I don't know them so I
can't sing thing good or bad about them
but that's it folks so we got those
scores for you will have a link down
below you guys can check those out for
yourself if you want to and for those
who are still waiting for the 1500 X and
the 1600 x well hold on your proverbial
hat because I'll have it here for you
guys techo tomorrow right in the morning
light with NDA lifts so peace that and
we'll see you guys back from the channel
for more risen 5 stuff coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
