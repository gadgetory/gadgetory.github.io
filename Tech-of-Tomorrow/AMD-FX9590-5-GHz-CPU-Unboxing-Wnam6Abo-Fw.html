Tech Audemar we're bringing you all the
tech all the time now today we've got
something that's pretty interesting now
you guys all know that forever AMD has
been the budget guy AMD has been the
company that you go to if you can't
afford Intel stuff and you still want
something that works well now
India's switch tracks they're on the
fast track now selling CPUs at the same
price as Intel's top the line extreme
series processors and we were able to
get our hands on their brand new FX 95
90 processor now you guys all know this
thing is coming to market at like $900
four point seven is the standard clock
5.0 only problem is 220 watts of total
GDP and 1.5 volt on that five gigahertz
overclock that's extreme now we
were able to get our hands on the
processor but to be quite honest with
you I'm kind of pissed off at AMD at
this Junction so with that said let's
see why I'm upset with AMD's latest
release alright folks will check it out
here is the box of the brand new FX 95
90 now I just think this is crazy folks
you know this thing is like over $100
it's their top-of-the-line unlocked
processor and look at the packaging that
we get here this is the flimsiest and
most honestly cheapest packaging I've
ever seen in my life
a and D if you have to be watching this
I feel insulted by you if this CPU isn't
so fast that it blows the roof off I'm
going to chew you up and chop you out
like a bad Taco Bell tacos L this thing
should have at least come in a nice
metal container saying it's a limited
edition this is an insult this thing's
basically you know for the am-3 platform
has 16 megabytes of level 3 cache it's
going to fit on the m3 motherboards so
here on the top right here if anybody
wants to look at the nomenclature it's
the black edition flip around you guys
saw us before but there's just nothing
to this at all just this little tiny
thing so I'm going to go ahead and pop
this little AMD tab down here on the
bottom here and you guys can see this
little AMD sticker they've got down here
blocking this just go ahead and put my
finger in here it's so cheap
folks I don't even need a knife or
anything else do this unboxing that's
how cheesy it is so let's pull this
stuff out so into the box we get this
level little AMD book here why we're
getting it I don't know but they've even
it's a bunch of paperwork in here this
is probably cost more anything else in
the packaging and then we have the CPU
here's the backside you guys can see
that AMD is still using pins
unlike Intel they use a different type
of design so we'll flip that thing
around again you guys can see it's the
AMD FX unlocked here's the CPU I will go
ahead and remove it from here so that
the camera can get a nice up close shot
of this for you folks so let me go ahead
and pop this open and now with the
cameraman get in here so we can get a
nice clean shot of this so you guys can
see this but honestly folks I really
want to know what your guys depending is
on this I know that you AMD fans out
there going to think I'm beating up AMD
and that's not how it is at all I mean
if you went out and you spent $900 on a
CPU would you be expecting it to come
and like with the bargain-basement
products come in no I really expect this
to come in something a lot better it's a
small thing but the small things at the
end of the day are what make up the best
so there you have it the brand new AMD
Black Edition FX 95 90 and all its glory
now if I seem a little bit grumpy in
this video honestly I kind of am when we
got the CPU and I saw that just came in
this terrible packaging as far as I'm
concerned I admit I kind of got really
flipped out about it because when I
spend money on something like this it
supposed to be a limited edition I'm
expecting it to really look like a
limited edition and you AMD fans you
guys should be with me on this as well
because you guys out there the ones who
really support this the most and when
you guys go out to buy a process from
those guys especially something like
this I think you want to come in
something that's very collectible not
just something that's just completely
throwaway actually that's probably my
biggest problem with it the content in
the box and everything just seems
completely throwaway if I'm buying a CPU
like this is supposed to be like you
know those supreme creme de la creme I
really expect some decent packaging let
me know what you guys think also I'm now
going to be taking the CPU putting in a
system and running all the testing and
letting you know how this thing actually
does against the Intel CPUs and against
its own so with that said I'm Alaric I'm
out here because well I got testing to
do so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
