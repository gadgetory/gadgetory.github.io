a video telling you guys that you
wouldn't see any new video cards from
video for quite a while and many of the
comments were pretty much like I didn't
know what I was talking about of course
there's new cards coming out oh Elric
you've been paid I've been played I hear
that so many times I've been paid I
really want to see these paychecks of
where I'm getting paid because it's just
gotten completely out of hand will now
check it out
now Jensen has announced that it's going
to be a long time before you see new
Nvidia cards bump a bump so basically
he's walked in he's dropped the mic and
everything that I told you turned out to
be absolutely 100% the facts just like I
said the first time around now why you
guys all have to be so many dukes of
doubt I have no idea I don't make videos
and pull stuff out of my butt just to
make a video that never happens like I
told you and for some reason I don't
know why you have trouble believing me
is that I called my contacts and NVIDIA
and I asked them and if there was going
to be a new video card coming out or new
video cards coming out I would know
because I would be included in the
briefing about those cards because
before they come out first guess what oh
yeah that's right we get briefed about
the cards so that when we get them we
know just what the heck we're talking
about when we do the reviews so there
you have it the cards aren't going to be
here for a while and I know that many of
you are wondering going man this is just
complete BS these cards are like 2 years
old and honestly in some ways I admit
I'm with you this has been the longest
time between video card launches ever in
the history of the computer industry
seriously it's been 2 years and I
understand your guys's points but here
is the other shoe for you AMD fans I
know this is probably gonna piss you off
and you'll be angry but right now AMD is
kind of halted on their new video cards
okay so in essence if currently Nvidia
sells the most video cards and now they
finally actually at stocking its is
another point all of the Nvidia cards
back in stock and pretty much priced at
exactly what they're supposed to be and
Vidya is also saying this at the same
time so if there's nothing out there
really to compete with what they have on
the market why would they shoot
themselves in the foot and release these
new 11 Series cards it just wouldn't
make any sense I mean after all you guys
might not really realize this but AMD is
barely 12% of the video card sales in
the entire world
barely 12% the rest the percentage all
falls over to Nvidia so you guys always
say Oh Nvidia is doing this they're
doing that they're trying to kill AMD
they're not trying to kill AMD AMD and
their video department they're the ones
who are killing themselves by not having
cards that compete and you guys can get
mad all you want but every single launch
from AMD and I'm not beating AMD up
these are just the facts it's always
hype oh yeah
this card is gonna blow away anything
that NVIDIA has in the market it's gonna
do it at a lower price it's gonna be
quiet it's gonna be more powerful bla
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
bla bla that's what we hear and then
guess what the card comes out and all of
a sudden the balloon goes
and you find out that all that hype was
guess what exactly what it was it was
hype the cards never really outperformed
you guys and say oh sure they do man you
know as the drivers mature two years
later its competing okay well we're
talking about launch day events on
launch day it's been a long time since
I've seen a card from AMD come out at
launch day and beat the end time excuse
me and beat the nvidia cards that it's
competing against it's been a long day
incoming and I've yet to see it now I
know we all want it to happen I want to
happen too sure why not
the better the competition is in the
market the lower the pricing is so if
you're gonna get mad at anybody get mad
at AMD because it's AMD who's not
producing these products not releasing
these products onto the market plus
other countries don't have laws but in
America we do have consumer protection
laws and I don't know if this is
actually in play right now but it could
be in play like let me just give you an
example say that we bring in I don't
know a hundred thousand TVs and they're
all based on a certain technology okay
but then two weeks later some Australian
company comes out with this technology
that completely blows that crap out of
the water the US doesn't allow all these
TVs from Australia to come in here and
flood the market why all these other TVs
here haven't been sold a certain amount
of the stock of the old TVs has to be
sold off and be gone off the shelves
before American law will let them bring
in these new TVs now I know for
consumers in a way that's kind of like
you know taking a little in the butt but
think about it if you're a person who
imports TVs and your business is
importing TVs
you're probably wiping your brow and
fucking saying thank you thank you thank
you thank you thank you because you were
able to sell your TVs instead of eating
all that money which would mean lots and
lots of money loss for people all over
the world especially for the people that
are in American markets selling these
things they would be left with all of
this stock that they could not sell
whatsoever now I'm not sure if that's
happening but it could be happening
because let's just think about it right
now Nvidia drops the 11 Series GPUs
let's just say next week I'm just
pulling the side of a hat and just
saying that's ok all of a sudden every
AMD card that's on the market is now
going to be substandard compared to that
so that means nobody is going to really
be wanting to buy MD cards in that 12%
market that I talked about just a minute
ago that 12% market will probably dry up
to a 0% market effectively knocking AMD
completely out of a game now once again
back to law in America we have laws that
say that no one can be a monopoly and
control the entire market and trust me
if Nvidia dropped their new 11 Series
cards right now they would dominate the
market completely dominate the market
they would knock AMD right off the shelf
because who's going to go buy a Vegas 64
or a Vega 56 if it's only a hundred or
two hundred dollars less than a card
from Nvidia that completely blows it out
of the water in every way shape or form
I know the ANU Nvidia cards that will be
coming out are gonna do 60 frames per
second and 4k with no problem which is a
market that everybody is waiting for AMD
doesn't have anything that'll touch that
right now so they drop these cards
they're effectively going to put AMD
completely off the map and American law
won't have that because then at that
time Nvidia would be the total monopoly
on video cards they would be the ruler
they be unquestioned because AMD doesn't
have anything they can put to the market
that's competitive at this time so I
know a lot of people get mad and they
just think oh my god these guys are just
still selling two-year-old cards but in
a lot of ways and videos hands are kind
of tied with this there's really no
reason whatsoever with them to do this
if the cards are still selling and
believe me they're selling they're going
off the shelves almost as fast as they
hit the shows due to the long huge thing
that we have with the mining craze or
you could even get your hands on a card
well now you can finally get your hands
on a card I do agree with many of you I
do think the cards should be cheaper
than when they came on launch day now
obviously we know we've talked about
this before all corporations and Vidia
included at the end of the day
they only care mainly about one thing
and that is making profit they have a
bunch of board members and when these
guys go and sit at the board the barber
would sit there and look at them with
dirty looks you guys have seen it in
movies from Tony Stark to BEM to
everybody else in the Marvel Universe
the board will just vote you out so if
you know you walk into the board and
you're like oh yeah hey we're like
losing money all over the place but hey
it's cool it's peace brothers you're
going to lose your position the board so
there's no way that anybody who's
dealing with the board and the people
who do the money is going to be able to
go in there and say oh hey we're losing
money and right now and viddy is not
losing money at all let's just think
about it like we just said two year old
technology flying off the shelf because
for the longest time there was a drought
so if there's a huge drought what's the
first thing that happens when you bring
water back in that water gets sucked up
and gets filled in to fill the place
where the drought was at and that's
where it's at right now so really at
this moment in time NVIDIA has
absolutely no reason to drop new video
cards and in fact like I said a couple a
couple of seconds ago minutes ago
whatever it was you know they could be
being held by US law saying hey no way
you guys released these new 11 Series
cards AMD doesn't have anything in the
market it will completely wipe out AMD
video sales and this may be happening
like I said I'm not absolutely 100% sure
but America does have a lot of laws that
protects companies and businesses which
is actually a good thing because you
really don't want to cut me to keep
coming out and putting stuff out that
blows away the previous-generation stuff
and then just have it sitting around on
a shelf to be there you know distributed
for cheap or just wiped out and I really
don't think you guys want to see AMD
getting completely knocked off the map
as far as the video card stuff goes so
it's really up to AMD if AMD can come up
with a great solution to compare with
the newer cards and they release this
card I'm sure at that time we will see
Nvidia definitely speed up release dates
so let's just make up a fictional thing
we're gonna say at Christmas time
AMD comes up with some radical new card
and they release it and it's totally
kicking butt on the 1080i and all that
stuff at that point you can be damn well
sure
that nvidia is gonna release new cards
for a fact but until that day happens
like Jensen said it's going to be a long
time coming before we see these new
video cards I'm Eric you've been
watching tech and tomorrow we'll see you
guys back here on the channel for more
tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
