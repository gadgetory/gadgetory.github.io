tech of tomorrow now you guys all know
that Bill Gates has had trouble every
time he's tried to bring out a new OS
every time he brings the OS out he sets
it up on a system it crashes every
single solitary time so he's decided
that he's going to give up on trying to
develop anymore Windows OS and will buy
into the Mac OS that's right
so you may not see any more windows OS
anymore you way seeing something coming
out in the future though called win Mac
which will work on both a PC and a Mac
and it's a new step for Microsoft that's
coming out you know later in 2014 very
interesting stuff at least bill has
finally came to his senses just
basically taking the bow and saying okay
you know I give up Apple you know you
win very very interesting stuff I think
now next up you guys all know SSD
technology has been pushing the Bary but
now we see people investing in hardware
in the hard core business that's right
people in the porn industry are now
investing their money trying to get a 10
terabyte SSD out by later this year
that's right these guys do not want to
lose any of their precious money shots
they want to keep all that all on the
disc now this is very interesting stuff
because you know usually the porn
industry you know they don't really get
into technology that much they're
usually more bunch of physical stuff you
know I mean but now we see these guys
investing straight-up money to try to
get a 10 terabyte SSD so they can store
all of their stuff on one thing that
they can keep with them maybe they'll
put it in like a secret briefcase and
Ron Jeremy like carry it around and
with him is like you know see Bryn's
agent man a secret agent man I don't
know sounds interesting though to me now
last up you guys all know I've been
going to the gym a lot just all a whole
lot minute every day I go it's been
feeling good and I had kind of a moment
of clarity I think that I you know I'm
kind of agreeing with with Bill Gates
Windows PCs there
done in a moment of clarity I decided
that everything I do for now on must be
Mac based I don't care about PCs just
like you know whatever like okay for
gaming you know but like so what
compared to a Mac they're just piles of
just you know I'm saying they're just
piles of compared to a Mac Mac is
such a superior machine then I decided
that I'm switching everything over to
Mac so like a lot of news stories here
