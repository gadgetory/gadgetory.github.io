to tech of tomorrow now i'm running
borderlands for iOS on the new ipad mini
and it's actually playing pretty good so
I know you guys don't really want to see
me so let's actually jump in and let's
check me out playing borderlands for the
iOS it's actually doing pretty good
let's go kill some people
all right so check it out folks this is
borderland to the iOS I'm actually
playing a level call to bring it home
baby let's jump in and let's do some
killing now everything that you see is
operated by your finger touch you have
different characters you can click on
that character and each character has
its own specialty moves for killing the
enemy like in this move right here you
can see I click on this guy right here
he's got a little bird that goes up
attacks the enemies other guys got a
power fist other guys got a machine gun
and the girls got our own little berserk
er characteristics going on so like all
of the characters have their own custom
stuff and it's actually pretty easy to
operate and do and check it out the
graphics they ain't half bad either at
1024 x 768 in this little 7.9 inch area
you're getting some really nice looking
graphics these things actually surpassed
some of the first pcs I ever used so I
gotta give thumbs up to Apple in this
respect sorry everybody you know what at
first I really wanted to be able to talk
some mad about this high pad minion
I really did I didn't think you'd be
able to play games I thought it being
thinner that was going to be pretty much
a flimsy little unit just coming out
pretty much thought that apple will just
have to dig the competition but after
sitting and playing around the damn
thing it really does play games really
good now you guys saw me playing
borderlands for iOS I was playing this
in 1024 x 768 resolution and it's
actually playing just great amazingly
it's playing as good as it's played on
some of the actual pcs that I've played
or not now one thing it's really cool
about this new apple stuff is that you
actually able to play games like this
though right now which is really really
cool so this is just me playing games on
it I want you guys to see this is one of
like the pretty probably what I think is
going to be one of the most popular
games I didn't even think at all that I
would like enjoy playing games on this
because I'm usually a total pc guy but
this shits actually pretty fun I have to
say that playing borderlands and this is
the funnest game I've ever played on any
handheld device I've tried the racing
ones they sucked ass I mean I'm so bored
with the picking back the bird it's
mind-boggling this actually has some
competitiveness to it some killing and
the
effects are actually totally awesome to
boot so I hope you guys liked the video
if you do make sure you hit that like
button make sure you subscribe because
we're probably going to be having
giveaways possibly even one of these and
also if you guys miss the unboxing that
we did check that out in the link in the
description below because we got lots of
more stuff coming up with the new ipad
mini so we'll see you guys back here on
tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
