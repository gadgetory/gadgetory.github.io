gigabyte wildfire SSD now these drives
are a little bit pricey they're supposed
to be really really extremely fast
though the guys over there happen to
send me two of these little bad boys
right here and we're going to do this
awesome outdoor unboxing I even brought
my trusty knife going to go ahead and
begin the unboxing gonna take the trusty
knife here insert it into the plastic
and because we are in nature I can no
longer throw stuff at the cameraman or
trash garbage because it's beautiful
beautiful nature so I have to take the
garbage put it in my bucket and tear it
away with me because we cannot make a
mess here in nature so take the knife
right here knife into the wood here and
begun our outdoor unboxing so we got the
Wildfire box front of the box 240
gigabytes lot of gigabytes to the back
of box three year warranty yes sir three
year warranty good stuff flip it out
here open the top part of the box and
then we'll uh we'll open it up so here
we go folks we're going to show you the
inside the box it shows a 2.5 inch SSD
the wildfire 240 gigabyte 2.5 inch solid
state drive say two three six gigabytes

are inside there as well beep up to pop
the cap on this show you guys that
screws
metal frame II let the Patriot
nomenclature got my elbow go ahead and
set that up the side let me show you the
rest of it now we're coming down to the
nitty-gritty the drive itself there's a
little lighting bolt thing in there spin
it around it's kind of weird doing an
unboxing outdoors with your normal not
normal props and stuff but interesting
so here's the drive the wop fire that's
right the Wildfire drive it's wild it's
crazy it's in the mountains flipped
around through the back into the power

there are two of them and I'm gonna
bring you guys a review with these
things in raid which is what they asked
