are a little bit pricey they're supposed
to be really really extremely fast
though the guys over there happen to
send me two of these little bad boys
right here and we're going to do this
awesome outdoor unboxing I even brought
my trusty knife going to go ahead and
begin the unboxing gonna take the trusty
knife here insert it into the plastic
and because we are in nature I can no
longer throw stuff at the cameraman or
trash garbage because it's beautiful
beautiful nature so I have to take the
garbage put it in my bucket and tear it
away with me because we cannot make a
mess here in nature so take the knife
right here knife into the wood here and
begun our outdoor unboxing so we got the
Wildfire box front of the box 240
gigabytes lot of gigabytes to the back
of box three year warranty yes sir three
year warranty good stuff flip it out

nomenclature got my elbow go ahead and
set that up the side let me show you the
rest of it now we're coming down to the
nitty-gritty the drive itself there's a
little lighting bolt thing in there spin
