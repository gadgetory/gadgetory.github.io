was a great launch lots of money was
made but then all of a sudden the iPhone
6 plus
oh it bends and I don't mean in a good
way baby I know her fares here on second
amorn we have the top five Ben gate
jokes for you the fans number one on
today's joke list
twitter user clifton thomas attempting
to obfuscate bendgate
let me see you try saying that ten times
fast and leap further into fashion Tim
Cook purchased and actually flaunted
1990s denim company JNC oh man I don't
know what you guys think but even the
thought of that image is like burned
into my mind and doing if you guys
actually owned pants that you wear like
that now I know you late-night Munchie
mothers out there know what a KitKat bar
is obviously you do it's a great Munchie
now these guys decide that they would
jump into the game of making fun of the
bend and they said we don't bend we
break so next up comin at you at number
three comes from gadget love.com now
these guys posted a photo showing
various iphones starting off with the
iPhone 5s the iPhone 6 the iPhone 6 plus
and then last but not least the iPhone 6
plus after a week so obviously Apple
note to self
thinner isn't always better next up
another Munchie which I know you gamers
are going to know that is another shot
at Apple from the people over at slim
jim snap into a slim jim now obviously
is any land and gamer worth his salt
knows a slim jim is unbreakable even
when it bends after you sit in it for 18
hours it's also good up to 64gb and no
I'm not talking about gigabytes I'm
talking about gratifying bytes and last
but not least slim jim at its longest is
50 Mina meters now I don't even know
there's any damn me
in a slim jim it's meat like substance
and it tastes good but is it me I don't
know it's kind of like surprise supper
last up on the bend gate number five now
we thought this was from Samsung and
personally it's my funniest one I
thought it was the funniest one I've all
but we found it was actually from
somebody from reddit now this one shows
the iphone six-plus to be bent to all
hell and bowing down to its master
samsung now we actually have a bonus one
that we're gonna throw in here and this
one was from LG but it cut and it was a
fail so they tweeted a picture of the LG
G flex and they said our phone doesn't
Bend it flexes on purpose okay so that
would have been funny but come on the G
flex was discontinued for lack of sales
and they were caught tweeting it from
guess what and iPhone so that wraps up
today's video like usual all the
information will be down there below
that like button you guys just click
that show more and we'll have all the
links to all of these jokes and done
maybe a couple more even for you like

last but not least before I bounce SATA
air a special thanks to Hulu Plus for
making today's video possible I know
that most of you folks out there know
what cool is but Hulu Plus is basically
like taking a plain old boring white PC
case and painting that bad boy to a
custom level and I don't know if you
guys have heard this or not but they've
recently inked that an awesome deal to
show every episode of South Park and
this also includes all the new episodes

icing Hulu Plus works on your computer

check this out say it's one of those
moments when you've got you know number
two you can even watch it in the John
