from the tech of tomorrow channel to
bring you guys a head-to-head comparison
of 2 of the top 27-inch monitors that
feature resolutions of 2560 by 1440
today we're gonna be looking at the HP
zr 27 for tw and we're gonna be also
looking at the del u 27 11 now these
monitors are both like I said they're
both 27-inch monitors they both feature
an anti-glare screen but their price
different and they do have some
different features I've got them sitting
right here behind me and a lot of things
about me the same the bezel is almost
the same size all the way around they
both got a Silver Line band around the
sides of both monitors now here we see a
screen where we show the bulleted
features of both of these monitors as
you can see as far as the display goes
itself these monitors are pretty equal
and the way their specs are in the way
the heat the temperatures resolution
everything else but here's where things
start getting really a lot different the
HB monitor has no on-screen display at
all this means that you cannot do any
adjustment on the monitor whatsoever you
can't adjust the color you can't adjust
the height you can't adjust the size
you can't adjust anything let's take a
look at inputs the del u 2711 has dual
DVI RGB DisplayPort and HDMI connections
now the HP monitor it only has a display
port and a DVI connection and you can't
choose between using whatever one you're
using when you're using the HP monitor
on the Dell monitor you can clearly by
the side controls choose which input you
want to use so theoretically you could
hook up six different computers up to
the Dell you can only hook up one at a
time to the HP I've also noticed that
I've had a lot of problems getting DVI
cables to work and recognized with the
HP monitor the DisplayPort seems to work
no problem whatsoever but the DVI cable
on many systems we plug it into the
monitor would not even turn on now as
far as the visuals go on the monitor if
you're viewing artwork playing games or
anything else these monitors are pretty
much equal
both panels are based off the LG panel
now one thing I want to mention if you
buy the older versions like if you go
online you buy from someplace and
selling like these older HP monitors
you're gonna get the first-generation
panels now the first-generation panels
on both the dell and the HP had issues
they shut down they failed and they had
an anti-glare coating on it that looked
like Edwards head from that frickin
movie about the vampires
Twilight I'm serious you can see the
comments online but I just want to
mention this is the first generation
panel the panel's have now been upgraded
on both the dell and on the HP and the
anti-glare panel that's on them now is
very very usable it doesn't give you
that same nasty you know
Edwards shiny head looking thing
whatsoever now text I don't know why but
text is a little bit clearer on the Dell
monitor I have no reason why there's no
theoretical reason why it should be but
text is just a little bit clearer on the
Dell monitor it's all right folks you
guys always want head to head videos I
feel this is like the best I can do
because comparing monitor is kind of
really hard putting him side by side and
show him I looked at and then we filmed
it there's not even much you can really
tell we could've done a lot more theht
but honestly there's not much you can
tell but here's my advice
the HP monitor I'm very surprised has
won a lot of Editors Choice Awards out
there on certain sites I won't mention
any names but I disagree with that
monitor being an editor's choice monitor
it's an entry level monitor for a
monitor if you want 2560 by 1440 and you
don't want to break the bank you can
find these things as low as 629 dollars
on the Internet
now with the Dell you 2711 it comes to
market at about a hundred dollars more
than the HP but there are a lot of
differences between the monitors some
things are the same
now both monitors feature two USB ports
that are located on the side both
monitor features 2560 by 1440 now right
there though is kind of where the
monitors stop being similar totally it's
not being somewhat for that no on screen
display for the HP total on-screen
display for the Dell
you can switch between all the settings
on the Dell and use different computers
you can't do that with the HP whatsoever
so when I see people out there giving
this modern Editors Choice Award I just
don't agree with that and here's another
feature that I noticed that I haven't
even mentioned on the Dell monitor
there's a card reader on the side so now
maybe you get the card reader you get
much more features you get better
flexibility and all you're paying is
$100 so if it comes down to a
competition and these two guys are enter
the ring and do some kickass things at
the end of the day the Dell you 2711
will seriously kick ass over the HP 2740
any day of the week thanks for watching
I hope you guys like this type of video
it's something new and we hope you liked
it see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
