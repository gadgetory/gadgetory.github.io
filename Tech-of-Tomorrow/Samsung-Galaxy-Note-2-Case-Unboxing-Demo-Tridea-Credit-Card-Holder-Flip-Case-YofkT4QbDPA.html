I'm Eric your host where we have all the
tech all the time now I know many people
out there gonna have a giant debate on
what they think the phone of the year is
now me personally I've seen just about
every single phone that's come out this
year i can't say i've seen every single
one of them but i've seen a lot and i
have to say personally for me that my
galaxy note 2 is definitely going to win
product of the year as far as phones go
this thing to me has everything battery
life is unheard of now i don't know if
other people out there have their phone
like this but if you do i want to hear
your opinion because i'm actually
getting days on end of phone use now i'm
not playing games or anything like that
i mainly just text you know and talk but
still days on end of battery life the
screen is perfectly clear so i can see
it very intuitive with all the new jelly
bean updates this thing to me is the
finest phone there is now i know that
people out there that follow Apple
they're going to say the iphone 5 and so
you know what probably for the Apple
generation that probably is the phone of
the year for them so I'm going to say
that I guess to be fair for the Android
generation this phone definitely gets
phone of the year ok now I just got in a
new case this is the tredia now it's
made of Italian stuff like it's not
leather though it's made out of some
weird material i said it's not supposed
to irritate your skin now they call it
an italian card pocket flip case which
means it it basically has a couple
pockets for you to stick your credit
cards in pretty cool stuff it's made in
italy why it has anything to do this is
not whether i don't know but still it's
it's selling point so we're going to
jump over here i'll go ahead and unbox
it and then we'll go ahead and put it on
the note 2 and see how this bad boy
looks so let's go all right folks so
here's the packaging you guys can see it
says Tritiya design emotion idea factory
italian card Puckett flip case for the
galaxy note 2 not much the front of the
box I'm not gonna squeeze time on it not
much the back either just the same damn
thing so I know you guys really pretty
much understood
so go ahead and pop the top off she'll
go ahead and just pull it out you guys
can see it's contained in to another
plastic container this thing out now the
cameron and me had a thing going on
about how this is going to mount what do
I knew the old back plate or not it
looks like I probably will need the old
back plate so as you guys can see this
thing's very nice soft leather like
material on the inside we get your
credit card that sticks in it suggests
not to use more than two cards at a time
just to be on the safe side let's go
ahead and flip the cover closed it's got
some writing down here go ahead and flip
it around to the back so that's pretty
much it so you guys can see you got the
flip case here so I'm just going to go
ahead and remove this old one off of
here
here's the original back plate so I'll
go ahead and put the original back plate
back on I really hate having my phone
when it does I want to shut my phone
down but oh well it doesn't hurt
anything I guess just make sounds so
part one stick the old original phone
cover back on seems to be a success let
me just set that down just push it to
make sure all right we're good to go
there and it looks like most of them was
just going to just pop on plus it's got
a lock on it that one do not have a lock
on this one has a lock so let's go ahead
nice easy simple pop the phone case is
on and it also had a little luck ok the
lock was only for that it's same as the
other one so here we go folks not much
to it very simply I do like how you have
full access to the pen though so you can
see the pin slides out right there nice
and easily no problems at all having the
nice soft leather interior right here
will actually keep your phone from
getting damaged in here and it actually
stays closed pretty good after I
actually move it around and said it a
few times it'll actually start to fit
the phone a lot better but it does have
a very nice feel to it if you didn't
know better you would swear this was
leather but it's really not I wish I
could say it was but it's actually made
of some material that's made to not
irritate your skin or bother you at all
so all the buttons are cleanly left open
alright guys so there you guys have it
the terranea it's pretty nice Kate's
coming to mark about 29 bucks you guys
can pick it up on Amazon or other place
i believe it's on sale at amazon right
now you guys can check that out in the
link in the description below like usual
I hope you guys like this video I know a
lot of people probably think that's not
too much so you know a case unboxing or
whatever but hey you know it does work
very well for the phone a lot of people
are always looking for new stuff I have
found it for the new note to your
chances right now finding something
really unique or kind of slim because
they're just basically hitting the
market maybe in the future I'll have
something more exciting so anyways hit
that like button show me some love if
you're not subscribed make sure you do

more giant contest coming up here on
