again to TECA tomorrow we're bringing
you someplace new that's right now you
guys are in Elric's garage that's right
not quite like Joe's garage because I
ain't got no damn cockroaches out here
beyond that it's pretty cool it's a new
Aryan is we're actually going to be
doing all of our PC builds and the cool
thing about it though I got to say this
I guess breathing stuff is his desk
behind me this thing is the autonomous
smart desk if you guys actually want to
see me do a video on this let me know
because the thing's got a ton of
features you can program how high and
how low it goes it's completely
automatic it has an engine that's right
so you don't have to worry about lifting
yourself you hit a little automated but
you can program it has stereo speakers
in it all kinds of USB ports wireless
charging hell it's got a lot of stuff
but anyways for working it's pretty damn
awesome so today's video is a brought a
brand new system from AMD this one we're
calling the producer and I think that
it's a pretty fairly rounded out system
because this system has a 1700 X in it
it also features a GTX 1080 so this
system is completely geared for doing
gaming it's completely geared for doing
any kind of editing anything you want
it's got a giant hard drive guys got a
really fast SSD just overall it's a cool
system plus it looks badass now off the
bat we use the same exact case you guys
can see that because I just wanted the
cases to match these kind of build so I
can do the comparisons and we've got
these now built you know the 17 X
hundred system it's coming in a little
bit over $2,000 we'll get to all that in
just a second but this system is
completely badass you guys can see it
back here behind me it's clean its
badass then behind that we have right
over here
horizon that's the previous one the
phoenix rising system so that one was
good to go but this system is our brand
new one back here behind me and it was
really easy to do and build on this new
desk out here because we were able to
sit down put some of the parts together
and then raise it up to whatever levels
we were totally comfortable working
inside of it and building it which is
pretty badass so if you guys actually
want to see a video on us like doing
another time lapse and showing the
features this let me know with that said
though let's jump in and let's see the
parts that we used in the producer
featuring AMD's horizon 1700 X
all right well I guess it's pretty
obvious to you guys I liked a bit
Phoenix show gun case we used it in the
previous build and we're going to use it
in this build as well just because I
think it's badass has a lot of nice
features it's well priced and let's just
face it man those glass windows and the
ability to all that Asians or a sink
stuff is really cool so if you like RGB
lighting you like a case it looks good
has clean stuff and lots of room for
expansions I got to say this is a really
nice case definitely worth looking into
instead of using the msi board that we
use in the previous build you guys can
see that that motherboard kind of class
a little bit with the case those two
color variations didn't really go that
well in my eye so we decided to go with
motherboard that actually matched the
case much better this is a gigabyte GAA
X 370 gaming 5 motherboard it has a lot
of features inside of it and it's got a
lot of cool RGB effects as well so to
keep that RGB thing going with the case
hey we use the motherboard that has all
those same nice features and you guys
can see that in the build it looks
really cool so the CPU obviously we're
using the AMD Rison 7 1700 X processor
now the one that we got did not come
with a cooler whatsoever there are
different SKUs one that comes a liquid
cool or one that comes without it we got
the one that didn't come with it and we
use a totally different cooler from
Corsair and our build which we'll get to
next if you're looking for a cooler that
you know will work right out of the box
on any motherboard that you get you want
to check out the corsair hydra series
h-11 0 i now this thing is really great
it'll cool off pretty much anything
that's out there in the market and it
comes like I said natively able to cool
your am4 board which is really cool
you're not to mess around with calling
any companies trying to get yourself
into the bracket showing a receipt doing
any of the other crap at all you just
buy this cooler and hey you're in like
Flynn and the h1 100 I comes with look
huge - an 80 millimeter radiator so you
know it's going to be able to keep your
CPU running cool and clean now this is
one part in the system where I know you
guys are going to freak out about but
you do not have to put this memory in
your system at all you guys know you can
get cheaper memory out there so please
don't leave me a crazy negative comment
going oh my god the matter is for crazy
price TELRIC hell's to the yes I know
it's expensive we're talking about the
Corsair Vengeance RGB LED this is a 32
gigabyte kit now features for 8 gigabyte
sticks it's DVR for 3,000 megahertz but
best of all
this is completely RGB if you guys
happen to miss our video you guys should
check that out because this is the
coolest and most crazy lighted memory
I've ever seen some people said they
liked other stuff a little bit better I
don't know I'm pretty partial this stuff
it's really cool I mean if you're
looking for something it can be stuck
inside your system it features a profile
so you can go in and set an XMPP profile
just like you could an old Intel systems
and you have all that light control it
just looks badass now for the boot drive
we wanted something exceptionally fast
we want the Corsair Neutron XT iSeries
SSD that is a 240 gigabyte SSD it's
SuperDuper fast plenty of room to put
your OS and even a couple of programs on
but for doing all your storage and stuff
we went with a 4 terabyte drive by
Hitachi now this is a 7200 rpm Drive and
it's got plenty of room for doing page
filing storing all of your stuff on
let's just pick it up to do quite a bit
stuff at 4 terabytes you're most likely
not going to run out of room too quick
on the back of the case we also have a
single led case then this thing's RGB as
well to keep that lighting theme going
strong gone are the days of the mustard
and ketchup cables I mean let's face it
this isn't dinner this is a PC case so
we use Corsairs latest sleeve cables now
these are their pro package they're red
and black these things are really nice
and they have all the cables that you
need to hook up anything that you're
using inside of your system now I know
you can't see it but yes there is a
power supply in here we don't have two
rats running around the cage it's of
course there are MX series RM 650 X now
obviously a 650 watt power supply
totally modular and 80 plus gold
certified and what's best of all hey it
works great with that Pro Series cable
set now for the video card we use the
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 founders Edition
now these things range in price from
like 650 bucks
all the way down to 500 bucks so we'll
have links to both of those down below
but like usual folks you have your
choice to put whatever video card you
want inside your system we've figured
the GD X 1080 was a perfect balance
between them high-end TI and then
something lower from AMD so I hope you
guys are satisfied alright so those are
all the parts we use to make the
producer back here behind me I think
it's a pretty awesome system it actually
has liquid cooling compared to the
previous system which had air cooling
and the problem with that was at the
time we just
get our hands on any damn cooler that
would work without getting a mounting
bracket thing so we finally got our
hands on that and we got this thing up
and going now with that said though
let's jump in and let's see the scores
between these two systems now the focus
really today is on this build but since
we had the previous build already and it
features the 1800 X we figured the
scores would be a good comparison for
you guys to see pretty much with the
system that's as close as possible all
of our testing was done with the latest
past edition of Windows 10 this actually
gave us some problems when we had to
reinstall it a few times to get it going
stable but we finally did and we're also
using the latest available drivers from
Vidya to power the 1080 now the only
other difference is between the 1800 X
and the 1700 X in the system is that
obviously the new system is obviously
liquid-cooled the previous is air-cooled
this system over here the new one
features 32 gigabytes of Vengeance RGB
and 16 gigabytes of the Vengeance memory
on the rise and so there we go let's
jump in let's check out those benchmarks
you
all right folks so there you have it the
brand-new the producer featuring AMD's
risin 1700 X now to be honest with you
folks unless you're a super duper crazy
content creator I got to say that I
think that 1700 X is going to be your
sweet spot it still does everything
pretty doggone close but it's not $500 I
mean think about the system is already
pushing into the over to brand you get a
system that has a 500 CPU it's going to
push it even further and I honestly get
a little uncomfortable that I'm really
afraid of what you guys are going to
stay because you guys usually try to
kick my ass ago man I can go to PC parts
picker and build the system for 17 bucks
that's better we don't like to do that I
honestly hate that man like we just
try to bring really quality systems to
the table for you guys to check out
they're just recommended builds I never
say anything like hey this is the best
for your money you can get I never say
anything like that whatsoever this is
just my team and myself these are the
systems that we bring to the table you
can always take it change the parts out
do whatever you want to do so even doing
this system the producer I felt like I
was walking on eggshells afraid of what
the MV fans are going to say you know
like oh my god it's too much money or
screw that or why didn't I use an AMD
card it's just uh you know I just felt
the 1080 was a great balance in the
systems it's a good affordable card five
hundred bucks now you guys obviously
know if you want a TI you can pay that
extra 200 bucks and stick it in there
and go for broke if you want to but for
those people out there who want to own
an AMD processor and you're not the most
totally content creative bastard in the
world I would say the 700 X right now is
the sweet spot of the Rison 7 stuff
that's just my personal opinion let me
see yours down below I'm Eric like usual
all the parts of the system will be down
below that like button hopefully you
will go Chuck Norris on that
motherfrakker and like this video cuz
hey we took the time to bring it to you
and so I hope you appreciate it so peace
out we'll see you guys back here if you
don't have notifications on hey turn
them on if you're not sub come on you
know what to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
