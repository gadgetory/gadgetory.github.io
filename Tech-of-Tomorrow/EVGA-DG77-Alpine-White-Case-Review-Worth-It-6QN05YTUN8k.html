back here once again on the chow
today we're gonna be taking a look at a
really nice mid tower case and the
people over at EVGA this is their brand
new DG 77 now they have a DG 76 it's a
little bit different little aspects but
as far as this series goes this is a
really nice case it's got tempered glass
windows both in the front and back the
front ones actually clear as you guys
can see the back one is actually colored
Alpine white to match the design of the
case now this case is about a hundred
and sixty nine dollars on the market but
it is designed very very well for one
thing a lot of the cases you guys see
nowadays you go to buy stuff it's kind
of hard to choose them because a lot of
them are just glitz and glam but they're
made really flimsy or they're just
flashing RGB lights everywhere it's got
some design that most people are like
what the hell is going on there but this
is actually simple and elegant all in
itself and the things you're gonna
really like about it is its ability to
use 360 millimetre rads both in the
front and the top as long as they're no
bigger than 60 millimeters thick and
that's really cool in the front of the
case you can use 320 millimeter fans or
240 millimeter fans and the same thing
goes for on top now in the very back
there's a single fan and when you buy
the system outright not excuse me the
case itself it actually comes with 320
millimeter fans already built in so you
don't have to go out and buy anymore and
the airflow and the pressure taking the
air out of the system is actually
perfect the way it is but if you want to
improve upon it or use radiators and
make this thing a liquid-cooled system
it is ready to rock and roll right off
the bat the GG 77 size in an 18 point
seven eight by eight point thirty by 19
inches it also weighs about twenty three
point three five pounds so it's not
really that heavy and when you have the
DG 77 in your hands you guys will notice
that it's a very well-built doesn't feel
flimsy whatsoever it's actually a nice
solidly built case now I need to correct
myself real quick a minute ago I said
that the case comes with three fans
excuse me I was wrong
it comes with four fans 420 million your
fans come with it when you buy it off
the shelf there are two in the front one
in the back and one on top and there are
also removable filters on the front and
the top
on the bottom when your power supply is
gonna be so you can take those filters
up and clean them and make sure your
system stays dust free for years on end
visually speaking taking a look at the
windows side you guys can see that it
has a nice logo setting the DG 77 right
on it you can see everything really
clear and because it's tempered glass
it's going to be very easy to clean now
in the back you also have tempered glass
as well but this is painted Alpine white
it looks really really nice checking out
the rear of the case on the very top is
where your motherboard IO is gonna come
out down below that or seven expansion
slots and located on the bottom is your
power supply and you can install pretty
long power supply inside this so I think
no matter which power supply you have
it's most likely going to fit on the
bottom of the case is also for standard
feet nothing fancy nothing that looks
weird
just for standard feet and last but not
least taking a look at the top of the
case we'll start from the back going
forward first off you have a button
called your K boost now what K boost
does is it allows you to work with their
motherboards and their products and with
this single button you can instantly
overclock your video card or your
motherboard so it's a pretty cool thing
especially if you're going to be doing a
bill that includes EVGA video cards and
EVGA motherboards the next button is the
reset button then you have two USB 3.0
ports a mic port and audio port and then
finally the power on button so that's
the outside of the case let me go ahead
and start disassembling it so we can
check out the inside all by the way
disassembling and taking everything
apart in this case is very simple to do
everything is a simple thumb screw you
don't need any tools whatsoever just go
ahead and disassemble the case and one
thing that I really do like about this
case and I think that you guys will
agree is the fact that you can
disassemble almost this thing all the
way down to its bare metal and you might
be asking yourself why is that a good
thing well if you're gonna build a
system nowadays and you want the best
cable management having nothing in your
way of doing so is the absolute best way
to be I mean it just is and these these
screws you guys can see they all come
off really really simple there's no
hassle with this at all you can remove
them I'm gonna it's gonna start
disassembling it so we can check the
system out I don't want to break the
tempered glass but there we go we'll get
the glass let me hand this off to the
cameraman here you guys go and by the
way this is tempered
which can break so be very careful with
it it's also probably one of the reasons
the case probably cost $169 now so I've
taken the side panel off and internally
nothing inside of here has a sharp edge
or anything that can cut you so working
inside of the case you don't have to
worry about you're gonna cut your hand
or do anything like that whatsoever also
if you're wondering hey man will my
cooler work in here well from the back
of the case to the glass is a hundred
and fifty millimeters of distance so as
long as your cooler is shorter than that
you will be good to go you can also
install three video cards in here and
you guys can see pretty much any video
card that you want will fit in here I
think it's like three hundred and ninety
something millimeters is the link so I
mean even large cards like the power
color cards are gonna be able to fit in
here no problem there's also all the
additional wiring and right here is the
EVGA logo and this actually lights up
RGB you can also remove it if you want
you don't have to have it there there's
an option for it but you can change it
to any different color you want which i
think is pretty cool because we'll use
it to match whatever the secondary color
of the build is these are all the cables
and everything that you plug into your
motherboard we still have them kind of
contained over here until we do the
build but honestly there's just a lot of
room inside of here it's pretty easy to
work with noting that I think is really
important to get in your way plus once
you do your build even if you leave it
the way that it is this will be nice air
fluid there won't be really anything
constricting it because of the cable
management and why people like for the
Glo cable management honestly I think
cable management is become like one of
the most important factors of doing a
build these days beyond the look and
everything else if you don't have good
cable management happy we're gonna go
frown on that and the better your cable
management
there's no airflow restriction meaning
that when these two things are bringing
excuse me these two fans are bringing
they're in this fan is bringing air out
if you're going to be an Oracle system
or with your radiators there's gonna be
absolutely nothing in there to keep and
constrict you know the air from flowing
through and keeping the case cool now
everything on this thing really
disassembles I'm just gonna start just
taking it apart solely here and getting
this thing out of pieces for you guys as
we go along here but like I said before
everything inside of here completely is
whoops I've dropped
four rooms over there ought to get in a
minute but there's no problem taking
everything apart I just want to show you
guys why I think this is cool on this
particular case just bear with me a
second here I know it takes a second
second for you to screw these out but
let's go ahead and start taking this
thing apart so back off now I'm gonna go
ahead and remove the other glass window
so I can talk to you guys about that and
this class feels kind of tripping
because it's really like like a glass
table when you when you hit a glass
table it's got that same kind of sound
to it so bear with me folks that go
through here and just get everything off
of here for you guys
I was gonna beer all this stuff out but
I figured hey might as well just do it
live and show you guys exactly it's
gonna be in the same time it's going to
be for you to do it so one more to go
and it'll be good to go as they say so
let me get this last one off in here and
hand it off to the camera again here you
go so as I turn the case around at the
back and you guys can see it now I'll
probably have some b-roll of this going
on but right here is where you're 22.5
drives are gonna go you can also remove
these and like I said before you can
remove almost everything in here I mean
even these things right here you can
remove take them out I'm not going to do
that because this is too much by half so
but you can remove all these different
things and there's so much room back
here and once again no sharp edges or
anything to cut you up there's so much
room back here that you can stuff all of
your cables back in here and you won't
have any type of problem whatsoever
we'll be bringing you guys the build
next in go go lighters do the building
it now well we wanted to get this case
out show you guys what the case all
about and then do a completely separate
video showing our building our concept
for this so let me just keep removing
screws here as we get unscrewed here on
techo tomorrow
but my point really is that this is just
so really easy to take apart for anyone
and I mean I there's some case that we
review that are cool but it still
requires a tool being able to to lessly
work with your case and take everything
out i I think is much nicer for one
thing who really wants to rely on a tool
I mean if you decide you get a wild hair
up your butt one day and you want to
just completely change things around you
want to be able to do it
so here's one more thing now this is the
very front of the case like I said
before removable filter here are those
220 millimeter fans that we talked about
before and that's pretty much as much as
you can disassemble it without without
actually probably taking a hammer to it
but you can see everything is completely
taken outside of the case now another
nice feature that this case came with is
it came with the way to mount the video
card vertically that's right vertically
I know every is a big fan of that so
that's what we're gonna try to do so
luckily EVGA gave us the proper bracket
and the proper cable so that we'll be
able to put in our card now I got one of
those Star Wars Edition Jedi cards yeah
the the killer card the Titan one and we
put that bad boy in here and luckily it
came with this now also you get screws
and everything to mount different
hardware you get a few zip ties but to
honestly do a complete really nice cable
management build you probably need a
little bit more parts than than this and
just saying there's also some little
rubber feet little rubber sticker feet
an additional part for your power supply
you get the manual and all that good
stuff so if you want to look up anything
about it it'll all be inside this little
book right here and that's pretty much
it I mean honestly the DG 77 is a very
nice case like I said previously a
couple times it's about a hundred and
sixty nine dollars depending on where
you buy it it's a mid tower steel
tempered glass windows plenty of room
inside for even a 360 millimeter
radiator on the front and on the top a
lot of room 150 millimeters from the
back of the case excuse me from the back
of the case to the front of the glass so
you have plenty of room for even a lot
of those after Marv
at huge coolers so you're good to go
there power supply can be completely
hidden so it doesn't matter even it's a
black blue green or whatever it doesn't
matter because you can honestly hide it
with the shroud and if you don't like
the EVGA logo it's like I said you can
take that off there and the fact that
this whole case can be completely
disassembled to do your build to me is
just a really great thing I would have
to say this is another editor's choice
case here on Tekken tomorrow we'll be
doing our build next but if you guys
want more information just want to check
out more things about this we'll have a
link down below where you can either buy
a case like this or just find out more
information from EVGA I'm Erik you guys
been watching techno tomorrow thanks for
watching we'll see you guys back in the
channel for more tech and more builds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
