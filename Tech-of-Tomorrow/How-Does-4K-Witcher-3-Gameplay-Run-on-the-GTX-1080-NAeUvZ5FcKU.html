tomorrow you want to see us fight some
Ghoulies some beasties and bodies well
let's try the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 in
witcher 3 with everything turned to its
maximum settings with hair on and hair
off let's go
sorry beasties as you guys can see we
have everything turned up to its maximum
settings inside of witcher 3 now the
particular footage we're going to see
right here this is with hair on but i
got to say that in the past i think
there were major differences with hair
on and hair off but it doesn't seem like
right now there's actually going to be
that much of a difference was pretty
surprising stuff also when we went
inside the Nvidia control panel and they
also have the GeForce experience we made
sure that we selected the tab in there
that optimizes settings for this game
but we went inside the game you guys can
see we set everything in game to its
maximum as well so let's go off and do a
little bell
wowie that's it roach
ah
slow now
well the chap on me gladitoria with a
low fuck but never visit me which
himself
mom said going good she'll send me on
the trailer treats
to be a large stone near the pond
they're bolder now right and down to the
cart

the mall watch what you say she's quick
to hire one home
now where she went off to hmm managed to
amass quite a book collection hmm
managed to amass quite a book collection
don't often see bubbles like this in
Belen now so this is where she did
well thanks wondering how long it would
take you down I'm upstairs don't be shy
greetings Witcher

rapport hurry up

managed that's so make sure and tell me
before heading next time teleport over
there we must activate it quickly after
feeling another golems about
on us
all right bcs so that was with hair on
now real quick though before we jump
into the next thing i want to give a
special shout to the people over
Braintree for making today's video
possible even the best mobile app will
not work unless you have the proper
payment API and that's where these folks
come in to solve all your problems this
is where brain trees V zero SDK comes in
one amazingly simple integration gives
you every way to pay it supports Android
iOS and JavaScript clients and it offers
a simple integration that you can do in
minutes if this sounds good to you try
it out for yourself in the sandbox all
you gotta do is go WW bring three
payments calm /t ot and now that we've
got that out of the way let's see The
Witcher 3 with hair off kind of like me
he awaits us

butcher 3 hair on and the hair up that's
right I call it the the bald version but
anyways that's it folks the GT x 1080
everything turned to maximum you guys
can see frame rates are going between 30
and 45 not getting 60 on this game at
all which is what a lot of you people
said so that's what we brought to you
also we know the original score seemed a
little bit wanky so we're gonna be
bringing you back a bunch of different
gameplay and we'll film the entire
gameplay just like we did today from the
ground up so you can see what settings
we use so everything's completely clear
for clarification for you guys the fans
