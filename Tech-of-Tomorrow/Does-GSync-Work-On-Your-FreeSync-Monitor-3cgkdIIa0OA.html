that this probably should have happened
a long long time ago and maybe I should
have made this video a little earlier
but I decided to really wait and let all
the water settle and make sure that
there was going to be no BS whatsoever
on what's going on and that's what we're
gonna be talking about today it was
actually something viable and happening
so what am I talking about okay and
Vidya will now actually support freesync
through their drivers and through their
cards that's right
amazing as it may sound you can now use
a free sync monitor with an Nvidia card
because we all know let's just face it
man
g-sync monitors are expensive takes big
bucks I'll admit I was pretty stoked
when Acer sent us their Predator X 27
cuz that's like the top of the line
g-sync ultimate monitor out right now
it's got HDR all the bells and whistles
we brought you guys a review before you
guys all said Wow alright that thing's
$2,000 you can stick it where the Sun
don't shine and honestly hey I don't
blame you if I had to buy this monitor
myself there be absolutely no way that I
could afford out of my meager budget
that I make from YouTube luckily though
I have good relationships with a lot of
companies to little kick me down some of
this stuff to review for your guys but
with that said it does seem though like
it is a fact
Jennsen kind of announced it I don't
know I don't really agree with some of
the tactics of that cuz like they were
just like showing like you know really
bad examples I thought of what could go
on with a free sink but it is now
happening since there are many people
out there who have free sink monitors
and I am talking about version one of
free sink monitors free sink two
monitors will not work because free sink
two monitors are more kind of like
g-sync monitors it's hardware to
Hardware instead of software hardware so
it's a different you know thing
altogether so the monitors that are free
sync to will not work they're not
supportive because like I said that's
direct but for many people out there who
own free sink monitors there is a good
chance that your monitor will work with
an Nvidia card now currently there's
going to be four different level
that you're going to be getting with
this technology that are calling g-sync
the one at the top is called g-sync
ultimate orgy sync with HDR it's you
know the top-of-the-line monitors like
acer predator and a zoo has some these
are all they're very top-of-the-line
most expensive most wallet breaking
monitors on the planet then next up they
have what's called standard G sync
monitors you know there's a lot of
monitors up that are just standard G
sync these you know is the next tier so
you got the very top this one the next
one and then you have under this one
what they call g-sync compatible
monitors there's a whole bunch of these
out there on the market as well and then
they have at the end what they really
call will go ahead and enable it and
hopefully it will frickin run and that's
really how how it was announced you know
the bottom line though here is currently
there are 12 monitors out there that
have been tested and guaranteed to work
using an nvidia card with the free sync
monitor we'll have some links to those
down below so if you guys want to get
one of those for yourself or check that
out you guys can do that for yourselves
now
one thing I'd like to do though there
are probably lots of people out there in
my audience that actually have an Nvidia
card and a free sync monitor so what I
would really like you guys to do is this
I'm gonna go ahead and create a little
poll that you guys can answer some
questions on but I'd like to see your
comment here I would like to know is
does your monitor work with the Nvidia
card so if you have freesync monitor I
want you to go in and Nabal the feature
and see if it works because basically
Nvidia said well maybe it'll work maybe
it won't work we can't guarantee if
it'll work you know but hey maybe it
will work not to you know great of a
target there it's like you know Cupid
shooting and just flying around going
nowhere I don't know but we do know that
there are these twelve now they're
probably five or six hundred free sync
monitors out there on the market and
what it tends to be so far is that the
later versions of free sync monitors and
the ones that were higher-end all seem
to be working without problem the ones
that are lower end or older
modders those ones don't seem to be
working very well whatsoever so chances
are that if you've purchased your free
sync monitor and it's not really that
old there's a good chance that if you
have an Nvidia card it's going to work
now this does make perfect sense because
like I said to beginning the video and
video with the G sync stuff yeah I mean
hey it is killer I'll give you that but
it's a very very expensive to get into
especially if you want to have the best
let's face it you know a card is gonna
cost you what 20 80 tags and it cost you
1314 bucks top of my monitor you're
talking $2,000
you're talking about $3500 honestly
that's like some people's like first car
or like a serious down payment on a car
or even a junky car but still $3500 is a
lot of money just to be jumping into
that technology and we're talking about
just the monitor the video card here
we're not even talking about the rest of
your system or anything like that so
that's some pretty crazy stuff so if you
guys would do me a favor I'd really
appreciate it
you guys have at home an Nvidia card and
you have a free sink monitor test it if
everything works please leave your model
number down below and let people know
that it works that way people who can
come here and they can check it out look
at the comment section and go hey you
know what I have that monitor I don't
have to go out and buy one
mine should work and that should
actually help a lot of people with their
buying decisions now because if you've
had an Nvidia card all this time and
you've really wanted to have a monitor
that that could work you know in
conjunction with it with all that you
know nice new frame ripping and all that
locked up frames everything just looks
beautiful
you want to have that technology and not
being able to do that and have to spend
a fortune you know to get a full g-sync
monitor is just insane so if you have a
you know really good freesync monitor
you should be in the end right now and I
want to know and I'm sure there's lots
of other people out there who want to
know this information as well so if
you're wondering hey Laura quell how do
we do this well it's pretty much just as
simple as installing the latest driver
going into the control panel and just
making sure that you enable g-sync
technology and so it's either going to
work or it won't work hopefully though
with the monitor that you have it will
work because I want to hear more success
stories because that will be absolutely
great to be able to hear from lots of
people and say hey it was really awesome
and I had this
I've never been to use a technology and
today I'd install the latest driver and
whoa alright man my monitor is working
so you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow it's actually here nvidia has
come down from their pedestal and they
now allow free sync on their video card
which i think is actually a really smart
idea because a lot of consumers own free
sync monitors i Mellark you guys been
watching techni tomorrow we will have
links down below so if you guys want to
check out one of these monitors get one
for yourself you can do so peace we'll
see you guys back down here for more
tech in tomorrow if you're not subbed
hey make sure you are sub will also have
links to my music so if you want to
download the benchmark song or anything
else we'll have links to that as well
