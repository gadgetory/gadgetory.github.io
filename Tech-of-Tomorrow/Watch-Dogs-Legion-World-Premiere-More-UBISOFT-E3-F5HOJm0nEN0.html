something pretty funny I don't know if
you guys know the show where it's always
sunny in philadelphia well always Sony's
Mac came out on stage and announced a
new TV show de buting on Apple TV called

the game out and see what it's about
Ubisoft also showed us a gods and
monsters trailer which is a
light-hearted Greek mythology adventure
