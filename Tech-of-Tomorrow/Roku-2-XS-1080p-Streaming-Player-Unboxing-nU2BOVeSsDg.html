welcome once again to the tech of our
youtube channel we do all the tech all
the time what am i doing today well
today I'm going to do the unboxing and
first look at the Roku 2 XS now what is
this thing huh well basically what it is
it's basically a little TV converter and
a box now previously I had bought the
Apple TV hmm I liked it for some things
but as soon as I want to do any of my
Amazon stuff well I was out of luck
because well they don't support it at
all and being in my living room I don't
listen to any music whatsoever mmm the
Apple TV thing kind of got kind of
obsolete very very quick for one thing I
watch a lot of Netflix and I watch a lot
of Amazon Prime stuff so with that said
I was like screw it I need something
else so for my Christmas present I asked
for this and Santa he delivered thanks
Santa
I appreciate that so with that said
let's do the unboxing and check out this
little thing and with free hand this
 today I'm gonna bring this up show
you guys this up here see the front of
the box and all that good stuff now you
get games on this too and it has a
motion sensor in the remote control so
you can play motion games so you could
play like ping pong or that type of
stuff all through the Roku 2 XS and
check it out they're free and it
supports every single solitary one this
one has no hate I guess the only hate
they as you can't do iTunes on here
since obviously Apple probably told them
to go themselves because you know
how those folks are so well spin around
to the side see the side of the box not
much do that we still want everybody to
see it because otherwise it would be a
proper unboxing here's that zoomy zoomy
Rock and roomy alright folks so a couple
quick incisions here one here one here
pop it out of the box here
dunt dunt dunt and uh Kapow
there we go we're at the bat it says hi
let's get started
only problem is if you're too damn high
you probably ain't going to be able to
get started not so good
alright so there we show it it's a
little guide and everything shows you
how to hook it up and all that stuff
there's different types of audio
connections and everything
it comes with RCA cables I'm probably
going to use HDMI because that's what I
prefer will using these type of devices
we'll just go ahead and flip through it
so you guys can see it alright so that's
enough of it we'll move past it blah
blah blah blah blah blah okay there you
guys are saw it now here we go right two
more pieces of the device and dump them
to excess not to be confused in excess
tube and so let's pop it out of here now
this thing's really really small
now if anybody ever saw the Apple TV and
thought it was small well guess what
sunshine this thing's even smaller so
let me go ahead and get this tape off of
it go ahead and show you the ports right
here on the side USB here on the back
HDMI audio video out from their cable
Ethernet for plug in the internet
obviously the power on the side over
here little purple little Roku thing and
if you pull that it makes it work or not
probably not see they got extra little
tape stuff on the side right here I'm
going to remove all this off of here
anyways so there we go
to properly take it off so that's pretty
much it and let me take a look at with
this thing right here now I guess this
is just a little tag on it has nothing
to do with any things it's not pulling
on I want to break it so I guess that's
not part of it I guess I should have
read the instruction guides huh mmm
alright then so here we're moving on
players very little control the plastic
sure came off of that nice and easy
as you can see alright and even has
that's right
check it out it even has a little thing
to wrap around your wrist now you guys
know why this is in here right because
earlier I said that it's a
it's those motion sensor games so you
know where the biggest problems that
they had with products like the Wii was
people going hey well and then showing
it right through their monitor and
breaking their monitor happened many
many times so here's the remote very
simple and laid out it'll control Angry
Birds and all that other stuff plus like
we said the action based game so let's
get that out of the way there na else
inside the box yes there is we have
tables and some other stuff all right
let's get that other so here is the
power adapter power plug which is
obviously going to go into here and then
this one's going to go into your wall or
into your little Hampshire things you
got two little Hampshire spinning around
to charge your electricity whatever you
got your house down different people got
different stuff I'm being fair so then
we got the wires pin is out of the bag
this one plugs in the back obviously
which is a little small plug right here
3.5 plugs in there and then you have all
of your jacks right here I'm not going
to use these at all I'm going to go
straight to the HDMI last but not least
we have batteries and then the important
product information guide and the
batteries for the remote and that's it
that's all stuff so well I guess doesn't
work the camera in anyways but hey there
you go folks
like I said the reason I bought this is
I mainly just watch movies in my living
room they're blu-rays or just watching
streaming stuff that's my gig I to watch
no regular TV at all and I do mean never
hate commercials burned on that
years ago as soon as sci-fi changed
their name to you know sigh FY I was
like f you guy and was never watching
that anymore it's went strictly to what
I'm doing so this thing streams much
more I like it better I'm not a fan of
running movies from Apple they charge
way too frakkin much who the hell wants
to pay $5.99 to run a frakkin movie with
you can go and get one from red box for
$0.99 yeah let's do the math that's what
I'm saying
you know what I'm saying or you can rent
them they have rentals on
much cheaper than them I like the Roku I
think it's going to be very cool friend
of mine having his house that's the guy
who inspired me to get it because like
he was like would you listen to music
and I was like well no he's like well
then why do you have that Apple thing
and I was like I thought it was for TV
but it doesn't do Amazon so that's why I
got it it's 80 bucks check it out if
you're interested I think this thing
personally if you only watch movies and
you don't care about music I think this
is much better than the one that you get
from Apple unless you're the person just
spends all their money through the
iTunes Store which I don't
with that said peace out like that video
and show me the love and always be
subscribed I'll see you in movie land</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
