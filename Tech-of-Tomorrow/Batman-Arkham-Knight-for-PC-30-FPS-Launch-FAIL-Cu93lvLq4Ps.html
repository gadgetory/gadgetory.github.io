in tomorrow I'll just bring you guys
really more of a quick PSA video I was
originally planning on giving you guys a
benchmark bid for Batman Arkham Knight
which did get released today however if
in case you haven't heard not exactly a
good thing to do right now because the
PC part of this game is atrocious first
off when you start the game off you get
an immediate slap in the face by seeing
an enforced frame limit of 30 frames per
second now the thing is it's actually
really easy to turn that off you just
have to edit the game system settings
any file but honestly I really recommend
not actually doing that because then
other performance issues start to become
a lot more apparent so first off if you
turn that frame limit off this game is
getting all full performance for how it
looks on my system which includes a GTX
780 and an i7 4770k processor I was
seeing at most 50 frames per second
while running it on max settings at
1080p resolution which is not great but
the other problem is with that frame
limit turned off I also notice that the
frame rate was incredibly inconsistent I
was seeing it max out at 50 but it was
constantly going back and forth back and
forth between 50 and 25 which is just
headache-inducing and honestly a lot
worse than just dealing with a low frame
rate now the thing is whether or not you
have the frame limit on there's other
performance issues you're going to see
you right away including the fact that
the screen will constantly stutter
during certain situations for instance
getting in or out of the Batmobile will
make everything stop for a moment and
completely mess with the experience and
the final cherry on top there are a lot
of textures in the game that simply look
awful and just don't appear to be
loading correctly at all
now according to a lot of people that
are playing the game on consoles they
are experiencing zero issues so this is
clearly a sign of the fact that it's
just a problem with the port job for the
PC version which Warner Brothers has
admitted they actually outsource the job
for that which really just cements in a
trend that we've been seeing with WB
games in that they really just don't
give a shit about PC ports I mean just
looking at the PC launch of Mortal
Kombat X earlier this year which was
abysmal and even looking at the other
Batman game as Batman Arkham origins was
unplayable for the first couple weeks
after launch in Arkham City while it
still didn't get released on the same
day as consoles and had a little more
time to be developed still
with a lot of issues that needed fixing
and the real shame is it seems like the
really only huge downside of this game
so far is the fact that the port job was
done so terribly gameplay-wise I haven't
seen any real problems I haven't
experienced any game breaking books
personally it's just the fact that it's
really hard to enjoy this game when your
framerate is constantly jumping around
so with that in mind if you are thinking
of picking up Arkham Knight on PC don't
do it just not right now at least give
it a few weeks pay attention to news
reports because it's going to get fixed
eventually but it's just not worth
paying money right now if it's not going
to work and if you did happen to already
pick the game up and pick it up on Steam
now is a very good time to remember that
Steam does now have their refund policy
in effect so if you haven't played the
game too much yet get your refund now
because it's just not worth playing if
it's not a properly polished product yet
you know like I said keep your ear to
the ground pick it up once it starts
working but for now just stay clear of
it so that's all I really want to do a
video on today about once the game is
properly fixed and actually running
smoothly I'll do a benchmark video in
the future but for now that's just on
hiatus as always if you guys enjoy our
videos hit that thumbs up button to let
us know and subscribe if you haven't yet
we'll be seeing you soon with some more
content until then I'm Kevin Kenton and
you've been watching Tyga tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
