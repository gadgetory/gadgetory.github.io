by Corsairs vengeance RGB hey what's
going on everybody welcome back once
again to TECA tomorrow where we're doing
another build this time based around the
rising 1,500 X and the RX 570 both very
very popular products and people over at
AMD so we thought we'd put a bill
together that was affordable and still
look pretty cool so this build is
considered a budget build I'm not going
to stay cheap because cheap makes things
down well cheap so this is a budget
build everything inside the case all
together about six hundred and fifty
dollars it runs really nice the scores
are good you guys have seen before that
a 1500 X just slightly overclocked and
score just as well as an 1800 X so why
spend that extra money on a CPU if
you're just a gamer do you know the
brand new rx 570 these cards are coming
to market like right under $200 so it's
a perfect blend so with that said let's
jump in and let's check out this really
nice system which I'm calling omega red
let's check it out so first off let's
check out the case now this case is red
obviously matches an AMD build in this
case comes with everything this is the
Rosewill black hot-dipped galvanized
steel ATX mid tower case but this case
is cool because it's not only $70 it
comes with a five hundred power supply
inside the unit you can be automatically
up and going with your system without to
purchase an additional power supply but
we'll get to that in just a minute for
the motherboard we went for the gigabyte
GAA be 350 gaming 3 AMD rise in a m4
motherboard now a lot of people have
said that the 350 series does view games
and stuff just about as good as an X 370
chipset now but from what I'm seeing
from the scores that we did the
motherboard is a wee bit slower than an
X 370 not so much you're going to be
like oh I can't absolutely use that
board but the scores are just a wee bit
slower and all the features are nice the
overclocking stuff seems to be about the
same I have to say these motherboards
are quite a good price for what they are
now for the CPU obviously we're using
the AMD Rison 515 in our Dex processor
and we decided to go ahead and use this
fire cooler this is a race fire cooler
that came in the box to keep the price
down now the CPU currently comes to
market at about 189 dollars and it's
pretty much the mid-range winner for AMD
at this point
now this next component the rx 570 this
is a very
objective card there are cards in the
market that are cheaper than this one so
you could build this bill just a little
bit lower if you use different cards
unfortunately the power color the fact
that's an overclocked card and pretty
much like the creme de la creme of the
cards it costs a little bit more but in
your build you can choose to use
something else if you wish now for the
memory at first when I built the system
I put four gigabytes of memory in the
system and let me tell you guys four
gigabytes with Windows 10 and this just
isn't cutting it it's very very sluggish
and everything that we're doing so we
decide to switch it up now to stick the
we got is by coming called Pacific now
they're kind of an odd company I
personally haven't heard of them but we
were able to pick this memory up at
Fry's it's very very low price fifty
three dollars for eight gigabytes if
there's any problem like I said it does
have a nice two-year warranty so you can
feel nice and secure for at least two
years now as far as the hard drive goes
we decide to go with the WD blue one
terabyte drive and this drive is a great
price you can get this drive right now
for 50 bucks that's right I said 50
bucks if you want to get a 2 terabyte
drive they come in to market about 70 to
80 dollars so you can change that around
your system if you need more space now
one thing I want to mention folks the
500 watt power supply that comes in the
Rose will case it does do pretty well
but in all honesty if you plan on using
your system for a lot longer time or
actually using your system do upgrades
and stuff I would go ahead and buy a
little bit of a more powerful power
supply especially if you want to do
crossfire or SLI or anything like that
in a future build you might want to
think about getting another power supply
to replace that one we've put a link
down below where you guys can check that
out or you can choose one for yourself
but either way if you're not going to be
keeping the system the way that it is
for a long time I might really consider
getting a little bit bigger power supply
and let's just face it folks more power
means more room for expansion hey tech
fans if you haven't seen it before you
gotta check this out this is Corsairs
RGB vengeance memory kit now not only is
this memory fast it also features a vast
array of colors due to the RGB implement
of the memory so if you're looking for
something they'll keep your computer
running fast and still look totally
badass
check out Corsairs vengeance RGB alright
folks so that is the system now I know
some people out there going to make
their comments like they always do but
oh my god dude you've got mustard and
ketchup cables
if you want a system with completely
custom cable and all that it's
going to cost you a lot more money so
being like I said this is a budget based
build I wasn't so worried about you know
having the best you know good-looking
coolest cable stuff in the world I was
more or less looking for a system that
would play all of your games at 1080p
and still be within a nice price range
so with that said though let's jump in
right now we obviously know the test
station is and let's check out those
scores and see how the Omega Red
performed that's right
all right tech band so there you have it
the Omega Red a $630 gaming system that
plays games at 1080p really really well
you guys can see it this system does
perform great across the board a little
bit slower like I said in the X 370
boards but that's just you know a small
little thing one or two frames per
second you know across the board really
is in my book that big of a deal and if
you want to overclock the 1500 X like I
said you can get performance almost like
that with 1800 X you guys saw us do with
the 1600 X the 15th rx overclocks pretty
much exactly the same way not quite as
high you know of clock speeds and stuff
but that's you know just a wee bit of
performance now like usual this is a
suggested build you can change any of
the parts you want to do to you know
your specific needs
now I know a lot of people can just go
out there to PC parts picker you know
click click click a button and get you
know the cheapest components all
together but the only thing with doing
that is is sometimes some of the cheaper
components don't always work well
together so doing that's a cool idea you
know but there's no you know guarantee
that when you get those things your
houses everything is going to run
perfectly together especially if you're
a person who's like really new to
building PC stuff you might not want to
get the absolute bottom line cheapest
part on everything that's out there and
like usual this is just a suggestive
build you can do things like I said to
how you want to but if you're interested
in this building you think it's pretty
cool all the links to parts everything
will be down with that like button you
guys know what to do there and hey if
you're not sub to the channel I'd love
to see you here so that's it folks the
Omega Red $630 gaming system featuring
all pretty much AMV parts and their
components so peace out we'll see you
guys back on Tekken Omar from more Tech
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
