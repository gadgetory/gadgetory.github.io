time we're actually going to be giving
you guys this stuff over here and what
are we talking about that's right tech
of tomorrow and zotac have gotten
together to give you guys an awesome
bunch of prizes that's right we've got a
nano we've got a basic we've got an 880
motherboard with everything on board
which is perfect for you guys are
building mods running a really small
system and we've also got their brand
new silent 750 card from Nvidia so these
are awesome awesome prizes and it's
actually really easy to be entered to
this contest that's right very very easy
first of all all you have to do is be
subscribed to tech of tomorrow that's
right now there are additional ways
though to win that's right you guys can
get extra chances by doing other things
I know everybody out there does oh you
know I don't care about the Twitter
account I don't care about the facebook
account I don't care about any other
accounts I'm here and that's enough so
for you guys okay that's cool but for
you thrill seekers out there who want
your hat more time to actually want your
name more times in the Hat there are
going to be additional stuff now what's
really cool about these systems behind
me though is that they come with an SSD
on board that's right so you guys
automatically have these systems you
install your OS run that SSD you've got
quick startup times quick access times
that's right and these things are really
cool too because they're very very small
now these aren't particularly gaming
things at all these things really aren't
meant for gaming but for those guys are
going back to school or those people who
are just wanting some that they can use
to exercise that right to surf the
internet do word stuff all that kind of
stuff this system is going to be awesome
and it takes up no real estate
whatsoever the 880 board it's also
really cool everything's on board you
get video your CPU everything all
through
one of those AMD APU so that's pretty
cool stuff in itself and then 750 it's a
brand new card from Nvidia and this one
has nothing on it at all to make noise
it's completely silent edition it's got
one gigabyte of memory it's really meant
for those people who want to completely
silent htpc like gaming but they don't
want to hear shot so check this out this
thing starts and runs for 14 days like
usual all the information will be down
there below that like button now with
this kind of thing if you're hitting the
dislike button I don't know what you
beat us like this is the easiest thing
in the world if you dislike button
you're just hating for no reason because
we're giving you cool stuff to enter is
really really simple most of you

additional ways to do it just makes
things really really interesting so me

in the pooch say hasta LaVista to my
friends out there just want to say that
yes this thing is completely worldwide
that's right we'll figure out to get it
to you now we do have some limitations
though we're no longer shipping to the
moon or anything outside of the mode I'm
sorry shipping is just outrageous with
NASA out of business in America it's
been a real pain in the ass attending to
