this contest that's right very very easy
first of all all you have to do is be

right now there are additional ways
though to win that's right you guys can
get extra chances by doing other things
I know everybody out there does oh you
know I don't care about the Twitter
account I don't care about the facebook
account I don't care about any other
accounts I'm here and that's enough so
for you guys okay that's cool but for
you thrill seekers out there who want
your hat more time to actually want your
name more times in the Hat there are
going to be additional stuff now what's
really cool about these systems behind
me though is that they come with an SSD
on board that's right so you guys
automatically have these systems you
install your OS run that SSD you've got
quick startup times quick access times
that's right and these things are really
cool too because they're very very small
now these aren't particularly gaming
things at all these things really aren't
meant for gaming but for those guys are
going back to school or those people who
are just wanting some that they can use
to exercise that right to surf the
internet do word stuff all that kind of
stuff this system is going to be awesome
and it takes up no real estate
whatsoever the 880 board it's also
really cool everything's on board you
get video your CPU everything all
through
one of those AMD APU so that's pretty
cool stuff in itself and then 750 it's a
brand new card from Nvidia and this one
has nothing on it at all to make noise
it's completely silent edition it's got
one gigabyte of memory it's really meant
for those people who want to completely
silent htpc like gaming but they don't
