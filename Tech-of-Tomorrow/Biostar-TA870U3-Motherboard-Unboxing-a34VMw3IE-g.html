out there it's me or Ferris here on the
tech of tomorrow youtube channel
bringing you guys another unboxing as
you guys know bulldozer still waiting
for its coming out soon and there are a
few chipsets out by AMD to support these
new cpus now the am3+ cpus have scored
by their new boards and these are the
870 and 890 chipset boards today we're
looking at a board that comes into
market very low price this board from
biostar this is the TA 8700 you three
plus sounds kind of like a deck ta 87 oh
you three plus I owe you 3 plus but it's
not that's a motherboard and it's the
870 board now the 870 board is just a
little bit different than the 890 and
that doesn't support both crossfire and
SL light together it only supports
crossfire on the board so that's really
the only difference between it that said
let's take a look at this very bargain
board coming on to the market from
biostar so you can see it at the front
of the box here I'm going to flip it
around get a really close up shot of the
back of the board so the lot of the
features these guys have a lot of you
guys think biostar bill accords are
cheap motherboards they're not cheap
motherboard month other words they're
just motherboards that are made for
people that are on a budget they still
work fine they have great arm a there's
no problems with their boards they're
just made for people that aren't a
budget and there are a lot of people
like that so now we're going to go ahead
and open up the box kind of pop the cap
right at the back we're going to see
that we have the t-series this is the
user's manual and I'd then we have the
drivers and utilities CD right here we
have all the other thing comes in a
little biostar rep package right here
you can see this it's all right by a
little cool thing here I'm go ahead and
wrap that you can see we've got your
molex to your SATA power right there get
your rear I oh not very much on there
you can see that then we've got three of
your SATA cables right here we'll set
all those down
go ahead and pull this thing out and
we'll go ahead and bring the motherboard
out and show you guys that now if you
guys were looking at a website or
everything all the stuff that you guys
see out here in the table right here
this will be considered the bundles
section of the review I'm going to go
ahead and get this stuff out of the way
i'm going to show you guys the
motherboard you can see it's completely
factory sealed i'm going to go ahead and
pop the seal they're sitting bored
around go and open this bad boy up OMG
static and everything all right here
we'll go ahead and take a look at the
motherboard itself not bad you can see
they actually use good Japanese part
Louis MOSFET choke all that all their
muskets are all cooled and everything
plenty of room around the ZIF socket
supports both the am3+ CPUs and all the
older generation CPUs as well over here
we have the memory but the board
supports it to 32 gigabytes of ddr3
memory the a gigabyte sticks are now
available over on newegg and other
places now for additional power we have
a single for pin up here then another 24
pin power connector here now looking at
the board I can see that there is not
very many cooling fan headers at all on
this motherboard in fact I see 12 so
there really only two that I can see
power headers in the entire board that's
not a lot not the worst of the world but
not a lot either then we have two slots
over here for the video these are both
one of these is a 16 and the other one
is an eight then we have to the pci 1x
slots right here and then two of the
standard pci slots right here oh that's
okay you can see there's plenty of room
down here for your video cards then we
have a couple things over here we have
first your to say two slots right here
and then we have additional stated down
here and you can also see this board
supports the USB 2.0 and is supposed to
say that six gigabit connections through
these as well so also down here on the
motherboard you can see all these color
connectors these are what connect from
your case on your motherboard they're
all very well labeled here and the
motherboard has been color-coded so it's
really easy to hook up your cables and
every
um of mac you can see the board's pretty
well laid out the rear I oh it's not
very much honored at all in fact the
rear I always like very very light on
this motherboard you can say but like i
said this motherboard is geared for
those people on a budget this
motherboard is not really geared for
like gaming and everything like that
it's really just more geared for like a
multimedia type system and stuff like
that so this is it right here this is
the TA 80 70 u3 plus x biostar like i
said this motherboards gonna be coming
to a market about $59 so it's a
budget-priced motherboard and it does
support all the new am3+ cpus including
the bulldoze that should be out soon
thanks for watching teka tomorrow i'll
see you cats here again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
