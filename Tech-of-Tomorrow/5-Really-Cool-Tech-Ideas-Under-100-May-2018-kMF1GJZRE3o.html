killer tech deal right I sure know that
I am and finding tech products that are
under hundred dollars that are really
awesome are seriously a hard to find so
here in the month of May we have five
killer tech products under a hundred
bucks here on TECA tomorrow let's check
them out now this product from best tech
is pretty cool they call it a power
strip but I honestly feel it's more like
a power block and it features eight
outlets with two on each side and having
surge protection as well on that is
pretty nifty fifteen hundred joules is
quite enough for your PC and stuff like
that and having 640 watt powered smart
USB ports is also very nice you can see
there's three on one side three on the
other the unit is very well built it's
pretty ergonomic for some people they
might think that it's a little odd the
way that the cables all plug in but if
you have a lot of room and you've got a
nice place to set it this can be an
optimal thing to add to your desktop
because let's just face it like I said
before there's lots of things that need
to be plug in and power strips are kind
of cool but this little power block is
something a little bit nifty now next up
is a set of really nice wireless
Bluetooth headphones and I don't know
about you but having a nice set of
headphones for the gym or for running
around or just listening to music in
your house that you don't have to bother
anyone else is pretty nice now today
we're looking at the Optima new force
be6 eye now these headphones feature a
patented 10 millimeter driver they're
also lightweight water and sweat proof
they feature a full aluminum ear piece
with a rating of IP x5 the battery life
on this particular set of headphones is
also pretty nice you can either answer
your phone or listen to music for eight
hours they also include these pretty
cool silicone ear wings and these are
for a nice comfortable snug fit
especially when you're doing sports the
retail package includes two types of ear
tips for different size of ears a sports
carrying case a charging cable and a
cord management clip for in-ear
headphones I have to say they do sound
pretty nice and it's also very easy to
answer the phone with these headphones
the NuForce bd6 eyes come to market at
$79 and we'll have a link down below if
you've ever wanted a projector but you
really didn't want to
out the money to buy something though
it's gonna break the bank the tinkerer
q5 LED mini movie projector supports
1080p HDMI and looks very very nice I
gotta be honest with you for under a
hundred bucks this thing really rocks it
does tend to work better in a darkroom
but you can see it in the daytime as
well the q5 features fifteen hundred
lumens 1080p viewing and is really
geared towards watching movies it says
in their ad that it's not meant for
things like doing business presentation
and stuff like that
but you do get a 35 to 100 inch
projection display and it's recommended
that you have a projection distance of
about 2 meters the q5 also offers a
variety connections it has a TF
connection an HDMI connection a USB
connection and a standard Vesak
connection and you also get an audio and
a headphone jack depending on how you
want to listen to it all the controls
for this projector are located on top
and they're very easy and convenient to
use and if you don't want to use those
it also comes with the remote the q5 is
very lightweight it's well-built it has
a three year warranty and like I said it
comes to market at ninety dollars and
has one of Amazon's Choice best products
for this type of device next up is the
Blitz Wolff BW stb-1 soundbar now this
is a 36 inch smart home sound bar that
features a multi interface multi scene
mode it has six speakers and two
diaphragms it has a smart on and off and
it features wired and wireless
connectivity the SDB one is not just
louder it's also clear so if you're
looking to replace your TV speakers this
will definitely do the trick when things
are exploding and things like that you
get really nice sound and you can also
hear all the dialogue very clearly and
the stb-1 is not only for your TV it
also plays back music really nice and
through it's bluetooth connectivity you
can hook up to up to your phone to your
laptop whatever has that type of
connections and you can hear your music
and it sounds great the sound bar also
includes four different modes for your
preference news mode sports mode music
mode and movie mode
and for those people who are gonna
replace their TV speakers it shuts on
and off automatically with your TV there
are also six different ways you can
connect this sound bar through bluetooth
coaxial optical 3.5 millimeter auxilary
USB and HDMI controlling the sound bar
can be done in one of two ways either by
the included remote or by the controls
on the front now the controls in the
front feature power source volume up and
volume down inside the box you get the
sound bar you get one rc8 at 3.5
millimeter audio cable you get an
optical cable you get the power cable
and the instruction manual and I have to
say for coming in at $99 this is a
pretty damn good deal and last but not
least my absolute favorite of the five
the Star Wars droid inventor kit the
Star Wars Jordan venner kit is cool for
a lot of different people whether you're
a total Star Wars fanatic or just a
parent and wants to interact with their
children doing something really neat
this is something really cool now the
Star Wars Jordan bender kit comes with a
variety of different parts for doing
different things with the droid
depending on how you assemble it depends
on what the droid can actually do and
there's actually 22 missions in the app
so that kids can teach their droids new
skills and with customisable missions
kids can get very creative inventing new
droids and giving them their own
personality r2d2 can be controlled
through any smart device doesn't matter
whether it's Android or whether it's
iPhone you can control it through that
so like I said before you can build r2d2
in different ways you can make it so
that its head moves
it's arm swings or if you just want to
r2d2 to move around you can do that too
to move r2d2 you can either use sliders
joystick control or you can customize it
to your own parameters it also has a
plethora of r2d2 sounds or you can even
record your own 5 second message like
this what's really best of all though I
think for kids is that they can set up
their own mission and challenges and
there's also 22 missions like I said
that are built into the app so kids can
teach their droid new skills and just
like the Kano products we took a look at
previously it features block based
coding missions so you can drag and drop
everything very simply to your
specifications honestly I feel for $99
that this is a great product because
like I said previously if you're a
person who's just a total Star Wars
fanatic you're definitely gonna have
this in your collection and if you're a
kid and you want to interact with your
parents and learn how to code this is a
great way to start
Oh sounds like they need me anyways I
gotta say I love this little guy I wish
they had c-3po as well but for some
reason I haven't been able to find that
so there you guys have it
killer top 5 products for the month of
May I think every one of them is really
cool I definitely want to hear you guys
opinions down below and like usual down
below that like button we'll have links
to every single one of these products
