makers of the new xpg series of gaming
memory they've got your color they've
got your speed a data tech fans you
asked for it now we're bringing it to
the table for you the new NVIDIA GeForce
GTX 760 in SLI mode last week we brought
you guys the review of the reference
card now we're bringing you SLI with two
of the partner cards we're using both
the EVGA superclocked edition featuring
their a CX cooling and we're also using
the gigabyte featuring their win force
cooling now to do so and to get both
cards to be accurate we clocked both
cards to eleven hundred and fifty
megahertz for the boost clock so that
both cards would match up now with that
said you guys know we're still using the
i7 3770k as our CPU were using an SSD
obviously if our boot drive Western
Digital lots of memory and stuff you
guys can see the test station if you
guys are interested in all that stuff
you guys can see a link down the
description below with that said though
let's jump in and let's check out the
benchmarks and see how these cards do
all right folks so there you guys have
it these cards in sli head-to-head
against some of the competition now you
guys can see that these two cards are
faster than a GTX 780 but the GTX 780 is
going to offer you a lot more
flexibility and a lot less power
requirements but the positive side of
things will be that these cards also
cost five hundred and twenty dollars
that's right so you get a set of cards
for five hundred twenty dollars it
actually beats a GTX 780 right out of
the box now if those things like using
more power and heat they're like totally
irrelevant to you and you just want Rob
power then you guys might seriously want
to check out getting a pair of these
cards and putting them in SLI mode
because you guys can obviously see they
kick ass in Crysis 3 2560 by 1440 almost
completely double so that means you know
if you've got high screen monitors or
you want to use multi monitor technology
a pair of these cards is definitely
going to be right up your alley now one
last thing I do want to mention because
some people it matters to some people it
doesn't like if you were in Germany and
I didn't mention this you'd be like you
really suck ass as a reviewer and that
is noise levels two of these cards are
definitely going to run much louder than
a GTX 780 but there are ways around that
you can take a pair of these things and
water cool them and then all those
things are eliminated and you can crank
the at them these are just options
for yourself to think about now one last
thing folks before I bounce the hell out
of here I want to give a special shout
out and thanks to the people over at a
data and providing us with their new xbg
memory we were actually able to get our
hands on a couple of different eight
gigabyte kits one at 2500 megahertz and
one at 1600 megahertz ones gold one is
kind of gray they look pretty cool we
also have a hands-on about this stuff so
if you guys want to check out the full
review on that make sure you guys check
out the link down in the description
below also for pricing and availability
of both these two cards and other models
of gtx 760 s take a look down at the
link down below the like button now
while you're down there by the like
button you guys know what to do and I
appreciate it and love you guys for it
so that's it SLI of a gtx seven
60s you guys saw it here on tech Audemar
if you're not so please do so and we'll
see you guys back on the channel for
more tech goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
