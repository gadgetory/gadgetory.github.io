Thermaltake makers of the tte Sports
line of products featuring their BMW
mouse and many other products including
their new Mecca genuine illuminated
gaming keyboard hey everybody
glad to see you guys back here on the
channel welcome back I'm Mel rock your
host and you guys all know that I
finally got ahold of my Titan video card
from Nvidia that's right I finally got
my hands on that bad boy so I went to go
stick it though in my SRX motherboard
from EVGA and was surprised that the
damn thing would not post at all at
first I thought my video card was broke
and I was having a heart attack but then
I went tested and it was ok so what it
is is that if anybody out there you own
the EVGA SRX motherboard make sure you
flash your BIOS to the latest 0 0 1 9
also some steps to go through you want
to make sure that you create a folder on
your C Drive name it bios or whatever
you want as long as you can remember it
then you want to make sure that you go
into your command prompt hit CMD find
that run it as the administrator and
then follow the on-screen instructions
if you don't do it this way it won't
even flash the BIOS correctly but I
finally did get the card in there got
resident evil 6 this is a brand new
testing software that's come out from
Nvidia it's come out I think on February
21st this year does DirectX 9 testing
but it's actually pretty cool now we're
gonna have a lot more testing going on
in fact our first video will be a battle
between the gtx 690 and the titan and
then what many others as we test against
a series of their video cards including
obviously the 7970 the 680 and others so
anyways you guys said that you preferred
to us to do over the shoulder type stuff
so you can see the fraps and actual
gameplay so today we actually show you
this in live mode running this brand new
benchmark so with that said let's hop in
and let's check this
so check that out this was in 2560 by
1600 you guys could see that but if you
want to actually see the preliminary
results of the battle between the 690
and this you can see the screenshot of
this particular test run in 1920 by 1080
over on our website it'll be in the link
in the description below like usual I
hope that you guys liked this video
you guys can show me that you like and
appreciate me by hitting that like
button up there and if you're not
subscribed I really wish you do so we
love you may hope to see you guys back
from the channel as the battle with the
Titan continues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
