Corsair glaive RGB Gaming Mouse hey
what's going on guys welcome back to my
garage here on Tekken tomorrow we like
to do some videos do some building now
we got the x-carve we'll be doing some
stuff with that you guys have to miss
that video you guys should check it out
man because we got this cool thing cut
on x-carve and we're going to be making
a totally wooden pc case and we took
some boats on and it's kind of looking
right now like the radio build is the
one that's like the most in the lead so
I think that's what we're going to jump
in and do now today's video is about
crossfire and a really over-the-top
system if you don't actually need but I
didn't want any bottlenecking whatsoever
this video on to be just pure pure power
of the card so we have two DS radeon RX
5 80s horse edition from gigabyte badass
frickin card totally cool car we'll have
a totally dedicated video on that but
for today we're just going to bring you
the crossfire results of these cards
pretty much versus bump bump a bump a
bump a bum the other rirs card the GTX
1080 Ti pretty much the bad boy of the
bunch now these IRS cards you can get
these cards for ply around to 69 to 70
apiece so for the entire crossfire thing
you're going to be looking at probably
like just really like under 600 bucks
now this card go however is like six
hundred and seventy nine bucks around
there so you're looking at like you know
seven hundred bucks for this or about
close to $600 for this so real quick
let's just check out the test system
it's an over the top system I gotta
admit it man 59 60 Intel CPU x99
motherboard lots of memory I mean where
are we going to talk about the red
suspects it really doesn't matter it's
just a nice cool system it's like one of
the systems we use for editing before
but now it's just kind of which is kind
of like just sitting there so I'd like
alright let's use the most ultimate
system that we can get with no
bottlenecking
whatsoever so with that said with the
system we're using the absolute latest
drivers that we can get from both Nvidia
and from both the MB so that
everything's current with that stuff
we're not using any type of beta driver
or anything like that but the drivers
that are currently available that you
guys can get out there it's Windows 10
completely patched up with all the
patches all the weird stuff a big moment
on lately but now it's completely up and
going then with that said though let's
jump out let's jump in rather and let's
rock out to the benchmark song and check
out the benches
now as far as the tents go you guys can
see that both cards under full load
we're getting around 80 Celsius and
that's kind of normal special and Carter
just air cold with water you get a
little bit better results but as it is
it's still not that bad and as far as
the cards boost power we saw the cards
hitting 1430 that was about the normal
boost that we were seeing
all right tech fans so before we bounce
out of here and give you guys the
conclusion now we all know we need a
killer gaming mouse to play our games
right so let's take a quick look at
course there's Glade RGB if you're a
gamer who spends a hell of a lot of time
and from their computer gaming you want
a mouse that not only is killer for
gaming but it's also totally comfort and
that's where the glaive comes in it's
also got a lot of cool features like 6
programmable buttons 16 K adjustable dpi
and it's made for absolute comfort
because you can change the thumb grips
that's right I said it the glaive
features interchangeable thumb grips
that's right you can choose between
three styles of snap-on thumb grips for
the total tailored fit for your comfort
style the glaive also features onboard
profile storage for lighting effects
macros and dpi settings so no matter
where you go you'll be up and ready to
go with the glaive RGB alright folks
once again special thanks to Corsair for
break in today's video possible now my
total conclusion of this is if you
really don't care about 5 to 10 frames
per second you can live with that with
whatever your games that you're playing
and you go out and you look this is
really important I feel pretty much the
most important thing if you're thinking
about getting a crossfire system right
the first thing you should do is look
online and see how many games that you
actually play take advantage of that
technology I mean if you go online and
you look and only like three of the
games that you play take advantage of
crossfire technology why would you even
vest that much money because when
crossfire works sure it works cool you
get close to double the frame rates even
sometimes it's almost what seems like a
wee bit more which is kind of strange
but it's there and you guys can see even
against the gtx 1080i which is pretty
much the bad boy of the single cards
right now in the market when Vague gets
here we'll see what the hell vega adds
up it's three models but so far we don't
know what exactly that is there's only
been
no matters when it gets here we'll talk
about it with you guys but for now you
guys can see that with this system which
is absolutely no bottlenecking what's
ROS system this hi
the cards when they do compete you can
see that in a few games they actually
beat the 1080i now if you're a person
out there and you go wow those are the
three games I play to most then you
should say well hell then heck yeah me
getting a pair of rx5 ATS is probably
better than getting a single GTX 10 atti
I mean that's just the facts because the
price is lower man and around the world
we all know that pricing for some people
is very expensive because the import
costs knowledge they get screwed by
the government or whoever mafia type
 are working there you know
taking their money as it comes in the
country and going gee the card costs 200
bucks so we'll sell it to you for 400 I
mean those countries are screwed
Australia I guess suffers really bad
from this - and we've already talked
about certain countries being poor not
being able to buy it so you want to get
a system that's really really
competitive for gaming now if you only
game I've said it before 1500 X is
really nice if you're going to do some
streaming and stuff like that probably
getting the 1600 standard you're not
gonna do overclocking is probably a
better bet but there are a lot of people
out there who just do gaming and with
that you can definitely get yourself a
be 350 motherboard you guys can cure
self a 1500 X get yourself a pair of
cards in crossfire and yet you are going
to probably suffer 510 frames per second
but think of all the money you're going
to save instead of buying that crazy
$1000 CPU that we use in this build I
mean this particular build is probably
like close to like you know 20 to 23
hundred dollars when you can buy a
system is probably buy eight under bucks
then in gaming well you know almost be
the same so I now hope you guys liked
today's video like usual all these cards
everything will be down below that like
button hopefully you guys would go Chuck
Norris on that motherfrakker if you're
not sub K I wish you are because I like
see here on the channel and look for
single car reviews because we'll be
doing a full review on this card and a
full review on this card here on ticket
tomorrow
coming up peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
