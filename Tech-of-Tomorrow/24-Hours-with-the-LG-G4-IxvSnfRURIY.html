brand-new LG g4 and the experience thus
far has been pretty excellent now you
guys who own the g3 you guys know what
the phone looks like the g4 is pretty
much in the same spectrum although it's
a little bit longer than its predecessor
the g4 offers a very minimalistic design
as far as buttons go in fact all your
button operation is done off the rear of
the phone you can turn it on by this
button or you can actually double click
the screen to make the phone turn on as
well also operations such as volume
control scrolling and such can also be
operated by the controls on the rear of
the phone the shape of the body is also
unique to the g4 as far as that actually
offers a slight bend in its design on
the front of the phone we see a 5.5 inch
2560 x 1440 quad HD IPS quantum screen
this features a contrast of 1,500 21 and
538 pixels per inch under the hood of
the g4 empowering it all as the qualcomm
snapdragon 808 now this is a six core
GPU which is really interesting it
features a dual core 1.8 giga hertz cpu
a quad-core 1.4 gigahertz CPU and the
adrenal 418 handling the graphics the
phone comes with 3 gigabytes of RAM and
32 gigabytes of internal storage if you
take the back cover off you can see it
there's a removable 300 milliamp battery
and you also get support up to two
terabytes of expansion with a microSD
card that's right two terabytes which is
quite amazing for your phone as far as
the operating system goes the g4 comes
pre-loaded with android 5.1 lollipop on
the rear of the g4 we see a 16 megapixel
camera with an f 1.8 aperture size white
balance options image stabilization
laser autofocus and HDR availability and
on the front we get an 8 megapixel
selfie camera with an aperture of F 2
point 0 which features gesture shot just
your view and a front-facing soft light
getting set up but the g4 was really
really easy as you guys can see all I
had to do is follow through a couple
on-screen instructions set up my wife i
get my google plus account up and going
and everything was on my phone i've only
had my LG g4 for about 24 hours so far
but there are two things about it that
really stand out and that is all the
camera options and the 2560 x 1440
resolution screen that just offers
amazingly clear and crisp viewability
the dewlap option although not really
new is still something really cool here
you can view two apps simultaneously
which means you can view a web page or
you can view a video both the same time
for video and still photography the g4
offers some pretty unique features
although not aspect out of some of the
very high end 4k cameras out there it
still has a lot to offer under the hood
you get simple mode which offers you
simple easy to operate options auto
which is everything automatic and manual
which gives you a lot of different
options including white balance is 0 and
others being able to adjust the aperture
and the advanced features is something
really really cool not only can you get
that great picture in low-light
situations you can also get that nice
blurry background picture as well this
gives you a lot of control over taking
your pictures and as far as filming
videos you get ultra HD which is 4k
quality another camera option that you
really don't see on many other phones is
the option to shoot in raw format RAW
format allows for very crisp and clear
picture shooting video with the LG g4 is
also really nice here we can see some
ultra HD footage of me and buddy
underneath an apple tree looks very nice
and very crisp it's got stabilization so
we've your hands are a little shaky the
image still comes out clear doesn't look
like you're shaking or faking it like
you're in a Star Trek episode
alright folks so there you guys have it
my first 24 hours with the LG g4 and all
I can say is so far I'm pretty impressed
this thing has a lot of features which
I'm still going to delve into and bring
more videos to the table for you guys
like usual all this information will be
down there underneath that like button
much hopefully you guys will go Jackie
Chan style on today I'm elric thanks for
watching tech or tomorrow if you got
subbed you know what to do I'll see you
