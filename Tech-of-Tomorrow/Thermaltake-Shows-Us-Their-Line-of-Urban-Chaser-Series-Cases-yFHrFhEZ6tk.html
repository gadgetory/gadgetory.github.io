Alaric at techni tomorrow and I'm here
with my homeboy ransom from Thermaltake
CES 2013 has been a huge success and
ransom has lots of new products so bro
tell us what's going on I've seen a
floor full of out there check this
out this year we have the chaser a
series so which means you see the chaser
a long time but it's expensive you're
thinking about getting one but now we
make it more affordable so I wanted to
check it out with Eric here later on
besides that maybe no Thermaltake make a
lot of performing kids and all he goes
is fancy but this year in 2013 we make
something more solid no solid is just
the panel what happened is it's
conservative is nice they sleep all
right guys so what that's it let's hop
out in the Thermaltake floor and check
out these hot new products for 2013 all
right guys so here we have it we've got
the chasers right here behind us about
these new products let's go over these
products okay this is a chaser is anyone
a seller's affiliate our case you got
all the hard drive that you ever need
of course we don't mean all in five and
a quarter Bay these some people still
need time you see you have a huge space
right here for extra long performing
video cards now think about heat in the
computer system you want a good cooler
you have a lot of space to put a big
cooler around here and don't forget
about cable management you can see all
the cutout is just for your cable
management computing a pc cable
management important for applo
the top-of-the-line right this is a
top-of-the-line chase this is coming in
at 140 but they go all the way down to
99 now that we explained that one let's
take out the chaser 831 I'm gonna go
ahead and just move this out of the way
this is the meet tolerant of all chaser
831 great pictures Wow
this is very affordable case we have USB
3.0 two of them not just one but two
we got a fancy power light you can see
that that costs a lot of money to do
that now of course we don't scheme on a
reset button and we don't scheme on the
audio part now what good about his cases
you can see the color accents with blues
and you have good airflow in front and
through the back for kids of $79.99 this
is steel now you check that out we put a
big little compartment here so you can
put your coins your phone on it into one
without losing the next time
it's awesome after the price it's really
cool stuff so now let's move down folks
let's take a look at the chaser a41
go ahead and probably the side of the
case off here and let's bounce in here
so ransom what are we talking about here
and we're talking about the chaser a41
this one's 99 bucks little higher price
what are some of the great features
about this one okay so the chance at a
91 you can see the top part the case is
wider so we can't put a super huge
cooler that's a largest career from
thermal tech it's a freer
odk that's right right right
then you can see we can fit quite very
nice on an ATX motherboard then you got
four drivetrain that is like easy
removable so you don't have to screw you
don't need that again we never want to
skip on a five and a quarter bag we give
you that so this case has more airflow I
stole it different design than 831 just
show y'all prime so what about cable
management on these runs a guild
management on the back of these or they
all
well I know that you guys usually find
that I know that a lot of the people out
there don't want to see that it's always
important to them so let's go ahead and
remove this backpack oh yeah
take a look where you guys can see there
is plenty of room but he'll manage I
don't touch anything or anything out but
you guys can see plenty of room back
here and a $99 case to hide and keep all
your wires looking good in a clean bill
plenty of room right here
bring your cables through
good to go fantastic now guys we got one
more to look at its basis the same case
as this but it's in white 841 snow
edition you guys can see we got the free
Ock snow edition in here I've got one of
their newest power supplies in here
Platinum certified now this thing's just
exactly the same as that one except for
that it's the white Edition for those
people who like those bills alright so
check it out next up we have the urban
series cases these things are Street
were they have street cred so let's
start looking at right here we have the
urban s21 $70 $70 the urban is pretty
nice so Maxim what are some of the great
features about this entry-level urban
s21 well urban s21 is the case that we
meet to the basic name on a computing
what we have for you here is you can see
all the tools for the hard drive to
that's ball five and a quarter Bay you
got good cable management we have a nice
40 cm fan up there and it can feel what
it going it's all comes in water cooling
water what a 2.0 performers it's right
great water cooling system fantastic you
got a huge hole cut out just your power
supply don't get hot and finally this is
solid solid now folks let's move up and
around the table we have the urban s31
this one is $89.99 but you guys can see
right off the bat when I get the camera
to come in here and look at this thing a
lot of features on this one looks cool
looks all the way we got a removable
front panel looks like right here
the fan pewter is removable so we can
clean as many time as possible also up
here on top I see that you have a space
here to put up an SSD or a hard drive or
on top so you basically have your dock
right here I do buy a dog it cost about
$50 but instead give it to you free in
the case which is a really great value
all the controls are up here on top you
guys can see what kind of fans are
looking about right in here now so what
do we got underneath here well this one
you can't afford either a fan while you
can put it too for you is radiator for
water cooling so this I'll take a 240
widen your finger right into okay cuz
there's a company out there they could
they call themselves no noxee and they
claim that their case is the only one on
the market that can do that so you are
calling on that right kind of
all right about that well here we go
folks up on top I'm gonna bring this
around took the camera and get in there
up here on top the ability to place a
dual red you can see they have a pretty
large fan here now but this would not
even be your action with your water
cooler if you double your block down
there plenty of room inside the case
removable bays cable management looks
like it's gonna be pretty decent I see
the stuff here so I'm gonna go ahead and
lift it up and show you guys the back of
it I know how you guys are out there
after a bunch of videos alright destroys
the Thermaltake booth alright here we go
if their lawyer calls me you know I did
it for you guys the fans and I might
need to borrow some money for an
attorney
just kidding alright so check it out
here's cable management on the back it's
pretty decent it's not super extreme it
remember this case is under a hundred
dollars it's not really even in the
enthusiast level price it's in almost
entry-level price so that's that one
let's move on and keep going up the
ladder well don't forget okay says how
many windows opening so you can show
what insight your case
alright then so next up we have got the
urban s41 this one comes with markets
you guys can see at 12999 and you guys
can see it just looks like it's
basically the bigger brother or bigger
sister depending on how you want to look
at it to the case we looked at a second
ago I'm going to go ahead and pull this
up here you guys see dual USB 3.0 in the
front USB 2.0 microphone headphone you
got the whole front grill here again
which opens up you guys can see all the
bays are completely removable out of
here now this thing is really nice very
tall fit almost any component and I'm
going to spin it around right here let
you guys see the side once again up on
top we can see there already is dual on
the top with the water you can see this
is the water 3.0 very nice lots of room
inside this case also bring it through
the top sieve every move real filter
right here on top which is great because
you can wash it remove it if you live
that dusty neighborhood like I can
really come in handy we also see purple
in through all the models you can see
right here once again we see the dock on
top once again a value just inherited
into the case the frame
last but not least folks let's go ahead
and let's look at the cable management
because I know you guys like it and you
guys said you want to watch long videos
so hey we're gonna give them to you you
want long we're gonna give you long
don't say we didn't give it to you that
when someone ask you you can tell that
work gave it to you long plenty of room
back here for cable management
this is enthusiast level case you guys
can see it's built for that completely
flush no sharp parts at all very well
made lots of cable management again
remove all your cables and everything
inside and out totally good to go on
that check this out you know what is
this sound dampening devices so this
case will not only be nice it'll be nice
and quiet now last but not least in the
urban series we have the last up this is
the urban s 71 this one's up one 39.99
you guys can see that and once again
it's just growing in size we see this
one's a little bit bigger than this one
so probably gonna fit just fit the giant
size motherboard whoa SRS alright done
extended ATX so once again we see the
basic features again on the front we've
got in different places now now the 3.0
s are on the left-hand side to the
right-hand side
saying peaches bays before a little bit
more but same essential stuff filter
right here in the top removes you can
see the fans behind there
this is totally removal and then you
afterwards you can clean it however you
want to do it flip it around the side
again just to see all the bays quick
lock all the way down
removable simple to install no tools
required whatever just pop your drive in
there and go on with your day go to the
inside of the case you can see there's
plenty of room as we said before it it's
this supports the extended motherboards
once again we see a water cooler this is
a single one right here all built in one
seems tough on top again folks do you
have the removable filter all the same
things removable filter you're swinging
around here we have the bay and then
last but not least like usual let's take
a look at cable management options let's
go ahead and take the back off
now this case is a little bit different
than the other one you have a lot more
spread out to spread your cables instead
of being as wide it's actually offers
you more space so you can spread things
out you can see we have different areas
down here and here now for running your
cables through there's also here on the
side little things right here so you can
ziploc tie all of your cables down and
keep it looking totally clean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
