it's good thing I'm chilling here at my
house making the video for you guys and
what's it about today well check it out
about six weeks since I've been out of
the hospital since my foot surgery and
all the healing is going pretty good and
everything's going actually actually
pretty great as far as the healing goes
like I said before the videos have been
on a strict diet eating you know only
the proper things making sure I got the
proper medication both with my blood
pressure and everything else and
everything is really balanced out my
blood pressure's balanced out my blood
Sugar's balanced out and my foots been
healing really really well and in fact
today is the last day I think there's
one more day Friday so Monday they'll be
taking the PICC line outs and no longer
oh I have to look like a Frankenstein
you know monster thing with this thing
am i I'm working an IV up every day I
got to tell you even though I've been
doing this for like six weeks I am not
used to it at all it's still freaky to
get up you know and take this thing off
your arm and get this thing and flush it
out and then hook up this thing make
sure all the numbers riding this con
this thing mission oh there's no air
bubbles in the - look it up in your arm
you know go ahead take it out I got a
flush a couple double times make sure
everything's clean hook it back up do
you know if it's infection gotta wear
gloves you know all in all it's a crazy
thing but here check it out here is a
picture of my foot when I first had the
surgery this is right here probably a
picture about one week after the surgery
is the very first pic and you guys can
see it looks crazy it looks like just
something out of like a war movie like
my foot just got blown up on an
explosive mind it's just crazy I saw it
and I'd really just like freaked out I
was just like it honestly when I first
saw the picture it numbed me because it
looks so bad
but then here we see another picture
this is about three to two I think three
three-and-a-half to four weeks into the
healing process you can see that
starting to close up more more MORE and
getting better and better and better and
now here is a picture from just a few
days ago and you can see it's almost all
the way closed up now what they've done
now is they've had me on this meta honey
treatment so basically every other day a
nurse comes over they take my foot they
unbanned it they take all the stuff off
they scrape as much skin as they can
take off without you no make any serious
you know due to bereavement like the
doctor does and they take this meta
honey and they put the honey all over it
and the honey is crazy because it kills
the germs and everything but it also
helps the flesh to heal so it's like a
double-edged sword and it's like really
SuperDuper strong you know manuka honey
that if you tried to buy it in the store
it's like a lot of money just to buy
this stuff over the shelf and with me
it's been a great help now they did say
that they were going to do a skin graft
but then after looking at it and how
well it's healing they said I don't need
to do a skin graft and I'm honestly
really glad about that because they
would have been taking it out of my
thigh and I understand it's really
painful and that the skin never grows
back ever the same that it grows back
and it's always like a different color
than your normal skin like it's like a
like a dark kind of brown color so
that'd be kind of weird to walk another
big patch in my leg so the pain the
patch I was like mmm okay so when they
told me okay we're not going to do the
skin graft I was like yes and the really
good news is as they have said that I
should be walking by this year's CES
which is you know basically almost like
a almost a month and a week away from
now so hopefully by then I'll at least
be you know doing better maybe I don't
know if I'll be up if you know fully up
and running and running or anything but
maybe I'll at least be able to walk a
little bit better than I can and put a
shoe back on my foot and continue the
process so as long as I maintain my diet
and all that stuff that should be good
to go so I have a question for you folks
as well if you're watching this video I
love a pole - what would you rather see
a flame thrower burning up a PC or a
flame thrower burning up an iPhone so it
would be to be flamethrower versus PC or
flamethrower versus iPhone please leave
a comment down below there'll be a poll
of the video please make sure that you
guys answer it so I can know what you
guys want to see here on the channel
either way it'll be exciting we've got
this you know crazy thing from Elon Musk
with this company that he invented like
make some crazy product so it says on it
you know not a real flame though well
hey if it throws a flame and it's got a
flame to flamethrower may not be
military-grade but this stuff's do a
flame thrower my friend I'm telling you
and you'll see we make the video yeah it
burns be
be it burns so I'm al work thank you
very much I'm healing really great
thanks to very much to all those people
out there who donated and supported me
and helped me to get those medical bills
and hot past that thing so thank you
very very much I'm not completely over
the hurdle but I'm almost there so
things are getting better all the time
thank you very much for support thanks
for watching this video if you're not
