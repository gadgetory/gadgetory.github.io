nvidia is going to be releasing what i
would call their cheapest card in the
lineup this is their brand-new gtx 1650
card that's right
a 1650 featuring a Turing 117 chip it
doesn't have Turing shading inside of it
but you're not going to getting those
r-tx
you know features in a card that's you
know only 149 dollars that's right this
particular card is a hundred and forty
nine dollars we're gonna have actually a
couple of different versions in here now
the one thing weird about this though is
that even though the NDA lifted this
morning at 6:00 a.m. they only gave us
the driver for this card probably right
about now the time you're seeing the
driver I'm I'm probably you know
actually live right now going and
downloading the driver because it isn't
available till right now when we're
showing you the unboxing of the first of
the two cards that we're getting
in-house so I got this one from ZOTAC I
got another one coming in from the folks
over at a Zeus so they should be pretty
cool now not much in this box in my tour
right now so I'm just gonna go ahead and
start popping the cap because there's
really not a lot to this I'm not even
really too worried about it we'll get
some close-up shots of the card as I'm
going along after this so inside the box
all you're going to be getting is some
paperwork nomenclature it's just gonna
have stuff inside that says you know how
to install your video card here's the
warranty yada yada yada yada you guys
have all seen it before
you know what the heck I'm talking about
so nothing else in the box so let's
permeate for the box and now I won't
throw at the cameras I don't know you
want to appreciate that now this
particular card though has very very
very low power requirements so let's go
ahead and pull out of the box so you
guys are gonna see though this card is
very small I mean you can see there's a
single fan design in the front this card
has 896 CUDA cores it features four
gigabytes of gddr5 memory has a hundred
and twenty eight bit memory interface it
only takes 75 watts of power to power
the card and that's all done through the
PCI slot so there's no external you know
other power stuff on this card you guys
can see in the back no backplate nothing
else in this particular card either I
mean come on this cards entry level it's
149 dollars
can't really be expecting you know all
that much on the card some interesting
things though let me swing back around
is those that you guys can see all of
the heatsink and everything it pretty
much almost encompasses the whole card
and this card is very small as well this
card sizes in at five point nine inches
by four inches high and it features a
two slot design and it says it's showing
you the minimum of a 300 watt power
supply just you know to power this bad
boy up to so if you're looking to make
one of those little mini systems that
has a really small power supply you'll
be able to use that but here's my whole
take on these smaller entry-level cards
now I mean we know that these new Xbox
that are coming out they all do 4k for
gaming and all that stuff so beyond
watching movies in 4k are these
entry-level video cards really even
worth anything I mean because it just
seems kind of crazy cuz you're gonna get
better performance with the latest Xbox
and plotter when they release a new
PlayStation it's gonna have the same
type of thing so I really don't know too
much about that now you guys can see
rear i/o very simple single DVID single
DisplayPort single HDMI not really a
whole lot to what's going on here so
this is just the unboxing of this
particular version of the card we have
lots of more stuff going on here on teka
today regarding these products so stay
tuned because as you're watching this
video we are right now doing all the
testing and getting all the numbers for
these particular cards and we're gonna
do something different as well even
though we always test everything at
Ultra it's kind of the way we do
everything we're actually going to lower
the testing down this we're gonna test
these cards on medium because I just
figure for a hundred and forty nine
dollars nobody should be really
expecting to test at 4k with all the
bells and whistles if you're only paying
$149 you're being kind of unbelievably
ridiculous now these particular cards
will be on sale tomorrow
so as the links come out we'll be
updating them down below but stay tuned
to the channel I got lots of tests
coming we've got another unboxing coming
of the a Zeus card as well then we'll
have all the tests and we'll actually
show you some game footage in another
video letting you see how games actually
look on this and you guys can see
whether you know really is something
like this worth it or are you better
just to jump into an Xbox or Playstation
if you're gonna play games
by Miller he has been watching Tekken
tomorrow we'll see you guys back from
the channel will have more information
down below so go check out that
information and as I said as we finish
the testing and the day goes by we got
lots of more stuff to bring to you folks
so peace we'll see you back from the
channel planners</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
