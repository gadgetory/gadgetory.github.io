tomorrow where today we're gonna be
taking a look at the gigabyte F 285 X -
u P for today we'll do the unboxing and
overview so we've got it out in front of
us already you can see it's the gigabyte
the ultra durable five ultra cool ultra
efficient ultra performance high current
capability won an award at Computex best
of 2012 designed for overclocking AMD
a-series AP use and use for in water
cooled system so basically they're
saying that this board is designed to
use water-cooled systems kind of like
the Swift Tec h2 - oh the sidon by the
people over Coolermaster the thermal
take other ones that are out there now
down here they're sporting their digital
power 3d bios duel UEFI bios two times
the copper new glass fabric PCB some
little fine tips down there it says it
has humidity protection so but sweats it
won't blow up alright
spinning around take a look at the back
of the box real quick once again we see
the name cool power inside and out
single package designed here we see
different types of MOSFETs and how they
work with the traditional being hot
other one being cooler and then their
new one being the coolest which is the
ir35 five oh that's right
so so that's the outside of the box
let's jump in and let's actually see
what comes in the box so i'll set it
down over here kind of bang this thing
up and by the way folks just to let you
know this is the type of cpu that these
use the AMD series
this is there APU has both the GPU CPU
and everything else in there
accelerated little thing here so set
that off the side so right here
start off we've got the manual might has
a little crease in it right here that
hurts
ouch ouch ouch suck it off the slide
here goes the C D and D FM to FM 1
series utility DVD next up the back
plate which you guys can see is all very
clearly marked so if you need to know
where anything's at you can look at
display port HDMI USB 3 all of your
audio so let's get past that three sets
of the SATA cables the multi-lingual
installation guide book got that there
set that down now let's go on to the
motherboard itself so we bring this up
here and let's go ahead and get the bore
it out it's also a little sticker in
here that we're missing there's a little
case badge folks so now let me go ahead
and throw this whole box at the camera
sorry folks so here we have the board
and all of its plastic packaging C is
completely sealed in the back here I'm
gonna go ahead and break this on the
tape seal
let's bring the board out and let's sit
it down and let's start going over it so
since we have the rear i/o up first
let's set the board out here so the
camera can get a good shot on it and
let's talk about the rear i/o first up
we've got the legacy ps2 both keyboard
and mouse port great to have that a lot
of times you cannot access the keyboard
sometimes the very first time you put up
a system unless you have that so I
prefer to have it we have two of the
first USB 3.0 ports as far as graphical
support we have VGA DVI DisplayPort and
HDMI all on the rear i/o very impressed
with that by the way next up we have the
eSATA port that's the red port here on
the bottom two USB 2.0 ports an
additional set of the USB 3.0 ports
gigabyte lan now as far as the audio
goes we have both digital being optical
right here and then analog right here so
you have the best of both worlds
whatever you need to have starting up to
the top of the board we have our first
of the system fans system fan 2 is
located right here on top 8 pin power
connector then we're going to move over
over on the far side it's a little bit
hard to see but there's the CMOS clear
switch right here it's a little button
I'll try to bring it up closer maybe to
the camera can see that it's right here
so we got that bring it back over here
now let's talk about the zip area you
can see all of their high end caps
plenty of room actually around the ZIF
socket as you guys can see here they are
talking about they can use water coolers
and all that well there's actually
plenty of room all the way around here
for this as you guys can see now we also
see the first CPU fan it's located down
here I'm gonna spin the board around on
the side
here we can see the memory slots 24-pin
power here's the onboard power switch
you can see that right there and here's
the reset switch this little thing down
here so now let's flip the board back
actually let's take a look here because
I still find this interesting let's take
a look here and uh still says ATI so
even though you know AMD is still the
one you know with their name on the
ownership you know it still says ATI
crossfire X right there and then mix
that we see the serial ata
now as we take a look down the bottom we
can see right here these are all say two
three say two three say two three till
is right there so yeah six of those
they're all say two three next up we
have a little split board down here this
is two if you have any system errors or
anything like that now let me spin the
board around again next up let's talk
about the PCIe support so we have one
two three of the PCIe 1x we have a
single PCIe 16x PCIe 8x right here
standard PCI slot right here and down at
the bottom we have another PCIe 4x slot
all the way at the bottom down there now
also why we're down at the bottom will
try to come down here you guys can see
that right here they're all
color-coordinated we also have another
eSATA external port right here which is
also say two three another system fan
connector right here all kinds of
various connections down here including
it another USB 3.0 port so over here so
the additional chips
you can clearly see right here all the
different PCIe stuff I probably should
have held it that way when I show it to
you guys if I would have been better so
my apologies on that I'll learn so
that's how I should have actually shown
it to you guys this is what you can
clearly see PCIe one PCI to PCI 3 16 a
and 4 and your standard PCI alright
folks so there you have it the f2a 85 X
- u p4 now it's a long thing to swallow
a long name but anyways I hope you guys
liked that that's the unboxing and just
showing you this board pretty much up
close I'll be installing it in the
system and seeing how it works as well
so anyways I hope you guys like this
video if so you guys know what to do hit
that like button and show me that love
also we're coming up on 80,000
subscribers so that means I'm going to
be having another rate big giveaway so
if you're not sub make sure you sub and
tell your friends so that they don't
miss out on anything here on tech hub
tomorrow see you folks back here on the
channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
