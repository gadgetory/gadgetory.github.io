by Corsair if you are looking for a nice
set of wireless gaming headphones that

these headphones are perfect for their
price range the HS 70 headphones work
with your PC Xbox or Playstation 4 and
come to market at under $100 check them
out and see what you think ok ever since
I've been into tech Intel has pretty
much been the name synonymous with
everything that I personally have done I
have used some AMD CPUs over the years
in different projects but mainly and
especially in the very beginning when I
first started doing PC stuff Intel was
the name that I always looked upon and
back in those days I mean I'm talking
about pretty much like almost in the
very beginning of the PC stuff because
I've been doing PC stuff honestly since
like the late 80s so pretty much very
since the PCs bit introduced in the
market I've been into it and Intel has
been the name of the cpu that I mainly
used and there's been a reason for this
and the reason for that has been is that
over that time Intel has usually had the
most stable CPUs that's just been a fact
now AMD has really really upped their
game in the Flast especially in the last
year and they've closed that gap
significantly and it looks like that AMD
may even pass Intel this year completely
depending on how their marketing
strategy is and how their products are
now Intel has made a lot of mistakes
over the years you guys know that
recently there have been some personnel
changes over at Intel some people you
know getting sacked from their job over
some you know internal BS which none of
us really gives a crap about but it just
shows that there tree over there is
being shaken up now to me though beyond
the Wii
business practices the lawsuits and all
the stuff back and forth that's gone
over the years where I feel that Intel
truly truly totally screwed up is back
in the day when mobile CPUs were first
being introduced Intel pretty much did
not focus on that market
whatsoever because let's just face it if
Intel would have switched back in those
days from just worrying about desktop
processors and server processors and
would have worried about cell phone
stuff they'd be in a much much different
position than they're in right now now I
know that many people are like pissed
off and Intel because they're like oh
you know they tried to cock-block AMD
from selling their CPUs and all that
kind of stuff and you know what that to
me is just business bullcrap like bad
tactics and cutthroat tactics I've said
this before always a part of every
business I mean if you're running a
business it's kind of like running a
military unit I've said this before
you're just out to crush your
competition so I can understand why
Intel would do some shady stuff but the
thing that's really hurt them in their
pocket book has been sticking to pretty
much the same market let's just face it
CPUs have kind of froze up now it's like
it okay we're five gigahertz were there
we're not really seeing anything
advancing past that so instead of being
able to make processes really any faster
as far as the single core goes well now
we see all these multi-core CPUs CPUs
with 32 cores and I mean come on that's
just some crazy crazy crap now if that
market was different and we hadn't
already like stretched Moore's law as
thin as uber bound about to break maybe
things would be different but the mobile
market has taken off cell phone
technology cell phones everything that
has to do with that mobile market is
pretty much the mainstay these days you
know there was a time when Bill Gates
said hey you know my goal is for that
every home you know in the United States
has a computer in it and honestly I
think in the u.s. that's probably very
true I think that all
everybody out there has some type of
computer and I know there's probably a
few people who don't but even these
people who don't have computers guess
what they have cell phones right
definitely they definitely have a cell
phone program because home phones are
really a thing of the past hardly
anybody has I mean really walk into
anybody's house anymore and see a
landline I'm sure there are a few people
that do but overall it's a cell phone
world and if years ago Intel would have
jumped on that bandwagon and start
developing CPUs that were for that
particular market they would have been
in such a different position than they
are right now we see Samsung we see
Apple those two guys right now pretty
much dominate the market you don't see
too many as I know there probably is
another couple companies out there that
I'm unaware of that are competing in
that market but we know that the two big
ones are the Apple and the Samsung those
the two biggest competitors why isn't
Intel out there like honestly at this
point if you went out and you bought
yourself one of those new Google phones
a Google phone that was totally related
to everything to do with Microsoft and
stuff usually was tied in with Intel but
because Intel didn't touch that market
they've lost out on all of that cash all
of it
now AMD probably could have done the
same thing but they didn't really pay
attention to the mobile market either so
that's kind of like a downfall in both
of them but the only problem is this the
market has changed so much recently that
Intel being that they wore the top dog
for so long now has this huge Achilles
heel in their company they're only
developing stuff for PCs and for servers
obviously but guess what that market
especially here in the USA has been
saturated saturated and saturated like I
said their goal was to get everybody to
have a PC in their home and for the most
part that's true everybody I know has a
PC in their house I do know a couple of
people who live in rural places that are
just like you know they're not really
like really in touch with technology
whatsoever but like I said before II
they have cell phones so I feel it the
biggest thing that intel ever did to
cause their company and harm and to
bring them down was to not jump into the
mobile market when they had the time you
know regardless of all the other
business bullcrap regardless of the CPU
market you know hitting pretty much a
wall if they had that revenue and that
market it would make things so much
different for Intel all around so Intel
if you're watching this hey you guys
know it as well as I do when that mobile
market started booming you should have
switched tracks you should have grabbed
ahold of that thing and said hey Jolly
Roger let's hit that next track because
when you didn't do that you put yourself
in a position to faze yourself out
because let's just face it computers
right now are kind of at a wall there's
no great new technology really coming
from anything if things are just
slightly getting faster and that's
really all there is what we need now
probably is a quantum computer so Intel
make a quantum computer and then maybe
you can jump back in the game and
dominate once again so hey guys thanks
for watching the channel that's just my
two cents I hope you guys enjoyed the
video peace out enjoy the tech world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
