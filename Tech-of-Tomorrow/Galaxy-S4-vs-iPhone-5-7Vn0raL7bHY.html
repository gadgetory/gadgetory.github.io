see you guys why well because we're
teching tomorrow and we're all about
tech and without you well there be no
tech or low tech I don't know you guys
tell me I'm earth to host and today
we're going to talk about our news
articles now first off you guys all know
Tom's Hardware they have gone and broke
the dam and linked all the stuff about
has well you guys all know about as well
it's the next generation coming out from
intel corporation it's their
next-generation cpu suppose be faster
stronger better all this type of stuff
but you know i think a lot of people
though who kind of fail to understand
sometimes with Intel's mission is like I
don't even think that Intel themselves
is trying to make everything super duper
faster or super duper performing what
they're more interested in is power
consumption and heat Intel's really
right now working on their stuff to make
sure that it can take a lot less power
which you know obviously know why that
is let's see if anybody guesses a mobile
technology mobile technology requires
low voltage low power consumption so
that it can be taken around without you
know obviously running out of power and
that's really the direction that Intel
is working on right now because you know
nvidia qualcomm alright even Apple okay
you know all have their own technology
that's mobile except for intel intel has
been the king of the frakkin ring of the
cpu forever but in mobile until just
really not there so haswell's been
leaked you guys can see there'll be a
lot of stuff coming out but basically
supposedly seven percent faster that's
what's going on right now that's the
basic step next up you guys all know
that Samsung's latest entry into the
phone for a is about to get released
that's right the new galaxy s4 is coming
out baby and fall you people out there
right now if you've ever been looking
for a chance you want to suck apple in
the eye kick them in the balls you know
bitch-slap them whatever is you want to
do well now's your time to do it because
we've seen improve
that the new escort is faster actually
by at least twice as much as the i5 foam
by the Apple folks that's right so
that's pretty cool also like always once
again we're gonna have a full article on
that over on our website as well which
will show all of the scores and a full
article written by Robert Gonzales are
and how Staggies making the campaign
stuff he's a new guy so he's on there
last but not least another story
regarding phones don't dunt dunt dunt
duh the nexus 5 whoo so we won't for one
thing 5-inch screen right nexus 5 you
get a 5-inch screen 1080p that's right
now there's all kinds of us stuff that's
coming out about this phone now one
thing you guys always know traditionally
Nexus phones suck ass into areas i'm
probably mingo hell yeah so it's battery
life and shitty camera so two things are
going to be happening you're going to
get a much bigger battery and you're
going to get a camera made by Nikon
that's right so crisp um you're gonna
get a lot of cool stuff including a much
improved camera cool screen probably a
lot of the other features are going to
be just like all the other phones that
come out you know they all come out they
kind of equal each other rather than
they jump ahead by one they jump again
they jump again kind of just like Nvidia
you know does with AMD in the video of
our department same type of shiz Nick
just on them so those are all the news
stories that's what's happening folks
like usual in the link in description
below are links to all of these reviews
and scores and all the other steps if
you guys want to get more in-depth
information I know a lot of people go we
don't like to read but please we
appreciate that when you read we really
do plus it's good for you it makes your
mind thank you Interfax so anyways hope
