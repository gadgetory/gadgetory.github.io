by mass drop the PC 37 x from sennheiser
maximizes natural sound reproduction by
including high-quality drivers that are
positioned at an angle this results in
more clarity during gameplay and when
you're listening to your tunes the noise
cancelling microphone is designed for
high volume low distance recording and
it is optimized to handle unpleasant
pops and hisses and this is great for
Skype calls and video chatting the
adjustable headband is also comfortable
and secure and the extra-large plus
velvet ear pads offer a spacious fit
giving you an enjoyable experience no
matter what size your head is so get
yourself a pair today alright so those
are some pretty cool headphones right so
now let's jump in today's video welcome
to my upstairs duty war and my upstairs
to do I have the very latest iMac that
you can get from you know obviously for
map I know why you guys are one-hour
chivalric but honestly the iMac works
great for doing video editing works
great with Final Cut Pro and it works
great with logic where I do all my music
so I got it the only problem with the
computer is though is that it only comes
with 8 gigabytes of RAM minutes so real
quick let's take a look at the specs you
guys can see as the latest i7 processor
has a very nice video card but the only
lagging thing about it is 8 gigabytes of
RAM and if you try to buy the memory
through Apple when you buy your iMac
like you're literally paying like seven
or $800 for the memory it's a complete
utter total total utter ripoff so never
ever do that now I was able to contact a
friend of mine over at Corsair and get a
nice 32 gigabyte set which is actually
two of these kits so it's 2 16 gigabyte
kits 2400 megahertz which is the exact
same spec that the Mac memory is only
it's 32 gigabytes now you might be
wondering dude why do you need 32
gigabytes of RAM and I'll tell you in my
music studio when I'm running logic and
I'm doing all kinds of virtual
instruments you'll see that your memory
just gets wiped out really quick you'll
get the pinwheel of death you know them
you know a PC gets a blue
screen of death on a Mac get a little
tiny little pinwheel rolling around that
never stops so I got really tired and
frustrated trying to work with it and
every time I used a few virtual
instruments all of a sudden my memory is
used up and I have to restart my
computer also in Logic Pro I'm excuse me
in Final Cut Pro excuse me when you're
doing video editing the more memory you
have the better so having a 32 gigabyte
kit inside makes things much easier now
also installing the RAM into the iMac is
very easy if you've ever ever installed
you know memory inside of a lapse inside
of a laptop excuse me you'll have no
problem here so real quick we ran four
different tests and you'll see in
Geekbench there's not much of a
difference whatsoever but in the other
testing there is quite a bit of
difference so let's real quick
let's check out those tests with the
eight gigabytes of memory first let's
rock
so now let's go ahead and let's change
that memory out to the 32 gigabyte kit
you guys can see if you simply put your
iMac on its face you pop a little cap
off of the back the memory easily comes
out and putting new memory and is also
very easy you don't need any tools
whatsoever there's no screws there's no
nothing it's very very simple to do
and as soon as we started the computer
backup voila everything's working
perfectly with that 32 gigabytes so now
that we put the 32 gigabytes in let's
rerun those tests and let's see how much
of a difference there is and beyond
Geekbench the numbers are pretty good
let's rock once again
all right so there you have it you guys
can see that upgrade to 32 gigabytes of
memory makes a big difference from 8
gigabytes of memory and like I said
previously in the video when you're
using Final Cut Pro and you're using
logic and you're using virtual
instruments it helps to have a whole lot
of RAM it keeps your computer running
for much more or less restarts all in
all just honestly less overall
and honestly this memory is not really
that bad price compared to what you pay
if you buy the memory directly from
Apple like I said Apple charge you
literally an arm and a leg to get memory
from them this is much better priced and
the Corsair Vengeance line of memory is
actually much better memory than
actually comes in the iMac when you
first buy it you get very generic memory
when you get it from Apple but this is
actually really high quality and memory
and you guys can see that in many of the
tests the scores improve quite a lot
making the iMac run a lot better overall
making my life simpler because when I'm
editing videos or I'm doing music
recording I do not want to have to keep
restarting my computer over and over and
over again it's just a major pain in the
butt so thanks for watching guys I
appreciate it just wanted to make this a
kind of quick video so you guys could
actually see the differences between the
eight gigabyte standard and a 32
gigabyte aftermarket kit from Corsair
their vengeance so-dimm memory which fit
in here without problem so thanks for
watching Tecna tomorrow if you guys are
interested if you happen to own the iMac
or you're just looking for some memory
for your notebook the same thing that
you saw here you'll get those same kind
of results even on your PC notebook so
if you have a PC notebook PC laptop you
know even a gaming one and it runs off
sodium then you'll know that just
changing that memory out will give you a
great improvement so peace out
we'll see you guys back here in the
channel for more tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
