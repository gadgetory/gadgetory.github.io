it should be because today we're gonna
be bringing you guys three different
unboxings of the brand-new r-tx 2080
series we're gonna show you two
different 2080s and a single 2080 TI
now the 28 yeah it's what i have right
in front of me this is the founders
edition yep this is that expensive car
that's about 13 on our buck that is just
decked out with features in that sense
why it's going to be the most expensive
car that's out there at the moment
now I can't bring you guys any of the
performance numbers yet I've said it
before I've said again it's still under
NDA so when the NDA lifts on this card I
will bring all those numbers to you and
then we can really you know see what
this car does differently in the
previous generation card now there's a
lot more under the hood of this
particular car that I'd like to get into
because you know RTX you know that alone
is like is its own complete different
thing inside this card there's 78 of the
r-tx ops now how exactly these work and
everything I don't know yet
still haven't really got a briefing the
information should be available pretty
soon so we can know exactly how they
work and all that good stuff but for now
we're gonna actually bring you the
unboxing take the first look and see
well what the founders edition is really
just all about as far as the specs go so
let's jump right in you can see this
thing's brand-new it came in actually a
completely different type of sealed
package than they've come before so
before we zoom in and all that stuff
let's just go ahead and pull this
particular card out and take a look at
it so this is just the box there's
really not much to the box like any box
these boxes are really simple I mean I
could spin it around but there's nothing
on it it just says it is the r-tx 20 80
TI that's what it says that's what it is
that's what's in the box so let's go
ahead and let's pop the cap off
underneath a nice beautiful car lovely
shiny new car I gotta tell you guys man
this card is heavy yeah this is no
lightweight car just taking it right out
of the package holy moly
let's see what else comes in here I got
a little thing that pulls out right here
let's get to that really quick before we
get to the car let's just see what all
the accessories are hopefully we'll see
like an Envy link or something and
err we do see an adapter we also see two
different books for information so if
you want to check out some information
that's in there you guys can do so it's
probably just gonna be telling you like
how to install your car and basic stuff
like that which I think that most of my
viewers already know how to do so let's
get this stuff out of the way that's
pretty much all that comes in the box in
the car so one thing you guys are gonna
notice for at the bat is that the
anti-static bag even this is kind of
your relevant it's totally different
than the other any statics like I've
ever seen on the car really kind of
weird usually an ecstatic that I get to
be easier was like but there we go
you guys see also these guys have now
included a complete back plate solid
back plate all the way across the card
it's also kind of feels like a mixture
between metal and plastic that's kind of
a interesting kind of feel to it so
we'll start with the back of the car
which is something different now this
card has 4352 cuda cores underneath it
like I said it has 78 of the r-tx ups
it's 76 in the non founders edition the
base clock in this card is 1359 as a
boost of sixteen hundred and thirty-five
mega so a really nice boost clock you
guys can see there are two individual
fans and they're totally different than
the other designs that we've seen the
other blower design just had one
particular fan now we're seeing to this
card features a 352 bit memory interface
the memory speed is 14 gigabytes per
second pretty fast stuff and it's kind
of interesting that they have a 352 bit
memory interface I remember back in the
day 512 and people were complaining now
we've seen the number actually go down
and the cards are even faster the memory
balance in this card is 616 gigabytes a
second so everything on paper looks like
this is gonna be one really fast card
I'll flip it around to the side real
quick show you guys a side of the card
now it's recommend that you have a 650
watt power supply the card takes 260
Watts through its - 8 pin power
connector so that's what's you know the
gonna be the absolute minimum amount of
power that the card is gonna want to
suck up so you want to make sure a power
supply it's going to comply within that
you guys will also know that SLI is
complete
different how it's gonna be done through
what's called the envy link so it'll be
a different type of connection all the
way around you can see that it looks
totally different than the standard sli
connection and that's because it's gonna
have much much higher transfer speeds
hopefully we'll see that SLI gets new
life breathed back into it and that
these guys work with game developers to
make sure wrestle eyes on almost every
game that we can see so it makes it
worth our while to buy two cards to do
SLI another interesting thing about the
rear outputs is the color I mean if you
guys ever seen one that's colored black
before I have and it's kind of cool and
I mean it is in the back of the system
so once again it's kind of you know
irrelevant but still it's kind of
cool-looking I like it
there's also a USBC connection one HDMI
and three display ports all with the
latest technology last but not least in
the bottom the card you really can't see
anything it's really plain there's just
the PCIe and that's pretty much it
honestly you can't really see anything
inside this card which is kind of crazy
all the other cards that we're gonna be
looking at that are aftermarket you can
actually see the components underneath
there cooling apparatus but NVIDIA has
this card completely covered up which of
the design is right will actually help
contain the heat and help it all be
dissipated out with those fans and
outside the car to make sure this card
runs cool because let's just face it
being completely sealed it may have the
potential to run a little hot hopefully
it does not though if you're wondering
if this card will fit in your system
well the length of the card is 10.5
inches or two hundred sixty six point
seven four millimeters and the height
the card is 4.5 inches or 115 point 7
millimeters obviously the width of the
card it's a two slot design so it's
gonna be just like all the other cards
out there and it's gonna take up two
slots in your system make sure you have
the room all right so there you have it
man all of the unboxing and the cool
first looks of this brand new r-tx 2080
ti card obviously it's a very expensive
card lots of controversy we have to do
the full test and get the scores and see
how those scores actually balance out in
a dollar dollar two amount I mean let's
just face it if you know all the rumors
you know are untrue this card happens to
be you know just like super duper faster
than the old card and it's like so much
faster that you'd be like oh my god it's
really worth my money I'm hoping it goes
that direction I don't know for sure
stick around on the 19th I'll be able to
show you guys all the final results of
this stuff it's a really nice looking
card I really like the backplate and the
new envy link is gonna be pretty
interesting as well I have two cards so
I'll be able to bring you guys an SLI
review as well so yeah thumbs up on that
so until then though I may lurk you guys
been watching Tekken tomorrow we'll have
a link down below for more information
about this particular car if you want to
get one for yourself and that's it
cuz stay tuned we got one more card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
