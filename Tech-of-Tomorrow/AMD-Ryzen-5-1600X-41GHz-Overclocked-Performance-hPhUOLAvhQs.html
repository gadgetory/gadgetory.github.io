welcome back once again to tech of
tomorrow where today we're going to
bring you the overclocking results of
the 1600 X in our producer system if you
guys have missed the video on that we'll
have a link down below now we did all of
our overclocking strictly with soft
white and messing around the BIOS
whatsoever we installed AMD's Rison
master software suite this is pretty
much an easy to use tool you just click
on it once it's installed it shows you
everything clearly laid out how to
change your clock speed you can change
it from whatever you want to how to
change your voltage all these different
things so what we did is we used our
system it has a liquid cooler in it has
nice memory and a pretty nice system now
we didn't use the be 350 chipset no not
at all we use the X 370 that's what
we're doing all of our testing on
currently we figured hey what the hell
is going to get better overclocking
results I don't really think the be 350
is met really for super overclocking
it's more of like you know consumer
level product but this board that we're
using obviously it's meant for
overclocking so we tried a bunch of
different settings a bunch of different
things trying to get to run and the
maximum overclock that I was able to get
using the software was 4.1 gigahertz now
3.6 gigahertz is the base clock number
on this CPU but we were able to get 500
megahertz of an overclock without any
problems whatsoever now when I tried to
push this up to a higher number even
just a 4.2 no matter what I did if I
change the voltage lower the voltage
messed around that every time we try to
run any test the system just crashed so
that was it but the good news is let's
real quick
and let's check out the performance
differences between the standard clock
speed and the overclock speed I think
you'll be pretty impressed let's rock
and one thing I think you guys are
definitely going to love it's even with
this overclocking there was only a one
degree difference in the temperature
that's right I said if one
degree which is in Jack crappin but you
know the world of overclocking so
there's actually probably if I can get
some crazy like nitrogen or something in
here to do it which I'm just not going
to do because I don't think you guys at
home or playing games want to sit there
and mess with pouring liquid nitrogen
while you're trying to get that headshot
the same time they can be pretty fricken
her useless so do you think that's a
good thing to do you can let me know but
I think most people are going to go with
a good liquid cooling system and get
what they want out of it so you guys can
see though that we're able to get better
scores though all the way across the
board just with this 500 megahertz
overclock pretty cool 5 frames per
second more in some games which is
pretty damn cool I mean that's almost
like getting into the video card so
usually we buy video cards you get 10
frames per second to the next model so
if you had an RX 480 you know you're
probably going to be getting it'll say
30 frames per second if you had maybe
say like something like a 580 we'll just
we'll just propose up there you know
maybe you get like 10 more frames per
second on that and the same thing with
you in the 470 be ten frames less so
overall I have to say these overclocking
results I think are pretty cool because
as far as gaming goes the 1600 X is a
really nice CPU it really really is I
mean the price is about $250 it's not
you know quite as cheap as some of the
i5 s out there but it's still it's a
really good solid CPU there are some i-5
is a little cheaper but then whatever
that's a whole other day a different
video but you guys can see these
overclocking results I think are pretty
good and the best thing about it is that
anybody out there who gets their system
as a decent liquid cooler can get these
results a lot of having to hassle too
much stuff I mean it was really pretty
much just you know turning the numbers
up trying different voltages until it
became stable running the tests and
doing everything now at the 4.1
gigahertz which you know that's pretty
cool it's 500 megahertz but overclock
the scores are pretty damn cool no
additional temperature whatsoever and
you're getting scores Gaming scores
almost up to what you're seeing in a
1700 and 1800 X for a much cheaper CPU
so if you're a gamer out there and you
just want to get you so we bit more
performance
you know out of your CPU and be able to
kick ass what 4.1 for my particular CPU
that was a sweet spot using the system
that we have in the liquid cooler that
we used now you guys out there I know
different people have stuff do you guys
want to leave a comment down below and
show what your overclocking results were
I'd love to see them with sure everybody
else would so let's make it some fun
stuff though I'm Network you guys been
watching Tekken amaro you guys can see
the 1600 X overclocks quite well very
very simply honestly anybody can do it
and I think the results speak for
themselves so you guys want more
information we'll have a link down below
to our previous videos and more
information about the CPU if you're in
debt we'll see you guys back in the
channel if you're not subbed you know
what to do and if you're not getting
notifications what the hell turn them on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
