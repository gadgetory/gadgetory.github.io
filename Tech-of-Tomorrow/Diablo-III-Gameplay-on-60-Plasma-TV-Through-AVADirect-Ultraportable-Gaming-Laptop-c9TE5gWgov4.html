once again I take a more to youtube
channel now you guys have asked for it
and so we're bringing it to you now this
isn't per se the full review at all for
the new a VA cleveo 11 inch ultra
portable laptop but this is a gameplay
video now Diablo 3 is really popular out
there and so what I've done is I've
created two movies one of them showing
live gameplay and you guys can see that
we have this hooked up directly through
my 60-inch Plasma TV I've got the little
laptop sitting right there in front of
the TV plugged in the HDMI cable away we
go now here on the screen you can see
I've got everything set to its highest
setting
I've got fraps running over in the left
hand corner and with that said let's
actually hop in and let's see the first
some live gameplay then after that I'll
show you guys a frat video as I battle
the Lord of despair which I actually did
earlier today but for now let's hop in
and let's check out some gameplay you
guys can see this is pretty damn fun to
play and this game really plays very
very well on this laptop I mean it plays
really excellent no problems at all and
because of the hybrid laptop you can see
that all the large textures are loading
no problems at all I'm not seeing any
jump whatsoever usually if you're using
in a good computer with a standard hard
drive you'll see a lot of problems
loading the textures with this hybrid
drive inside of here we're getting none
of those problems whatsoever just rock
and roll in game play see who else we
got to kill in here some good live
gameplay here showing it got a big old
creature right here
right on I just want a new banner reward
good just kill these little baddies off
right here because I just wanted to show
you guys how it worked but for a little
portable laptop this thing's really
kicking ass and I like to be able to
just put it on my 60-inch Plasma and go
go go alright everybody so that was part
1 live gameplay of Diablo 3 on the AV a
direct cleveo ultra portable 11 inch
notebook
now we're gonna jump in and actually
show you the fraps video record where I
kill the boss who's wants to take away
all of our oh let's jump in let's check
this shit out I'm gonna go back and
place more Diablo 3 see ya
into the Silver's alright guys I hope
you liked this video it was a two-part
video part of live gameplay and then the
frats video so you guys had the best of
both worlds remember that all this
gameplay was played on my a-v a direct
quick ship a little tiny 11-inch cleveo
ultra portable laptop now that's really
cool because this thing can be taken out
you can play games wherever you want for
about three and a half four hours but
when you get back home if you don't
another computer you guys can plainly
see that you can just hook it right up
into your big-screen TV hook up a
wireless mouse and keyboard and you're
off and going and playing games wherever
so I'll see you folks later take it easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
