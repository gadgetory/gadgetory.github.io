tyrunt echo to mourn why are we here
today we'll check this out you guys are
always asking for system build after
system build so this time we've got a
really killer one for you it's the
Weapon X that's right the Weapon X
system and it's $1,000 mini PC build
that's really cool features a nice
corsair case this thing's totally
portable you can take it on the road
with you anywhere and it's very
cool-looking as well as being pretty
simplistic in its overall design so with
that said let's first check out the
parts list check out the scores and then
talk about the system at the end and see
hey what do you guys think and what do
we think and by the way we didn't really
build this to be some competitive thing
a friend of ours came to us and si said
hey man I want to build a system I have
a thousand bucks and I want to be
complete didn't need a monitor obviously
so actually the OS in clear as well in
this build and he wants some that'd be
portable so this is a system that we
came up with I'm sure there's many
people out there who's gonna say oh yeah
you know I could dig around for six
months and I can dig around PC parts and
I could find a little better system
that's all fine and well we didn't do
that this was pretty much for fun we had
a system for a friend we know you guys
like the C system so hey this is it the
Weapon X is born let's check that
out
so externally you guys can see this
thing looks really nice man the Corsair
graphite series 3d T is a really nice
case it's painted white and so it's
gonna go with many many things I
personally think it looks really killer
and the real iconic help the Weapon X is
from the very front you guys can see
that the fan kind of looks like you know
that kind of little design
yeah I'm not exactly but it's still cool
and plus all the controls in this are
very easy to operate you got some seeds
like riding the front there are two USB
3.0 ports and you're on Twitch and all
that stuff is all based right on the
front of that Corsair okay so it's
really nice and easy to get to and on
the rear i/o you guys can see it's nice
and fleshed out from the motherboard and
by the way the motherboard is the
gigabyte Intel H 81 Mini ITX motherboard
this thing's really cool and for the CPU
we're using the Intel Core i5 45 nine
you know this CPU is not even really
geared towards overclocking whatsoever
we didn't really plan on overclocking
our thing was really
keep it as quiet and silent as possible
and we succeeded in doing that now for
the memory we used eight gigabytes of
the Crucial Ballistix sport for the boot
distance storage we have a SanDisk Ultra
- this is a 480 gigabyte SSD the video
card is some people over at PNY really
good come if you guys don't know P&amp;amp;Y
they make good stuff at a basic price
it's usually also spaced off reference
model stuff but they keep it solid we
have a great warranty now this card
today is the PNY geforce gtx 960 2
gigabyte accelerate elite overclocked
card now this thing's made for gaming
and for those people are doing 1080p
it's a really solid card now powering
all this is the n1 green me 650 watt
power supply and I don't know if this
particular ones in stock that if not at
the end we'll give you guys a link to
something different and powering the
entire system we're using Windows 10
home now this is a $96 software pretty
good they kept the budget within $1,000
but with all that said that's the system
you guys can see it looks really good
now let's check out the scores and let's
see how it performs
all right folks so there you have it the
Weapon X and like I said from the very
beginning we did this entire build for a
friend of ours and it was for fun but I
gotta say this system looks really cool
it's simplistic its elegant and it's
totally portable you can take a wherever
you want and game on the go we're not
quite on the Gogan list you know like
you know get a power supply in your back
that runs all the juice for the power
supply and a monitor in front of your
face which would be kind of killer
remember those old guys in the old days
you stuff like a portable band a one-man
band you could be like a one man walking
PC you know and as you walk it powers
your little charger no I'm just kidding
but you guys think the scores are pretty
decent for the system like I said it's
like a thousand dollars that's including
the OS Windows 10 so all in all it's a
pretty decent system it runs very quiet
it runs cool it's efficient and for
somebody who wants some that they can
take totally on the road it's really
really cool so please spare me the
comments down below or I could have went
to somewhere and built a cheaper system
okay I give you credit you know really
Harper maybe you could hats off
but that's not we were trying to shoot
for you guys always want to see systems
we built the system for a friend of ours
it's a system Hey so we brought to your
ticket tomorrow we'll see you guys back
here for more tech because blue fury
system kind of lagging is having a
little bit of issues because there was a
whole bunch of different things I was
trying to do inside of the new Windows
10 and I wasn't really getting all the
results I wanted because well for one
thing there's no DirectX roll 12 out yet
and so I was hoping that more games that
show up but that's a whole nother
frickin ball of wax so anyways like
usual every single one of these parts
will be listed down below so if you do
think the system's really cool you can
recreate this for yourself and by the
way there will be an alternate link for
the power supply because the particular
power supply that we use in this build I
don't think is available at the moment
for some reason they're out of stock
under they're not doing something with
it so we'll have a link to an alternate
one down there or you could choose one
for yourself because I'll be - the power
supply anyone will work as long as it's
got the right power requirement so peace
out I'm Alaric this is buddy the dog the
mascot we love you guys hope to see you
guys sub here and we'll see you back
here for more videos peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
