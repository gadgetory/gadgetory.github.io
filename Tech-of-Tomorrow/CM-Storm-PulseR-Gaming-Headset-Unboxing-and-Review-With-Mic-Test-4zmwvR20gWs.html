tomorrow now normally my share the
videos on this channel are focused just
on talking about games themselves but
today we're gonna do something a little
bit different and talk about accessories
and we're gonna do a review of this the
CM Storm Pulsar gaming headset from
Coolermaster now normally this retails
for $89.99 but you can find on Amazon
right now for about 83 bucks we're gonna
walk you through a little unboxing of it
talk about some of its features sound
quality and form factor and let you know
whether or not it's worth your dollar in
today's competitive gaming headset
market so let's check them out
so here we've got the headsets still all
boxed up let's just go ahead and rip off
this plastic covering it so you can more
clearly see the box details now on the
front we get a little stylized picture
of it's showing lighting effects coming
off of the headset with the full name
the pulsar aluminum gaming headset with
a few of the main features being listed
on the side of the box we have a listing
of all the specifications for the
headphones mic and inline controls and
on the back we have a full picture of
the headset pointing out some of the key
features such as the detachable mic and
the customizable plates which we'll talk
about later sliding this cover off you
can see that this just a plain simple
black box we lift this lid right here
and bam there's our headset with the mic
first off as you can clearly see the mic
is a detachable design to help make the
whole headset way more portable and then
we have the actual headphones themselves
with this sleek yet sturdy black and
aluminum design also inside the box we
have a little QuickStart guide for the
headset and a nine-foot cable for
hooking it up to your computer so enough
with the unboxing let's talk about how
this thing performs and what kind of
features it has to offer now to begin
with this is an illuminated headset
which means that while it's plugged into
your computer not only can check your
friends or yell at people over the
internet but while you're doing so
you're gonna have white LED lights
coming out of the side of your head from
the crevice between the actual headphone
and the aluminum plate on the side which
is cool because there's not that many
eliminated headsets on the market just
yet
now speaking of these aluminum plates on
the side this is actually one of the
more unique features of this headset is
that these are actually designed to be
very easily removable and reattach Bowl
meaning you can take them off and
customize them how you see fit you could
spray pay them a different color at a
decal or a symbol of some sort and make
the headset all the more your own now
this is a wired headset so it does need
to be plugged into your computer at all
times though it's not that big of a deal
because it does come with a three meter
cable which is almost 10 feet in length
that's way more than enough if you're
using it at your desk and it's still
plenty for trying to have some kind of
living room set up now don't let the USB
cable at the end fool you this is not a
USB headset
you only need to use the audio and mic
jacks for it to properly work on your
computer the USB plugin is only required
to power the lights for the headset now
on the cable we do have some inline
controls just the basic pairing of what
you need an on/off switch for the
microphone and volume controls as well
now speaking of the mic as we said
earlier it is detachable the wallets
plugged in it's very secure it's not
gonna wiggle around a lot it's not gonna
move long while you have attached the
headset so you can move your head around
worrying about the mic getting out of
place you can still make sure to place
it where you want thanks to its flexible
and bendable design now as for a form
factor it's a really solid design it's a
bit plain looking at first for my taste
but once you have the white LEDs on it
really brings it to life and the lights
are at just the right brightness they're
not blinding but they're not subdued
either and if you're not a fan of the
aluminum design then great just go ahead
and attach the plates like we said
earlier and change the color as you see
fit either way the aesthetic ends up
working out really well
now of course looks alone aren't
everything of course one of the biggest
factors that most people care about with
headsets is of course comfort and this
one handles it really well the headband
is of course adjustable like most
headset designs so you can have it fit
your head while the cushions on the top
and ear cups are very soft so you can
use them for extensive gameplay periods
but firm enough to hold up over time I
was able to wear this headset for
several hours before experiencing any
kind of major ear pain or discomfort so
it definitely passes the comfort
category with flying colors now all
these things aside the one big important
question is of course how does it
perform sound wise now to be clear this
is a gaming headset strictly balanced
for gaming meaning there's a very heavy
emphasis on bass and highs for things
like explosions gunshots things breaking
or shattering basically all loud sound
effects there's nothing stopping you
from listening to music or watching
movies with these it's just that there's
better headsets out there that are
balanced for that kind of thing
though these might work for the
occasional action flick that's Michael
Bay style where there's more explosions
than dialogue gaming wise though this
headset sounds really good a lot of
different explosions the sound effects
can go off at once and still cleanly
come through all together the only thing
that ever ends up getting subdued or
drowned out by other sounds is in-game
character dialogue and only what it's
trying to compete with those other
things at the same time now as for how
the microphone sounds we're gonna let
you guys hear that firsthand now as you
can see here I'm wearing the headset and
the audio you're hearing right now isn't
being recorded by our usual mic setup
but actually by the headset mic itself
hooked up to our little Sony recorder
right here now this is a noise
cancelling microphone so it's gonna do
its best to drown out any kind of noise
in the background that is a too loud or
too sharp that way your voice comes
through cleanly during game chat so as
the pulse our gaming headset one of the
best headsets out there not particularly
is it a good headset for its price point
definitely especially if you're in the
market for getting an illuminated
headset without breaking triple digits
on the downside it is wired although you
do have an almost 10-foot length cord to
work with
and it's not surround sound but it's
comfortable customizable and offers good
quality sound for gaming well that was
