once again on TECA tomorrow taking a
look at one of the most fun products
I've ever played with in my life and I'm
serious
out of all the toys I think I've had my
whole life even though this thing's
leather expensive toy the x4 fpv drone
to me is the absolute when it comes
to total fun in a package now this thing
can be used from small children all the
way up to adult children which is what I
am an adult child pretty much and it's
just a hell of a lot of fun great
controls great controller all kinds of
cool stuff all kinds of cool modes but
that said though let's first take a trip
to my front yard as we learn to use the
x4 in the first couple of shots and we
had a you know a little bit of fun right
here and that was okay but what was
really fun though is when we took this
thing down to the park now but Before we
jump on down to the park let's check out
the x4 and it's controller up close now
the version of the x4 that we got you
guys can see it's black and gold it
pretty much came all the way put
together other than the propellers it
came the tool to put those on but after
that hey she's pretty much up and ready
to go one thing different about it the
reason I think they call it the fpv is
the first-person view is the cameras
mounted straight ahead if you guys have
seen other drones out there a lot of
those have a camera that points
downwards or they do modifications and
do it that way this one's not made that
way at all but it's actually really cool
for like doing your own drone selfie
now one thing a little bit weird about
the x4 is that it doesn't have an on/off
switch what it does have though is two
blue connections one is it going to the
drone the other is going to the battery
you put those two together close it up
and hey she's up and ready to go on the
bottom you can see there are four feet
these all light up individually in
different colors and when you're using
the drone to do its balancing and all
that different stuff you'll see they
like different colors in that process
honestly the drone kind of looks like an
attack weapon or some futuristic movie
like you know terminator another
controller it's actually one of the
better ones that I've ever seen from the
drones that I have had I haven't had any
$1,400 $1,500 ones I'm sure they have
any more badass stuff but the ones that
I've seen a few hundred dollar range
were not this dynamic taking a look at
the controller you guys can see that
first off there are two antennas for
controlling and operating the drone then
we have two useless buttons the t1 and
the t2 buttons on this particular model
do absolutely nothing so we can
completely ignore them there are also
four switches on top the first of these
switches is the a switch now this is
called headless mode this allows you to
fly the drone wherever you want to go
whatever you want to do it's pretty much
open territory now next up is the GPS
switch what this does when you first
start the drone you turn the switch on
and it locks in your location making
sure the drone knows exactly where
you're at now in the center of all the
switches is the screen for monitoring
and knowing actually where you're going
with the drone I found it a bit hard to
see in the daylight they do give you a
cover that kind of makes it a little bit
better but I think glasses for me is
going to be the optimal way to control
the drone next up we have the home
switch what you do is obviously what it
says you switch this switch on and no
matter where your drone is if you've
done that GPS locater thing the drone is
going to come back to you and this is
actually a really really excellent and
awesome feature I think in my book and
then last up we have selector switch B
and this is the follow me mode and what
it does wherever the controller goes
after you set this it will follow you
around like a puppy dog the first
joystick on the left hand side is
considered the elevator stick this
allows the drone to go up and down and
turn right or left
and the right-hand joystick is for Ford
left and right and for tilt down below
that we see a button the left that says
exit and a button on the right that says
enter the button on the left is for
taking a photo the button on the right
is for filming video and then down below
that you see the on and off switch and
then the various trim switches for when
you're using your drone so we finally
got the x4 down to the park by the
college and you guys can see there's
plenty of room out here for flying and
we had a lot of fun using this now
admittedly this thing is pretty powerful
and you guys can see through all the
pictures of the 1080 camera takes really
nice crisp pictures maybe not like the
absolute best camera you can get on the
market but definitely not a piece of
junk either because you guys can see
everything looks really nice now we had
a lot of fun doing the different testing
I actually kind of right here you guys
can see with you know they call this
thing like buzzing the tower
well I buzzed my mom you guys can see I
went right by her head she said she
actually felt the drone I can't hurt her
so I came really close so that was
pretty crazy
we flew all around the park learning how
to fly this thing today and it was just
a hell of a lot of fun and this drone is
crazy we were able to take it way way
way and I do mean way the frak up into
the sky and bring it all the way back
down and then crazily I started playing
with the drum I felt like I was losing
control because I got so far away I
couldn't even see it we were like box
away and then we engaged they come on
home button and the drone came all the
way back home and then landed on the
ground right in front of us which is
just totally a cool feature I mean when
you're out flying your drone on
something that costs this amount of
money you don't want to lose it you want
to make sure that you have this thing
with you at all times and you don't want
it you know but you don't want to lose
it period it means something I actually
felt scared a couple times because I
couldn't see the drone I started to
freak out but juice as I came in just
hit umm button and I admittedly I was a
little bit worried about that too but
you guys can see it comes home
absolutely no problem whatsoever
one of the funniest parts of the day
though I thought was when Jesus was
flying the drone by me and I felt like I
was going to have a little fight with
the drone so I started like throwing
some kicks the drone some punches at the
drone even gave the drone the middle
finger that's right I gave the drone the
bird baby there are a lot of other
people that were like inside of the park
so we kind of had a little be a little
bit conscientious about them we even saw
a cop pull into the parking lot we were
gonna buzz him but we thought well maybe
he not might not like that very much
um controlling the drone admittedly at
first it's a little bit of a learning
curve but out of the ones that I've
tried so far I have to say the controls
are pretty much intuitive the only
problem I can see is that if you can't
see the control screen the bright side
and it gets a long ways away it does get
a little bit confusing I'm trying to see
exactly where the drone is going so
having that home button once again just
becomes an awesome feature for the drone
now the follow me feature we weren't
really able to get that to work all that
well I don't know what was going on
maybe it's just because just some fluke
or something I know I know it works
because obviously everything else was
working but all the other features that
were coming home the camera taking
pictures and it's just a lot of fun
although I'm not actually totally sure
of how high or how far the x4 will go
we took it so far high into the sky that
I couldn't see it anymore and then once
again like I told you I was getting
nervous we had taken the drone about
three blocks away from us and we
couldn't even see the drone anymore and
we were still able to get that drone
back to us so that in itself was
something to say
okay so I don't even know where to
frickin start man but you guys can see
all I can say but the x4 fpv is that
this thing is frakkin fun fun fun fun
fun fun fun fun fun fun and at the end
of the day honestly I think that's what
matters now should a little kid who's 12
years old probably go out and have this
thing without his parents I don't know
because you might hit somebody's car
somebody's window or do something
accidentally that could cause damage to
either your drone to their vehicle so I
might suggest if you're a little bit
younger you might want to take your
parents let's just one of those badass
rebellious kids you just want to have a
hell a lot of fun with nobody around
then it go for it I would but I
mean I value the products and I get and
the way I buy my products on volume is
if I buy something and it's cool and it
sits on a shelf how much fun you're
really getting out of that this is
honestly a lot of fun
hours and hours of fun the learning
curve wasn't that hard
we had the drone up in the air for quite
a long time it was about 45 minutes I
think that we were up in the air and the
battery still hadn't died by the way it
does take eight batteries in the back
that's that but you know like I said
they say it's only in the sky for about
20 minutes we were at 45 x4 was still up
and going by that time I pretty much
learned to fly the drone pretty much
like I said we flew it high into the sky
we flew it down the road and it easily
came back to us and you know losing your
drone is pretty much like right here the
most thing that people worry about so
with the x4 you really don't have to
worry about it if you do everything
correctly set up your GPS you know the
exports coming right back and landing at
your feet and that's just badass and
let's just face it being in the park
flying your drone around chasing your
mom chasing the dog you know chasing
people come on it's fun like usually
we'll have a link down but like but if
you want to get one of these for
yourself or check stuff out and I'm sure
we'll have some links in the next couple
days for Black Friday deals so you can
get this thing even cheaper I Miller
you've been watching teka tomorrow back
to the park</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
