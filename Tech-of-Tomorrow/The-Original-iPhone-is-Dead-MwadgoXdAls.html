youtubers now it's probably a fact that
most people haven't cared about AT&amp;amp;T 2g
network and probably quite a long time
although for some people out there who
actually have that og iphone things are
about to get them well for you yeah
you're not going to have any access to
this anymore why that's right a TEENs he
says they are getting rid of all
coverage on their 2g network so it will
be gone and by a by so what that means
that means if you are one of those
people out there who's been holding on
to your og iphone for dear life and just
for some fracking reason you don't want
to upgrade well Europe great choice has
now been made for you because if you
want to keep having 18t you are now
going to have to get yourself a new
updated phone now for the other carriers
some of them will have until 2020 others
still 2019 but pretty much the 2g thing
is going out the window of the past so
which means that eventually all you
people out there have been holding on to
your GI phone and you don't want to
update well you're going to have to
update and if you own one now and you're
on AT&amp;amp;T get ready to buy a new phone now
while we're talking about phones will
know the past few years we've seen some
crazy things with phones overheating the
note return burning up phones phones on
fire we've seen all kinds of crazy
stuff and we've also seen phone just
keep getting thinner and thinner and
thinner the bend gate things there with
the skinny jeans but your pocket well
now LG is doing something a little bit
different do you guys follow the chal
you know there's many videos of the cars
that have come out and these video cards
don't have a fan they are completely
banned lyst cooled card they use heat
pipes and stuff to cool off the card
well now LG and their new g6 is going to
be incorporating this into their phone
now they're doing rigorous testing right
now to see how this stuff is actually
going to work but it should work very
well now obvious the cavity this is
going to be you're probably not kind of
a phone that's going to fit or you know
right in the back pocket and stick tight
to your ass because then chromatus your
phone might have to be a little bit
bigger but let's face it I mean
personally I'd rather know that my phone
is going to run a long time no problems
with that whatsoever no burn ups and run
cooler that's just me let me see
what you guys think I want to hear you
guys opinions down below do you guys
think its own should just keep being
like completely skinny jean type phones
or do you think the phone should be
geared so that they run their absolute
totally cool let me know by the way if
you're wondering where we're filming
where you guys know follow channel we
moved and so we're finally getting my
gaming room together I've got a freaking
awesome system back here which is the
absolute best thing in it you guys will
see that soon the room we get all our
pictures and we'll talk about that but
today's about news now for you guys out
there who are totally into systems and
into your living room systems asus is
now going to have a system for 799 that
will actually fit right inside your
living room just like another component
it's totally via already it's going to
have a great video card all kinds of
stuff and they actually have two
different versions of this if they're
going to have out they have this version
which is a 79 and if you want those uber
crazy guys who wants even more expensive
system and don't care about it fitting
in your living room they have an
alternate version so asia has got some
coupling proxy announce these at CES but
they'll be available soon sir for your
into asus and you like this type of
stuff this will be good news for you and
last but not least in today's news for
you fans out there who love resident
evil resident evil 7 is about to hit the
shelf so it's going to be really great
this time around is that not only will
it plan your PC it will also play on
your xbox for the same price and what's
best yet if this game is now going to be
completely VR now so far the VR games
I've played I thought they were you know
okay but honestly resident evil with all
the crazy spirits the spooky music the
direct grim you know in VR might freak
your back out because let's just
face it if you have a game that immerses
you in that type of environment it's
really fun it'll be much cooler than
just playing things two things that look
like kitty graphics playing around there
just because they look 3d I mean this I
don't know me personally I'm into that
it seems like you my fans really aren't
either because we doesn't be our stuff
most the time you guys just like yeah
okay brt they're too expensive not
powerful enough and I admit that be are
pretty much is in its infancy right now
I don't truly enjoy VR that much Jesus
he was able to play for hours on him for
summary
that made me feel like throwing up
I played a few of those games and I
literally had a headache but actually
the worst you know what I mean headache
I've ever had in my entire life playing
the VR stuff but I'm sure in the future
as they gear it up they fix the games
they fix the graphics the resolution the
refresh rate everything so it's more
natural with you know me interacting
with it I'll like it more and i'm going
to admit i'm going to try out resident
evil 7 as soon as that hit to the
shelf i'm going to buy it we just got
another set of VR headphones in here
from gearbest there are actually much
lower price than the other one I think
they're actually under four hundred
dollars so if they work as well as other
ones that'll be a great benefit we'll
check that out later but there you guys
have it ma'am if you own an OG Apple
