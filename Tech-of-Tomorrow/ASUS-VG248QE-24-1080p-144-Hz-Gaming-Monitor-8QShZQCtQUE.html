suite continuing to look at their
products now we're going to be looking
at one of their latest VG series
monitors now these things have all the
great features that some of their other
monitors have with some things taken off
to make them very affordable for you the
end user to buy so JJ tell us what are
these things and why are the end users
wouldn't want to buy these things click
well our VG series have actually been
really popular because they've had super
high refresh rate low response time and
also had that added benefit of having 3d
vision but some users have actually just
wanted the high refresh rate and low
response you know they appreciate the 3d
vision support but maybe they didn't
want to buy a monitor that already came
equipped with that if they just wanted
that super high refresh rate for the
reduced input lag and the low response
time so this monitor is going to be
hundred percent 3d vision ready so if
they want to go out and buy the 3d
vision kit they can but it's the world's
first hundred forty-four Hertz with one
millisecond response LED backlit it's
going to be an awesome gaming panel for
users that are just looking for the best
of the performance best fluidity but in
addition to that we've added a couple of
new features in our game plus technology
so you actually see two of these right
here on the screen so one of them is
actually we had an integrated crosshair
reticle system so for gamers that are
playing in 3d sometimes they stayed hey
when I'm looking at the crosshair the
reticle it's hard to see so we'll have 4
different crosshair options you can go
and select and play some in different
parts of the screen to go ahead and aim
a 8 and aiming and these things are
actually a part of the monitor rise
practice so if you're playing your game
now and you go in and you're doing it
you'll no longer have to strain to see
what you're shooting at this is actually
hardware based in the monitor so we'll
make it very clear for your targeting
which will improve your gameplay by
quite a bit yeah really targeted towards
the 3d gamer another option is you see
here we actually have a blinking cursor
tiger on and that's actually because we
have a timer function so we'll blow up
and kill us when it goes to zero know
this I'm going to run now now so you can
see I actually have different timer
options this is really great for guys
that are doing like wow
League of Legends stuff that where you
have actually count down considerations
or maybe you need to go back and check
back on a build maybe have you know a
different spawn point considerations
things like that so even cooking stuff
right show me could you really brilliant
if you were going to bake your food the
oven you can come and do anything your
time around here and go back when your
movies are done maybe I'll put a judge
or no in the oven man except I'm gaming
I don't want to forget about it dude hit
thirty minutes I'm going to come back to
it I'll remember it's better than
smelling the burnt pizza smell a hundred
percent so these are going to be an
awesome new set of panel that is coming
out at the end of the month two hundred
eighty bucks as other projected price
points now will there be multiple sizes
on this or is strictly coming out of the
24 24 inch we're going to be targeting
alright then so you guys have it new
monitors coming out very affordable if
you guys out there have never used a
monitor with this type of refresh rate
trust me you're going to be frakkin
blown I had my monitor really for a
month before JJ come into the video he's
like hey did you dumbasses even click
and enable 120 and we kind of all looked
each other were like no and once we
clicked it unbelievable when I'm writing
reviews and everything the text and
everything is so clear I never get any
eye strain whatsoever if you get a
chance go out and try one these monitors
out in public I guarantee you you will
be impressed so if that's it we'll see
you guys back here for another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
