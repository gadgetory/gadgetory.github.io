deal brought to you by tech of tomorrow
this week by the original Crysis Crysis
warhead and Crysis Wars all for under
$10 that's right $8.99 for all three
games check out the description to blow
where you can see where to buy this
awesome new deal
hey how're you guys doing out there our
care once again on the tech of tomorrow
YouTube Challenger bring you guys
another yet cool unboxing of something
from the folks over at AMD I know you
guys always like that stuff today we're
going to show you guys the new
water-cooled fx-8150 processor now this
is their new Allsop Indus eight core
processor that includes an aztec water
cooler in the box
so it's kind of like the intel version
that you guys have saw my Intel platform
only this is the top of the line for the
AMD guys so I got my trusty knife I
flicked that bad boy out you guys can
see I got this little thing underneath
my arm and we'll go ahead and let's jump
over the box and start unboxing this
little bitch alright folks so like usual
every good unboxing starts with the box
and a trusty little knife to open that
little bitch so check it out AMD FX 8
core processor Black Edition you guys
should all know what this is has been
out for quite a long time really the
only difference about this one is that
it comes with an a stick water core now
here on the side I get the camera to
zoom in closer up there you can see it
says overclocked and don't overheat
liquid CPU cooling system all that good
stuff
it says cooled by a stick a stick is
tech however you want to pronounce it
different folks different strokes show
you guys the back fx-8150 3.8 gigahertz
socket am3 let's open it up though let's
see what actually comes in it so I'm
gonna take a nice trusty incision right
here don't try this at home I am a
doctor take the top off you see it's got
a nice little package here to slide out
so we're going to slide it out of the
package then we're going to take the box
and we're gonna throw it at the camera
man who even caught that thing you
feeling pretty good not bad at all then
we have the ACE tech installation
overview an FX 8-core processor black
edition with liquid CPU system chill
control version 1.3 software maybe
there's an instruction guide I'm not
exactly sure what that it I don't think
is any drivers that go with the CPU that
would be interesting but here's all the
instruction stuff on how to install it
get the cameraman to show you guys that
see the second part of it very clear
very simple instructions it's so easy a
caveman can do it if you look inside the
box all right starting off we have two
fans so he opens other fan box up here
coupling one fan this is an ever flow
little fan I'll get this up close to the
Cameron so we can zoom in and show you
guys that we've got two of those bad
boys one for obviously each side of the
radiator coupling couple am we've got
the Watts had a cool air seen these in a
lot of systems now a lot of you guys
that they're gonna make a bunch of
claims I know closed loops so it's
closed loop slugs and well it doesn't
really suck that bad because obviously
everybody in the Brotherhood's making
them so water cooling is getting more
and more prevalent as the days go by
here's a radiator show that up close to
you guys let's flip it around show you
guys this the top of the block so to
speak flip it around you see the bottom
it's got a little plastic cover
underneath there pop that around
mounting hardware all the good shizmik
mounting hardware and finally the
fx-8150 processor itself and a nice
little box it will take another incision
of the knife go ahead and get that in
there
and we're about out of the box here with
this and they let me just dump all this
stuff out so here's the thing comes a
little processor box there's a please
read this first label basically states
if you're a complete total moron there's
something about hardware please don't go
try and do and put this in your computer
because you'll blow up your house and
kill your neighbors all right maybe not
so loose translation you know Advanced
Micro Devices AMD little thing right
there and I'll get a close-up get the
camera to zoom in on that and here is
the CPU the fx-8150 totally unlocked and
ready to be overclocked we're gonna put
this bad boy in a system and see how it
does so so that's pretty much it folks
this is a brand new Sigma just come out
it's about three hundred dollars you can
buy it all over the internet probably a
new egg probably on Amazon a lot of
different places if you guys missed it
our gaming deal of the week is crisis

original first thing Crysis Crysis
