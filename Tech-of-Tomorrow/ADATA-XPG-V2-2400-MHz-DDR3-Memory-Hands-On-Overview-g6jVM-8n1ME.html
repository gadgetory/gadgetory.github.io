what up Tech fans welcome back to TECA
tomorrow I'm Milic your host and today
we're gonna take a look at something you
guys have been asking a lot of questions
about now you guys all saw Kevin system
we'll have that back here behind us
that's we're doing all of our video game
editing and all of our game capture
stuff we use this memory and also on our
$1500 gaming PC which you guys can see
there we use this memory from these
people at a data now Rob the bat these
guys use a 2 ounce 8 layer PCB that kind
of like sets them apart and you guys can
see you guys been asked what the
transformer stuff is well it's right
here in my hands you guys can see it do
you like it it's beautiful now check it
out this stuff's gold this is an 8
gigabyte kit they come an 8 gigabyte
kids they have 16 gigabyte kits on the
way up they also have memory from 1600
all the way up to 30 100 megahertz so if
you guys are overclockers looking for
extremely fast memory they have a set
that will fit you now this set in my
hand this is a twenty five hundred
megahertz kit and it's pretty fast it's
gold and if you're looking for that type
of thing in your build it's really cool
they also come in various different
colors you can get these guys in gold
you can get them in black you guys can
check out a lot of the link down below
where you guys can see all the different
types of this memory you can get but it
works very very well now a long time ago
a data when they first came to America
they were a new company didn't really
establish themselves but now these guys
are very established they have their own
RMA they have their own technical
support so they're doing very very well
so if you buy this stuff here you've got
their support they're actually right
down the street from me on Gale Avenue
pretty much you know Gale and a street I
won't mention but they're right down the
street right by the La Puente malls more
hence so if you're in California these
guys are in California which is an
America so you guys will get great
support like I said we've used it in a
lot of builds you guys can see this
stuff looks really really cool you guys
a lot of you guys so transformers now
this stuff is very simple to set up and
use as well when you take this memory
you install it in your system you pull
your went out here get them both out
here for you guys all you got to do is
go in go into your BIOS go into your
memory settings and find your XMP
profile
set the memory for XMP profile one and
you're up and going now I want to give
you a warning if you don't do this
you're not going to get the true speed
of this memory a lot of people send me
emails like when hey do it I put this
thing in my system it only shows this
what's because you haven't engaged the
XMP profile so do the smart thing go
into your BIOS figure it out and set the
SNP profile for XMP profile one where
you will get the true twenty four
hundred megahertz performance that
you're looking for like usual if you
guys are interested in buying into the
stuff and want to check out more
information down below we'll have a link
to both a data and we'll have a link to
where you can buy some of this cool
product if you're looking to use it in
one of your build so I'm Eric thanks for
watching we'll see you guys background
check in tomorrow I'm sure gonna use an
aviator memory and some new build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
