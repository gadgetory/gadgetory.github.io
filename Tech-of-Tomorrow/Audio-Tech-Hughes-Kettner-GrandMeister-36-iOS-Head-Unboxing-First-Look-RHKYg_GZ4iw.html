back to another edition of tech in
tomorrow no sphere we're going to go up
man
dear hope you're like going alright cool
gear it just depends I guess what side
of the fence you're on and by the way we
like to especially thank techo tomorrow
for making this video possible today
today's video is brought to you by tech
of tomorrow so what is this video
alright check it out for those people
out there who really give a damn this is
a really cool product by Hughes &amp;amp;
Kettner this is the grand Meister now
this thing's badass man 36:15 five-10
any watts that you want to have all
kinds of analog effects are built in
it's totally controllable 128 different
presets that are built in and there's
four channels and what's really cool
about this amp is that you can set all
the presets to whatever channel you want
so if you don't like the rockin channel
you don't like the super ultra channel
you only like the mellow Channel that's
the only challenge you have to use and
you can program everything around it now
I have to also get the FSM 432 mark 3
foot switch this thing is 199 bucks on
top the 1199 for this amp and now some
beer going to go dude why are you going
to bring us an unboxing much hey guys
why I look on the internet and there are
a lot of people out there who have this
and it done demos over in Europe Europe
here in the States
nobody's seen this I think I honestly
believe that I'm actually the first
person to get my hands on this I don't
even know if the tone King guy out there
got his hands on this yet I got an order
list I've been waiting since October for
this bad boy
so I basically want to show you guys
this app it's one of my personal
favorites I use it back in my back in my
room and stuff where I'm a little
personal studio most the other stuff and
I really dig this amp one thing
awesomely cool you can put this thing on
like low wattage and just crank up the
volume and it still comes out at a
moderate volume inside your house you
also have red box out you also have
speaker simulation out so if you want to
up like a 4 by 12 speaker simulation you
can do all that out of the amp now this
thing is awesome so let's jump in let's
take a closer look at this amp and see
really why I'm all
so let's go alright folks so let's first
off let's take a look at the FSM 432
mark 3 the MIDI board also includes the
9 millimeter cable so let's pop this bad
boy open we don't need a knife or
anything for that now this thing is
going to be the foot pedal that's going
to be totally controlling this amplifier
controls a channel controls all the
presets controls everything about my amp
so first off let's check this up right
here so you guys can see can switch
through the ABC and D channels or 1 2 3
4 however you want to do it numbers and
numerals it's up to you here you have
your modulation your tap your boost you
can also change the different banks and
programmable so if you have all your
programs in here you can change them up
and down via these switches and if you
guys know what tap is but sometimes with
delay and stuff you can do a go you
really toes are going labelled a die and
a match along with your tap it's pretty
cool all the cable and everything in
there as the box goes tumbling over
there is all included in there so foot
pedal this here's the back of the foot
pedal you guys can see the various
connections you have stomp box mode
preset mode your MIDI in and out over
here you have controls 1 &amp;amp; 2 and also
for power right here says 15 volt AC I
do not think I saw a power controller in
there 15 volt AC I don't believe I saw a
power connector in there so I'll have to
hook that up and what to see if it
requires power hopefully it will just
work with the amp through the MIDI cable
so stuff to fill out let's see here and
I guess there was nothing in there and
let me just a bounce over here and take
a look though real quick ah yep there is
some stuff to fill out and I'm going to
fly across a table here so you guys can
get that in the video and then have fun
with that as I fly across the table so
it actually did come with its a little
programming board here so for all the
program everything it's all going to be
inside of here how to hook it up how to
use it that was actually pretty fun
folks almost took a tumble across the
table and that would have been very fun
for the video I think anyways you guys
could have had fun laughing at my fat
ass that would have been funny alright
so check it out
so here we have it in front of us the
grin Meister 36 head on digital
Total Recall fully programmable tube amp
like I said before three 12ax7 tubes for
el84 the power tubes four channels 36
watch digital effects like I said B 428
presets you also have this thing called
power so consoles time but before we can
lower the wattage on it crank that up
and still get that really beefed up
sound that you can get it really loud
volumes built-in breadbox and the soft
bag is included let's take a knife to
the box and let's see what the heck this
thing is so a quick slice there hey
quick slice over here and then a quick
sliced it out setter now whoa that was
kind of interesting cameraman can you
hand me that stuff that went flying out
as I made a little incision there
interesting stuff there yeah as I was 9
oh it's pretty funny huh okay so you get
this little four month like vidi
gigabyte cobbler account you can focus
on your music story music and all that
stuff you want to get this account from
Sweetwater we did get this from
Sweetwater thank you very much guys Matt
Adams is our sales person he'll always
hook you up he's a cool guy so here we
go there's more Sweetwater sound stuff
like that oh it's really funny they have
an I loud loud and clear little thing in
here from Ike a multimedia I actually
had that product I'll be bringing that
to you guys very soon as well
now usually there's always candy inside
of a Sweetwater order now I don't see
any in this one whatsoever I didn't put
a nice little cut though down the old
thing with the knife there which means
that knife is however nice and sharp
so how are you guys doing at it but you
guys can see right there it was a
wriggly supposed to be $14.99 we got it
for 1199 pretty good deal I think so
check it out we look inside you see the
amp it's inside of its case it's very
well packed down below it looks like
Sweetwater included another catalog like
saying hey buy more buy more all right
so now let me go ahead and pull this out
of here nice and simply now down inside
of here we have all the warranty guide
now the manual and everything on this is
much much bigger than my tubemeister
this is the grand meister so there's
gonna be a lot of reading here to do as
have to learn how to program this bad
boy all right so I'm a little bit
disappointed I got to say because
Sweetwater this time did not give me any
dang candy and I know I'm not supposed
to eat it but man sometimes the candy
sent from Sweetwater is really nice and
I didn't get any this time I'm going to
cry it's all right check it out usually
the cable is included in the front here
like usual cable is in the front so
there's the cable yada yada then we get
this nice carrying case you guys can see
this thing is pretty reasonably sized I
mean this thing is not a giant sights
like a little bit suitcase size it's a
little bit heavy it is heavier than the
tubemeister that is for damn sure I'll
go ahead and open up these little side
pieces and we shall slide the amp out
and it's Virgin state so it dun dun dun
Ton Ton Ton Ton Ton Ton all right who
has a weird smell in there man you're
all smells right all right so here we go
a little bit of last plastic wrapping
here we're almost there folks almost
there
Wilber almost there Wilber our dough's
pick it up and try to pull this thing
off and man I think has a weird smell -
it smells like glue in a way but all
right then PAH boom let's start off and
let's get the camera to refocus and then
let's take a look at the back of the
unit alright folks so now let's check
out the back of the hughes &amp;amp; kettner you
guys can see we start over here we have
your MIDI in and out then we have the FX
loop line out and included noise gate
here is the red box out and your speaker
simulator over here all these little red
dots right here when the amp is going
all these light up and they say that
your tubes are working perfectly for
your power soak you can set it to 18
Watts 5 watts 1 watt no speaker at all
and if your regular standard speakers
they automatically go from 8 to 16 ohms
and automatically sets it up when you
plug it in and last but not least you
have your plug for obviously your power
spin around this one side you guys see
there's a carrying handle on this side
using Kettner logo plain and clearly
there all right folks I'm going to go
ahead I'm going to flip it around the
front right here but you guys can see
looks really beautiful right now
four channels master presence residents
all your effects everything right here
reverb treble mid bass volume gain boost
you have your clean chatter your crunch
channel your lead channel and your ultra
channel and like I said all of those can
be programmed now let's check some that
even cooler look at how that bad boy
lights up in blue I love the way this
amp looks you guys can see I'll even
link to it there are a couple cool
videos out there already at some demos I
actually want to play around with mine
I've been listening to what you guys
have been saying the videos hey you guys
let me do the clean a little stuff
different so I'm listening to you so
instead of just bringing you that right
now I want to take my time and bring you
guys a lot better video doing that than
just doing it on the rush nobody else
though out there had an unboxing of this
product whatsoever and that's why I
thought I'd bring it to you guys so you
guys can see right here you easily
switch between all your channels and
another thing what I mentioned that you
know what a lot of amps when you go and
you do the adjusting of these things it
doesn't do much but on this amp it
really does make a big difference when
you go up here and you addressed the
treble knob adjust the treble knob
excuse me there when you adjust the
treble knob you can really cleanly hear
a difference same thing with the mid the
bass it's an amazing clarity on this and
reverb right here in the front you can
have it with almost zero or nothing and
I really want to mention this folks you
guys can't see this but these things on
here spend so amazingly clean and
perfect you can just tell that the
German engineering is just built behind
this damn thing it's so badass so that's
pretty much it folks I got the keyboard
right here which you guys saw earlier
I'll go ahead and set that just down
here in front of the thing and you guys
solving that comes inside with the amp
it's case and everything so that's
pretty much it folks man the grand
Meister 36 coming to market about 1199
most the ones that came into stock
pretty much sold that if you go anywhere
they're going to say coming back in the
stock real soon they should have
something about two or three weeks I was
lucky to get my hands on one rock and
roll I'm very very stoked so
for me this amp is everything man four
channels total programmability all the
effects everything inside the amp it's
got a noise gate
I mean seriously these guys leave any
bunkin thing out of this thing I mean
they really did not and from all the
stuff that I've already seen on the net
and looked the videos this amp has
amazing tones I can't wait tonight to
dig into this thing start playing it and
then be able to bring you guys new
videos showing you all the crap that I
have learned about this app for now
though this is the unboxing of both the
products the footswitch and the amp we
thank you very much for watching Pekka
tomorrow we'll see you guys back here
from the more rockin soon
