it gonna take you tomorrow YouTube
channel to bring you guys a new case
from the people over at Cougar this is
their new evolution case now this is a
full tower case that has some pretty
cool stuff has a controller on top to
control the fan speeds it's supposed to
be completely tool-less and this one
happens to be white so first off let's
look at the front of the box you guys
can see all the normal normals there I'm
gonna spin it around alright so you guys
going maybe gonna go over to you guys
even read the box but to point down what
you guys can see it all kinds of nifty
stuff well actually get inside and see
the case and see how it really is cuz
that's what you guys want to see tell my
trusty little knife gonna make my first
medical incision right here nothing over
here let me show begin to disseminate
this lovely little bad boy the dog is
now got up and run around Oh looks
pretty cool alright those where it
actually looks like in the box before we
take it out so I'm gonna go ahead and
pull it around
you know out of the thing now you guys
had you liking your through the
cameraman cameron shaking his head he's
like you dude but it happens they
want to see me throw stuff at you so
here comes cameraman Foxx a cameraman oh
good he's catching oh there's some sound
effects alright chase can spin this
thing around right here man takes thing
off got some more secure manner at the
tripod oh well you know say let's be
it's not really too heavy
okay so it feels pretty light another
thing throw the camera nice big bag
around the entire thing as well so here
we go with a little tech magic first you
see the cover on and then
oh it's magically off alright we'll
start off by look at the front of the
case all the babes are completely sealed
in and then closed let's see if the
front cover comes off okay there we go
so here's the front cover cameron taking
a closer look at that spin it around
filter grilles all the way through front
of the case got another thing right here
with a grill we have here a fan so
there's a band right here in the front
taking the air intake and a dust cover
which I believe is removable as well
then we can see the fan it's like an
orange this one right here you have to
take four screws off to remove this one
just easily came off as you saw here's
we're gonna be putting either your CPU
or maybe possibly an SSD depending on
how you want to your case I'm going to
pipe it - I'd over here but there's the
front so now let's flip at the top the
top of this case for me is pretty cool
you've got USB 3.0 USB 2.0 multiple
jacks for headphones microphone a die
off your fan control
your power on button restart it's really
cool stuff these probably might have
actually do with light control and then
one thing that's really cool it's gonna
be hard to see but this right here pops
down I'm gonna spin around real quick
just maybe the Cameron can zoom in on
don't forget to close in there but if
you pop this thing down you can see
inside of there there's a place to mount
a drive it's at an SSD just perfectly so
if you want to plug in SSD right into
that you'll have it directly up into
your board through the inner wiring of
the case pretty cool stuff
I like that quite a bit this case
actually also looks really nice it's
made of plastic but it's quite nice
actually the side panel has a partial
see-through window we have another fan
port right here if you want have a side
fan let's go ahead and take these side
screws off these were very easy actually
to take off some cases you guys have
seen me it's been a hard life even twist
this thing they're like been put on
mother by mountain giant so let's see
how easy the side panel comes off side
panel comes off very easily
slight little tug side panel insides
like we said room for another fan now
you can see there's an accessory package
right here with all the wiring and stuff
I'm sorry excuse me not the wiring so
probably all your mounting hardware fit
that other way
now all the bays are the nice easy kind
that the plastic pull off being orange
is really trippy with the white I really
like this a lot like I don't know what
it is but I like this color scheme it's
weird
all these are easy self locking plug
your drives input pop them lock them
very easily so far I've seen no reason
not to have any tools motherboard tray
inside of here there's all the places in
the knockoffs if you put your
motherboard knockoffs in there please
make sure you this before you install
your motherboard so doesn't short out I
can see there's case man
achieve me I can see there's wiring back
here case wiring easily be able to
manage it you put back here I'll take
this light panel so you can see that
further another fan in the back here we
were exhaust also all of your wires and
all your interconnection stuff is all
loaded right here a lot of different
stuff there so let me flip it around
here's the rear of the case now these
guys don't mess around really any water
cooling stuff so this case is not going
to be a case really for doing water
cooling with not too many modifications
there on that but for air coy it's
really nice it's elegant see right here
back in the base your pod be able to do
just two-way SLI or to a crossfire maybe
3-way definitely not to have court
without thing probably done enough room
power supply area let's pull off the
other side of the case pull off the side
again in skin easy actually I don't
really do is just pull it out and
actually pops you don't really do
anything at all so here's that side
pound but there's really nothing on that
one so we'll get that other way so back
here we have the plate out for the CPU
on the motherboard now there really
isn't that much room back here for cable
management now there's a tiny bit of
room but not a lot so I don't say as far
as kill management goes I have to say
that you're going to have limited room
back here I mean there is some room but
not a whole whole lot so do you bought
but some of your wiring back there but
not a whole heck of a lot of it
so let's show you guys now the bottom
here's the bottom of the case there's a
sliding filter for the fan again
removable and washable lock that back
into place little rubber feet all the
stop box of the case it doesn't scratch
or damage a table but the one we're
using right here all the additional
mounting stuff like I said the
instruction guide there's actually a
breakout box in here from putting
smaller drives into a bigger drive bay
so if you need to use an SSD whatever
you can use this Bay and the wiring
stuff so I mean that's pretty much it
folks I mean this is the Cougar
evolution it's a case that's about $80
but I have to say it is one of the
nicest $80 cases I've seen there's not a
whole lot it looks like on the back for
a cable management but I probably enough
to be sufficient for many you know
simple builds so that's it look for us
back here on teka tomorrow with more
reviews and more unboxings later this
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
