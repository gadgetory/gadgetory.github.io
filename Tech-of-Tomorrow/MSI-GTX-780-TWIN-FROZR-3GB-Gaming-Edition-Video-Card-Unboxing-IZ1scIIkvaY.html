back here once again welcome to techyv
tomorrow i'm Elric your host and today
we've got something really nice for you
folks now you fans out there who love in
video products you're going to be really
loving this one
msi has made a name for themselves with
their twin frozer line of video cards
and we have their twin frozer gaming GTX
780 right here next to me so today we're
going to do the unboxing and the first
look at this card and then we'll move on
and we'll get the full review for you
folks as the day's unfold with that said
though let's jump in and let's see what
this new Twin Frozr bad-boy is all about
alright folks like usual any good
unboxing and overlook makes us look at
well the box so here we have it we've
got the MSI logo and then we see their
gaming G Series and this thing's pretty
cool reminds me of Ferrari emblem only
it's like with a crazy dragon you guys
can see it's the Twin Frozr gaming
edition they actually have a motherboard
that matches this which makes it really
cool as well for those people looking
for you know color-coordinated builds
geforce gtx 780 this is obviously a
three gigabyte card in front of the box
overclock right out of the box so let's
flip it around real quick here is the
nomenclature so if you're looking to buy
this you can look here you can look at
our description down below if you're
looking to purchase this then you just
got that once again the side the geforce
gtx 780 three gigabytes of gddr5 which
to me really sets the karna part because
that three gigabytes just means a lot
more than two pcie 3.0 DirectX 11 all
right now let's flip it on the right
back and this is where actually some of
the more important stuff comes out I
don't know if a lot of you guys have
been following these guys but they make
afterburner software which is very
famous for doing overclocking with a lot
of people use it you guys can see they
have their own gaming app in here which
they're talking about that now these
guys also use the twin frozer is their
advanced cooling and I don't know if you
guys know this or not but everything
that has to do with overclocking is now
done through the boost so the cooler
that your car runs the better your boost
and having great cooling like this is
going to mean a lot and we test it will
actually do some overclocking these guys
are still saying they're using their
military class for parts that just means
they're using high quality components
all across
bored ayamaro my friend Bruce Wayne
actually came up with this entire
marketing idea and a lot of people said
what the hell does that mean that just
means high quality components the
features and the specs are right here
we've kind of already gone over those so
let's actually jump in and see what's
inside of this lovely box all right so
now I'll go and begin the unboxing go
ahead and pop this little cap here very
easily done go ahead and pull the box
out of the box a box within a box with
our box
hey this wants to stick in here there we
go
a little bit of shake and bake and then
we get the box out so here's the box in
the box go ahead and take the top part
off I know this is completely wrong but
what the heck it's original right so
we'll flip it around and here we go all
of the accessories once again we see the
gaming g-series so let's go ahead and
open this up and we've got going on
we've got six pin eight pen we've got
dual molex to 6-pin the msi drivers
afterburner all that stuff is on the CD
and everything you need to get up and
going but I would actually suggest going
to the Nvidia site and downloading the
latest drivers because sometimes CDs are
made months in advance here is the quick
user's guide for the part number which
is this card and then we have this which
I feel is completely and I do mean
completely useless in the United States
is the DVI to VGA connector now I know
over in other countries this might be
important thing the United States
nobody's using that anymore
and here we have the card all back here
look how clean it looks is that awesome
looking no I'm just kidding guys
alright so let's pull that out of there
you guys can see that this car does come
completely self sealed in the box so
we're going to go ahead and break that
seal right now talboom red and break
that seal and we shall remove the guard
very nice and carefully from the bag
it's actually pretty tight from this bag
it's skipping to the side but we got it
there so let's start out right now let's
start out at the rear i/o DVID dvi-i
standard DisplayPort standard HDMI now
it's flipped to cart around the front
you guys can see it has two huge
windmill-type fans on top
you guys can see all of the aluminum
cooling fins all underneath there and
you can also see this card is made on
open-air architecture now what does that
mean
open architecture means that all of the
heat everything is dissipated away from
the card though and it actually relies
in your case to push the air out here we
see the pcie 3.0 interface along the
side of the card we can see all of the
heat pipes I'm going to flip the card
around here on the end you guys can see
more of the cooling apparatus so what
happens is basically the GPU is
connected to all these fins the heat
goes up into the fins goes out into the
heat pipes this air blows all that heat
away from the car to keep it cool so
let's flip it around
I'll flip it around this way right here
we have the eight pin power connector
the six pin power connector we see once
again the heat pipe being evident
running all on the side of the card once
again we see the msi name now I'm going
to flip it around to the back of the
card now I don't really know exactly
what color this PCB is I'm looking at
with my eyes and it looks like purple
brown black all mixed in one I'll have
to ask my contact mark and ask them
exactly what color is supposed to be you
guys can tell me what you think but to
me I don't really see a color here what
about you John do you color I don't see
any color what color is it it was like
an army green army green okay well there
you go another color opinion so now
let's talk about removing the cooling
apprise in case you so desire to do so
there is a screw here a screw here you
have your four main screws holding on
then you have an additional screw here
here here all you do is remove those
screws and then the entire cooling
apparatus will pop off now here on top
we see two sli fingers and with the gtx
780 series you can do Quad SLI on the
770 series nose below you can only do
triple but with this card you can do
Quad SLI for those kick-ass systems
alright so there you guys have it the
MSI twin froze
Gaming Edition and I want to take note
here this video card actually matches up
with their gaming edition z87
motherboard and we're going to be doing
a giant two thousand dollar gaming build
to bring to you folks really soon so pay
