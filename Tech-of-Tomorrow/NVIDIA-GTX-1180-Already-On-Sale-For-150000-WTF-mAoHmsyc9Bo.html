live in when nvidia does pretty much
everything in their power to silence any
news about their new video cards like
I've said in my videos they told me
there wasn't gonna be in any new video
cards anytime lately Jenson one stage he
said the same thing no new video cards
are coming out well it seems like
honestly you folks who write and I was
wrong and that honestly a lot of that
stuff just seems to be a smokescreen
because now we're seeing crazy stuff
right now there's actually an 1180 for
sale on a Vietnamese website that's
right another card that's rumored to be
on sale is the Aizu Strix card which is
actually one of the most top-of-the-line
cards you know that when it says Strix
on it it's meant for gaming it's topped
the line showing three fans showing spec
showing everything else with a price tag
of $1500 and here comes the dog rattling
his bone making noise but that's just
crazy stuff now Ian from an N Tech has
also already officially said that
there's been an invite that's gone out
from Nvidia to invite people to go to
gamers con in Germany now I got this
same invite now what exactly is going on
there
I don't know but probably chances are
pretty good that they're probably going
to announce the 11 80 and the 11 70 at
that particular time so anything that
we're really telling you right now is
still pretty much speculation there's
been nothing official from Nvidia as of
yet but you guys have seen web sites
around the world have been ruling this
for a long time and I pretty much try to
avoid those rumor you know things as
much as possible but now it seems that
these rumors are actually coming true so
let's real quick
let's see what's being touted right now
as the specs for the new 1180 and for
the new 1170 so from what we're seeing
so far the GPU is the GT 104 and this is
part of the touring architecture it's
running at 200 watts and manufactured
with the new 12 nanometer process it's
going to have 3584 CUDA
224 TM use which our texture mapping
units 16 gigabytes of GDR 6 now this is
new architecture memory the memory is
also supposed to be clocked at 14
gigahertz which is Gd r6 effective which
works out to four hundred nine point six
gigabytes of memory bandwidth thirteen
teraflops of power 256-bit memory bus
now that particular part really doesn't
make any sense I would imagine that in a
car that's this powerful it's going to
have probably a 512 bit memory bus so I
think this particular thing is probably
actually wrong and like I said this card
right now is supposed to be $1,500 with
an availability of September 28th now
that particular part sounds like it
might be real and the reason I say at
that particular part might be real is it
does seem from most of the rumors that
we're going to see the cards that are
directly from you know Nvidia the
founders edition cards we're gonna see
those cards first and then probably a
month to 45 days after that we'll
actually see the aftermarket cards
hitting the market but that may not be
true I mean for one thing we're seeing a
box we're seeing specs we're seeing a
price we're seeing a link so all that
information may be completely wrong and
the information that we're seeing on the
Vietnamese website might actually be
true now how true it actually is
nobody's going to know obviously until
Nvidia officially announces these video
cards and says hey they're gonna come
onto market now one thing I want to
speculate right off the bat $1500 for a
video card I mean come on that price is
just outrageous honestly here in America
you can get yourself a cheap car for
1,500 to 2,000 bucks I believe G the
camera even bought a car a few years
back for like 2 grand and used it for
like 2 or 3 years so you can almost buy
a car for that and probably I don't know
how other countries are but it's
probably that's the same thing as the
money translates around for that amount
of money you can buy a new car well not
a new car but a used car you can buy
yourself a new car but it'd be a used
car but new to you yeah that's that
that's what I mean now that's just
insane now reportedly though it's
supposed to be double digit numbers as
far as perform
Mintz goes now if this translates across
the board and that would be basically
saying that if you're getting 60
frames-per-second in a game now well
you're gonna get 120 frames per second
with that same game with the new video
card and if that actually happens that
will be incredible numbers and honestly
I don't know what they md has anything
up their sleeve Iran the market that's
anywhere near competing with that level
of performance I know AMD fans are gonna
be like oh yeah hey and B's got
something up their sleeve for sure
they're gonna come out they're gonna win
we always hear that but do we ever
actually see that even with the new rise
in CPUs that came up they've closed the
gap with Intel CPUs but they haven't
completely overtaken them yet now some
people speculate if you overclock it you
do this you do that you can get better
performance but out of the box
performance which is what most people do
you're not going to see those numbers
translating into beating anything it
comes close but it doesn't beat it and
if NVIDIA does release these cards and
the speculation is true and they have
double digits on performance and
everything even though the cards not
worth 1,500 bucks it's still probably
worth around eight or nine hundred
dollars for being the top-of-the-line
card now there's also the new 1170 and
here's what we've heard about that so
far now the gtx 1170 will reportedly run
with two thousand six hundred and eighty
eight cuda cores 168 TM use eight to
sixteen gigabytes of ddr3 RAM and 9.75
teraflops of power but like I said
everything right now is completely
speculative we don't know if these are
the facts but still those numbers do
sound good so at the end of the day I
have to agree with you guys the audience
I honestly think that Nvidia just put up
a giant smoke screen in a way that kind
of hurts my feelings I feel like I have
really good personal relationships with
the people at Nvidia but like many of
you said they're gonna defend their NDA
and defend their card probably till the
day it comes out so until you know
Germany happens and possibly they
announce it there it's all just you know
rumors in the wind now unfortunately I
have been invited to this event in
Germany but I have a giant hole and my
foot which is it's just causing me a lot
of pain and I can barely walk so I don't
think I'm going to be able to make the
Germany trip which is highly unfortunate
because I was hoping to get me in the
a man out there and we could cover the
event but it looks like that particular
event in person I'm going to miss but it
does seem like from every rumor out
there and everything is actually
pointing to this is when they're going
to officially announce these new video
cards
hopefully the cards will be available
for review right after that so we can
bring you guys that reviews these cards
get rid of all the BS all the hype and
only stick to the facts and see what
these cards are all about now from the
rumors though I am really hoping that
these cards perform at double digits
than their predecessor I mean if I can
get an eleven seventy and get double
digits over my 1070 that will just be
amazing and the same thing with the 1080
if I can get an 1180 and it's going to
be double the performance that's going
to be awesome and let's just face it we
haven't even talked about the ti
editions which will obviously probably
come later
and those editions will be even faster
you guys know how Nvidia does stuff they
release the cards they get these they
max out that driver they boost the card
up a little bit more give it more
performance release as a TI addition
make more money and keep the car going
for a while now the really crazy thing
about all of this is between the 1080
and the 1180 launch has been the longest
delay in releasing a new video card in
Nvidia's history they've traditionally
release new video cards every year all
the time like clockwork usually around
are a little bit earlier in the year
that way they can get the summer traffic
but now this is gonna be announced
really kind of right in mid summer into
the beginning of summer and I'm honestly
looking forward to see what NVIDIA has
under their hood but for now all this
stuff like I said is still speculation
but the fact is that since there is a
card that's available for sale on a
Vietnamese website and I know these guys
have broken into a and probably in
videos probably shooting them Hellfire
and burning them at a pit of steaks
right now that still shows though that
there's got to be some fact to these
rumors so even though there's rumors I
don't think you have to take them with a
complete grain of salt a little grain of
salt yeah but I think these cards are
coming I think we're going to see them
very soon and that's that man like for
sale in Vietnam though why Vietnam
that's just
kind of crazy anyways would links down
below to the original articles we thank
you guys for watching like I said
hopefully these news cards will be here
right around the corner and we get our
hands on them here at tech in tomorrow
to bring you guys the test results and
see what they're really all about bass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
