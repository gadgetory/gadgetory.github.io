the channel you know in the last week
I've been talking quite a lot about how
there's a great video card shortened in
ways to get around it
now mining a lot of people think it's
going somewhere personally I don't think
it's going anywhere but getting bigger
there's all kinds of science fiction
books I have actually read where a
cryptocurrency and all this type of
stuff becomes the way of the future
because let's just face it the way our
government is going and the way a lot of
governments going there's a really good
chance that the government will go under
and the money the dollar and all its
stuff that's aboveboard may one day
actually go completely gone I mean it
could happen I mean the world's had all
kinds of revolutions Wars and stuff in
the past luckily you know my generation
I'm past that I'm like the last year of
the baby boomers being born in 65 but
you know people who lived you know in
the beginning of the century all the way
like into like the 50s really and
actually even in the 60s with Wars I
have just had so many Wars going on over
and over and over again we've seen
governments rise fall all kinds of
things not necessarily here but around
the world so mining is probably going to
be something that's going to keep
happening over and over and over again
now what I want to know though is this
they have gaming cards okaying and now
the markets being shorted out because
all of the gaming cards are being bought
up by miners driving prices up many
places I will say this NVIDIA is selling
their cards directly from there from
North from their company excuse me for
the same price they're normally supposed
to be no price gouging from them
whatsoever so be on the lookout for
those dishonest people trying to raise
prices but at that point though since
these cards are selling why is an Nvidia
and AMD making enough cards though so
that there isn't a card shortage
whatsoever I mean why are we dealing
with the card shortage why is there car
shortage you know why are cards being
able to be sold for so much money with a
market that should be saturated with
video cards for people to buy which
leads me down to what them you know the
basis is videos why aren't companies
like Nvidia even Intel and AMD making
video cards that are strictly dedicated
tomorrow
or just making products period that are
geared for mining I mean let's just face
it you're not actually playing a game
when you're mining so do you even really
need a rear plate do you need
connections for all that kind of stuff
hook up to monitors no you don't you
don't need that
I mean whatsoever so right now the way
the situation is honestly gaming cards
are not the best solution for mining and
at the same time all the gamers out
there are getting screwed because they
can't afford to buy their video cards
and do their do-it-yourself kits and
that pisses people off like when I put
my video hey you know buying some
pre-built pcs is probably a really good
idea some people are like hey cool I can
deal with that but other people like
absolutely no way brother I ain't doing
that
no it's do-it-yourself for nothing jack
you back off raah so I was just like oh
hey okay cool guy so do-it-yourself
people they want their cards and they
want them by themselves Alec cart they
don't want them on a plate with some you
know vegetables and rice they just want
just the meat and that's it get rid of
the rest so why aren't these companies
making cards or products that are
dedicated to mining I mean really think
about that for a minute
honestly I mean can't they do it or is
it some giant leap of thing to do we
need a rocket scientist to come from
outer space and invent it and say hey
guys so there's a better way to do this
I mean what's taking them so long do
they not believe in mining I mean
obviously they see the cards are being
sold and there's a commercial that keeps
running on my channel about this guy
who's like you know years ago that this
dude named something-or-another had
10,000 bitcoins you know and if he would
have had them today it they'd be worth a
million point seven okay people getting
paid sponsored to make videos like that
tells me that mine isn't going anywhere
at all well I've seen comics come on oh
yeah they're gonna legalize they're
gonna do that really there's no control
over that it's not going anywhere
so at the end of the day I don't know
what you guys think do you guys agree
with me why in the frack aren't these
companies I'm serious AMD Nvidia Intel
I'm talking to you folks why aren't you
making a dedicated product for mining so
the gamers can
their cards and blue they're doing
yourself systems and have a happy
friggin 2018 instead of all the hate the
anger and the upset isn't going crazy
cuz there's no freakin video cards see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
