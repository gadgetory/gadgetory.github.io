back once again at echo tomorrow I'm I
orientated know that probably most you
know then if you're new to the channel
well then hey welcome we're glad to see
you here now I get emails every day from
people going hey dude how do you guys
make your videos what do you guys use
what kind of equipment do you guys use
basically how do you guys do it so
basically there's me and there's Jesus
the cameramen who actually I should have
made him to this video but he pushed
that a man goes here's one of you on
camera so yeah whatever but he should
have been doing it because he knows more
about the equipment even than I do
because he uses it every day but that
said I know the first thing off the bat
I know that my pc fans are gonna freak i
think we like oh my god he got a macking
on the back again i'm at so let's just
clear the air i use my pc for gaming I
gained the on my pc my kids game on
the PC when I work I work on a mac and
that's just all there is to it talk
say whatever you want man I don't care
max are productive they get work
done quickly faster they're just better
for work for gaming know they suck ass
never buy one don't even look at one if
you're a gamer and you don't do your
computer for like doing a website or
doing that kind of stuff you know then
hey you're good to go and in fact pcs
make pretty good websites and they can
do music now too and I'm going to be
making some videos all that stuff but
right now let's jump in the first thing
we're going to talk about is the camera
because obviously that is going to be
other than your computer the most
important thing that you're going to get
now our camera does both 4k and it does
the you know the 30 frames and the 60
frames per second all that stuff you
guys go to in 60 frames per second we
use the panasonic lumix d8c gh4 body now
this thing is a 16 point 5 megapixel
digital single lens mirrorless camera
with 4k cinematic video now the things
this thing is a bit pricey it's $1,500
for the body alone but this thing does
4k so think about that if you wanted to
do 4k you've seen our videos in 4k they
look awesome now there are other cameras
out there that cost a lot more in fact
looks like we're going to be upgrade our
equipment pretty soon because we kind of
go from like having kind of really good
 all the way to get a fabulous
here that's how it is like you'll see we
get to our you get what but look with
the lighting works you see in all videos
and doesn't cost hardly anything so the
camera uses that one now let's talk
about the lens now there are a lot of
lenses out there but we choose the
Panasonic h HS 1203 5 lumix g x vario
now this is a twelve to thirty
five-millimeter f2a asph x series lens
now i don't know what all that stuff
means a nomenclature winds but i know
that works because we use it every
day and that's we're shooting on right
now and it works we do have a couple
other ones that we use sometimes but
like for daily stuff this lens works and
it actually works pretty well for doing
what we're doing you wouldn't need
another lens does lens work perfectly
well for everything you want to do if
you're looking to like build your
YouTube channel and do all that stuff
which is probably more with this video's
a line excite excuse me is more along
the lines that people were making
YouTube challenge we're going hey what
do you guys use to make your cool
looking videos like you must have a cool
editor yeah we do we also have some okay
equipment too so now let's talk about
the microphone because obvious that's an
important thing it's like up here above
my head and all have the cameras
readjust real quick we need to show this
thing to you now we've been using this
for quite a long time so that thing is
the zoom h1 portable and it really works
great for picking up audio it works
really good too because a lot of times
like even like we made a video last week
the ampulla something in the background
I'm like apologized you guys going hey
sorry for the hum but when we edit it
there was no hum so it picks up pretty
directionally just a quick hint if you
set up your mic we're using a boom stand
too I'll talk about that do you want to
make sure that your microphone is placed
basically like you have a string so
picture you have a strength in your
mouth and that string is going straight
up toward the microphone is so you want
to make sure that when you're doing that
you set it up that way that way you guys
will actually get the best presentation
of your voicing you'll pick it up nice
and you won't get a lot of background
noise like I said a minute ago now the
boom stand I think we picked this thing
up at over it to lose Sam Ash it's like
this onstage stands i was achieve
onstage tan so it's an on-stage stands
boom like just typical boom you guys can
see it has a big old long thing we've
uses thing indoors outdoors everywhere
it actually works pretty doggone good
now there are a few of the things that
we use let me just talk about those real
quick for our tripod we use the Vanguard
out 2 plus 2 63 AP three section
aluminum tripod with 3-way magnesium
alloy photo panhead now there are a ton
and I do mean a ton of better ones than
this I mean I know guys out there who
spend big bucks they have these fluid
head ones they do all this crazy stuff
we've thought about investing on it but
so far this is working we are going to
be changing things up like I said so
maybe wound up actually getting one of
those more expensive tripods for now huh
we're trying to keep it right there in
the middle ghetto fabulous and like I
said pretty good now we all see you
smooth things as far as SD cards and
stuff like that we use one micro on one
standard-size flash card the mini one
goes inside the microphone the standard
goes inside the camera now for our light
and swear I told you guys we go really
low budget we just went over to home
depot got some lighting stands and then
found the lights that were like the
truest white you always want to get
white lighting trust me on this you only
in a yellow light you not want to mix
your lights you want to get all pure
white that way makes it a lot better and
a lot easier to do white balancing also
where's the white balance thing and
it'll be real quick this is another
thing that's kind of important to the
white balance kind of a crazy thing but
to you use this before every video and
it helps the camera and keep everything
in its balance like I'm not a cameraman
I don't know all these things I just
know that they use it every time we
shoot and it works because well
obviously you see the videos so once
again I'll cut the cameras head off the
withered whoa ooh almost this close as
far as the lighting goes like I said you
guys can see over here that we have it
and it's a pretty get away it's just
standard lights nothing expensive there
guys out there I know of so much more
equipment we my friend from TLD is like
a ten-thousand-dollar camera always
likes all super you know led this led
that I mean I mean it's a matter of
spending like me to make the argument
like I could actually own that but I
like recording equipment of music stuff
just as much like I'd about where i can
still whatever cash i get if i was only
into a camera equipment and that kind of
stuff and was less on the music then
obviously I would probably own that
10,000 dark amber too but nope I had to
get one that I could afford and still be
able to you know
have cool guitars and also the last
thing on the plate people always ask
okay like what software do you use now
I've told you guys before I love logic
jesus loves logic even though he's got a
degree in pro to open but he knows logic
actually really good so I was pretty
surprised he knows it actually better
than my other friend news a pro tools
like guru but I guess everybody's got
their strengths so we use that and then
we also use this other thing called
final cut these programs work really
good they're great for editing I know
that piece T guys out there you guys can
use Adobe Premiere and there are other
programs after that you guys can use on
a PC these are just the ones that we use
in house we have a bunch of imacs that
we use for all the music room so they
just work that way so that's it folks
like I said everything that we talked
about in the video always will be down
to the like button so if you guys cook
them that show more button will have
links to all this stuff so if you guys
want to make your videos and make them
look like ours and not spend you know
and break the bank is I mean I think
pretty much other than the computer
which I'm going to assume that most of
your going to have a computer and you
don't have to use our editing software
that just getting software you we use
you have a PC you're perfectly welcome
to use that pc and edit it on your
machine you'll get the same results I
just think it's a little bit quicker and
a little bit neater on a Mac that's all
instead of going control up to leave
it's just ctrl alt so it's just a one
list click on the Mac you know you can
save that finger for something else like
playing some ribs so that's it folks
thanks for watching that's what we use
here on techo tomorrow to make our
videos so thanks you guys
