shut up I'm trying to film here welcome
to dr. Sexy's channel I'm dr. sexy now
I'm just kidding welcome to tech of
tomorrow and today is the launch of the
new ivy bridge-e cpus we were lucky to
get our hands on the new Ivy Bridge dash
e 40 960 X we've been testing it out on
the x79 platform now right behind me I
have the inland test station this
thing's really cool it's there xfactor
like thing you guys can see behind me
now i'm using the asus rampage extreme
motherboard that's their ex every nine
series had to flash the bios to its
latest update to make sure it recognized
the cpu but after that everything was
absolutely fine far as the memory goes
32 gigabytes of patriot viper extreme
we've got it to this XMP profile one at
1866 megahertz as far as our drives go
we have a couple of them for our SSD
boot drive we have a 520 series from
Intel that is a say 23 it's 240
gigabytes and for our mass storage Drive
we have a western digital one terabyte
standard hard drive the cooling is
provide as you guys can see by the
corsair h 90 which is back there it
works very well and Intel actually
recommends that you use liquid cooling
on these CPUs now we use two CPUs in our
test set up the 3960 that was the Sandy
Bridge that's what we did the initial
testing we remove that cpu and we put on
the Ivy Bridge 4960 X now you guys can
see everything's lit up behind me it's
open air test bench it's very easy to
work with all the controls everything
are right there in the front so we just
hit a button and away we go now if yes
somehow didn't notice there are a pair
of GPX Titans on the test station we
tested with those and a single gtx 780
now for the Haswell side of things we
use a different motherboard we used the
Maximus hero motherboard that's on the
new z87 platform
we use the i7 4770k now one of the
drives was actually different the memory
was very similar it's also the Patriot
series it's red and we had that set also
at X and B profile 1866 megahertz but
for the SSD boot drive we use the
Patriot pyro 240 gigabyte drive as far
as the hard drive for storage we use the
same western digital one terabyte drive
so those are our test stations we
thought they were pretty damn similar
they're all kind of the same spec we try
to maintain using the same controllers
across the board so as far as apples to
apples testing goes this is pretty damn
close now nothing's going to be totally
exact but I think this is about as close
as you can get if you guys are looking
to buy these parts want to reproduce
those tests station at home you guys can
check out the link down below like but
which I knew you guys are going to hit
and you guys can see all these parts if
you want to recreate your own test ISM
or build a system based around these
parts it will be down there so if you
happen to somehow miss it we have the
full review and all that stuff right up
here behind me you guys can click on
that you guys can see the full review
and all the scores if you guys want to
see it before the next video the next
video is the Haswell versus the ivy
bridge-e so i'll see you guys in the
ring
he will</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
