eller from Tekken tomorrow with Andrew
fear of nvidia and now we're going to
show you the Nvidia shield live
streaming on to a large TV and seeing
how well it streams and how well it game
so Andrew what's up with this man this
is pretty cool this is our as you said
our Nvidia shield and we have a
technology we call nvidia game stream
and what it allows you to do is
literally stream any game you own on
your pc you can stream it to the shield
device when you when you have the shield
itself industry from the pc we normally
assume in 720p 60 but what we're showing
up here is what we call shield console
mode so you connect a shield to an hdmi
television and when you start streaming
out it streams at 1080p so you're
literally it's like you're playing with
a kick game console you can have 1080p
at 1080p you can have you getting up in
a Dyson you can have your PC sitting in
your den or anywhere else in your house
and you can take your shield with you
directly your TV your projector or
whatever it is you have and I just
automatically connect to it all right
and connects up it finds the games and
what's cool is you know we have the
GeForce experience runs on your PC it
works with any geforce gtx pc to stream
the games we automatically optimize all
the games for you if we tried to hide
all the dialogue boxes so when you start
the game you don't have any weirdness
have any click so make it is rounders be
clear about this you're saying that
basically any game that I have on my
computer that I have that I'm running
through my experience thing I can run
through my shield onto my TV any games
with you guys there's 10 bucks any game
not just limited a games any game that
you have on your thing you've got an
nvidia card you've got the GeForce
experience installed you can stream it
all through your shield so you take your
share whatever room in the house
wherever you're at and boom you've got
instant gaming all right yeah it was
even coolest we have the supports Team
big picture
this team is probably the largest
digital game library in the world you
can even log in directly into steam and
you know x games and I start streaming
them right away alright folks here's you
can buy games and really start streaming
them also what about like just take like
taking pictures and stuff like that like
your self gaming or something do like
your auto camp the work with any of that
kind of stuff yet well it's we're
starting to work with companies that do
that twitch twitch TV who a lot of
people know for game game casting and
game broadcasting we started working
with them on the piece on the pc side if
you have a geforce pc and you have
you're playing your game you can stream
any game to you can basically stream
your game it's directly to twitch TV wow
we're starting to work with I'm able to
do it on the shield as well so you can
launch the twitch TV app on the shield
and then start streaming your games no
streaming your pictures of your naked
girlfriend food through your device
though crazy guy did online I don't roll
like that my wife would not appreciate
my nail commit sir but you guys can see
focused amazing stuff here Nvidia shield
technology anywhere on the go gaming you
take it hook it up wirelessly in fact be
streaming your games gaming on the go
