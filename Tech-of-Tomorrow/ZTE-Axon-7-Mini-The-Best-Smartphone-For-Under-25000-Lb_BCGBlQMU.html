audible.com when you don't have time to
read and you still want to get the
classics audible.com is your friend
what's going on people detect verse
welcome back once again detective
tomorrow now if you're like me and like
many folks out there you want a good
cellphone but you don't always have that
eight hundred ninety eight seven dollar
price tag to buy yourself one that's
unlock and let's just face it having an
unlocked phone is better all around
because you can use it with whoever you
want to whatever you want to and pretty
much the good ones you can take around
the world to their features now today
we're going to take a look at a cell
phone by the people over at ZTE now this
phone I've seen for as low as two
hundred and twenty bucks
I left a comment on Twitter and other
people said wow they were look at this
film for cheap as well and this is the
Aksum seven mini this phone is actually
$299 in the website but we've seen it
for his cheapest stupid even right now
going on over on Amazon so that's pretty
cool so if you want to have a secondary
phone that has a lot of features and
works great I think this is a really
cool device now I want to say we're out
to bat I wasn't paid any money by this
company to say anything about the phone
they did provide the phone and they did
provide us a SIM card for month of
service so we could check the phone app
but beyond that we're not paid any money
but I have to say though that unclearly
I'm actually impressed with this phone
quite a bit the features are very well
starting up in the front we have a 5.2
inch full AMOLED HD screen features
glorious it features the grilles last
generation four so you know it's nice
and tough this thing actually features a
Snapdragon processor has a Qualcomm six
one seven and an Adreno 405 dedicated to
the GPU so it has a lot of power under
the hood you get full 1080p filming at
30 frames per second unfortunately there
is no 4k filming whatsoever on this
phone at this moment but that's okay 720
is a little bit better and you actually
have slow-mo filming as well
as far as the resolution goes the seven
mini has a 1920 by 1080 Full HD
resolution with 423 pixels per inch and
the speed on that Qualcomm processor is
1.5 gigahertz and if I did mention
before it is a quad-core processor now
other features of the phone are a very
nice camera set you have an 8 megapixel
camera in the front for doing all your
selfies and all that stuff and on the
back you get a full 16 megapixel camera
now this camera offers all pretty much
the same features that you see on all
the major brands now the editing
software and stuff on it probably is not
as intense as some of the stuff like we
saw in pixels and some of the others but
still is an all around you know solid
camera these features are all there
but I'm the photography side of things
the Seven mini actually really shines it
has so many manual options you'll be
very impressed in fact when I first
picked it up and started taking pictures
I was like wow this is kind of cool it's
almost like being in the cockpit of a
plane it actually even shows you how
it's balanced you're offsetting what's
the menu angle you're even shooting at
very impressive as far as that goes and
we'll show you a couple shots right here
you guys can see it takes very excellent
pictures in fact this is one of the
features that the company really touts
about the phone is its ability to take
great photos and I have to say as you
can see it has that very well especially
for a phone that you can get for under
250 bucks and for those of you wondering
what comes in the box let's real quick
see everything that comes inside the box
of the action 7 many you get the phone
itself you get a cool charging cable
which is USB type-c you get the power
adapter for the wall you get headphones
and the one that I actually got came
with the phone case inside the phone I
think this is actually standard so when
you get your phone you'll not only get
the phone you'll get the accessories and
a nice little case to keep it safe audio
is another feature that most neo
companies that are released in their
smartphones they talked a little bit
about it they don't really know too much
tout about it because most of them have
crappy speakers they don't have the
ability to record highs I mean there are
some that out there we all know there
are but the rows that just don't they
still cost a lot of money you know the
Seven mini however it has stereo
speakers so riding the side so your
stereo sound action you look at your
phone actually
sounds like stereo stuff it has baseman
hats but it actually uses the design of
the phone itself in its aluminum frame
to create a bass like sound so your
sound is quality it's Basie and you can
hear it really well and also it's great
if you're out here recording stuff it
has sound dampening and excuse me I'm
kind of stuttering there a little bit it
has actually sound dampening effect so
if you're out in the concert screaming
loud the suppression the phone is going
to keep those sounds from overloading
the microphones they're actually two
microphones built into the phone and
they both have that feature so whether
you're screaming at it or you're at a
concert outdoor music the phone's going
to be able to actually record that and
handle it very well and I don't know how
this bone actually does it but it says
that it has Dolby Atmos featuring 7.1
audio right on the smart phone so maybe
you could like plug in the set of
surround sound speakers into it and you
could take advantage of all that you
know like maybe you could like run the
phone into like a device for like
running your video and then the audio
could come out you can get that great
step I haven't gotten that part of
testing with it I've only had the phone
for about a week but I'm curious to see
if it actually can really do 7.1 Audio
like it says on the website are you let
me know down below the axon 7 features 3
gigabytes of internal memory and 32
gigabytes of internal storage but you
can expand this because you can pull out
a little slot where you can not only put
in an SD card to get 128 gigabytes of
additional storage you also have space
that's sticking to SIM cards you can
have one SIM card while you're in the
States
or wherever you're at in your area and
then when you travel abroad you stick in
the other SIM card and voila you're up
and going all around the world with the
phone battery life is something that's
also very very important now inside the
7 minute you have a 2705 milliamp hour
battery which offers 15 hours of
talktime 270 hours of standby time and
charging it to the qualcomm 2.0 fast
charge you can charge your phone in
ninety minutes to a full charge and a
half an hour you can have it a 50
percent charge so that's pretty cool you
can almost be up and going with that to
sit around for a long time scratching
your butt wondering when is my phone
going to charge the only thing if you're
a power user or person likes to carry
around multiple batteries the back is
not removable at all the Seven mini so
you can't take the battery out it's
there for good
as far as performance testing we ran
Geekbench which is a standard test the
most everybody runs and we can see that
the score isn't that great due to the
fact the processor is a little bit older
technology but for this price it's still
doing really solid one thing that I know
is kind of a really minut thing but i
think is pretty cool is the ability to
change your wallpaper on the fly so if
you get sick of what you're looking at
turn the phone back on you just simply
swipe your finger swipe it swipe it
swipe it and change it around and for
security features just like other phones
this bone features a fingerprint scanner
or thumb print scanner rather you know
and that way you can be locked out of
your phone and the only way you can get
through it is through biometrics so
unless they cut off your thumb and oh
you know that I'm only joking about that
but it's a great way to keep people out
of your phone and a great security
feature and for a phone you know that
this I considered to be on the lower end
of the spectrum it's pretty nice
currently I've teamed up with
audible.com to offer you guys something
really cool you guys can now get a free
trial for 30 days for absolutely no
money whatsoever audible.com has an

those of you who follow the channel you
guys know that I'm heavily into
music so the first thing I did when I
went over to audible.com is I looked up
books on music and I found a really
excellent one by Tony Iommi now if you
guys don't know him he's the guitar
player from Black Sabbath now this to me
is like one of the very classic metal
bands pretty much the guys who brought
in a whole doom metal genre are these
guys and having a book about him was
perfect for me because all I have to do
is sit back play my guitar and just
listen to the book and he has a lot of
great things to say about his life in
the band and not have to actually sit
down and read it and focus on that
allowed me to just enjoy my life and
still enjoy all the things that he had
to say about his life now you can choose
a book to those same type of things for
your enjoyment now you can just sit back
and listen and enjoy honestly if you try
it once I think you'll be hooked because
it's great when you're driving and like
I said earlier sometimes you don't want
to listen to music at the gym you don't
want to watch news on TV but maybe you
want to hear something cool like listen
to the Lord of the Rings and hear about
their adventure while you're doing yours
