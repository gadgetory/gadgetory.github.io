by audible okay so I know that a bulk of
my audience are just total PC
enthusiasts guys who like the biggest
baddest species with v8s v12s underneath
the hood and just all of the everything
that you can get inside of a case well
what about if you're a person who
doesn't need that v8 v12 engine you just
need something to surf the net check
your email a few light Microsoft games
for you you need something a little bit
smaller than that and what if you're
somebody like me who has a giant
big-screen TV in their living room but
you don't really want a big bulky PC you
just want something you can go real
quick check your email and do all that
stuff well today we're gonna be checking
out the Azul byte plus now this thing is
a relatively really low price PC it
comes loaded with Windows 10 on it and
it's just perfect for solutions for this
type of thing so let's jump in real
quick let's check out the azul by plus
and see why at the end of the day I
think for the money this is one
seriously kick-ass product now you guys
are gonna see that the Azul bike plus is
very small it's actually smaller than
the palm of my hand
so really it's really really tiny but
underneath this little tiny hood it has
enough power to do everything you need
featuring a quad-core Atom processor
that turbos up to 1.8 gigahertz this
thing's ready to rock and roll you get 4
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
internal memory and if you flip it
around to the Rio you can see that this
is fully fledged you've got connections
for every type of thing that you want to
do you've got USB you've got HDMI
you've even got old-school VGA if you
want it so everything's there the design
is also very very minimalistic there's a
simple antenna on the back and the very
front there is just a single power
button and if the onboard 32 gigabytes
of storage isn't enough for you on the
side of the unit there's an SD slot so
you can expand it up to 128 gigabytes
one of the things I really like about
the Azul bi plus is the fact that it
comes pre-installed with a legit copy of
Windows 10 and if you need to connect to
the internet but you've got no access to
a cable the Azul byte plus comes with
this
built-in Wi-Fi now these specs might
seem low to a lot of people out there
but if you're somebody who just streams
movies like I said you use Netflix you
use Amazon Plus any of that type of
stuff this little box is the perfect
companion to that now in my living room
you guys have seen it before I have a
giant screen TV I've been wanting to put
a PC in there for a long time but
because it's just all bulky and won't
fit my glass cabinet I've kind of
avoided it
but this Louie unit fits so well in my
living room that I can integrate it
simply in there without it looking out
of place at all in most of our videos we
do a lot of extensive testing with a lot
of different games however with this
particular system we didn't do that much
testing but we did run Geekbench and we
did run a few of those Microsoft games
which run absolutely fine so like I said
before if you're not looking to you know
play the latest doom or any of that kind
of stuff you'll be right at home with
the Azul bite
if you're with me so far and you like
what you see there's also another
component that you can purchase with
this unit that makes it even more
ergonomic and easy to use and that is
their wireless keyboard and controller
now it's a fully functioning QWERTY
keyboard as well as a remote control so
you can fast forward your music change
your volume do all that stuff or even
type on the internet all through this
little remote it comes into the market
about $29 and we'll have a link down
below it's not the actually most
ergonomic thing to type on but if you're
somebody who's used to typing on your
phone and stuff like that I think you'll
be well at home and think this is
actually superior and looking at the top
of the remote you guys can see that it
has all the functionality to take total
control of your multimedia environment
if you guys follow the channel you guys
know that I've been using audible for
quite a while I started out with it
reading a book by Tony Iommi and now
I've moved on to something really cool
which is how to not suck at guitar I
know let's just face it everybody needs
improvement and with this book it gives
you 10 basic steps to totally improve
how you play and just make you a better
overall player now what I like best
about audible is not only you get the
option of listening to it if you're
really busy you can also download to
your Kindle or to your phone so you can
read it that way you can access it no
matter where you are and whatever style
you want to do it at now what's best of
all right now is you can get a choice of
any book from there mass selection of
things for you to read or listen to and
you can do it for absolutely free for
30-days right now that's right and with
this 30-day trial you get a free book of
your choice for absolutely no money and
right now you can head over audible.com
forward slash tomorrow and start your
free trial today
all right Tech fans so there you have it
the Azul bite plus which I guarantee you
you won't be saying bite me if you get
it now before we bounce out of here
special thanks once again to audible if
you guys want to get that free book all
you got to do is sign up for free for 30
days now this unit while I get the most
is because of the price point because
let's just think about this guys if you
like a legit copy of Windows 10 you
don't want to pirate it you don't want
to do any of that that's a hundred bucks
to 110 bucks depending on
you get it now the Azul is on sale right
now for a hundred and eighty-nine
dollars so you basically take off that
price from $189 and you can see that the
system's almost under a hundred bucks
that's right and if you're a person out
there who actually does the math that's
truly the cost of the system I know
people go out there and go all I can
pirate my windows I can pirate this
compare that sure you can but if you're
a business you're somebody who just
doesn't like doing that you want
legitimacy there's enough power inside
of the bike plus to do all of your
streaming movies to play like gaming and
it's so small and so compact
then it's unobtrusive no matter where
you put it I'm metric you guys been
watching teka tomorrow the only caveat I
can see what this thing is uh it's not
free cuz beyond that I like it I want to
hear what you guys have to say like
usual there'll be a link down below you
guys can check out that free trial
period over inaudible or you can check
more information this product or buy one
for yourself see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
