back once again to tech of tomorrow now
the first thing that's going on here
today in case you guys missed it we made
a really incredible $1200 system that
we're giving to you guys and that
thing's still rolling now we're gonna
announce the winner next Monday fields
people are interested so you guys might
want to check out that video and see
what it's all about we actually use the
PC parts picker and we looked at a bunch
of different parts to create a really
good system for $1,200 to give to you
folks so if you guys missed that you're
gonna want to check that out first
that's before anything else that's going
on to winner simply sign up with the
link below and if for some reason you
guys haven't checked it out yet you're
gonna want to check out unrolled dot
Emmie now this service does is it allows
them to go ahead and remove all of your
unwanted and junk email so you don't get
any of that crap anymore now some people
like this a lot I saw a lot of comments
in the last video where people actually
went out and tried it and they said hey
this actually works pretty well so you
might want to just check that out and
for you Apple fans long awaited news in
the iPod realm that's right since 2012
they've left that technology and it has
not been touched but now it's coming out
with a brand new 64-bit a8 CPU which is
going to be great and you can also get
it in 128 gigabyte version as well as
gold so that's pretty cool stuff
now also there Nano and other products
are gonna have a bunch of new colors but
- pretty much the big news is though is
that hey they've upgraded the platforms
this is great news
since 2012 you know technology has a
tendency to really out date itself
really quickly especially with Moore's
law and now it's getting up bid so it
has fancier better stuff so anybody out
there who's interested type of product
you'll be able to buy one now for better
price and it's gonna be totally upgraded
technology now in addition to gold
there'll be dark blue and pink colors as
well
now the 128 gigabyte model that's on the
higher end that thing's gonna get a
price boost as well as a price bump it's
gonna be coming to market at 399 dollars
so it's a little bit pricey but for you
guys to learn of this product hey I
think you're gonna be happy also
for you folks out there that the cameras
a very important option the camera has
been improved in both versions with the
back shooter now being at eight mega
pick
Souls also both the iPod Nano and the
iPod shuffle are all getting brand-new
color variants so there you have it
Apple fans some news for you this next
story is kind of off the hook and kind
of crazy now few mobile user authors you
might think this is the most incredible
thing in the world pretty much the best
technology right now which is 4k takes
an immense CPU to push on a cell phone
that type of device so Samsung has now
said that they're going to come out with
listen to this
I'm not even an 11 K screen so
first of all first of all Google up
first off no phone that's in the market
right now it had any type of ability of
powering this you'd have to basically
have a power print that you know Jai go
Norma's to power around with the thing
but Samsung they've got a lot of money
invested this project like now millions
of people investing it trying to make
this new 11 K screen which they're
saying could actually simulate 3d that's
right so gonna look at your phone to be
like oh 3d how cool Bob call me in 3d
woo
but here's the thing folks okay for the
average person 4k is the absolute best
that the human eye can interpret that's
right now some people out there there
are some people it's not very many but
maybe they're the future people they can
actually see a little bit more but
without being enhanced either way or
another by enhancement for your body or
through some kind of device how are you
even gonna really see or translate 11 K
so it's really kind of a crazy thing
because that obviously is gonna be some
controversy because if most people going
to see 4k what are we gonna do we gonna
start upgrading everybody just so they
can see the 11 K phone dude do you have
the latest I upgrade or not no bro my
health Penn doesn't doesn't give me that
so I don't know it's gonna be crazy
stuff but check it out
the hair it goes man Samsung has said
they are working on an 11 K screen for
your cell phone they've got millions and
trillions of dollars in it so I don't
know tell me what you guys think down
below and also tell me did you guys
actually know that 4k was the most that
most human people can actually
see I didn't know that so I got an
education and so can you so gamers I
think you guys all know about the Batman
Arkham Knight thing it came out it sucks
so much ass so many people said oh my
god this is the worst port ever
in history I mean it sucks so much ass
that became the ass game it got pulled
completely now check this out rumors of
GTA 5 because of bloated software doing
the same damn thing getting two and
three frames per second even on super
high-end systems heading the same
direction as that so that's pretty crazy
because like I know my son he loves that
game he spends hours there and I'll
admit it is pretty fun it has really
cool aspects to it and I dig a lot of
things about it it is pretty cool
compared to the same old first-person
shooter thing I have to admit it offers
a lot more than that but you can shoot
things but driving around discovering
and stuff hey I like that it's kind of
cool
but all this bloated software's in there
because of people trying to hack into
the game and do stuff so there's all
this code in there trying to peel it all
this code and they're trying to not let
those people do this kind of thing so in
a way it really kind of sucks so just
think about that because people hack
your game because people want to cheat
because people want to do these things
they put so much bloated code in
this game that's now it slowed down like
a beached whale and won't even move so
that's just crazy crazy stuff just shows
you that people out there hackers and
stuff look you do cause problems it's
definitely not in some ways a victimless
crime because won't be for actually
making some of you lose money I guess in
a way it could hurt I mean if I lost my
money somehow
and I couldn't feed myself or pay my
bills is that really victimless I don't
know it's crazy but that's what's going
on I definitely definitely want to hear
what you guys got to say down below in
the comments I want to hear your
comments so let's hear them and last but
not least folks check this out Samsung
Evo 851 terabyte drive for three hundred
and forty-one dollars that's right I
said it
a one terabyte drive for under 400 bucks
that's incredible pricing I finally get
one myself so if you guys are interested
in this you're gonna want to check that
so before I get out of here like usual
