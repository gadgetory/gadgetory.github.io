by 0 &amp;amp; 9 if you're the type of person
who builds a lot of pcs or just changes
the parts out inside their PC quite a
bit having an extra Windows 10 Pro key
can be a lifesaver
especially if something happens and all
of a sudden your registration isn't
working
and right now at 0 &amp;amp; 9 they have Windows
10 Pro for 16 dollars now this is like
84 percent off but with a coupon code
that we're gonna share with you you'll
be able to get the same code for $13
that's right Windows 10 Pro for thirteen
dollars we'll have a link down below
where you guys can check us out on their
website and one thing that's really cool
is you can buy as many keys as you want
alright so you know the deal looking for
a Windows key on the cheap level link
down below alright so it seems like to
me that the r-tx 20 atti came out with
very very mixed results even though
people were very very excited to get a
new video card when the video card came
out it's at $1,300 for the
top-of-the-line founders Edition that
just put a big smooch in everybody's
face
and the fact that even though the card
is called an RT X we still haven't seen
jack shit in the r-tx department I've
seen a patch from Windows I've seen a
patch from Nvidia where's the damn game
patch we're kind of in limbo about that
which kind of makes it a little bit
weird I think that there you know if
there were more games right now or more
news about more things taking advantage
of RT X that we were actually going to
be able to sink our teeth into people
would be a little bit more excited but
even with all that stuff going on
obviously we still have to do SLI
testing and even though I'm very
sickened by the time you guys probably
watched his video I'll be in the
hospital having my leg amputated we did
all the tests because a lot of people
contacted me and said hey Elric we want
to see what your results really say and
I think that you'll really be surprised
at the end of the day for one thing
SLI in the past was something that was
pretty much free as far as the
technology goes because most
motherboards came with their own little
SLI bracket so you could hook them up
well guess what those days are
absolutely gone no more gratis on the
bridge
the bridges start out I think don't
quote me completely here but I think
they're like 39 $49 in the starting
range price and they might all be that
price but they might range but either
way you're still paying money out of
your pocket now for this bridge and the
sli bridge itself it's completely a
thing of the past now they have
something brand-new called envy link and
when I made my first videos and I said
Oh envy link is gonna bring you know
almost double the frame rates a lot of
people scoff and told me oh like you're
full of shit you're a paid fanboy you're
sucking tunica media well guess what now
you can do that same thing to yourself
when you see the results today because I
was like I usually a.m. when I say these
things I was correct sure I make
mistakes like everybody else because a
lot of stuff is speculation but you guys
are gonna see that when envy link
actually works it really kicks ass now
in 1080p obviously the CPU is
bottlenecking the shit out of this but
at 4k hoho
I think you will be really impressed
with the numbers now we've tested 10
different games old to new we tried to
test all the games there were but some
were just so weird it's like yeah all
right now so we decided to test you know
some of the newest games and a little
bit of the older games for those people
out there just want to see what it
really does so real quick let's check
out our test system now we had to go and
build a whole nother test system because
you were having one hell of a time with
their previous one but once again we
built a really nice system with the a
Zeus Prime 370 motherboard 16 gigabytes
of memory this is ddr4 we have an i7
8700 K we're only at stock speeds but we
always keep it so it's over throttling
completely through our tests we've got 2
2 terabyte hard drives and a 240
gigabytes say to drive all nice and cool
the system runs very quiet and we've got
to RTX 28 ET is in sli featuring the
brand-new and v link bridge so with that
said let's rock out to the new benchmark
song and let's check out those damn
scores
so let's first get the elephant in the
room out of the room we obviously know
that buying two of these cards is
literally enough to go out and buy a car
you can buy a car for $3,000 driving
around town the other day I saw plenty
used cards for twenty three twenty four
hundred bucks so literally you could
choose to buy an SLI setup or you can
choose to buy yourself a nice
entry-level car and get back and forth
to work but for those people who are
financially secure who have a really
nice job and all that stuff and play
games in 4k you can see that there's
definitely a difference thirty to fifty
frames per second increase using the env
link bridge on many games and that is
just outstanding obviously if you're
doing 1080 why would you even consider
getting two of these cards it's a waste
of time but I know that many people out
there have said hey you know 4k gaming
is dead well honestly if Nvidia releases
more new titles and has more of these
games software developers work with them
this new NV link could really change
things the way they are all the way
across the board because you can see
with two of these cards 4k gameplay at
great frame rates is definitely possible
with games that support it so other than
the outrageous price tag that's on it we
all know that that's just over the top
if you have the money you're a 4k gamer
and you want to be able to get the
absolute best that you can get including
good frame rates and not crappy
choppiness hey man this could be your
solution
I'm Elric you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow we'll have links down below to
a couple different RTX 2080 eyes you
want to check one out for yourself or
buy one and we'll see you back here in
the channel for more tech soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
