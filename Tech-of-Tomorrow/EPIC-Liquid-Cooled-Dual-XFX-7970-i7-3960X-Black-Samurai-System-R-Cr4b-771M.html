welcome to Tekken tomorrow I'm Eric your
host and why am i doing the antics well

one of our custom-built systems you guys
know we love to custom build systems
make them as best and beastly as they
can be and with that said we're gonna be
showing you a system today called the
black samurai this thing's very
incredible all the way from the inside
out so that any further ado let's check
this badass system out let's rock out
the benchmark song and go go go all
right everybody here we're check-in it
out the black samurai now right off the
bat you guys can see those things
totally water cool we're gonna start out
by talking about the exterior first
starting off we're using the silverstone
raven to case this thing's pretty cool
has lots of room inside of it for all
the stuff that we needed for our build
we're also gonna show you the cool ants
10k 501 that's right there that's the
reservoir we're using pretty cool stuff
with all the bubbles floating around in
it you'll see that we have the Asus
blu-ray player right here for plan all
of our awesome movies and stuff like
that then we'll take a trip along the
top this cover right here actually gets
removed so you can see everything
underneath it and the road also cables
up everything as well it's the silvers
don't label here you go right here
zoom the top of the case is the 2 USB
3.0 ports

cover off you all see the lights going
on underneath when we remove the side
panel where you can get the goodness
here we stopped at the power supply we
have in the back we have a silverstone
power supply in there there's also a
silverstone fan and as we move our way
around the back will sue you guys the
rear i/o with the video cards display
port HDMI DVI closed we're interested
the video cards that you can also see
are both XFX cards so we're using dual
XFX seventy-nine 70s here are the twin
Komodos from Swift tech these are
cooling both of the XFX 79 70s now we're
going to move into the center of the
system the lighting actually looked
pretty cool even though it's in a dimly
lit room now let's get closer
we're using Corsair Vengeance
16-gigabyte quad-core kit and for the
motherboard we have the Asus Rampage for
extreme based off the x79 chipset we
have an Intel 3960 X CPU socket 2011
we're also using hey that's right a quad
radiator the MCR X 20 QP quiet power
quad 4 unjoin 20 millimeter fans inside
like I said about the coin system it's
made up of different parts we have the
mCP 35 X 2 dual pump this is the wide
addition it has two pumps built into one
for our storage drive we have the
Kingston for an 80 gigabyte HyperX SSD
our boot drive is the OCZ
Revo dr3 it's a PCIe SSD with 256
gigabytes we're also using the Apogee HD
block with custom tubing from danger
dead and assorted wiring cables from all
kinds of different places now here we
see the power supply it's Silverstone
