little bubbles floating around in it

player right here for playing all of our
awesome movies and stuff like that then
we'll take a trip along the top this

the XFX 7970 s now we're going to move
into the center of the system the
lighting actually looks pretty cool even
though it's in a dimly lit room now
let's get closer

motherboard we have the asus rampage for
extreme based off the x79 chipset we
have an Intel 3960 X cpu socket 2011
