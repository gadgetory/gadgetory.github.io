back to school so this month we've got
the back-to-school edition of the top
five tech items under $30 and a lot of
them are really cool so let's jump right
in and let's check those products out so
chances are if you're going back to
school one of the very first things
you're going to need is a backpack to
store your books and in today's society
most likely you're going to have
yourself a laptop now the Ascend it'll
hold up to a 16 inch laptop inside of it
and it's made for ease of use you've got
a lot of external pockets to store extra
stuff in on the back you see nylon mesh
material the entire backpack is actually
made of a couple different black
different materials so it's going to go
with pretty much any outfit you have
you're not going to look funky carrying
the thing around and the back straps in
the back they're very nice and soft you
don't have to worry about hurting
yourself or having an uncomfortable
thing hanging around your back while
you're trying to get around school and
it's even got some extra stretchy
pockets on the side so you can carry
your water beverage around with you the
best of all this bad boys under $25 so

we just checked out a backpack that will
store your laptop I know a lot of people
out there are going to have MacBook
products and for those people out there
there's a really cool product right here
called the blockhead sounds kind of
funny but the bucket is actually pretty
cool
now but the blockhead does is it allows
you to take your macbook charger and
with your macbook charge you just simply
slide this little thing on here and now
your macbook charger can simply plug
into the wall and no longer sitting out
like this so somebody can come by and
knock it off break it so it's actually a
really cool ergonomic product it's cheap
it's cool and for you guys that throw of
a Mac laptop admit it you like it it's
cool so if you got a Mac lapping get one
you blockhead blockhead next up we have
some really cool tech for you fashion
folks out there I mean check this out
it's cool necklace that you can wear
around your neck and you can wear to
school just totally mess me this thing
around my neck though is the fuse
chicken right the fuse chicken now what
is a fuse chicken well basically it is
an awesome awesome - a this micro USB
cable that's right standard - micro or
micro to standard and it's made
SuperDuper durable now if your person
out there and you like charging around
ROI devices this thing can be really
valuable you might go oh my god dude I
can get a cable they're like blah blah
okay but here's the thing a lot of the
cables that you get out there they're
cheap and they break this thing's pretty
much indestructible I mean you can twist
it so many different ways that it's
crazy and like you guys saw before you
can also you know be a fashion sense
home boy you know and get all crazy and
ghetto and with your Damji stuff
right here and your NIC yo what's up
what's up geez no I'm just kidding but
hey that's what this product is it's
called a fuse chicken crazy name is the
fuse chicken Titan actually is the model
number of this one and if you're looking
for a micro USB cable it'll charge all
of your Android devices and you want one
that's going to last your ass forever
this is the product you should be
checking out just saying another thing
that probably most of you people out
there have is some type of device that
you're listening to your audio on and if
you travel on you go a lot of places you
want a pair of headphones that are nice
enough to have good sound but not so
quality that you lose them you're gonna
be scratching your head oh my god I'm
going to lose the blank and that right
there is where the jnl wireless
bluetooth headphones come in and not
only these headphones wireless they're
actually noise cancelling as well and
they're only 26 bucks so that's pretty
incredible
we were trying to actually get the video
down to under 25 because this product
was twenty six we just kept it under 30
but these things are really cool they
fit in your ear really nicely they have
nice soft combs I also will not fall out
of your ears no matter what you do as
you can see right here if I go crazy a
bunch of things trying to shake the
junior 100 's off my head and as you can
see there ain't no way they're coming
off my head and they also come with a
cool and convenient carrying case so you
can take these things around wherever
you're going when you don't need to put
them in your ears
the jl 100's are also a marked very
clearly as to what ear each headphone
goes in and all the controls are
conveniently located on the right cup
you have your volume toggle and on the
very top you have your bluetooth
connectivity and power button and the
micro USB charging port is connected
easily on the left hand port so you can
use it with our huge chicken and the
fact there bluetooth there very nice
they can connect very easily to your
Apple device or your Android device and
you
be on the go listening to music all day
long and simple fact is since are under
$30 if you lose them you're not going to
go crazy and go oh my god what did I do
and there are some expensive ones out
there and these things sound good enough
I guarantee this when you put them on
your head you're gonna be like hey wow
not bad for the price and like I said so
many people out there have some type of
device that they want to listen audio on
that this product is pretty much suited
for anybody out there so we're down to
number five and we're still alive
now this next product may be a slight
bit of a controversial product but it's
been featured on NBC and lots of
stations around the world has a really
awesome product for self-protection that
this is called the sound grenade now
what it does is as you engage the sound
grenade engage it rather it emits a very
very very loud sound and unfortunately
there are people out there on college
campuses and things like that and even
you know just campuses everywhere there
are sometimes bullies there sometimes
people who are sexual predators and if
any of those type of people approach you
or bother you while you're at school
well this device right here it
definitely hurts your ears and gets
people aware so if someone's bothering
or whatever you can give yourself the
sound grenade and it will not disengage
the sound until this piece is put back
in so you can pretty much almost just
pull this out if something was bothering
you
toss the damn thing somebody's going to
hear it and unless you go engage it it's
just going to keep making noise it's
funny buddy the dog went to go grab it
and input it so it's pretty funny so me
gets the Camerons we can turn that thing
off but that's pretty much it folks let
Mia engage her as he goes over here and
turns this thing off but a sound grenade
pretty crazy thing great for
self-protection nothing you guys heard
it's really really loud so how are you
guys been watching Tekken tomorrow this
has been the back-to-school edition like
usual all the information about all
