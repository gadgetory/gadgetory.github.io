lurk here on TECA tomorrow we bring you
all the tech all the time now what's up
well you guys all know it was rumored
that the Richland ap use will all come
out and well guess what they have come
out in fact they even got leaked a day
early over on Newegg where we actually
have them to purchase one now there are
six SKUs coming right off the bat that's
right and the highest priced one of all
is only 149 dollars which is the 810
6800 K which I actually purchased but
there's actually five more SKUs that
actually got released
so let's first off let's talk about
those SKUs starting off the six SKUs is
the a4 4000 which has one module and two
cores it is a CPU base frequency of 3.0
a maximum turbo frequency of 3.2 a TDP
of 65 watts and the graphics chip on
this is still yet to be announced which
is kind of funny because it has the GPU
course at 128 and it has the GPU clock
set at 724 megahertz
it also has one megahertz of level two
cache now the top of the line model
which we'll be looking at at unboxing
today is the a10 6800 K it has two
modules four cores a CPU base frequency
of 4.1 a maximum turbo frequency of 4.4
has a TVP of 100 watts and the graphics
processor on board this is the HD 86 70
D which features 384 GPU cores and has a
GPU clock speed of 844 megahertz
it also features 2 by 2 megabytes of
level 2 cache and features maximum ddr3
clock of 20 133 megahertz the street
price of this is up between 150 dollars
and a hundred and forty two dollars we
purchased ours at Newegg for 149 dollars
so if that said folks let's take a close
up look of the new 810 6800 K alright
folks so here you guys have the box now
one thing you guys are gonna trip out is
the top now check it out on top it says
a 10-6 80k now when I first went and got
this thing from will calls oh hey what's
going on here I picked up some new crazy
video card because one of the zero
is a just a miss in there as you guys
can see right here it says 4.1 gigahertz
base clock 4.4 gigahertz max turbo
frequency so I'll spin around not much
the box just says it supports it also
says for its eye affinity sometimes you
can use three monitors right off the
video support out of this apu nothing on
the back worth talking about what
service is AMD a-series AP which is
their new high-end flip it around one
more time it just gives you some
graphics options
it says the a.m. 810 works best with an
HD 66 70 the a.m. 8 works good with that
and then when you get down to the lower
end a 8's it supports lower video cards
like the HD 6450 so last but not least
back to the front and let's begin the
unboxing I don't have a knife to these
folks I have to cheese it up and just go
ahead and use a little tiny little thing
here you know let's just work right what
the hell and pop the cap here should I
see inside the box go ahead and remove
this out here or didn't put in for doom
I don't better Dumba doom but don't put
the boom so we got three pieces here
folks
alright we've got the cooling fan la
deuda la deuda nice plain one here you
know even a name or anything like just a
little number hmm getting cheesy yeah
they're uh AMD just your basic little
clip and mount one that's what you get
and so you also get their little AMD
adventure Micro Devices process a little
users guide thingy just shows you how to
insert it into the socket am-2 buff that
off and last but not least bum bum bum
now Andy still uses pins I'm like in tow
until it has a pins on the board and not
on their processor flip it around let's
see I guess so are you guys and see the
AMD a-series Black Edition which means
going to be unlocked and raid
overclocked what to see how that works
out
now go ahead last but not least and I
will go ahead and try to take the
plastic packaging off here
so we can get the Cameron to get you
guys a nice little close-up of the CPU
so here's a CPU let's see if we can get
to the shot
all right folks so there you guys have
it up close and personal with the new
810 6800 k APU from the folks at AMD we
also showed you the five of their SKUs
that are being released for the desktop
market so we hope you guys like this
like I said before we are going to be
full-on testing this against the
competition from its own realm
plus the Haswell + Ivy Bridge CPUs to
see how the video test against
everything else we all know that
probably Intel as far as this Ross GPU
performance is going to be more powerful
but it's been noted that unless you're
using more than two cards these ap use
will do very very well
even for upscaling and putting your own
video card in so with that said folks
hope you guys like the video if so hit
that like button make me know that I'm
appreciated you guys aren't sub please
do so because we got lots of more videos
coming up here on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
