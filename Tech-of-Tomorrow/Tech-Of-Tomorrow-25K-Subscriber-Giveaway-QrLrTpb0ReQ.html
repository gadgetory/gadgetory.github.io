channel with bloody the dog and Jesus
the cameramen back there in the
background now we had some really cool
for our 25 k sub contest all you have to
be to win this is subscribe to the tech
of tomorrow youtube channel so we get to
25 k we're going to give out some really
cool stuff for the American winner we're
going to give this video card right here
in my hand it's a sapphire 7750 ultimate
edition it plays all the games it's
actually a silent card as well it's a
really cool card comes in to mark about
one hundred fifty dollars you'll be
getting this card and one game code now
for our European winter it's actually
just cheaper to do this crazy way so
check this out European winner you're
gonna get 100 feet are paypal spending
spree that's right goodbye time I check
the scar view it cost me a hundred
dollars so it's just much easier to go
ahead and do it this way so all you
gotta do is be sub the channel hope you
liked the video and hoped i put it the
dog here you know does he give me a bath
here but that's it 25 k sub contest
basically a sub giveaway there's no
contest so that's basically how we're
gonna do it a lot of you guys always ask
out there how we pick the winners yes
that's what we have to do we have to go
into the thing get a bunch of different
names then go pick a winner then go look
and see if they qualify actually make
sure they're a youtuber and a real
channel so yes it's actually a bit of
work to pick a winner it's not just we
go in and just pick some name it's not
like that you are out of your mind so
let's just reiterate this contest we're
giving away this video card and a game
code it'll be for either probably origin
or for steam hopefully you have one of
those accounts and for the European

fifty dollars via paypal and a game code
