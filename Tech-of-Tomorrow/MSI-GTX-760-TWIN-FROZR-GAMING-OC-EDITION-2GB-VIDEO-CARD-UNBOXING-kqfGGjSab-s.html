tech of 2r where once again here 6 a.m.
it's launch day
that's right what do they launch in a
day well today Nvidia is launching their
new gtx 760 card that's right and we
haven't have the reference version and a
version from msi first thing this
morning so you guys are getting your
texas breakfast of filled up with msi
goodness so with that said let's jump in
let's do the unboxing and check out the
carcass we got lots of videos coming
today about the new gtx 760 so here we
have it folks the msi Twin Frozr gaming
geforce gtx 760 we've got their gaming
g-dragon look over here you guys can see
it's the red overclocked edition I'm
going to spin it around real quick this
is going to be important fact inside the
box is just nomenclature though see you
people out there or looking to buy it
you guys can check that out and see what
that is flip it around to the back we
got some fun facts just basically says
your gaming app ez tune easy play it's
going to be if you're overclocking stuff
there Twin Frozr for advanced thermal
design cooler and quieter you guys can
see back here they just have a lot of
stuff about what's going on here shows
different temperatures noise levels so
basically they're saying this card is
going to run cooler and quieter that's
right we all saw their military class 4
Hardware this is just basically saying
they use the highest quality Japanese
high sea caps solid caps chokes all that
good stuff is all made very very good
now it's going to be very very small on
the side of the box right here but you
guys did see us real quick I'm not going
to say it very much but here just all
the fun facts human system requirements
easy specs and that's pretty much it for
the box folks let's jump in and see the
goodness so let's just pop a tab here on
the side of the box pop another tab
right here we have a box inside of a box
like usually how things go
go ahead and just pull that out you guys
can see inside of here on top they have
one box with all the accessories in it
so I will go ahead and first off we will
take a look at the accessories what
comes inside the box so first off we
have the six pin - eight pin power then
we have molex to 6-pin power those your
power cables we have the drivers CD DVI
to VGA and last up the quick user's
guide that's all a stuff that be content
and written review let's move on let's
check out the card now we're gonna do
some little different here folks I've
got both cards right here so first of
all let's take a look at the reference
model card I'm gonna go ahead and pull
that one out first now I have to laugh
at this the reference model came with a
sticker that said 760 and it so that's
pretty much it you know it says GeForce
GTX 760 by Nvidia and you can't really
see it let's just stick on the card but
I thought that was kind of interesting
you guys can see it's an unopened pack
to go ahead and take that out for you
folks right now and take the sticker set
it off to the side just for a second
here you guys right there's okay the
tape right there and let's go ahead and
let's pull the reference card out so
this card is based off the reference
design from Nvidia you guys can see it
uses their old cooling solution this is
just like the previous generation single
blower style right here show you guys
aside I know most you guys have all seen
this type of card before we're just
going to show you guys anyways flip the
car all the way around GeForce GTX dual
six pin power connectors you guys can
also see that the board actually uses a
shorter PCB than standard the PCB is
actually quite shorter we looked at an
asus direct cu card it was one of their
670 mini cards this looks pretty much
like it there are four bolts right here
to disengage the cooling solution
two fins for SLI and obviously the rear
i/o now let's take a look at MSI's which
is totally based on a non reference
design why you guys so ask what's
reference what's non reference reference
is made and designed by nvidia and this
is made by MSI now let's just start the
back here because I know that there are
going to be some comments about this
rootbeer Brown PCB these guys have the
root beer float that day and decide to
change the color scheme because like
usually don't see that so very back you
can see root beer brown color scheme
down from the bottom PCIe to SLI fingers
four bolts again for taking out the
cooling solution let's flip it around
the back there are I oh is exactly the
same as the reference card as you guys
can see they're identical to DVI one
HDMI one DisplayPort but now let's flip
it around at the top now here's where
things get much much different this card
has totally superior cooling on it via
their twin froze a cooling system than
the reference model you can see there
are two fans underneath is a giant
cooling solution lots and lots of heat
fins
there's also heat pipes as we can see
here on the side so basically the GPU
gets hot it goes up into the heat fins
then out through the heat pipes being
dissipated and then blown from the fans
in this open-air design so although he
knows we blow it out and then take it
out to the inside of your case here's
the back of the card you can see more
the cooling solution right here once
again we see one of the heat pipes going
all the way around here flip it around
you guys can see we see the MSI logo and
now this card is different though the
power requirements on this are is six
and eight pin we're on the reference
they were to six pin power connectors so
there is a difference there so that's
all the stuff folks the MSI the
reference we have those here sitting
right next to each other for you guys to
see it's early in the morning I've got
lots of the videos to bring you guys
today on the GTX 760 so let me get my
damn coffee so I can get
back to work see you guys back in the
channel we hope you like this video is
so you guys don't do it that like button
hit it and show us that you love it as
much as we love you and if you're not
subscribed make sure you do because
we're going to have lots of videos today
like I said in the new NVIDIA GeForce
GTX 760 see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
