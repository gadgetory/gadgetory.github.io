once again to tech of tomorrow we're
bringing you all the tech all the time
if you guys haven't been here before
welcome to channel I'm mark your host
and today we're going to be doing an
unboxing and first look of a brand new
r92 ATX toxic edition the people over at
sapphire now you guys pretty much should
all by now know that the new r9 280x is
pretty much just a rewrapped 7970 card
that's right
has 2048 stream processors three
gigabytes EDR five memory three and
eighty four bit memory bus sixty-four
hundred megahertz effective memory
bandwidth this thing's clocked at a core
clock of 1,100 and it's overclocked
automatically to 1150 through its
internal boost stuff so with that said
though let's jump in take a look at what
comes in the box and just a little bit
more about what the cards about let's go
alright folks so here we have the new
box from sapphire now if you guys have
paid attention to sapphire in years past
this color scheme is totally different
than anything they've actually done
before we'll start up here on top where
it says the toxic r9 280x Edition now
something very different about this UEFI
ready so this video cards saying that
with compatible motherboards in Windows
8 you'll actually be able to use the
UEFI motherboard BIOS to check out your
video card that's going to be something
totally different that I've never seen
before or it's going to be its own
separate ufi BIOS I don't know we
haven't got that far yet but it should
be interesting either way over here we
see what I talked about earlier 3
gigabytes of memory overclocked out of
the box
xxx cooling GCN architecture AMD
eyefinity and it's the Toxic edition
flip it around the back just real quick
they just show basically a picture of
the card show some more stuff just talks
about the toxic features the memory is
basically just reiterating what we
already saw on the front so with that
said let's go ahead and pop the cap of
the Box open this nice little virgin box
ok so now I've got this box out so now
we'll go ahead
pop the cap and begin the unboxing got a
little thing on top right there then we
have the card nice and giant size card
some more foam and then down here all of
the accessories let's take a look at the
accessories first if I get the thing out
of here the box here this is a very
interesting urn come on out of there
sucker not really then like this today
alright alright so starting off with the
content first up we have the display
port cable always important if you need
it crossfire bridge got a single one of
those molex to eight pin and molex state
pen so you get two molex to eight pin
power converters mini HDMI to standard
HDMI connector drivers installation CD
little case badge in there as well
information warranty guide all that kind
of stuff paperwork registration number
everything's in the back of this make
sure you register to the sapphire club
because that way your warranty kicks in
so let's get all this out of the way
that is the box content and now let's
move on let's check out the card itself
oh yeah now this is a bad boy I love how
this thing looks now like I said before
you guys can see this is a totally
different color scheme for these guys in
fact I looks very so Tagish the colors
on here look very very arms otech but
check it out we've got three fan design
two outer fans and then a smaller fan in
the center these all run and you can
change the speeds on them and adjust
them to keep your card running cool
actually very very nice down here we see
the PCI 3.0 interface cards obviously
two slot design you guys can see all of
the heat fins and everything underneath
here looming them heat fins running all
the way along the side of the card flip
it around the back end
looks pretty cool right flip around over
to the side to 8-pin power connectors
nice little window here which I'm hoping
lights up we'll know that when we plug
the card in I'm going to flip the card
around here we see the sapphire logo we
have there dual BIOS button right here
on the side catch that little bad boy
right there now let's look at the back
of the card now you guys all know I love
it when they cover the back of the card
with something like this it makes the
card so much better to handle don't have
to worry about touching and shorting out
any of the electricity in the card I
absolutely love this thumbs up for
Sapphire for including this we're going
to flip this around once again you see
the two crossfire fingers flip it around
one more time dvi-i DVID standard HDMI
and two main display ports the stand
that you see on most all of the AMD
cards so that's it folks this is the
card you guys saw what came in the
content and that's everything there that
comes in the box alright folks so there
you have it the brand-new r9 t 280x
toxic edition from the people over at
sapphire you guys can see this thing's
got a pretty cool cooler on it we're
hoping that this thing actually has a
lot better temperatures than even the
other 280 X's that we've seen but so far
all the aftermarket coins been doing a
pretty good job and I'm hoping these
folks will just fall along the same type
of thing we'll have the full review of
this in a few days folks we just got
this in so we got to throw it in the
test bench run those old tests see how
hot it runs see how loud it is and bring
all that information to you good folks

description you guys will find all that
information on if you liked the video
