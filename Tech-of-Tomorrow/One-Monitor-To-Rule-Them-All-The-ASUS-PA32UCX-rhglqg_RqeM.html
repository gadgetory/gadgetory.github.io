here once again with Nick and now we
know that everybody loves the gaming
stuff but what if you're not a gamer but
you are a gamer but you also are a
content creator and you want the best
monitor for producing all of your videos
and doing all your art well these oops
now has this monitor and just like that
video card we saw this is another
product that's a well one of a kind
coming out with the second quarter of
this year second half
pro art right tell us about it because I
mean looking at it it looks incredible
it looks more lifelike than real life
yes so this is a the best that can be
achieved right now longer life so you
had 1200 HP brightness over a thousand
exactly and that's number so many LEDs
will make that possible is the ceiling
so a lot of the top-end each jar
monitors have been 384 zone the backlit
and you're getting almost four times
though the backlighting sevens and which
means complete even lighting everywhere
way and if you're a person who does art
and you're doing stuff like I want the
color spectrum the gamut and everything
in the monitor to be is exactly as it's
being reproduced which means if you're
seeing something and you're gonna be
transposing it like you know in the
digital print or something else you want
to monitor it's gonna be able to do all
that and look exactly like what you're
doing and this is gonna be the best for
them John if you're watching this from
TLD dude you know you want to smother it
even hooks up to max right it's good
it's kind of a connection under hdmi
displayport mine yeah it probably
doesn't translate as well to the through
the camera here but
oh it's a it's amazing all the hair on
the animals everything that's just so
lifelike I don't ever think I've even
seen a TV or anything that looks this
much dental all of the wrinkles and our
spirit and the clothing I'm honestly
blown away by this monitor even though
it's not really for gaming you could
still use for gaming you can do it for
so much money much over man currently
there's not really a price out of this
particular monitor but it is called it's
called the PA 32 you see X and if
there's somebody out there like I said
does a lot of content creation and
especially you know if your personality
of a Mac and you're looking for you know
you don't want to keep using your eye or
your screen and your iMac and they're
okay but this is way better you can hook
it up and just transfer everything over
that and keep going
it works by smacking so whatever turns
off you just smack it'll turn it back on
I'm skipping but all right well cool um
like I said no prices of yep I guess
we'll see it you know second quarter of
next year but thanks for watching thank
you over here with that little thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
