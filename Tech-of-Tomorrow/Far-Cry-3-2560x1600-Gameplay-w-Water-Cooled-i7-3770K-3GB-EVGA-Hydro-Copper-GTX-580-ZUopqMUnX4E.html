tech of tomorrow you guys all know that
far cry 3 has come out now I've been
doing some gameplay so I thought I'd
bring you guys a series of videos
showing you the game and talk about the
system i'm using so behind me i have a
system that's a little bit you know it's
kind of in between generations it's my
ravenclaw system now this thing's got
the gigabyte z77 x dash ud7 inside of it
it's got an i7 3770k it's got 16
gigabytes of Dominator memory this thing
is really really cool it's also got a
580 that's water cooled now the water
cooler is a swiftech one that you can
buy when you buy the car directly from
vga just like i did hmm costly but i
guess it was worth it because well if it
comes to find out that i can't run any
of my direct x games without increasing
the voltage so i had to actually go in
and use the good old program from msi
and increase the voltage to 1125 just to
get the thing to recognize and play
Direct X Games as I was trying to it
before it started failing out so my
system behind me I feel a lot of people
have this a lot of people have
themselves a z77 motherboard a lot of
people have the i7 3770k 16 gigabytes of
memories not that outrageous and lots of
people obviously have 5 80's that was
