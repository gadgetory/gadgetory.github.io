day your body can get jump-started in a
very special way
well it um but anywho uh you know I
jumped the bones today we're bringing
you some news on hump day and I hope
that you get laid
what's going on my friends family and
fans welcome back once again to another
edition of tech o tomorrow now we know
that infra was a little bit kind of
funky but we actually want to show you
guys a little bit about what this iRig
voice does now today we're bringing you
both a news video and pretty much a
product spotlight video all in one we
figured you folks would kind of like
that mixing it all together so we're
gonna bring you a few news stories and
we're also gonna highlight two new
products that we received in one of them
is the I came multimedia this is their
I've voice and then we have over here
the Coolermaster CM storm rapid eye now
this thing is going to be a really
awesome mechanical keyboard and we're
gonna talk about both these parts as we
go through the video but right off the
bat
Nvidia fans it seems like it has finally
been confirmed we will see a new 880 and
870 card from Nvidia very very soon
let's talk a bit about that
according to sweet Clockers and videos
playing to launch its new desktop gtx
800 series no sooner than fourth quarter
this year it seems like the rumors are
true and then nvidia has completely
cancelled the GM 100 chips full-scale
development is now focused on GM 200
parts leaked import/export data from
zumba already revealed that nvidia is
preparing GM 204 processors which is
most likely a successor to GK 104 it is
said that the GM 204 would be equipped
with 8 gigabytes of gddr5 memory and a
256-bit memory interface there might be
a lot of variants on this though as
launch date comes along but one thing we
know for sure is that it's coming and
last but not least we should still
mentioned the GM 20x GPUs are still
using the 28 nanometer fabrication
process it seems unlikely that we're
going to see the 18 20 nanometer
graphics processors this year so if your
Nvidia fans and you've been waiting for
these cards come out and holding your
breath welp you're not gonna have to
hold your breath much longer the war for
video card domination is constantly
going on AMD Nvidia they
love to have it out and hey this only
benefits me and you so like usual all
this information will be down there
below the like button so if you guys
want to sign it anything more about this
read the article you guys can check that
out next up we're talking microphones
that's right the I came multimedia iRig
voice 839 dollar microphone which offers
you an abundance of features and low
cost recording options let's check that
bad boy out the IQ multimedia iRig voice
is a smartphone tablet mic now what this
thing is a basically a $39 microphone
that can be used to basically record
anything you want on the go right
through your phone right now there's
software available for the iOS that
allowed you to record your voice to add
effects like you guys saw in the
beginning of the video and just
basically do anything you want with a
simple portable package now since this
thing's only $39 the investments really
very low to get into and they also
feature a product called the I loud you
could basically take this microphone
take it on the go and have a portable PA
using that so for $39 you get you guys a
mic that can work directly into your
phone it's gonna work with both the iOS
and Android and be one of the most
coolest little portable recording things
that you can get now it's not totally
pro level but it is really fun next up
in the news last week was III and a lot
of things got released last week but one
of the really cool ones was something
that valve found out by a third-party
company that's developing a product
called the steam boy now the steam boy
is something really cool it's basically
like a Vita but a little bit different
now this handheld console looks a lot
like a combination of Sony's mobile
gaming system and the latest steam
controller and it also has the ability
to play a majority of the current steam
titles that are available the steam boy
boasts much of what you would expect in
terms of controls with eight-faced
buttons for triggers two rear buttons
and two steam controller like touch pads
it has a 5-inch 16:9 touchscreen and
packs a quad-core CPU four gigabytes of
RAM and 32 gigabytes of built-in memory
to work in conjunction with steam
streaming functionality this will be
just enough juice to handle most of your
favorites team titles although exactly
aren't available at this time according
to the developers steamboy is about as
powerful as a PS Vita and Nintendo 3ds
compared to their HD console
counterparts as far as the release date
go we're actually going to see this
product that's still kind of up in the
air but this does sound like a pretty
cool project for gamers who like to be
on the go with all kinds of things out
like the shield and products like this
this is a product that could hit the
market and have a very valuable spot
depending on how well it does when it
comes out I want to hear you guys

spotlight let's take a look at one of
cooler masters latest products this is
their new CM storm rapid eye mechanical
keyboard the coolermaster CM storm
