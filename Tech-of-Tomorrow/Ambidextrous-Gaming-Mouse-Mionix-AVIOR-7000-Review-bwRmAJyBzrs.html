Squarespace what's up Internet Kevin
here on TECA tomorrow it's been just a
little while since my last video I know
but today I'm bringing guys a new
accessory review we're talking about the
mionix a V or 7000 ambidextrous gaming
mouse now as the name implies the big
draw of this mouse is it symmetrical
ambidextrous design we're going to talk
about the benefits and drawbacks to a
design like this as well as what other
strengths weaknesses the mouse has so
let's check it out
so to begin with I want to talk about
the main thing that's been advertised
and marketed about this mouse and that's
the fact that it is an ambidextrous
Mouse now what makes it ambidextrous is
the fact that it is perfectly
symmetrical it's got the same kind of
curvature on both the left and right
side it has identical buttons on each
side and the only case you're having
just a single copy of a button without a
twin is when it's in the direct middle
which is where we have the scroll wheel
and a pair of buttons that are initially
pre-programmed for adjusting your DPI
settings with preset settings of four
hundred sixteen hundred and seven
thousand epi now what's great about this
is the fairly obvious point that it's
well ambidextrous it works just as well
in your left or right hand but what's
really a great about the aviorans it's
actually really comfortable while being
ambidextrous there's a lot of mice out
there that go for an ambidextrous design
but it just doesn't fit your hand all
that well in the left or right it just
ends up feeling uncomfortable either way
but the avior actually feels pretty
solid in either hand what's also really
cool about its design is that it's
curved just right to where it also works
for multiple different style of handling
options if you like using more palm grip
or a claw grip style on your mouse it'll
work either way with the havior so if
you yourself are ambidextrous or you
find yourself having to switch between
your left and right hand often or if
you're just in a household where
multiple people are using the same
computer and have different hand
provinces than the Avior is an excellent
option thanks to its biggest strength
which is of course its versatility now
the problem is when you focus on
versatility you inevitably have to give
up on specialization the fact of the
matter is that no matter how comfortable
the havior is for an ambidextrous mouse
it's still not going to be as
comfortable as a mouse that's
specialized specifically for your left
or right hand and it's not just a matter
of how comfortable the grip is either
button placement also becomes an issue
when you do this whole mirror image
thing you end up having two buttons
available to your thumb which is
comfortable and normal to use but then
you have two more buttons they have to
use your ring finger for which just
doesn't feel nearly as intuitive so you
practically cut your macro options in
half to reiterate the AVR 7000 is a
really really comfortable ambidextrous
mouse it's just that these are the kind
of issues you're gonna have to deal with
when you're debating between purchasing
an ambidextrous mouse or one that's
specifically for your right or left hand
so the arguments for and against
ambidextrous design out of the way let's
talk about the other
and downs of the AV or 7000 first off
its strengths one of which is it's great
customization app and options the
customization software for the AVR is
easily some of the most user friendly
and nice looking software I've ever had
to use for a mouse each option is clear
it's easy to find and tweak what things
you want to mess with and the AVR covers
all the important basis for
customization you can store up to three
different dpi profiles as I mentioned
earlier setting them anywhere between 50
and 7,000 dpi you've also got options
for scroll speed double click pointer
acceleration pointer speed liftoff
distance macro programming and
assignment and of course that
all-important option everyone loves in
lit up designs color options allowing
you to do any color you want in the RGB
spectrum have it cycle through colors
have the lights stay solid blink or
pulsate and even choose to have only one
of the two lights on in the first place
one option I would like to see that's
not present on the customization
software though is being able to assign
different colors to your different DPI
settings you can do it in a sort of
roundabout way by just assigning
different main DPI settings and colors
to different profiles and then just
replace the DPI change buttons with
profile switching but it just wasn't
really nice to have a simpler option of
being able to know what dpi you're using
based on the color your mouse currently
is now one other downside I want to
bring up although honestly this is one
that is a bit of a matter of personal
preference is just how light the mouse
is it feels really hollow on the inside
and whatever kind of plastic they used
just feels flimsy to me almost as if if
I grip it too tight or mash on the left
click too much it's going to end up
shattering now obviously this hasn't
actually been an issue because I'm not
showing you images of a pile of scrap
but it's just something out the way it
feels that's bothered me since day one
so overall the AV or 7000 is a solid
Mouse it's got great customization
options it's really comfortable for
being an ambidextrous design and it's
got this really good plain simple black
sleek look to it if you're a dedicated
gamer who's right-handed and there's
going to be a lot of other options worth
looking into online but if you want to
be able to use both hands comfortably or
if you're left-handed and you're
struggling to look through what few
options are out on the market then the
AV or 7000 is a great option it's MSRP
of 107 75 is a little on the high side
for me but you can find it on a lot of
websites including Amazon available as
low as 70 99
