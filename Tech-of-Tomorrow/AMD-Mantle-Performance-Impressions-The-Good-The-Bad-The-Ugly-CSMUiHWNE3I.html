plus for a free extended two-week trial
period pet / hulu plus com /t OT gamers
and for those out there
who spend almost all day long playing
games and for those who are AMD fans
welp you can say that the shiz nika's
literally hit the fan because mantle it
hath arrived in this video is all about
mental what it tastes like what it
smells like is it yummy is that tasty
mental sandwich now case you guys don't
know the 14.1 beta drivers the catalyst
ones came out from AMD we also have
those linked down below in the
description in case for some reason you
don't have them currently right now star
swarm and battlefield 4 the only games
right now that can actually take
advantage of this API know the r7 and r9
cards that are out right now those are
all supported you can also use the 7000
and 8000 series gpus as well as the 810
and a eight 7000 series ap use now for
those out there were completely clueless
or going hey what is mantle well mantle
is a new type of API like OpenGL or
direct decks only this one comes
directly from AMD and it's meant for
game developers and gamers alike to be
able to take more control over their
gaming environment now the initial
perception is that mantle allows a much
higher amount of draw calls per frame
resulting in a significant boost in GPU
performance across all AMD video cards
the reality is mantle is geared to
improve performance by reducing the
workload on the cpu what the actual
results are however are this performance
gains depend on how CPU heavy the game
is and should offer bigger improvements
users with entry to mid-level processors
so essentially it's this the people who
are going to see the most significant
boost are those people who have actually
lower end CPUs why is this well because
if you're taking all that information
off that it's not going to matter if you
have a super high-end CPU or low n CPU
which means you know you save money so
you've got an entry-level CPU high-end
GPU a lot of people
always talk about this especially in
system builds like hey put all the money
into the GPU and basically screw the CPU
just put the money the GPU well now you
will actually be able to take advantage
of that and it will become a reality
when you'll be able to offload all the
stuff from the cpu on to the GPU your
cpu's not really going to matter and
that's one point about mantle that I'm
really looking forward to seeing in the
future few folks who follow the
challenge you've probably seen our test
bench if not i'll have a link back here
behind what you guys can actually check
out the video of our new test bench it's
actually really cool we're using an i7
4770k I know this isn't probably the
best platform for doing it but we've in
all other testing on it and we're using
this lovely gigabyte 290x card on it for
our testing and you'll check out our
results and we think they're pretty good
for initial results from mantle we're
looking forward to more in the future
but for now initially let's just check
that out so the first game up is
battlefield 4 on its ultra settings now
we had our monitor at 1440p the first
score is directx 3d where we saw 58
point 12 average frames per second we
switched over to mal we see 60 1.87
average frames per second so not really
much there at all now in 1080p with
DirectX 3d we saw 86.7 t6 average frames
per second why with mantle we saw 92.6
seven average frames per second so not
too much of a jump there at all in
battlefield 4 with our test setup now
one thing to take note of folks mantle
does not work with fraps so if you're
out there trying to figure out hey how
the hell do I calculate my frames per
second check out our link down the
description will have that information
for you folks as well now the next game
benchmark we used is called star swarm
this did not require fraps whatsoever
and with that using mantle we saw almost
20 frames per second of an increase now
that's pretty cool considering that
we're using the i7 4770k you can see 20
frames per second hey that's nothing to
snuff at now usually in the past when I
went out and I bought a bunch of video
cards and tested them you usually see
about 10 frames per second per card up
grain which means if you out of 280 and
you have to like a 280x you see 10
frames per second well with this it
would be like going up 3 cards because
you're getting you know 25
per second so instead of getting
yourself you know AMD 290x it would be a
to 90 x plus plus so that's actually
really cool I think for people out there
with AMD cards you're going to be pretty
damn stood with this information and
these scores so it's a score up and for
mental I think that's pretty damn
significant for right out the gate so
far we've talked about all of the good
things about Manta but now let's talk
about some it's a bit controversial and
kind of on the negative side but it's
actually more default actually of dice
they've admitted so than actually AMD
and what's this well what's happening in
battlefield 4 and we actually the
screenshots down below to show you guys
is that even though the frame rates
might be increasing the quality of the
picture is decreasing now this is kind
of like I'm not really a good thing i'm
sure dice is going to pick up their game
you like that one dice going to pick up
their game and they're going to fix this
but right now there's a little bit of
controversy around that I know many
people play battlefield 4 so few folks
out there you've noticed this hey man
leave me a comment down below and let's
see you know what your experience has
been but overall from what I can see
mantle out of the gate is a pretty good
success now before i bounce on out of
here i want to give a huge shout out and
thanks to hulu plus for making this
video possible and for supporting the
channel so i know many of you pc users
out there know what hulu is but do you
guys really know what hulu plus is
because who plus is like a whole
different level hulu plus is like taking
that standard video card slap on the
water cooler on it and getting the
absolute most bang for your buck just
all kinds of content now with the
standard who you can only watch it on
your pc but with hulu plus baby you can
take that on the go on your tablet on
your phone with little plus you can
catch up on current shows binge on old
favorites or watch a great movie stream
as many TV shows and movies as you want
anytime anywhere you can also check out
exclusive content including
originals like the wrong mans and behind
the mask best of all you can watch all
of this content and HD now I know a lot
of people always ask how can you guys
support the site well at this time you
can support the site and get your guys a
free extended trial period just by going
to hulu plus com ford / t OT where you
can enjoy food plus for two weeks so
that's it folks that's what we have on
mantle coming out of the gate from AMD I
feel personally that it's more of a whim
than a lost in any way at all and even
though dice may have you know crumbled
on the game right there a little bit i'm
sure they'll pick things up and fix all
of these problems now for you folks out
there I know you guys have lots and lots
of different systems out there and we're
gonna have an article in this over on
our website wtae.com which will be down
the description as well we want to hear
from you folks you know how we love to
interact with you post give a big
virtual hug doll you guys let me hear
what your guys's system and what you
guys have seen from mantle thus far we
love to hear your opinions we want to
know what you guys are seeing me because
there's a broader much more of you
people out there there is us we have our
test system way of what we do here but
there's a whole world and all view
people around the world or AMD fans are
out testing the crap out of this right
now so we love you if you're not
subscribed to challenge you like what
you see here make it hit on that like
button and also subscribe to challenge
will see you in your news box every day
see
