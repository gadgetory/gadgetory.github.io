hell is up with that in fact by doing
this steam has actually opened up
Pandora's box of problems so check this
out it all began with steam saying hey
we'll pay people for doing their mods
okay that's all good you know I think
that a modder guy should get paid but
the only problem is this what happens
and you start borrowing content from
other people how do they get paid and
what are the real legal issues about
this well this guy named chesco was
basically he was the snow ball that
rolled down the mountain and became a
giant freakin fiasco because what did he
do we'll check it out he created a
fishing mod for skyrim you think it's
simple enough thing right fishing mod
nice and easy only problem is this guy
borrowed somebody else's stuff to make
this mod now he checked with attorneys
he check was steamed we have checked
with god I don't know he should have but
you know he went ahead and death he put
his foot in the water those wounds
golden look because people were just
freaking 41 they'd pay for it and two
when the guy found out who's mati barred
from that guy was pissed as well so
Steve pulled that thing right out of the
water oh so basically you know this guy
found out right off the bat that to
making of mods not that simple to do now
I'd be okay with paying somebody for a
mod if there were better parameters
right now what could happen is you could
pay somebody for a mod that guy could
decide he can give up on it and when
they update the game you're out of
luck you paid your money and then you're
like what the that doesn't even
work with my game able what did I pay
for so there has to be many more things
implemented in place to take to care of
all these problems first of all if
you're going to be using somebodys
technology that they did you have to pay
them and there's gonna have to be laws
in place and parameters balancing all of
this out right now it's like feel
blessed
just going crazy and users I mean who
gamers frickin pissed off they are
really pissed off they're saying case
team we are not going to come we're not
going to buy our game so many
anymore we're going to go over like GTA
2 and all these other places and buy
their game of the third party vendors
they're saying no way jose and in fact
there's a petition going on their heads
over 50,000 people already saying look
you steam yeah kind of painful now
personally thing is gonna blow over and
I'm not against paying like i said but
we're gonna have a pole and we're going
to let you guys give your opinions tell
us why well why not it should be or yes
sir and no this will be over on our
website www marcom you guys also a 350
dollar steam game code that's right so
get a free game go just for going over
there it will be announced on the
website within 14 days so like I said a
lot of crazy stuff one thing that you
say right now though you go out and you
get a mod it's all free so if it doesn't
work you know you're like hey whatever I
didn't invest in it and another thing is
is this guy create this mod and with all
the legal issues and everything they
didn't pull it they just pulled it from
being sold you can still get the mod in
the workshop for 3 and usually when you
go and lace type of things they have a
little click box and it says hey would
you like to donate some money and most
people agree that that's the way it
should be now I'm cool with that but I'm
kind of on the fence like i said if
there would be parameters that said that
if i bought this mod these guys gotta
constantly updated they got to make sure
it works with all the gaming stuff and
we were guaranteed that my money was
good not beast you know wasted i would
be down and you would be down probably
too the big problem is now this guy made
it look they pulled it steam refunded
the money but it's still it made people
out there Goa hey this is really a not a
good subject right kind of
another quick thing to take note of rock
star says that they are hands off when
it comes to modding they don't care with
you pay for it wear this for free they
just don't want to deal with it they say
it might lead to somebody hacking the
game or maybe the products coming out
doesn't fit with the vision that they
have with their gaming
series so you can know that Rockstar
says hey no way to mods period
personally I'm dead of against it I
think mods are kind of cool Skyrim was
badass in GTA 5 have all kinds of mods
 I want to use them i'm sure you
guys do to write down blood like button
hope you guys liked this video and you
guys would get involved and let me hear
your opinions because what you guys are
the gamers and the fans and it really at
the end of the day it's all up to you
i'm just a map that kind of brings it to
you right but you guys the fans the
gamers you guys are what matters so hey
do you guys think that mods are worth
paying for or do you think they should
be free inquiring minds like mine the
rest the world want to know and we're
going to give one individual a 350
dollar game code from steam or if you're
totally pissed off at scheme you want to
deal with that then you can go somewhere
else and we'll give you a game code for
there so it's no problem basically you
give us your time one lucky guy we'll
announce it on the website within 14
days you'll see us there like usual all
this information will be down there
below that like button or hopefully you
guys will hit it so you go down there
hit that like button it to show me more
button that is the kick-ass thing to do
what kickass thing is you check that out
crippled man can kick you see my foot
say you always want to see this but
there it is look I'd be fast hey you
