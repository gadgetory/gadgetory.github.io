card manufacturer out there whether it
be
AMD or Nvidia there's always a lot of
hype a lot of speculation a lot of
people saying things but I find it
really kind of funny with all the latest
stuff that's going on about the RT X
series of cards I mean a lot of people
have made all these SuperDuper negative
videos and they've getting a lot of hits
on them for beating up on these guys can
guess you know I guess everybody loves
to see the big guy
you know get kick so if you're making a
video about kicking the big guy and even
if it's just hype and not true people
seem to really like those kind of videos
and that's just kind of funny because I
see those same video cards coming out
now about RT X but then on the other
hand I've seen some you know rumors
saying that these cards are going to be
you know 35 to 45 percent faster than a
1080i and let's just stop right there
okay how can you make a video okay and
complain that it's 35 to 45 percent
faster than a 1080i I mean how is that a
bad thing how is that something you know
if that actually pans out to be true and
honestly I think the cards are making
their way to us I believe that I will
have my hands on a card very very
shortly and then after that we'll find
out the exact MDAs with the briefing and
all that stuff but I think very soon
will actually have the real information
for you but if the new cards turn out to
be that they're 35 to 45 percent faster
that's a large improvement huge
improvement
usually like I've said there's usually
about 10 frames per second difference
between a different model car which
means if you buy a 10 60 you know it'll
be at you know 50 frames per second you
buy a 10 70 it'll be at 60 you know all
the way up that's kind of how it's been
it's not exact rocket science but if you
go back and you look at the testing
between anybody testing cards over the
years you'll see that that really is a
nice average point for so if you're
going to be getting something that's
going to be you know way higher than
that you're going to be getting like you
know what 30 to 40 more frames per
second because I'm hearing stuff also
that you're going to be able to do fork
90 frames per second with all the bells
and whistles turned on now if that turns
out to be cool I mean and true that's
excuse me if that turned out to be true
that's gonna be some really cool stuff
right but still we have all these sites
out there basically saying you know oh
RTX is a scam ray-tracing is bullcrap I
even saw a video where some guy said
there's no such thing as ray tracing I
mean honestly another can you even
say that like there's no such thing as
ray tracing like ray tracing is pretty
much the entire backbone of 3d and 3d
gaming without a ray traced element and
a skeleton and everything that you're
working with you're not even gonna be
able to put the rest of stuff on your
image to build your image so I mean I
don't know how these people are coming
out and saying this like I said in my
other video I was really expecting what
RT X to do is pretty much just be able
to have almost the same gameplay
possibly as a 1080i but with all the
bells and whistles completely turned on
hair works everything every every Bell
whistle and super thing that makes it
more like you know reality you could
turn on but you wouldn't have to
sacrifice anything whatsoever in frame
rates but now I'm hearing no personal
performance could be 35 to 45 percent
but that's even more framerate so if we
can play 4k and we can do that at 90
frames per second with everything turn
on I think that's a win now I know that
you know $1,200 for the top-end card is
a lot of money like I said you can get a
you know the lower model it's like $1000
still a little bit pricey if you're
thinking about this we're talking about
a really super duper pal for card here I
mean this card is gonna be really
powerful if touring technology and r-tx
turns out to be even close to what the
rumors are actually saying they're going
to be I think that's a complete win all
around now I know it's pricey that's
what everybody is really going to bitch
about is going to be the price it's
always going to be the you know the
bitch about the price but the latest
technology always cost the most money
and even though on Tom's you know Tom's
our Oracle the guy talked about you know
if you wait long enough for new
technology to come down in price you
know it gets cheaper and affordable I
mean obviously when it's brand-new
technology it's going to cost you you
know and
a leg or a kidney you know but after
it's been out a while it's been the
market the market saturated stuff gets
lowered new stuff comes out and that new
stuff will be the most expensive stuff
so honestly buying bleeding edge
technology stuff unless you're a rich
guy it's probably never ever the best
place to be always buying probably last
generations best stuff it's probably
your best bet if you're gonna be buying
something because you're gonna get all
the benefits of all that stuff which was
great just you know really literally
usually like a year behind only now
we've seen these two-year delays before
you know a video card gets released
before was like every six months every
years now it's like every two years and
with AMD we're waiting and going okay
well where's the new card coming but
anyways it's really just strange how
everybody points their gun at Nvidia and
just says oh all this bad stuff and if I
see anything good about Nvidia then
obviously I'm a paid Jill I'm paid for
by Nvidia I just slap that off I've
never gotten a symptom ever it's just
kind of funny that people say that so
unless I really beat somebody up and
drag the dirt and try to like do their
dirty laundry and act like I'm the
National Enquirer then you don't want to
hear it but I mean the bottom line is is
everybody has an opinion and they're
just like your butthole
they all smell everybody's opinion
including mine should always be taken
with a grain of salt because nobody has
the answer to anything and the way I
view something even the way I would
taste of food or view something or smell
something is different now somebody else
is going to be out there so there's
always going to be differences of
opinion I think that the new 2080 cards
of 2080 I are going to be really nice
cards I think they're gonna be pricey
yes but if they come out to the market
and they're available that will be
what's actually better what a really
suck is that these cards come to market
and then all the sudden all the miners
buy these cards and so all of a sudden
there's just no cards whatsoever again
so that means you're gonna see a card
that you know Nvidia released the market
at $12.99 being sold at $26.99 and
that's literally how the numbers were
before so if that happens it's gonna be
a really crappy crappy market and if AMD
doesn't release something really soon to
counter that it's going to really suck
for gamers
even worse and things are now because
you won't even be able to afford a video
card now will that completely kill PC
gaming no I won't kill it but it's sure
gonna bring PC PC gaming down a notch
most people will only be able to afford
a PC that's a little bit better than a
console because otherwise you'll be
spending an arm or a leg on a video card
i mewn go out and get a console I've
seen PlayStation 4 for cheap man under
like I think I'd seen one for like 210
bucks the other day on eBay on one of
their specials so you can get you know
one of the latest Xbox is one of the
latest PlayStation fours and not even
have to pay a lot of money so video card
prices get too doggone much money well
people are gonna be shifting away from
PC gaming and back onto consoles you
know because it's just gonna become
unaffordable hopefully that never does
happen hopefully AMD comes up with the
counter card that blowers the price
point for us again to hell I mean excuse
me forcing Nvidia to do the same thing I
didn't know if it's gonna happen I hope
it's going to happen and if the cards
really do like I said perform 35 to 45
percent better how is that really a bad
thing honestly it seems like we've
become really spoiled as gamers we want
instant gratification we want the
absolute best stuff in the world we
don't want to pay it we want to be able
to eat caviar but pay for a dollar
McDonald's special and that's just
really not how things are but it seems
like that's a lot how the mentality is
of these days of many people out there
they just expect so much from everything
if it doesn't give them absolutely
everything they think it should have
even if that's not reality based then
that company sucks and NVIDIA gets
crapped on a lot about that particular
stuff they make enough mistakes of their
own in business and do stuff that just
seems a little bit like questionable
like all companies do because there are
corporations and that's just what
corporations do watch a movie
corporations are generally evil they're
out for money Nvidia even though I like
working with them they're easy to work
with they are at the end of the day a
corporation so hate corporations don't
hate our need corporation in particular
because they're pretty much all the same
Nvidia they make video cards for the
gaming environment and obviously want to
try to make as much money as
can just like the gas company tries to
charge you the most they can charge you
for gas obviously if people can pay that
money for gaming cards and they're
willing to pay that much money for
gaming cards then they'll sell and like
I said pre-sales pretty much sold out
out people said Oh what if they only had
10 cards these guys don't make no 10
cards if you know anything about PC
industry they have to order good
out of these cards right out of the gate
to get them manufactured at a price they
can afford
they don't walk in and go ok hey you
know what check it out man want to do a
pre-sale can you whip out like you know
20 30 cards for us thanks bro it's not
like that these guys are buying
thousands upon thousands upon thousands
of cards so that the people can make
these cards for them get them to market
and sell them so it's all about money at
the end of the day AMD is exactly the
same I know the AMD fans hate to hear
that they get all mad but AMD is the
same thing they do their own shady stuff
AMD's usually just guilty of super duper
hype you know they pretty much take a
lemon and say hey it's a super limited
with supercharge your life and that's
pretty much my only really thing with
AMD is there's too much hype around it
you always hear that we're going to beat
them next time we're gonna drive them to
the grave and yet I really don't see it
happen that often so there you go folks
kind of a weird kind of you know kind of
off the strange video but I just start
thinking today by still watching these
videos about Henry's is making a video
about you know how RTX is basically the
devil you know it's like oh my god and
Vidya is the devil with r-tx and really
they've already sold their cards when
they come to market they're gonna sell
and for us as gamers it sucks but think
about it if miners buy all their damn
cards all Nvidia is gonna do is kick
back and say I see my account number
