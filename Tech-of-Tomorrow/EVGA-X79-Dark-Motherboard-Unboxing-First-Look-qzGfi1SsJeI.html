back to tech of tomorrow we're on
location in Los Angeles California where
it's nice and beautiful out here tons of
trees and we're bringing you guys the
unboxing and first look of the brand new
EVGA dark x79 motherboard with that said
let's pop it
alright folks are like usual and any
good unboxing i'm going to show you the
front of the box you guys can see it's
the EVGA x79 dark now this is for the
high in LGA 2011 chipset but this is
also going to support the brand new ivy
bridge-e cpus that are coming out very
very soon and it will have more news on
that later now as we spin the box around
the side of the box we can see here a
lot of the important details about it so
let's start the side of the box right
here we see the onboard CPU temperature
monitor the EVGA elite tuning utility
the passive at chipset heatsink the poss
cap capacitors is all high-end
components EVGA easy voltage read points
this is we're going to be able easily
hook up things and read all the voltage
on your board for doing overclock and
stuff like that 12 phase pwm power
conditioning good stuff triple x 0
support most motherboards have one some
have to this actually has three next up
is the PCIe disable switch which is used
for troubleshooting your computer it
looks like and then we have the onboard
Bluetooth connector now let's go ahead
and just flip it around and show you
guys the back of the box just gives
information about it says a new error
and high-performance motherboards has
arrived with an EVGA x79 dark this
motherboard was redesigned from the
ground up Tov the ultimate in
performance features and overclocking
the EVGA x79 motherboard features a
redesigned vrm that offers the best
overclocking possible improved PCIe lane
distribution for better performance
supports up to eight dims of memory and
the intel gigabit land and more member
folks is just the unboxing i'm trying to
like kind of go as anal as possible for
some people like that here go the key
features just have the cameron run down
there it shows the stuff will be doing a
full-on build reviewing everything on
this get the free overclocking utility
we talked about the elite before 90-day
step up program warranties awesome EVGA
twenty four seven support I just want to
go back to this to the 90-day step-up
program that's kind of cool although I
don't think in something like this you
really be getting a better boredness I
think you're already at the top last up
the last side of the box just have some
more things talking about the company
saying the number one seller of nvidia
based products in America all the way
down all their awards and stuff then
down here is what's going to be really
right down here is the part number so
for those people who aren't in
purchasing this will have a link in the
description down below but here it is
for you folks that are really curious
with that said I'm going to go ahead and
pop this little tape off right here
didn't get to bring a trusty knife with
me today so I'm going to do this the
old-fashioned way and just kind of just
you know rip the sticker here and then
begin taking everything out of the box
I'm really looking forward to smother
board I have a lot of Sandy Bridge
processors but I'm waiting for something
different to come out do you guys all
know about but this thing will work with
a 3960 3970 any of the old LGA 2011
Sandy Bridge processors but it will work
with the future as well so here's the
box it came in I'm going to go ahead and
pop the cap right at the top we have the
EVGA x79 dark motherboard installation
guide it's going to tell you all the
different things about the motherboard
how to install it its features here is
the driver CD and inside of the plastic
package you can clearly see a case badge
named EVGA so we'll go ahead and get
that out of the way close that up we
also have another type of installation
guide this one's in pictures and
everything now here folks you can pretty
much see everything that's going to be
on this motherboard the eight lanes the
different bios vvg a easy voltage the
CMOS clear everything is clearly shown
here there's two entel controllers and a
Marvel controller as far as your SATA
ports go you can also do quad sli you
have 12 16 x 28 x and a single four x
pci you for lane so this is pretty
interesting stuff here I'm just going to
go ahead and get that out of the way
though we'll move on now here we're
moving to the main accessory packs and
it looks like this motherboard came
fleshed out with a lot of stuff so let's
just begin and do it one by one first
off single SLI bridge
this is your x79 dark this is for
supporting your video card then we have
the quad sli bridge that's right look at
that beastie thing although we're
looking for using something else from
actually EVGA for doing that connection
cables for all your hot wire stuff all
located right there very easy this is
your probit cable like I said for doing
your electronic stuff then we have a
triple SLI bridge just a lot of stuff in
here the backplate very very heavy duty
see it says LGA 2011 BP standing for
backplate very very tough very heavy
duty and we've got the rear i/o shield
you guys can see that in there the old
Rio Rio shield breakout cable box for
two USB 3.0 ports standard USB 2.0
breakout bracket with four USB 2.0 ports
and this thing's got a lot of USB ports
these right here are molex to SATA power
converters so you get some of those in
there that's kind of interesting you
don't really see that coming out too
much then I actually came and see us win
is so I'm going to go ahead and have to
take this another plastic package
because I can't see what it is okay so
here we have pair of SATA cables
molex to SATA and then this right here
is your GPU link cable so I'm taking it
now you're going to be able to connect
your video card directly to the
motherboard I think that'll be
interesting so that's basically all the
accessory pack now I'm very new to this
motherboard I just got this thing
yesterday we want to make sure that we
got this up very fast few folks so now
let's get to the motherboard and I just
want to say right off the bat this is
probably one of the heaviest
motherboards that I've actually ever
felt in my hands it's very heavy go
ahead and just take the back sticker off
let me move that and now we'll take the
entire board out of there and we'll set
it down and who has a really really cool
fresh car smell so let's check this
thing out now starting off the very top
10 charges go ahead and angle this the
very top up here you guys can see 8 pin
power connector components back behind
there right here you've got your probe
located right there on the top of the
memory now like they said there's two
things of memory on each side eight
different dimm slots incredible memory
support I don't know if you guys ever
saw the Red Dawn system but we had like
an amazing 96 gigabytes of memory in
that bad boy will we do the same here
maybe so let's just flip it around the
side here we can see the reset and start
button for those people are going to be
using the boards on an open test bench
and they're very very nice looking and
they're in dense when you press them in
your favorite kind of touch the top
there they're very well made next that
we see the CMOS reset switch then we see
the post led the first of many of the
fan headers to flip it over to the side
you guys can see now they have a
completely angled 24 pin power connector
that's really nice a lot of people have
actually been trying to do that lately
it's really good to see that ebj is also
adopting this type of model to their
mother board
now I'm going to change angles just once
again we're up here we're going to talk
about the area around here you guys can
see the LGA 2011 is a very very large
CPU it's basically like having a xeon
for the desktop plenty of room around it
though for aftermarket cooling on the
top you see the cooling solution up here
keeping some of the components cool
everything's very low profile around the
board you can see that as well all the
components are very low profile and not
get in the way of anything that you're
doing at all so now let me flip it again
once again now there are Intel and
Marvel controllers on here so you get an
amazing amount of say to support on here
you're never going to run out of support
you have raid 0 raid 1 rate 5 raid 10
all supported off the motherboard and
then we see something that's really cool
the bios selector switch i'll go ahead
and try to set this down to the camera
can get a better angle on that in fact
let me just take the whole board out of
here and reposition it for you guys so
down here you guys can see the bios
selector switch i said previously there
are three bias on the board so you have
one two and three there's three
different pole positions on it so you
can set one for extreme overclocking one
for minor overclocking one for standard
then next up you have another fan header
and these connections right here are for
all your case connections everything for
your reset button all that's going to be
connected here you can see it's all laid
out well so you can see it we have USB
3.0 headed right there I will go ahead
and remove little thing either so you
guys can see that then we have two more
USB to point out there I don't remove
those because you guys actually saw
those this little thing right here is
little BP thing so if your computer
starts up you get a bay bay bay bless
you little post little speaker beep down
over here we see another 6 pin power
connector now let's jump in and let's
talk about the PCIe lanes you see
there's one two three four five lanes
one is 16 and eight one is 81 is 16 and
eight
is four and one is 8 so you get support
like I said before you can do quad sli
on this motherboard right out of the box
pretty cool stuff so let's flip it
around to the last but not least to the
rear I oh we can see right here we have
the Bluetooth connectivity underneath
that to standard USB 2.0 ports reset
switch the f bot connector two more USB
2.0 to the right of that we have to
esata ports then above that two more 2.0
USB and then after that we see the first
set of two USB 3.0 ports next to that
another set of 2 and then above that the
two gigabit ethernet lan ports next to
that we have all of the audio both your
analog and your digital spdif connector
all right on the rear I oh alright folks
so there you guys have it the brand-new
EVGA x79 dark motherboard now what are
we going to be doing with this well you
guys remember last year we brought you
guys the Red Dawn computer well this
time we're bringing you a whole new
system and this one's going to be called
simply the dark that's right so we're
gonna be building this thing bring it to
you guys in full review format will be
building it showing you guys the parts
all that kind of cool stuff like I said
we're kind of holding off because we're
waiting something to come you guys
probably know what it is but when it
gets here we'll be doing that this
motherboard currently supports all the
CPUs like I said that are out now plus
future generation stuff if you get my
drift so I'm elric thanks for watching
tech of tomorrow like usual down below
like but which I know you guys are going
to kung fu chop is all the information
if you guys are looking to purchase one
of these for yourself and build a system
just like we are so I'll see you guys
later don't forget to sub or you'll miss
out on all the cool here on check
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
