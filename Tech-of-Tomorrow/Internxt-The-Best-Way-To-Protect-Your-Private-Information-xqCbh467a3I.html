guys back here once again on TECA
tomorrow now today's video is brought to
you and sponsored by intern X now intern
X is a company that focuses on
cloud-based storage and what separates
them from Google Drive and companies
like Dropbox is that all their
information and storage is decentralized
now in the wake of the huge Facebook
fiasco all that information leaked and
hackers around the world keeping your
information safe online is one of the
most important things that you want in
your life
so let's real quick let's check out
intern X and see what makes them safer
than the rest now the biggest thing that
intern X wants to get across to all
their clients is that they have a
personal cloud you can trust with
traditional cloud services like Dropbox
your files are stored in one place that
is lawfully acceptable by the company
hosting it this means that the company
can access it or anybody else can as
well with X cloud however your files are
encrypted split into pieces and
distributed amongst different machines
all around the world this way only you
have access to your files and no one
else and because your files are
encrypted and sent to thousands of
different machines they are much harder
if not impossible for hackers to get
access to your files also with multiple
machines running simultaneously together
using X cloud is quite fast at
retrieving your files due to having more
computer power serving you at any one
time in turn X also claims using X cloud
can be cheaper too with X clouds open
source network you are renting other
people's unused hard drive space
resulting in decreased storage cost the
X cloud also is pretty simplistic and
easy to use it kind of gives off an
iTunes kind of feel you can also
customize your folders with tags and
colors to fit your lifestyle and all of
this is run off there X core technology
X core is also community driven
eliminating the need for a central
controller each host can donate their
system's unused resources creating a
global network of storage and computing
servers this method should also be way
safer than Dropbox or Google Drive
now something that's really cool if you
do want to host your services you get
paid by intern X's own cryptocurrency
which is called the Internet's token now
there are multiple ways to get the
Internet's token you can do this by
hosting or buying it outright it seems a
little bit compared to Bitcoin this way
of mining for Warner next tokens but it
is a little bit different for Bitcoin to
work you leave your computer on to
support its blockchain for Internet's
you leave your computer on to be used as
storage server of some sort now I wonder
if the price of storage drives will
skyrocket once decentralized cloud
storage becomes its own new norm another
point in turn X wants to get across is
growth from every angle where everyone
is the winner the more hosts they have
the better the network will run which in
turn means less storage cost and all
this will increase the value of the I
NXT one thing that's also pretty cool is
that you can also designate how much of
your resources you want in turn X to use
as well as when and for how long and as
far as storing your files X core will
also automatically find you the most
optimum host specific to your needs
the user interface of X core is pretty
simplistic the home screen shows upload
and download speeds as well as your
current ixt earnings in different time
periods the option screen is also pretty
intuitive with easy to use options for
resource allotment currently internet
services can be paid in either US
dollars or I NXT in turn X is own
cryptocurrency and if people do pay in
u.s. dollars internet says they will
purchase I NXT from the USD payments and
distribute the collected ion XT to hosts
participating in their X core network
and this is one way they are growing
their cryptocurrency di NXT
now according to their roadmap they are
currently in beta mode with both their x
core and x cloud technology but the
final commercial version should be
released in q4 of 2018 so if all this
sounds very interesting to you folks
we'll have a link down below you can
find out more information and see if
this fits your lifestyle thanks for
