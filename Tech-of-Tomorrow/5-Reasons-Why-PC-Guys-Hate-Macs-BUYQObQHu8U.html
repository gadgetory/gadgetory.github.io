computer industry is that the PC
master-race guys really don't like the
Mac guys or Macs and today we're gonna
bring you the top 5 reasons of why PC
guy is just absolutely 8 max all around
now one thing I'm going to tell you guys
wrap the bat is that the mindset of a PC
user compared to that of a Mac user is a
completely different mindset for one
thing PC guys for the main part are
tinkerers they love to take their
computers change out the parts overclock
them they're kind of like the dudes back
in the days who you know made their
Chevy's and all their Fords and all
their cars they made them all souped up
that's kind of what a PC user guy is a
Mac guy doesn't like doing in that stuff
at all Mac guy wants to buy his computer
not have to do Jack diddly doo to just
have it work with no thought whatsoever
and it's not that a PC guy doesn't like
stability and all that stuff but a PC
guy just likes a lot of flexibility in
their life so let's start out with the
reason number 5 of ypc guys hate Mac's
with Mac's what you buy is what you get
so when you go over to the Genius Bar
whatever you go to a Mac store to buy a
Mac you cannot change the way the looks
are whatsoever so PC guys like to make
their computer very personalized it's a
very very big thing PC guys like to make
their systems custom make it as
different as they can and when you get a
Mac you can't do that whatsoever you
walk in the store
you've got like one different look and
that's pretty much it so reason number 5
and it's definitely a big one is that
with a Mac you get what you buy and that
is what it is it's not quite you know a
plain vanilla wrapper but it's pretty
doggone close and even though max aren't
ugly you're still not going to be able
to get a custom case or anything like
that unless you go old-school and try to
build yourself a tower using old-school
parts because let's face
all the new iMac to trashcan max all of
them look pretty identical there's not a
whole lot of choice in what you get so
what you buy you're pretty much stuck
with now reason number four this is
another big reason that PC guys really
do not like Macs whatsoever and that is
the limited amount of software that you
can get plus the very fact that a lot of
PC guys just as face it they pirate a
lot of software they do music guys do
they go out and get every plug-in that
there is they can hook up their computer
they can try it they like it they can
use it with a Mac you can do that but
it's very very limiting and the amount
of software that's out there for a Mac
is also very limited plus a lot of times
a lot of the Mac software only works on
a Mac like if you like logic for doing
music you're either doing it on a Mac or
you're doing on a hackintosh you're not
doing on a PC whatsoever and it's the
same thing with Final Cut and other Mac
programs you fall in love with him if
you like working on a Mac but if you
want to work on when a PC it just isn't
happening so number four come on limited
amount of software options limited by
two pirate options which makes PC guy
just be like hands-off now reason number
three and once again this is a giant one
in the world of pcs is the ability to
upgrade and make your computer and all
the components inside of it be exactly
what you want and if you're going to be
upgrading parts for a Mac they're also
very expensive if you ever go online and
you try to configure a Mac from the Mac
store soon as you want to put in a
bigger hard drive or some bigger memory
you're paying prices that are so
outrageous it just feels like you're
being ripped anew but by them when
you're buying this stuff and it's just
ridiculous honestly it's just kind of
crazy when you buy your Mac you do have
a limited amount of upgrades these days
especially with new iMacs you can
upgrade the memory and that's pretty
much about it you can't change anything
else in it you can really change the
hard drives you can use external stuff
and that kind of stuff but as far as
upgrade ability all the way across the
board
Mac's let's just face it they're not
very upgradable like I said earlier when
used to have the old towers these type
of like a tower Mac those were a lot
more upgradable and why Apple ever
stopped making those towers is beyond me
because they were actually the best bet
you had a tower you could change out
some parts and for musicians and people
out there who do a lot of editing and
stuff that was a much better path than
buying an iMac or a trash can so there
you go upgrade ability on a Mac it's
expensive and generally it just plain
sucks okay now number two this might be
number one for some people but number
two is I have tried to game on a Mac
many times with different video cards
different stuff and even though they can
play games okay let's just face it Mac's
aren't really made for gaming and even
though sure there are a couple of games
that'll play on a Mac yeah they really
suck for gaming now what's really weird
if you go back in time back to the very
beginning when PCs and Mac were
competing Mac's actually had more games
at one time than pcs did yeah believe it
or not they did but now PC is completely
dominating the gaming arena Mac's really
sucked for gaming you're not gonna find
anybody out there he's gonna be going
hey bro check it out man I just bought a
Mac - game on bro I'm awesome he's seen
my Mac dude check it out it's got a
built-in graphics card man with 4
gigabytes around I'm gonna kick your
button gaming it just ain't happening
captain ain't happenin ain't happening
so no real gaming on a Mac PCs are where
the fun is that yeah now number one and
this is pretty much the biggest
complaint that I see in forums around
the world and everything and that is the
doggone price the price of an iMac is
outrageous they start out at about for a
nice 27-inch one you're going to be
looking at probably close to twenty to
twenty three hundred dollars just to get
an entry loved one after tax and stuff
like I said before if you try to do any
upgrades whatsoever a Mac is going to be
very very pricey all the way across the
poor with that there
very expensive the really the the main
thing going for a Mac at all though is
people who use them in business because
for PC guys PC guys like to have fun and
like I said at the very beginning of the
video they like to have lots of options
when you've got a super duper high price
tag can't play games upgradability kind
of sucks I mean you can't make it look
like what you want to and there's
limited amount of software so for PC
guys there's really it's a no-brainer
about why they can't stand Macs and
honestly for those reasons for those
particular group of people they are very
solid reasons there are some reasons of
why you might want to own a Mac and I'll
make a video about that later but today
these are the five main reasons that the
PC master-race guys just can't stand
Macs in any way shape or form and that's
just the way it is i milk you guys been
