got something special to show you folks
and it's sponsored by the people over at
LG this is their brand new 65-inch
curved OLED 4k Smart TV featuring the
webOS
now the first time I ever saw this TV it
was really cool it looked great had
awesome colors everything but it was
locked at 1080p this amazing TV features
a full 4k display and it packs all that
crisp 4k goodness into a 65-inch curved
screen
okay fans so in text speak OLED stands
for organic light-emitting diode now
this not only makes the TV look much
better than a standard LED TV it also
consumes a lot less power and offers a
much better viewing angle you might
think that a curved TV would offer a
limited viewing angle but in fact it's
quite the opposite
with the OLED TV you can pretty much sit
anywhere and get that great viewing
experience for those folks who are fans
of webOS you're in luck because webOS
has made its way back into the LG TV
platform most you eyes inside your TV
are bulky and really not something you
want to use you usually end up using an
external box or something and ignoring
them completely but with webOS it's a
completely and totally different
experience and since all of the latest
4k content is streamed through the app
you want something that's very easy and
simple for you to use not something that
gives you a headache the launcher is
really simple and easy to use and
features your favorite apps including
YouTube Amazon Hulu Plus Netflix and
more and teaming up webOS 2.0 with the
included remote makes searching for your
TV programs and content a much better
experience than any standard TV UI you
guys can see that OLED TVs offer some of
the most advanced and best visuals you
can get on a TV you guys also know that
I'm a musician and I really appreciate
good audio and it was a really cool
thing of LG to include Harman Kardon
speakers inside this TV now obviously
these things aren't going to replace a
full thousand-dollar surround sound
system but maybe you don't have room for
that and for someone who just wants
simple basic audio that still sounds
absolutely great even at full volume
these Harman Kardon speakers seriously
do a great job for those of you who have
been following the channel for a while
you guys know I've had quite a few TVs
in here but no TV that I've seen yet
actually compares with the quality of
this curved 4k LG OLED Edition TV it's
just something truly incredible and has
to be seen to really be truly enjoyed
the curved screen offers something
unique and different and it really
immerses you in what you're doing
and the fact that colors are so vibrant
and so brilliant things look really
natural and more realistic than ever
before at the end of the day folks I
have to say that I am very impressed
with this OLED TV from the folks over at
LG it offers some of the absolute best
visuals that you're ever going to get
and the sound experience is also
pleasant as well really folks everything
about this TV is elegant from its curved
design to its bevel to its white back
this TV just screams elegance one of the
really cool things that I felt
personally was the ability to turn any
movie into an instant 3d experience me
and my family actually get a kick out of
this and once you do it it's really hard
to turn back the clock and use
old-school technology I mean let's face
it
3ds just cool so overall you guys can
see this is just simply one incredible
TV and before I bounce out of here I
just want to real quickly give a special
shout out once again to the people over
at LG for making today's video possible
now I know some people out there
watching this and you're going man I
really wish I could get my hands on one
of these TVs well guess what you're in
luck because LG is giving one away
that's right and you can get in on that
