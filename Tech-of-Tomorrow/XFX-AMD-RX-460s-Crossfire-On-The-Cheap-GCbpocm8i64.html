back once again to tech Oh tomorrow
right now we'll just plan a little
titanfall 2 now this games really fun
and today we're actually playing this
game with two Rx for 60s in crossfire
now both these cards were provided by
the company XFX
we were paid no money for this review
whatsoever but the cards were donated
for free with that said I got to say
that these cards and crossfire
for the price range is pretty doggone
good because you can actually get both
these cards for under 300 bucks so it's
pretty much crossfire on the cheap now
both these XFX cards have the identical
specs down the road the core clock on
both cards is set at 1220 megahertz
there's 800 and aiesec stream processors
128-bit memory interface 7000 megahertz
on the memory clock minimum power supply
recommend is 400 watts so really the
only difference between the two cards
we're using in today's configuration is
that one has a fan and one does not
there's no power connection required
other than the PCIe and as far as the
cards look the one with the fan has a
red top shroud and a single fan design
the card that is fanless it's totally
different that it just features a
heatsink on top with no fan whatsoever
which means it's also totally silent
there's already been a bunch of reviews
out about the RX 460 but today's video
is pretty much about bringing those
cards to the table in crossfire now the
test system that we're using it's the
Mirror's Edge system if you guys happen
to miss that video we'll have a link
down below if you want to check out what
we use now all cards were tested on
Windows 10 with the latest updates as
well as the latest drivers from AMD with
that said though let's check out 10
games in crossfire with the RX 460 from
XFX
and like I said earlier folks the only
real difference between the cards if the
temperatures here you guys can see the
difference between the two and make up
your mind which car would you actually
sleep your build at the end of the day I
must say though that these cards scale
very well as you guys can see the RX 460
and crossfire is almost double the
scores across the board competing with
higher end cards if you're somebody who
likes those kind of numbers you can get
this crossfire system like I said for
under $300 looks pretty much crossfire
on the cheap
I'm Elric you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow thanks review in the channel
down below that like button will have
all the information about these cards so
you can choose the one that suits your
build rock on we'll see you guys here
for more tech on teka tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
