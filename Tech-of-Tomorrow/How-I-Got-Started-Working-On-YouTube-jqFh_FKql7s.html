out there who follow me you know that
I've been a youtuber for quite a few
years now almost 10 in total start off
first
over at motherboards org then we
switched over to TECA tomorrow but some
of you may wonder how did I actually get
to be youtuber what roads did I take
that made me finally go okay I'd like to
be a youtuber well it's kind of a long
story years and years and years ago
motherboards dog was honestly the very
first og website for technology predate
Symantec it predates Tom's Hardware
predates excuse me Tom's Hardware it was
the og site
it wasn't ran by me it was ran by
another guy and it ran for like about I
think about four or five years and I was
working at this company called Aberdeen
and this guy named Patrick gillaspie and
the owner decided that they were going
to buy this website and so they bought
the website and I was working there as a
salesman selling computers and building
computers and I saw they got a website
and I was like hey I've always wanted to
be a writer and write about computer
technology so I went home I started
messing with stuff and I started
overclocking stuff and nobody was really
doing this at the time at all
I was overclocking I think there
probably was one or two other guys after
I don't know which one of us actually
did it first so I can't say that it
completely invented overclocking but I
know I was one of the very first people
if not the first person to do a lot of
overclocking because we were doing it on
computers way before they had the pcs
today back kind of migas and stuff like
that we were messing with them there
were ways to change the way you did
things so I started writing for the site
and motherboards out or grew into a
giant site we were one of the biggest
tech channels for many many many years
well the writing thing started to change
obviously because you know the birth of
the internet and all the people wanting
to now do this YouTube and video things
change the way things were done so even
though I was writing for them the
company kind of started going a little
bit downhill so then motherboards org
there's a whole Michael fiasco if you
guys want to see a video about that you
can see it you can check it out and go
look for yourself I'm not going to get
into that part but we basically lost
that and then I didn't know really what
to do with that so John a friend of mine
Jonathan Morrison you guys know him from
TLDs a big-time youtube star well for a
long time he worked for me
he was my producer
he was writing music with me like we
were going to the gym together we were
just doing a whole lot of stuff together
he was actually the person that pushed
me into doing YouTube him and a friend
of his Josh Kenton already had a site up
that was called live love music it was a
really nice site for learning music and
all that kind of stuff but for some
reason it just wasn't like doing
financially well and was just taking up
their time so I finally said okay I'll
give in John I'll start doing YouTube
you know cuz he was like hey YouTube's
going to be the future so do YouTube so
I started doing YouTube videos and
trying to do this kind of stuff now as I
got sick and everything and kind of
going downhill John wanted to go and do
his own thing which he finally went in
did you guys know his channel TLD is one
of the absolute best channels that there
is on YouTube he takes a lot of tension
to detail I mean he loves cameras and
all that stuff more than just about
anybody else that I know on the planet
so in honesty I didn't really start out
ever thinking that I would be a youtuber
I really never did when I was a child I
did a lot of different commercials I
acted I acted all the way up until
square pegs so I've done a lot of
different stuff as an actor when I was a
child but I never really considered
going back and doing it as an adult I
was more into playing with my bands and
trying to do that type of stuff than I
ever was and trying to go back and be an
actor and I got to tell you YouTube can
be very very fine although it does seem
now that you're either the giant site or
you're a small site there's not really
much in between what's going on right
now it's almost kind of like the same
thing that's going on with the class so
you know the middle class is kind of
getting squeezed out you're gonna have
the rich or the poor so if you're out
there and you've ever really wondered
hey Elric how did you ever get to be a
youtuber well honestly I probably would
have never been a youtuber if it wasn't
for Jonathan Morrison because he pushed
me into doing it I really didn't even
want to do it as you guys see it's been
moderately successful for me I have a
lot of fun doing it gyah like said I
like it the dog UI was he wants to be on
camera it's really weird whenever we
start filming a video this guy is just
like on me it's just weird it's like
almost when I open a cheese repre now
this guy can be upstairs in a bedroom
and open a cheese repre knees downstairs
like in an instant like how does he do
it I just don't know but that's it folks
I just wanted to give you guys a little
quick video about how I ever became a
YouTube in the road I took so I
basically man I started out as a writer
I wrote for a lot of different magazine
back in the day for pc magazine pc
enthusiast magazine i have stacks the
stacks of magazines where I actually
wrote for magazines that were in Turkey
and people translated my English and a
Turkish so writing was my thing but it
was magazine writing but then I switch
to the Internet and then that led to
filming YouTube videos so I love all you
guys I thank you guys for all your
support you guys have always been
wonderful so we'll see you guys back in
them for more tech just thought I'd
bring you guys some personal videos so
peace see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
