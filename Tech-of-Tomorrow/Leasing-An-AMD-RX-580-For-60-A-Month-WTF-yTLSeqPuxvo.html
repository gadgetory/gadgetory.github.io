industry when you see a company starting
to offer check this out
leasing a video card that's what I said
leasing a video card cutting-edge gamer
comm now I don't know if it's exactly
entirely a true thing it was just some
kind of joke but there's a website in
the link for $57 a month for you to get
an RX 5 80 now before you totally freak
out if that's actually true those cards
were $500 upon watch and excuse me there
I got kind of a frog in my throat $500
at lunch so if you're paying for 12
months you're really only paying a
hundred and something dollars over the
costs and for leasing something that's
really not a bad idea but I mean do you
guys think this is like a cool idea
because they have different type of
programs I guess that you can get
something like we're it's it infinity it
updated where you can get completely
getting update cards you can outright
buy it or you can lease it an internet
the internet there's all kinds of
different ways I guess this company is
offering ways for you to lease a card
now this would be kind of a trip now say
you're a minor I know you guys all hate
those bastards I know you do but check
it out the mining guys them could lease
those cards from those fools I mean
those guys excuse me and then they could
return them to them at the end of their
lease and get other cards and let those
guys deal with it so in that aspect if
it actually happened it would be kind of
cool right because then you won't have
to really worry about these guys going
out and buying on your video cards
because hey they can just lease them
from these dudes so I don't know I
personally think that if it's actually a
true thing it's not a bad deal
whatsoever especially if you can get on
some kind of upgrade program where you
can constantly over and over again
update your video card that in itself
would be pretty cool because let's just
face it I know lots of dudes out there
my buddy Jerry who basically every year
they get a brand new car through the
leasing program so there every year
driving a brand new car and they lease
it now yeah I guess you don't open it
and there are some things probably
different between leasing and owning
that's why people buy and people lease
but a lot of people do it mm-hmm
yeah I don't know what the heck is going
on I think I need water today I'm
parched and parched I'm arch
at the end of the day what do you guys
think though do you guys think that
leasing video cards could become like
the way of the future like leasing cars
now take this on a thing though cars are
uber expensive these days for a new car
so does that mean that video card prices
are getting ready to jump up so high
that you're gonna have to start leasing
your PC like a car so yeah hey dude Oh
what do you got well I finally went out
and I bought a computer homie I'm
leasing one from super computer calm you
know what I mean
so I don't know I hope things aren't
going that direction but I think it is a
very interesting idea now currently
there is only one card on the site just
one one card to rule them all well don't
you wish but it's an rx 580 you know a
gigabyte card I'm sure for the money
that they're charging the car does play
all the games pretty decently especially
at 1080 let's face it 4k is not totally
here so if you're playing at 1080 or
1440 you're doing just fine there's no
reason for all that 4k stuff or any
worry for at this time anyways monitors
are expensive getting all the stuff to
work with it expensive so hey 10a 1440
you're good to go so let me hear you
guys comments I like usually you know
I'll have information down below and on
top the video you guys probably saw it I
had a little question thing going on so
you know let me see what your guys
opinions are we've got lots of more
stuff coming here on the channel
our gleam giveaway stuff is almost
straight away to get all those companies
altogether get the information to get
all that stuff going I've never done it
before so you know it's all new for me
but you guys are gonna like what's
coming up so I'm Eric you guys been
watching tikka tomorrow our leasing
video cards the way of the future
we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
