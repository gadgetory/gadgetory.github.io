tomorrow we're doing something a bit
different today today we're doing an
unboxing but we're doing an unboxing and
everybody's filming on an iPhone 6
I got a trooper of youtubers here and
they're all filming this unboxing so
what is this so you guys all know brand
new release from Nvidia just happened a
couple of days ago the new 9 series
released featuring their Maxwell
architecture and I've got a brand new
card from Asus now this card has a weird
name it's like Strix which is like owl
in Greek and this is the 970 card it's
an overclocked edition and you guys know
these guys gear all their cards for
overclocking and top performance so what
that said I got the box right here in
front of me let's go ahead and take this
card out of the box shooting with the
brand new iPhone 6 in fact multiples of
them so real quick before we jump in and
see the content let's take a look at
obviously well the box or akka hi if you
want to translate into espanol so here's
the front of the box right here you guys
can see now this is totally different
either card they've had before Strix is
a brand new naming convention we've seen
ROG we've seen all kinds of different
cards well this is a brand new one it
says on the front four gigabytes flip it
on the back just talks about their super
alloy either via Ram you guys know these
guys gears their cars like I said it
completely overclocked and one thing
awesome at the 9 Series is that these
things run much cooler in choir than
previous generations of cards that's
right way lower TDP way cool running
means way better overclocking so let's
go ahead and find a little cap here on
the side right here and we'll pop a cap
not pop a cap in yo ass but we'll pop a
cap out of this thing right here and
we'll open up the box so let's see here
take a little tab right here flip the
tab here and get another one and in fact
yeah I know you guys don't like when I
take everything out of the box but hey
we thought today we'd give you guys the
full monty alright just kidding so
alright let's go ahead here's the a Zeus
box oh boy thrills but underneath is
inside dun dun dun dun dun duh oh look
at that a box with a little box
exception here is going to be all of our
accessories and all that good stuff so
we'll go ahead and we'll pop that cap
first going here not too much stuff in
here but do you kind of a baron design
there and not
too much in there whatsoever so we do
have though the speed setup guide we've
got the serious graphics card guide got
some foam more foam come on Austin
spit still all right then we've got what
you guys are all looking for it well the
card itself supple one more oh that's
right and one over the gender as well
just keep tossing boxes here so now
we're getting out of the nitty gritty
the card itself now you guys all know
Hayes's is famous for including a back
plate on their cards a lot of their
people have followed suit now but
brought the bat let's start off take a
look at the back like usual complete
solid background direct cu2 means direct
copper the two means that there's two
fans for you guys out there who don't
know that start off you guys can see a
giant heat pipe going all the way on the
side you guys can see the logo clear
light they're Strix right here we have
two sli fingers discard you Quad SLI for
people rocking and looking for that
build I just got to say so far folks the
970 seems like it is the real winner of
the 9 Series I'm just saying this these
cards have been smoking fast
check out through our IO a lot different
from the standard rear i/o the ones they
were getting on all the reference cards
CAD like 5 connectors this one's got a
lot different you just have a single
HDMI single DisplayPort in two DVI ports
so a little bit different sticking to a
Zeus's normal theme on the top the
direct see you we see the two fans
underneath you can see all the heat
pipes and everything now what happens is
all your heat goes into this into these
and translates away from the card
dissipates that heat keeps the card
running good PCI 3.0 interface pop that
little tab there you guys can see that
and pretty much folks this is the car
let's go ahead let's talk about the
power requirements as the police pull of
somebody over there now this is pretty
interesting folks check this out single
6 pin power connector when I was briefed
to by Nvidia they said that some
companies will be doing that they didn't
know exactly when but you guys can see
that a Zeus has been the first one to
jump in the market and they have a
single 6-pin connector some cards have
dual we've actually seen a cards you
guys saw him launch day that had two
eight pin power connectors so this has
Ingle making power consumption the
easiest ever so this thing's probably
gonna have the standard 145 Watts TDP
maybe it'll even be a little bit less
those numbers haven't been specified as
yet so that's pretty much it folks this
is the card brand new one from Asus it's
the GTX 970 pricing availability all
that stuff will be down below
shout out to Austin Jonathan to Judd nur
even to josh Kenton who's holding the
microphone stand for being here today
and for doing this video so we'll see
you guys back here on TECA tomorrow more
stuff if you guys missed anything like I
said down below like button in the
description we'll have availability
pricing and all that other good stuff
and if you like what you see then hey
you know what to do
subject eka tomorrow see my beer mug
