here in Tekken tomorrow Elric Faris here
and today we've got something pretty
unique and cool for you guys to take a
look at we've got the unboxing first
look and performance review of the
latest Intel 330 series 120 gigabyte SSD
now some really cool things going on
right now right at this moment this
Drive is on sale over at Amazon for a
hundred and twenty three dollars that's
right
one hundred and twenty three freakin
dollars for a hundred and twenty
gigabyte SSD basically bring it to a
dollar a gigabyte which is very very
fair this is the same price that we saw
when standard hard drive prices were
going good so that said let's jump in
let's do the unboxing let's check it out
and then let's see the performance of
the drive and then see later if it's
worth your money
as the consumer
so here we go folks here's the drive
first we have the outside of the box the
front here we show the back of the box
where it shows the drive and with the
drive contained that says this box
contains the drive the installation kit
and that's really it here's the
nomenclature anybody wants to look this
up online here's the reference numbers
that you will need for that we'll go
ahead and take it over here and we shall
pop it out the cardboard box a little
attention thing right there all
cardboard in pop cap here we have the
drive itself as you can see it's in a
completely sealed bag with an actual
serial number on it now something
different there underneath it we have
the speed demon sticker and the camera
will take the camera go look up at the
wall you guys can see I actually have
one of these stickers on my wall for my
last drive that's right I like these
until drives that are always fast pretty
cool stuff
now we'll get back over here to the
unboxing so we got the sticker the drive
QuickStart guide shows you all the
different stuff that comes inside of it
let me take this out here all right so
this trike can YouTube uses a laptop
replacement kit or a desktop replacement
does it matter you can use an either one
it's supposed to have 500 read 450 right
we'll see that we actually took the
drive up that's the rumors specs of how
fast it goes there's that and that how
to do it your desktop how to do it in
your laptop
pretty cool stuff got drivers also has
the installation guide on this as well
I'll go ahead and rip the seal on this
a little mini disk out got all that no
this thing comes the really cool three
year warranty
supposed to work for a solid three years
Intel's been listening let me get all
the rest of this out of here we got the
rest of the kid in here the box is gonna
stuck in there
here's your bracket this is you can
stick your drive on here and then put it
inside your standard Bay we've got the
SATA connector the power connector the
screws connect the SSD to this and then
finally the screws to mount this into
your system so that's all this stuff now
let's actually open the SSD drive you
see it's a brand new virgin driving to
go ahead and make the rip right here
open it up breaking the seal one more
here get it out nice little package of
silicon there if your kitty don't eat
this stuff it'll kill you
now check out this Drive looks really
trippy on the bottom over here looks
like it's already like better like an
industrial type car or something you can
see the four mounting holes here we see
the SATA connector here is the power
connector flip it around let you guys
see the top of the drive until SSD 330
series 120 gigabyte 2.5 SSD so trippin
out in the back of it though what's kind
of whitewash lump you guys can see that
and actually this like it's been pulled
in that of a system repeatedly which is
kind of weird for a brand new product
but hey so this is all the stuff that
comes in the box so this is the unboxing
part of the review you guys didn't see
the test station over here to my right
we've used this test station and many
different things I'm going to be using
the Marvel controller I'm gonna take it
and hook it up into here and then hook
this drive up and run some tests and
I'll get right back to you guys in a few
minutes okay guys so I've actually
installed and I've hooked up the drive
to the system right here we are using
the controller that is on the asus
motherboard that is their own as media
chipset runs pretty fast I've got my new
volume I called it volume X for the
testing and now I'm going to go ahead
and we're
run at Oh alright so now we're going to
run Adam what you guys actually see it
run and this will be some of the first
performance of the drive the runs always
start out flora and they build until you
get your final result at the end for
those of you er unfamiliar with this
test
it's the at ho disk benchmark works very
good for SSD drives the drive has said
to have 500 and 450 that depends also on
which controller that you're using we'll
see how this one pans out at the end you
can see it's building and building and
building we're sitting more something
exciting here to do I could sing you
guys a lullaby or we could put in
benchmarks on top but we thought we'd
give you guys actually a live
demonstration of the death simply know a
lot of people do then you guys don't
seem to mind a little bit of the video
so
consider this actually you know putting
the results out there which we could but
we actually show you guys the desk
something different I'm sure you guys
are leaving your comments section saying
hey we love that do it again or oh we
hate you we want you to die
you guys are lovely about that stuff oh
absolutely lovely
especially those troll comments oh god
gotta love those right only a few more
instances to run here folks I got the
drive right here my handle here is
actually around the whole time no heat
there actually no heat SSD no noise just
let you folks know two different
controllers show different results I'm
just using the one
as immediate tip - you guys can see on
our scores I got a little bit over 400
and read a little bit over 360 on right
that's using this particular chipset
other tests may vary so hey there you
guys go we showed you the unboxing
talked about a little bit about the
specifications of the drive showed you
guys performance in live on a doe I'm
using the rampage for extreme
motherboard behind me and it's as media
chipset now other chipsets may make
different results if you try and marvel
one or you try and Intel one of the
newer ones your results will vary I'm
sure an Intel tested it they test it out
with one of their boards it's one of
their chipsets this is the results on
this one they're going to vary but
obviously you guys can see even on that
it's a very fast drive Intel's known for
their reliability that's this is about
the 330 series in entry-level driving
it's on sale at Amazon right now for a
hundred and twenty three dollars so
check out the link below peace out we'll
see here later on TECA tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
