welcome back once again to techid Omar
now today we're going to be checking out
a brand new product in the people over
it NZXT this is one of their brand new
mid tower cases it's the s3 40 elite
it's under 100 bucks and has a lot of
features and let's check this bad boy
out let's first start off with the size
of the s340 elite because I know to some
people that really matters now the width
of the case is 203 millimeters the
height of the case is 474 millimeters
and the length of the case is 432
millimeters the side window panel is
made of tempered glass so you know this
is going to be very durable and it also
cleans up pretty nicely as well the rest
of the case is made of steel and ABS
plastic and as far as the weight goes
before you throw anything inside of it
it's 8.13 kilograms the s340 elite also
comes in three different colors you have
red and black for those people who like
the Ferrari or the a Zeus or the AMD
look you also get white and black the
one that we got is obviously the white
version all of your inputs are located
on the very top of the s340 elite and
they offer something that no other case
I have seen yet offers and this is the
availability to hook up your VR set
directly to the front of your case this
is just really killer you guys can see
you have an audio port you have a mic
port then you have an HDMI port then you
have two USB 3.0 ports and then
additionally two more USB 2.0 ports and
then find the power button but like I
said what's really cool though is that
you can plug your VR headset directly
into the top most VR headsets only
require an HDMI and a USB port so you
can simply plug those in and not have to
worry about it being lagging all over
the place and what's even better is the
s3 40 elite comes with two magnetic
holders now you can use these to hold
your headphones so hold your VR headset
or just to wrap your cables around and
the magnets are actually strong enough
as you guys can see to actually hold up
my entire VR headset so this is no cheap
magnet whatsoever it's actually made
pretty well when you purchase the s3 40
elite it actually comes with 220
millimeter fans now the first of these
you guys can see is located in the top
and the second one is located in the
very back and additionally on the front
of the case there room for two more fans
as well and as we look at the back you
guys can see there's room for seven
expansion slots and there's also a
shroud for your power supply so you
don't even see the power supply
whatsoever
making your bill just look even cleaner
taking the case apart to do your build
is also very simple you just remove a
couple of screws in the back panel on
the front panel remove those and then
the front panel pops off so you can
access everything very easily now you
guys can see there's a lot of cable
management running along the back and
there's actually a little shield inside
of there that protects all of your
cables and keeps them out of the way for
a clean build you can also see the cable
that goes from the inputs in the front
of your case that plugs into the back of
your motherboard and to keep those
dustbunnies out of your PC there are two
dust filters included one is on the
front and one is located on the bottom
now that we have the case completely
disassembled we can see inside of it and
you guys can see that it supports
motherboards from the ATX micro ATX and
mini ITX family no giant-sized
motherboards will go inside this case so
make sure you know what you're buying we
also see plenty of room for hard drive
and SSD expansion there are three 2.5
bays located inside the case and on the
rear there are two more 3.5 bays for
those larger size hard drives if you're
one of those folks who loves liquid
cooling you'll be very pleased with the
s340
elite because it has lots of room for
radiator support in the front you can
have two 140 or two 120 millimeter
radiators and in the rear you can have a
single 120 millimeter rad so they've got
you covered everywhere and if you're
wondering hey man will my video card
even fit inside the system if I'm using
a radiator let's check it out the GPU
clearance with a radiator is three
hundred and thirty-four millimeters and
the GPU clearance without the radiator
is three hundred and sixty-four
millimeters so make sure you take note
of that and there's also a 161
millimeters of clearance between your
CPU cooler and the top of the case cable
management can also be done very well
inside this case because there's lots of
room to hide the cables like we showed
you on the backhand side previously all
of your cables can be tucked up
underneath there for a clean and elegant
build and what's better yet is there are
even clips to clip all those wires
completely out of the way and finally on
the bottom of the case you guys can see
the
filter and then there are four little
rubber feet to make sure that your case
stands up straight and tall
alright Tech fans there you have it all
of the fun facts about mzx t's lightest
case the s3 40 elite now this thing
looks really nice has excellent cable
management plenty of room for
expandability for your video cards for
your hard drives regardless of the
variety the cable management like I said
is just really really excellent people
who want a clean build are really going
to appreciate that the case comes a
market at under $100 with the glass
window so you can see all the excellent
things inside your build I have to say
this is a very nice case for the money
like usual we'll have all the
information about this case down below
like button want to hear you guys hit
that but loud and proud and also I want
to hear you guys it pains about what you
guys think about this case any
improvements and just your ideas so I'm
Network even watching Tekken tomorrow
we're going to be doing a full build
inside this case next so stay tuned to
tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
