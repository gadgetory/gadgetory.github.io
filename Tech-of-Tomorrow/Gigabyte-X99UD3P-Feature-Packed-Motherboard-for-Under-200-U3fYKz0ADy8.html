platform but thought hell I haven't got
the money we'll check it out gigabyte
has a solution that may just work for
you the GA x99 su d3p comes in the
market at a hundred and ninety nine
dollars and has a ton of features and as
you guys can see this motherboard is a
beauty and the motherboard itself even
the basic by the board itself is really
cool it's completely black and gold
designs it's going to fit in any system
that you're designing it's going to be
the basis for any of a custom mod system
because you know black is a call that's
very neutral and you can build anything
around and it's kind of look cool the
motherboard itself has a2x copper design
so it has two times the copper net that
a standard motherboard has and that's
going to help the motherboard run a lot
more efficient a lot cool and have a lot
less EMI all around another thing that's
going to help believe in a bit am I on
this motherboard and by the way if you
don't know what EMI its electromagnetic
interference every single one of the
place where you put your screws in has
plenty of room around it so there's
nothing going to be touching and having
any problems of any kind of connection
which is pretty cool I haven't seen very
many motherboards that have that on it
now the audio on this thing is actually
really crazy as well it's another just
crazy feature will get into all the
basic features too we'll talk about
those but let's just talk about some of
the really really cool stuff the audio
on here is 7.1 audio and it actually has
a line that runs all the way along the
side of it you guys can see this right
here there's a line that runs all the
way up the side of here and segregates
all of the audio now this is the alc
1150 chipset from realtek and it
features 7.1 digital audio and it also
has the nichicon capacitors so you know
this thing is going to sound good and
this little bar here it's not only a
cool looking thing it actually glows at
night and you can have it bouncing and
beating to your music you can have it
just static one color you can have it so
it just beats independently you can have
it so it's not on at all but that's just
a really cool feature I mean how many
motherboards have like a little bouncing
cool item when they were inside your
case you know I mean so you've got your
mod go in your case going build you got
your thing thump the Boom Boom Boom pump
open this thing's blinking right along
with it plus it's actually a really good
hike
on the audio solution for those looking
for you know great audio on board lots
of people game and for years they just
threw out your regular old chipsets I
had a tinny sound people have now taken
audio serious and you can see gigabytes
taking this really serious because
this is a really fine audio chipsets
going to sound good now like I said
before low low noise interference going
to sound good have lots of noise
interference whoops not going to have
any noise rather excuse me there a
little it's kind of hard to memorize all
this stuff and then bring it to you guys
in the camera there's just so much on
here so like 32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
supports XMP profiles up to 3000 and 333
megahertz really extremely fat stuff the
Intel this is the ZIF socket 2011
supports all of the latest Intel Extreme
I seven CPUs you're going to be able to
use all the top of the wine CPUs and one
of the main reasons about jumping onto
the x99 platform is for using multi
graphics cards because there are
basically 40 lanes that are total
availability on this particular board to
get I think 320 gigabytes of total
bandwidth through the pci lane so that's
a lot of bandwidth now there are two of
these that run at 16 x that's one and
two then we have three and four these
run at 8x unless you use a 5820 cpu uses
5820 cpu you only get i believe for exon
3 and 8 X on to I don't know why exactly
it's that way probably has something to
do with the technology now all around
the socket you guys can see to me this
is a pretty Spartan motherboard and I
really think that it is some people may
disagree let me hear what you guys have
to say but I think it's pretty Spartan
you've got plenty of room all around it
for an aftermarket cooler water cooling
and all that stuff now one of the big
features about all of gigabytes x99
motherboards are there new all-digital
power design which features fully
digital power phases and fully digital
PWM so that means all of your power
stages and all of your pw ms are all
completely controlled by this new thing
from international rectifier it's pretty
cool and it will actually keep the board
running very smooth and it'll also be
good for overclocking because all the
electricity coming in the board
you very regulated and it will be even
so even electricity means better
overclocking and just better stability
all the way on the board now as far as
the fan headers going this motherboard I
believe they're our total of five
there's one up here on the top another
down below the ZIF socket another over
here by the 24 pin power connector then
I see another one over here by the back
bracket where you're going to be able to
connect the Wi-Fi and then another one
down here at the bottom of the board now
I'm going to flip it around and right
here we can see all the SATA connectors
now this thing features not only say 26
it also features say to express that's
right say the Express is like the
fastest thing on the planet now and this
board has it honor now how many devices
out there we're going to see using it
that'll be a different story altogether
I may have mentioned this earlier but as
far as power connectivity goes there are
two places on the board there's an 8-pin
12 volt right here and then your 24 pin
right here next to that you can see the
USB 3.0 header this is where people use
an external three-pointer bracket I
probably won't use that but some people
will and as we Traverse back over here
we can see there are one two three pci
1x slots as well and then down there
between it and the bottom pci slot you
can see there's a little thing for
connecting external audio I'm gonna go
to the very bottom of the board here
very by the board you can see all the
places to connect to your case and
everything this is all labeled clearly
then over here we see the CPU switch now
this as two different modes standard
mode and mode for overclocking so you
put an overclocking mode you're up and
into your overclocking this motherboard
also features dual m2 technology which
provides users PCI Express connectivity
for SSD devices and 411 AC Wi-Fi +
bluetooth 4.0 cards and data transfer
speeds can be up to 10 gigabits per
second the m2 connectivity is also much
faster storage than either msata or
standard zeta connectivity real quick
folks something I may have failed to
mention now crosstalk and electronic
harmonic interference and all that stuff
is something that affects most audio on
motherboards now these guys have done
something totally different
the right channel is on one layer of the
PCB and the left is on another so this
is going to help maintain the absolute
best audio clarity that you can get
another great feature in this
motherboard are the chokes in this
motherboard are actually server gray
that's right their server grade and all
the capacitors are black and feature a
10k life span which means 10,000 hours I
don't know if some of this stuff i'm
going over again folks i really tried to
memorize as much stuff in the
motherboard as possible i hate like
reading off a script or doing any kind
of stuff I try to just memorize it all
and bring it to you folks and sometimes
that can be kind of a you know a
headache but hopefully I'm getting it
all cuz I really wanted to bring you
guys the best about this motherboard so
I think we've covered most of the
features for overclocking these guys
have all their own overclocking software
and all that stuff it's very easy to use
in fact I think for most basic users if
you're just using a fan or just some
standard liquid cooling using their
instant overclocking solution is
probably going to be much better than
tinkering with yourself and you're
probably not going to be able to get
that much greater result by totally
going out and tweaking it may be a
little bit but not much these guys have
worked with overclockers around the
world for years to help develop this
software and it's actually come quite a
long ways let's bounce around now real
quick let's go to the back the
motherboard also features gigabyte land
with cephas the rio it's pretty decked
out you guys can see it's got some
old-school legacy ps2 keyboard mouse
ports you've got standard USB 2.0 you've
got USB 3.0 a lot of them you've got all
of your analog audio in your s/pdif and
this right here is actually for your
Wi-Fi antenna so if you're going up the
Wi-Fi antenna this is just the port to
help you you know get through there so
that's pretty much it folks like I said
this board comes to market at one
hundred ninety nine dollars has a lot of
features and for the x9 platform that's
actually really good somebody's boards
are up to five and six hundred dollars
so if you've been thinking about jumping
onto this platform now I might be the
chance one thing i want to say though if
you're just using a single graphics card
this is not really going to be the board
you're looking for you can use it but
there's no reason it would basically be
like buying a Maserati to dry run a
parking
I you just you know really need to do
that you can get the best solution out
of that just by using a lower in
platform like I said an i7 4770k but
with this this mother 499 bucks I gotta
say as an editor's choice product it
looks good has a lot of features is
going to do good overclocking you can
use for cards in sli or crossfire mode
so for people wanting to do that it's
awesome and look it just looks very good
like usual all the information for this
motherboard will be down the bullet like
button hopefully you guys will like this
video I haven't actually done a
motherboard video in a long time i was a
little bit nervous so i hope we all
learned something together so I'm elric
thanks for watching taking tomorrow into
let's build a system
