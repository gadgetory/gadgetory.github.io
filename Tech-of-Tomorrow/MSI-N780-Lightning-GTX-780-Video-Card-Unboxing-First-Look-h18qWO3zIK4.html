welcome back once again to the channel
we've got another pretty interesting
unboxing and first look today it's going
to be the new msi gtx 780 lightning
Edition now this is not your standard
run-of-the-mill gtx 780 by any means
whatsoever this thing's got completely
radical cooling on it it's got
completely overclocked out of the box
and this card's actually a little bit
more pricey than your run-of-the-mill
card because it's actually geared for
doing extreme overclocking like I said
the cooling mechanism on it's supposed
to be really incredible the box itself
weighs enough where you could use it as
an exercise tool because it sways so
damn much now we're gonna be doing a few
things with this video card first today
we're gonna bring you guys the unboxing
in the first look then we're gonna go
ahead and stick on the test station so
we can get the review up and everything
but then we're gonna do it we're having
a lot of fun with this actually build a
system back here I've got one of their
motherboards the mPower and we're
actually going to build a Metro last
light PC that's right that's going to be
the theme it's going to be all yellow
and black and since the colors of the
motherboard and the video Carter that
that's gonna be the theme and these
things are gonna match very well also
thank you very much the people over at
mayhem I appreciate you guys thanks for
sending me out that package with all
that cool stuff and without any further
ado let's jump in and let's see what
this damn gtx 780 lightning is all about
alright folks so here is the box the
starting place of all unboxings here we
have it the msi lightning built to be
perfect geforce gtx 780 overclocked
certified right out of the box I'm gonna
flip to the side real quick here get the
camera to bring it close to pin here
this is all the nomenclature so if
you're looking to purchase this card
we'll have the information down below in
the description but if you guys want to
look up yourself it'll be right here
gonna flip it around again just show you
guys the back of the box we see right
here they have their new triple force
architecture it says right here msi is
new geforce gtx 780 line provides triple
force our cut
that brings out a blockbuster level of
graphics coming to life on the screen
it's basically has to do with all of
their twin froze or cooling and
everything like that but this is
supposed to be three times the power and
three times the cool we don't really
know until we slap it onto a test bench
and move along but you guys can see it
as MSI military class four components
the military class component just means
that they basically are trying to use
the highest components that they can get
high C caps dark solid caps
SFC everything high-end now some of the
special features are going to be there
dr. Moss for their copper Moss MOSFET
high C cap new SOC super ferret choke
and their dark solid cap now these are
all the high-end components that go with
the military class four I'm gonna flip
it around to the side right here this is
something that most people who are
Nvidia fans are gonna know this I would
think that a lot of people watching the
video gonna know it but it's basically
the GeForce GTX 3 gigabytes of gddr5
there in 84 bit memory your display port
HDMI DVI tons - same normal things in
the rear i/o so with all that let's just
go ahead and let's pop the box open and
let's start taking a look at what's
really important the stuff inside the
box so like I said you folks before this
thing is actually very very heavy it's
probably the heaviest video card that
I've ever got in my life now you guys
can see it comes this really bitchin box
this is in your standard box at all cool
check it out we'll just start at the
bottom and I'll go ahead just pull this
little drawer out get a little difficult
here but that's just cuz it's tight in
there it's tight because it's a virgin
bottle that's right so third gen so
let's go ahead and let's pop the caps
here and check this out
right off the bat inside we get our
certificate of quality and stability you
know few people do that but it's kind of
cool to come in the box kind of like
getting a video card with a pedigree so
we'll set that off to the side now
underneath here we have all kinds of
different cables we have different type
of power connectors I'll go ahead since
is such a good card we will go ahead and
just move everything out and take a look
at one-by-one let's pour that out we
have a huge SuperDuper long SL I came in
here I mean this thing is super long
with a damn thing super long then we
have a couple of six pin to eight pin
power connectors those could become
important if you have a power supply
that doesn't have this required things
then we have these right here these are
all things for doing your overclocking
and using multimeters so we have all
these little things right here that
you'll hook up the board and hook up in
these little things right here screws
for what's the part that's underneath
here which will get to DVI to VGA here
is an extra part for doing different
types of cooling go ahead and set that
off to the side and I think there's even
more stuff underneath here yeah they're
still actually a couple more things down
underneath here we have the quick user's
guide then we also have the drivers CB
most people though when they get a video
card I would actually suggest you can
put these in just teach your card up and
going but you want to go on the internet
and go to the nvidia side and get the
absolute latest drivers that's what
you're going to want to do so let me go
ahead and just set this stuff off to the
side we'll pop the top here it's kind of
interesting because there's just like a
separator here so here is the car don't
madami get this bad boy out of here okay
folks no wonder this box is so big this
is honestly the heaviest video card that
I've ever seen go ahead so here we go
triple fans you can see they use a
different type of fan completely in the
center here than these two fans the
entire mechanism can be removed so if
you wanted a different type of cooling
stuff you can pull us apart hence that
other back piece that we showed you guys
before this car it's actually very very
big as well it's a little bit bigger
than two slots now here you guys can see
the side where the Lighting's going to
light up here you can see all of the
aluminum heat fin
going down around there like a musical
instrument to 8bim power connectors
right there flip around show you guys a
side angle you guys can see all of the
heat pipes are all right here running
through it it's got a lot more than any
other card that you're ever going to see
now right here it's kind of hard to see
there are three of the fan connectors
right here and then right here are the
three connections for those little wire
probes I showed you earlier
those plug into here and that way you
can do all of your monitoring and
everything from there as well now down
the bottom we see PCIe interface right
there
more heat fins again now the back of the
card is really cool not only does it
have the msi reactor on the back it has
this totally cool shield for covering up
the card and the other part that I
showed you before you can take this off
and use that one for different things
we'll get into that more we're actually
doing the review and talked about that
stuff we're just trying really show you
what comes in the box today now there's
also a little warning tag right here it
says warning being noted that the
improper installation of the GPU reactor
card may cause damage to the graphics
card so you want to make sure that
you're paying attention when you're
installing is I think there's things you
want to smack this in and start smacking
this thing around and break it off for
anything it caused a lot of problems
once again we see the name lightning on
the bottom I'm gonna flip it around show
you guys the rear i/o rear i/o is a
standard DVD v ID DisplayPort and HDMI
just the same as all the other cards now
the big features of this card though or
its overclocking and the cooling and its
ability to be overclocked to extreme
levels due to the cooling now a lot of
guys out there I know we're gonna get
cards like this they're gonna tear it
apart they're gonna use ln2 I'm not
gonna do anything like that at all here
my home but we'll test it against the
other cards and see how actually cool it
does compare to some of the
competition's I've got one from the
people over at 2 gigabyte I've got one
from the people over at EVGA we'll be
testing this card Direct with the
classified card and the wind force card
from those companies and seeing if it
really does keep it as cool as
advertised so
you get this folks all this lovely stuff
I showed you earlier inside this box
there's all kinds of it you get the
giant box and all this stuff inside of
the msi gtx 780 lightning edition so i
folks there you have it the gtx 780
lightning from msi you guys can see that
this card is really really crazy like
this is kind of like some of those
high-end a zeus cards like the matrix
and stuff like that but this is only the
msi flavor of the card with all that
cooling apparatus all that stuff this
card's actually geared for those guys
who go out and do pro overclocking you
know they use all at ln2 and all that
crazy stuff on it I'm not gonna be doing
that because I like to keep stuff kind
of natural and at home and I don't want
to lose any my fingers I play guitar and
my fingers are precious do me also check
it out guys there have been a couple of
new really killer announcements first of
all battlefield 4 beta captain Kevin's
been playing it and giving you guys some
stuff on it you guys can check that out
here also it seems like the trademark
has been sent in and half-life 3 should
be coming if you guys want to hear more
information about that check out this
box right here so that's about it folks
I'm Elric thanks for watching if you
guys like this video hey you guys know
what to do and if you're not subject out
what we do make sure you hit that sub
button see you guys back here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
