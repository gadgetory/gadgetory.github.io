channel and today we have something
really special for you guys from the
people over the Nvidia now we had to hop
in our car travel out to the middle of
the desert to see our buddy Mark poppin
he runs a website that you guys can
check out called babble tech reviews
it's all written stuff for those of you
who still read you might want to check
it out but with that said we've got
something really interesting right here
next to me you can check it out now this
is the Titan XP Star Wars Jedi Edition
that's right no red card here this
card's all for the good people so if
you're on those bad evil people you may
not want to watch this video and go
watch them with the red card because
we've got the good card right here and
with that said let's start up a Rebel
Alliance and check this out
alright so check it Star Wars Jedi Order
and Vidya Titan XP that's right now the
Titan XP itself there's nothing
different about the you know all the
specs and all that all the specs
everything are exactly the same as your
standard Invidia Titan XP only thing is
though this card looks way different so
here's the front of the box I'll slip it
around there's not really much on the
back of the box just says Star Wars
edition the Nvidia logo and obviously a
Disney air since uh looks like Disney
now own Star Wars
what the heck alright then so there's a
top of the box let me pull this little
cap off dun dun dun dun dun duh Cameron
no alright so here we go cool-looking
thing though right
the cards are encased in this plastic
and it came like packed incredibly
insane as well it came like SuperDuper
packed so it wouldn't get broke but
inside he got the sliced noodle case
looks kinda like glass it's not glass
though obviously it's some plexiglass
but to there you guys can see that and
here it says NVIDIA Titan XP collector's
edition and obviously Star Wars in the
back there so let me just for now we'll
go ahead and pop the cap here what do to
do to do you guys can see that let me
spin it around one more time now this
card looks true because it looks like a
lightsaber now at first when I first saw
that I didn't really pick up on that but
as I take it out here you guys will kind
of see what I mean so on the top we have
the tight next collector's edition a
nice sort of window you guys can see
underneath
all of the heat fans we have a single
fan design but it's really cool because
it has the star wars emblem and the
center making it totally badass
now before I said it looked like a
lightsaber we'll check this out this is
totally like a lightsaber design if you
check it out here's like the button for
the lightsaber thingy I mean it's not
exactly that but it's pretty dang close
if you guys can see this is the Jedi
Order edition and inside of a case it
actually looks pretty cool you guys can
see it right here inside of a case where
it actually glows and looks pretty nice
as well so it is a totally unique design
to power connectors single 8 single 6
power connector just like pretty much
all those cards now in the back if I
pull this up you guys can see these are
the SLI fingers in there this car will
obviously do any type of vessel
configuration you want me get that back
on there
NVIDIA Titan XP collector's edition nice
solid backplate Star Wars Mark said not
to tap the card too hard but that's my
trademark got a tap on the back of the
card I just love those things so that's
it guys I mean not a whole lot to the
look I mean on the back you know this is
the same thing the main difference is
the card is the way all of the metal is
like aged on the card all the way around
so the card like has this like total
like industrial like look it's not
really I wouldn't consider really
steampunk maybe close to steampunk
infected pine mite fitness steam puck
thing but to me it looks just a little
bit dimmer than that just looks kind of
like industrial kind of very industrial
anyways to me okay there's also the
Titan X logo right here on the card and
then last but not least the input
outputs which are pretty much the same
one every other card they've released
that's the style of card now with that
said though let's check out the test
system which by the way out if you guys
can see the backgrounds for a little
blurry but this is mark's test system
back here he'll be testing this card and
everything so when you guys see the
video we'll have all those scores so
here you can see a screenshot of the
testam that was used for all the
benchmarks in today's video mark always
uses the latest drivers that are
available at the time of the testing we
use the latest version of Windows with
all of its updates and all that good
stuff and the rest the specs you guys
can see right here on the screen now
let's rock out freakin Jedi style to the
benchmark song Rocco
all right folks so there you have it the
bottom line here is if you like Star
Wars or you want to do a Star Wars theme
build which is what I want to do this is
an awesome freaking card to have in your
hands obviously it's the fastest single
card solution that you can get on the
market right now if you're a gamer
there's nothing out there that any other
company has that will touch this card in
pure gaming that's just the bottom line
but it's also a cavea because well this
card's like 1,200 bucks unless you're
gonna like steal your mom's jewelry or
like rob a bank to get the money most of
us can't afford to go out and just buy
these cards on a whim but if you're a
star Wars fan I mean this could be one
of those things you buy and never even
open and keep on a shelf as a
collector's item and so that's one
aspect that you might want to consider
to buy this card obviously there are a
lot of Titan XP cards out there on the
market the real difference with this one
is the whole Star Wars themed thing
there's actually two different cards
there's us you know the rebels as the
dark Empire calls us then there's the
bad guys the dark Force you know in that
cards actually red I haven't seen one of
those cards yet but I'm sure there'll be
some unboxings out there later today now
if you have a 1080i you're gonna get
about 10% more performance with this
card then you're gonna get with your car
that you have right now so 10% means
something to you and you're like man I
just need to have the absolute fast the
fastest because you want to well then
hey that may be a reason to upgrade but
for me I think the number one reasons to
really buy this card is more for a
collector's item thing I've got a lot of
stuff from Tron Star Wars so does that
mean you're the guy who because our
systems he has a ton of collector
stuff he's really into Batman so like
all that stuff like some weird
collection stuff I have knives and all
that kinds of crap so if you're a
collector this might be a card you want
to get if you're a gamer like I said and
you want to build a killer system that's
totally Star Wars oriented well this is
a great place to start I'm Eric you've
been watching Tekken Omar once again
thanks to our buddy mark for doing the
testing and for letting us check out
this card at his house so peace out
we'll see you guys back here for more
generation
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
