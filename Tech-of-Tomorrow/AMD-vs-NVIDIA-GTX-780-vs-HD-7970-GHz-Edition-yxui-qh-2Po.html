Saturday morning here on tech of
tomorrow where we've got a battle going
on that's right you guys all know the
new geforce gtx 780 has hit the market
and we have a bout today of it going
head-to-head against the AMD HD 7970
here at Edition card a lot of things in
common
something's different with that said
let's get in and let the battle begin
so before we jump into the performance
section of the video let's talk about
the specs of the car now the 780 is
based off the gk110 - 300 Core the
Radeon HD 7970 gigahertz is based off
the Tahiti XTX
as far as transistors there are 7.1
billion on the 780 and 4.31 billion on
the 7970 now as far as stream processors
or CUDA cores go
the 780 has 2,304 CUDA cores while the
Radeon HD 7970 has 2048 stream
processors pretty much the same thing
now as far as the core clock goes the
geforce gtx 780 has a core clock of 863
megahertz
it also has boost clock of 902 megahertz
the Radeon HD 7970
has a core clock of a thousand megahertz
and a boost clock of 1050 megahertz so
just 50 megahertz there as far as the
memory clock speeds go these things are
very close the GeForce GTX 780 has a
1502 megahertz
memory clock while the AMD Radeon HD
7970
has 1500 megahertz memory clock now as
far as the memory and the memory
interface both cards are identical both
cards feature three gigabytes of gddr5
memory and a 384 bit memory interface as
far as the TDP the max TVP is also the
same on both cards being at 250 watts
now as far as rap units the GTX 780 has
forty-eight while the Radeon HD 7970 has
32 as far as TM use we see 192 on the
geforce gtx 780 and 128 on the HD 7970
once again we see memory bandwidth being
almost identical between the two cards
with the geforce gtx 780 coming in with
288 point four and the AMD radeon HD
7970 coming in just two hundred and
eighty eight now here is where things do
get a bit different as far as pricing
goes the AMD Radeon HD 7970 gigahertz
Edition has a usual retail value of
about 499 dollars while the new NVIDIA
GeForce GTX is coming to market at about
six hundred and forty nine dollars
something to consider if price is very
important to you alright folks so next
up now that we've seen all the spec 2
specs comparisons let's jump in and
let's do some competitiveness the
benchmarks first up in the gaming folks
we see battlefield 3 now we tested all
of the cards of both 1920 by 1080 and
2560 by 1440 per your request our
audience we see the 7970 coming in at
1920 by 1080 at 75 frames per second we
see the 780 at the same resolution
coming in at 90 frames per second at 25
6 by 1440 we see the HD 7970 gigahertz
Edition coming in at 47 frames per
second while the GTX 780 at the same
resolution comes out at 58 frames per
second a pretty wide margin in that
particular one next up Metro last slide
we see the HD 7970 at 1920 by 1080
coming up at 54 frames per second while
we see the 780 got the same resolution
coming up at 59 frames per second which
is only a 5 second difference not much
at all at the 2560 by 1440 resolution we
see the HD 7970 coming out of 38 frames
per second and the GTX 780 at 2560 by
1440 at 42 frames per second once again
a very small margin
next up Batman Arkham City that's right
the Caped Crusader kickin ass the HD
7970 a 1920 by 1080 comes up at 105
frames per second while the GTX 780 at
the same resolution comes up at 129
frames per second a pretty decent
increment there at 2560 by 1440 we see
the 7970 coming in at 72 frames per
second and the 780 at 82 frames per
second next up we have attention the
people over at future mark this is a 3d
marked fire strike we see the 7970 with
a score of three thousand five hundred
and eighty-five and the GTX 780 with
4338 quite a bit of difference there
next up is lux mark via 2.0 we see the
7970 coming in two thousand three
hundred 1k rays a second while the 780
came in at eleven hundred and twenty
five K rays a second here's where you
see an open CL where the GTX actually at
one point loses to the AMD card next up
in gaming BioShock Infinite 7970 at 1920
by 1080 comes up at 96 point 87 frames
per second while the GTX 70 the same
resolution comes up at 112 point 46
frames per second quite a margin there
at the 2560 by 1440 resolution we see
the HD 7970 coming at 65 point o nine
frames per second and the 780 coming up
at 2560 by 1440 at 76 point 78 frames
per second Crysis 3 last but not least
one of my favorite games to date the HD
7970 at 1920 by 1080 comes up at 60
frames per second while the GTX 780
comes up at 75 frames per second at 2560
by 1440 we see the HD 7970 coming in at
40 frames per second while the GTX 780
comes in at 49 frames per second next up
let's talk about temperatures the HD
7970 had a minimum temperature value of
35 Celsius while the GTX 780 had a 37
Celsius minimum value the maximum value
under full load we see the Cee 7/7
coming in 75 Celsius while the GTX 780
comes in at 78 Celsius making the GTX
780 a slightly hotter running card
all right folks so there you guys have
all of the differences as far as the
hardware specs go and as far as
performance goes and you can see you
know obviously the new nvidia geforce
gtx 780 is obviously you know going to
kick some serious ass but it's also $649
and the newest kid on the block right I
mean this card is like you know the most
amazing thing that's come out from these
guys it's top-shelf but if you have you
know a monitor that only does 1920 by
1080 P and that's what you've got and
you've already got a car that's working
pretty good you know you may not want to
upgrade now if you're a brand new person
going out there you're considering
buying a video card and you're a fan of
AMD the 7970 gigas Edition does though
offer solid performance you guys see if
the specs are very very close to those
of the Nvidia product you know a lot of
things are the same now there's no
physics though not the advanced physics
at all although like I said before you
can use physics on an AMD card it just
uses your CPU not your GPU make sure you
guys check out the video on that if you
guys missed that by the way but at the
end of the day as far as just sheer
performance goes you guys know the new
you know card from Nvidia is obviously
going to win I think for the very
beginning of the video you folks knew
that was going to happen in this battle
now as far as using three monitors on
both you have Eyefinity over on the AMD
side of things you have surround from
Nvidia
you have nvidia surround these both
support multi monitor technologies the
big differences though the 3d glasses
you will not have any of the 3d vision
stuff going on at all if you get an AMD
card so if that's something that's very
important to you then you're not going
to want to go with the you know card by
AMD obviously because it doesn't offer
any 3d options but for $499 versus $649
with $149 price difference as far as
performance goes I mean I don't know if
you can really balance that completely
out just
far as performance goes and there's one
thing to really take note of now AMD
lately has been totally kickin down on
the gaming bundles I mean these guys are
given like great titles they're given
you know triple-a titles and trying to
really get the people in so if you're
somebody else and you don't have a whole
lot of money but you'd still like to
have some of the top align games you may
also want to consider that but at the
end of the day if you're a person that
just money has no bounds and you don't
care and you want the absolute best card
there is then obviously the new nvidia
geforce gtx 780 is the king of the ring
it will slice the head off the AMD
competition and right now there is
nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
nothing that can beat it so with that
said I hope you guys liked this video if
you guys want information on either
where to buy either a HD 7970 or a new
geforce gtx 780 check out the link down
the description below we'll have all the
links all that cool stuff you want that
there's a like button there make sure
you hit the like button otherwise I'll
have to find you and you know decapitate
you that's just how it goes now I'm just
kidding love you folks hope you liked
the video we'll see you guys soon here
on techo tomorrow it's Saturday hey have
a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
