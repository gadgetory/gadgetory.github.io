tomorrow I'm Bob your host
so you guys enjoy that intro welcome to
tech of tomorrow I'm network your host
and we're bringing you exciting stuff
today it's finally arrived we have the
tron fully built assembled and ready to
rock and roll and it's right here behind
me now this thing is really incredible
starting off from the outside isn't as a
case you guys can see there's a clear
window but this thing's been totally
custom painted white it's a metal flake
white team if you see it up close to the
light you can see it actually gleams
looks kind of pearly it's very very nice
paint job thanks to our painter guy out
there by the way and you guys can also
see now we're going to start right in
the front this is completely custom-made
Plexiglas this is not the standard front
that came to this case at all of you
guys know that but this has a case and
the CD is really cool you pop a CD in
but instead of having a jet button it's
kind of cool you just barely touch the
plastic on the right hand side down
below it and the CD ejects that's
totally really cool so check it out
starting on the front you see all these
little lightning bolt type things that
go around the side of the case they go
up on the top when you buy the case you
have these plastic things in it but
there's no lighting in them whatsoever
and thing custom did all the lighting
inside of running all the wire hiding it
behind there to bring you guys the
lights that are in there so we'll flip
it around take a look at the side window
first where you guys can see inside the
motherboard and all stuff it's an asus
motherboard thanks des sous for giving
it to us it's AP z77 this is their
premium motherboard they don't really
make too many premium motherboards this
is kind of a rare one underneath that's
the i7 3770k we have the Swift tech
cooling cooling off all of the CPU and
everything you guys can see we also have
a blue rat off to the side over here
also there's three drives on the system
powering it we have an M stated drive
with the people over at Kingston this
128 gigabyte that's actually mounted
onto the motherboard itself one of the
features of it then we have a 240
gigabyte SSD from Intel up there in
front you guys can see that actually
Anthony modded that out and put a little
Tron little finger so you can actually
see it says Tron that was any question
about it
actually named Tron pretty cool stuff I
like the mod you guys can look inside of
the case even further you can see the
main storage drive this is a western
digital drive it's a one terabyte
standard mechanical drive many people
use the strife now inside of here as
we're looking at all this stuff you guys
can see that the power supply you can't
see it it's actually a cooler master
thousand watt power supply and it's
actually located in the front hidden all
this plexiglass hides the power supply
most of the major wiring and everything
else it's really cool looking check that
out all clean all unique now the video
cards we have they're actually made for
you guys are going to hate this don't
throw rocks actually made for the people
over at Apple these are the Apple
edition cards there's 79 petition the
people of our sapphire but they're white
and they match the bill all we have to
do is flash the bias of the cards turn
them into the standard 79th it is for a
pc it's easy stuff anybody could do it
and they actually have a dual BIOS
switch on it so if you want to use that
you can use that as well now as you guys
can see also there are custom braided
professional cables going all the way
through the system I believe some of
these are made by the people over at
Silverstone the very back fan with the
blue little plexiglass that's also made
by Silverstone and the fans on top are
some by inter max this thing was really
hard to build getting all the paint to
match all the colors to match giving it
up at the water cooling system took a
lot of time and energy I know some
people aren't going to say hey you guys
should have water cooled the cards we
decided not to do that just in case some
other card came out and we can find some
other additions and upgrade the cards
later and entirely water cool the system
keeping our options open there because
sometimes we make a system and we change
it up as we go but right now you guys
can see the tron just looks amazing
thanks to all the companies out there
who supported us god bless you people we
totally appreciate your support you guys
can see it in the system here now do you
guys want questions on the parts and all
that kinds of stuff in particulars down
below in the description will have all
of those parts listed so you guys can
check those out also we hope you guys

do with that like button and if you want
to stay up to date and know all the
