tomorrow I'm Bob your host
so did you guys enjoy that intro welcome
detective tomorrow I'm Network your host
and we're bringing you exciting stuff
today it's finally arrived we have the
Tron fully built assembled and ready to
rock and roll and it's right here behind
me now this thing is really incredible
starting off from the outside isn't as a
case you guys can see there's a clear
window but this thing's been totally
custom painted white it's a metal flake
white tip you see it up close to the
light you can see it actually gleams
looks kind of pearly it's a very very
nice paint job thanks to our painter guy
out there by the way and you guys can
also see now we're gonna start right in
the front this is completely custom made
plexiglass this is not the standard
front that came in this case at all of
you guys know that but this has a case
and the CD is really cool you pop a CD
in but instead of having an eject button
it's kind of cool you just barely touch
the plastic on the right hand side down
below it and the CD ejects that's
totally really cool so check it out
starting out in the front you see all
these little lightning bolt type things
that go around the side of the case they
go up on the top when you buy the case
you have these plastic things in it but
there's no lighting in them whatsoever
and think custom did all the lighting
inside of running all of the wire hiding
it behind there to bring you guys the
lights that are in there so we'll flip
it around take a look at the side window
first where you guys can see inside the
motherboard and all stuff
it's an asus motherboard thanks stasis
for giving it to us it's a PZ 77 this is
their premium motherboard they don't
really make too many premium
motherboards this is kind of a rare one
underneath that's the i7 3770k we have
the Swift tech cooling cooling off all
of the CPU and everything you guys can
see we also have a blue rad off to the
side over here also there's three drives
on the system powering it we have an M
state of Drive but the people over at
Kings in this one hundred twenty eight
gigabyte that's actually mounted on to
the motherboard itself one of the
features of it then we have a 240
gigabyte SSD from Intel up there in the
front you guys can see that actually
Anthoni modded that out and put a little
Tron little thing there so you can
actually see it says
that was any question about it hey it's
actually named Tron pretty cool stuff
I like the mod you guys can look inside
of the case even further you can see the
main storage drive this is a Western
Digital Drive it's a one terabyte
standard mechanical drive many people
use the strive now inside of here as
we're looking at all this stuff you guys
can see that the power supply you can't
see it it's actually a Coolermaster
thousand watt power supply and it's
actually located in the front hidden all
this plexiglass hides the power supply
most of the major wiring and everything
else it's really cool-looking check that
out I'll clean all unique now the video
cards we have they're actually made for
if you guys are gonna hate this don't
throw rocks actually made for the people
over at Apple these are the Apple
addition cards they're 79th petition the
people over at sapphire but they're
white and they match the bill all we
have to do is flash the bias of the
cards turn them into the standard 79
videos for a PC it's easy stuff anybody
could do it and they actually have a
dual BIOS switch on it so if you want to
use that you can use that as well
now as you guys can see also there are
custom braided professional cables going
all the way through the system I believe
some of these are made by the people
over at Silverstone the very back fan
with the blue Plexiglas that's also made
by Silverstone and the fans on top are
some by inter max this thing was really
hard to build getting all the paint to
match all the colors to match giving it
up at the water cooling system took a
lot of time and energy I know some
people aren't gonna say hey you guys
should have water cooled the cards we
decided not to do that just in case some
other card came out and we can find some
other additions and upgrade the cards
later and entirely water cool the system
keeping our options open there because
sometimes we make a system and we change
it up as we go
but right now you guys can see the Tron
just looks amazing
thanks to all the companies out there
who support us god bless you people we
totally appreciate your support you guys
can see it in the system here now do you
guys want questions on the parts and all
that kinds of stuff in particulars down
below in the description we'll have all
of those parts listed so you guys can
check those out also we hope you guys
like this video if so you know what to
do with that like button and if you want
to stay up to
and know all the things that are going
on in TECO tomorrow on a daily basis you
guys can follow us on Twitter you guys
can follow us on Google+ Facebook or you
guys can just sub to the channel in this
little box right here behind me so I'm
Marik I'm off have fun I got to go put
her know Wes in this thing and then see
how badass the games</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
