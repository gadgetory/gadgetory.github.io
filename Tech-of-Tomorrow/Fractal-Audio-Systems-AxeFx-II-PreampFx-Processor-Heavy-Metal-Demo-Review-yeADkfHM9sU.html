tomorrowland gets me tell Rick Faris
your host here on second tomorrow you
guys saw us unbox the fractal XFX -
today we're gonna bring you some guitar
sampling we're gonna be using a couple
of actually what I consider to be the
heavy metal stuff that said let's just
jump in and do a little jamming
so check it out guys we've got a
jam-packed in here right now I'm using
what's called factory preset FSA lead
one this is number 34 it has some pretty
cool sounds on it you guys can hear that
as I'm playing there's lots of different
values in here though
what has change they're a couple this
one's called whoa as I smacked the
guitar around this one's called the d60
Wentz a little bit different sounding
ha that was kind of nifty wasn't it he
was showing you guys different stuff
here and about the greatest guitar
playing the role tell you that now
this one's called camera and hi
here's another one here we'll see number
33 or than we just did a second ago it's
come down to 31 this was called corn cob
I kind of like this one quite a bit I
think it's a pretty cool one
pretty good sounding stuff there I'm
really liking all these patches corn cob
is actually one of my faves I haven't
gone through all these but you guys want
to do real fast so I basically got it
all hooked up we thought you saw it move
down this is called energy ball
that one's pretty ballsy folks I got to
say that the number 29 energy ball got
some fucking balls let's just switch
around here check out a couple others
this one is another one of the rhythms
is another rhythm channel here
we've talked about this before basically
this thing is very easy to operate
there's a value button right here you
just move the value button up to how you
want to be there's so many Gann presets
in here then you go on forever so this
must be for bass who's like a bass
preset
- sure you guys know but let's face it
it's easy to use if you want to tune
your guitar there's a tuner right here
today though we're just basically
showing you guys all of the presets that
we're having in here today it was pretty
much metal day as far as I'm concerned
hey guys want you guys to check this out
this is my Dave from the stain ESP
guitar this thing's like one of my
favorites I couldn't find its katar and
then we found it at the last second but
I want to show to you guys this thing
sounds pretty badass
Mustaine knows the guitars man
I love this guitar wait for another
video as we show you more shit on the
axe-fx - and I'll see your brothers
later I'm gonna go play some fucking
guitar Joe
