guys back here once again on the channel
so check it out we all know that the
brand new and Vidia gtx 1070 Ti is hit
the market and people are probably going
why well I can honestly tell you why and
this is the reason why Nvidia didn't
really have a spot to directly compete
with the Vega 56 and the Vegas 64 they
their 1070 then they add their 1080 but
there was still a little bit of margin
as long as pricing and stuff goes like
that so they made this card pretty much
to be at the market to have a price of
449 dollars now this makes it just
slightly more expensive than a 56 but
actually $100 cheaper than a Vegas 64
and that's why they did I mean now they
have a spot right in there at a lower
price that's competing very very well
totally being the 56 on pretty much
everything across the board 56 can't
keep up with this card we do see a
little switch off between the 64 and the
1070 TI's which you guys will obviously
see in the video but that said though
let's jump in real quick and I'll tell
you guys the difference between a 1070
and a 1070 I for those people out there
who don't know will talk about our brand
new test system and this time we went a
little bit of a different way with our
test is amusingly always go for the
top-end things we go for the i7 you know
we were gonna do the 7800 but we decided
that we would use the brand new I 580
600 so this is a really nice so it's 8
600 K by the way and this is a very nice
cpu very well priced and performs great
so let's real quick let's talk about the
differences between the 1070 TI and the
standard 1070 the standard 1070 had 1920
cuda cores the 1070 TI has 2432 cuda
cores now here's something that's a
little bit tricky though the 1070 TI
even though it has a higher base clock
of 1600 and 7 megahertz compared to the
1506 on the 1070 both cards share the
same boost clock speed at 1680 3 alright
so you guys can see on paper the
differences between the 1070 and the
1070 I are very very
we see a few more CUDA cores and we see
a hundred megahertz on the base clock
and that's pretty much it the memory all
the rest the specs and everything are
exactly the same as the 1070 no changes
and all the things that you like about
Nvidia cards for Nvidia fans are all
there with that said though let's check
out the test system Before we jump into
those benchmarks the test system used in
today's video features an Intel Core i5
80 600 K with a maximum turbo frequency
at 4.3 gigahertz and it requires 95
watts of TDP the motherboard we use the
gigabyte Z 370 AORs ultra gaming
motherboard featuring the Intel Z 370
Express chipset we're using 16 gigabytes
of ddr4 this is a corsair dominator
Platinum Series it's 2 8 gigabyte sticks
at 3000 megahertz as far as the power
supply goes we're using the C Sonic
focus plus series SSR 850 FX 850 watt 80
plus gold power supply now as far as the
OS goes we use the latest patch version
of Windows 10 we used a beta driver for
the 1070 Ti and we use the latest driver
available from AMD for the Vega cards
with that said though let's rock on and
let's check out those benchmarks
as far as the temperatures go the gtx
1070 TI got as high as 83 Celsius enter
full load which was actually right in
the middle of all the cards we tested
alright so at the end of the day you
guys can see that the 1070 TI just fits
in that weird space it pretty much
totally wipes out the 56 in DirectX 12
it actually gets beat by the 64
sometimes sometimes it doesn't so at the
end of the day I just have to say this
this card is about four hundred and
forty nine dollars and obviously you
guys see it does beat the Vega 56 by
quite a bit so is it worth $50 more than
the Vega 56 I mean I would honestly say
yes and it's $100 cheaper than the Vegas
64 so I mean unless you're a person
who's looking for a mining card I mean I
probably wouldn't go with the Vegas 64
over this card either now some people
are gonna say well hey it does better in
some of the DirectX 12 games but if you
guys really played the DirectX 12 games
because I mean in my opinion I don't
really feel like the games look any
better or anything else in DirectX 12 it
just seems to me like DirectX 12 just
makes your games run slower you know
kind of like you know making your car
I'd have had a heavy weight so that your
engines got a run longer I don't see
really that great of improvements in
DirectX 12 visually with me looking at
it I'm not seeing anything that great so
is being a little bit better at DirectX
12 at this point in time better now
people are gonna say okay but it's
future proof I'm just gonna tell you
this right now been watching this game
for years go on
as soon as DirectX 12 becomes the
mainstay pretty much whenever anything
becomes the mainstay I'm gonna say this
right now the mainstay so what that
means is that that's like with the thing
that everybody's using because in the
past
AMD many times has beat Intel and NVIDIA
to the board with newer I mean it's
happened let's just face it for the
longest time the only CPU that would
support 64-bit Windows was obviously in
AMD chip but the whole time they did it
nobody really used it because there was
nothing out that was actually supporting
it and then guess what the day that
actually became relevant whoa well you
know that Intel was there and they had
64-bit CPU so the same thing the same
things going to happen here in the video
card market as soon as DirectX 12
becomes SuperDuper relevant you know
damn well NVIDIA is gonna have something
to do that to change the game now to me
if Nvidia really really wanted to
compete with it with with the AMD excuse
me they would make their cards more
oriented for doing Bitcoin mine because
if they did that then all those people
out there buying up all the cards for
Bitcoin mining and screen gamers that
are being able to buy their cards that
would pretty much be eliminated because
people just go oh I don't have to buy
that anymore you know and I think that
would really work out well for them when
we're actually going to see that happen
I don't know now I have heard rumors to
that effect that's going to happen but
so far we've yet to see it so you guys
can see and all the testing and
everything that this card fits in a spot
and I would pretty much say it's came in
to be the Vega killer because it's only
fifty dollars more expensive than the 56
and it's $100 cheaper than the 64 and in
most tests it beats the 64 in a few
directx12 things it doesn't but that's I
to me a wee bit of margin and we're
still looking at you know people you
know buying the cards for Bitcoin mining
raising the prices up on AMD stock so
you can't get a hold of the cards so it
not only becomes a game at the end of
the day of which card actually runs
better it becomes which card can you
actually afford to get your hands on
right because if you can't get your
hands on it and you're going to be
paying somebody on eBay or something
like $900 you get a hole of a 64 card
because you want to be out minor well
the gamers out there they're not gonna
be able to afford that because they're
not actually making money off their card
they're spending money on their card
anyways I'm Alaric you guys have been
watching Tech and Morrow peace out like
usual down below like button we'll have
more information so if you guys want to
check out even more information or to
purchase cards and all the good stuff
we'll have it down there we've also got
more stuff coming up overclocking and
SLI coming up next peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
