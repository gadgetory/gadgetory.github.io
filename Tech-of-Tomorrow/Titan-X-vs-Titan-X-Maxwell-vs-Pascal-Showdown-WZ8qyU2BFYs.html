once again a TECA tomorrow I'll work
here with buddy the dog G behind the
camera so we brought you a series of
videos on the tight neck so far we're in
two videos this one though is basically
a video that shows how the old Titan
compares to the new Titan so without any
further ado let's check out the Clash of
the Titans foes you fall in the channel
you guys know we've been using the i7
6700 we've kept this thing and it's
turbo boost o'clock at 4.4 confident
throughout all the testing we've got a
nice motherboard from the people over
there at asrock and we also have some
rip job memory and with that said though
let's now check out those benches
you
okay so you guys can see that the new
Pascal seriously smokes the old Maxwell
chipset damn it gets pwned seriously by
the new one not a lot of people out
there saying it's the new Titan xB but
well not according to it and video I
know some people out there have called
it that but that's not what it is that's
the new Titan X that does Pascal's we're
gonna fill the P in there some people
said oh it works with Windows XP so it's
the Titan xbe all funny and good stuff
but it's there you can have it though
you know obviously it's kicking butt
though on the old Maxwell so if you're
somebody out there and you own the old
Max one you're wondering hey shall I
upgrade this is the card for me well you
can see obviously it is a serious
performance contender and it beats the
old generation by quite a bit
we've got much more testing coming on
Direct compute and all kinds of
different stuff direct stuff directly
with AMD you guys have been asking for
just give us time we're still getting
settled in as you guys see we're in
different film area and well and that's
about it like usual check out the link
down below we'll have link to our buddy
site as well and we'll see you guys back
around TECA tomorrow for more tech
videos see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
