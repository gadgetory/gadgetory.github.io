tech source and welcome to another ask
me episode so once again I reached out
on Twitter and I asked you guys to send
me in your questions so I can feature
them in this next episode so yeah let's
get started so before I start answering
some questions but you guys might be
asking in the comments section even now
as we speak what happened to big red
it's no longer here well I did mention
that on Twitter and Instagram I'm
actually working on a project and it's
still in progress it will most likely be
up on Tuesday of next week so make sure
yes stick around for that
what slider and tripod combo do you use
after you got rid of the shark slider
actually I went with the canova slider
but then it was a piece of crap and I
sent it back and went back to the shark
slider in addition to the Sharks slider
I also picked up a wireless slider kit
and I'm absolutely loving this thing
what do you recommend spending more
money on keyboard or mouse and that
comes from my good friend kappa i would
definitely say well my personal
experience the mouse just because I'm
using the mouse a lot more but it would
then depend on your experience if you
use the keyboard more maybe you spend a
little bit more on the keyboard windows
8.1 or 10 for gaming you know when
Windows 10 came out it had a lot of bugs
and I'm actually made my PC crash a few
times so I can revert back to 8.1 but I
love Windows 10 so much so once the bugs
are cleared and it's up to date I would
definitely go with Windows 10 what is
your pet hate apart from people not
having an extended Mass Effect I think
even pet peeve aside from that I would
say definitely cable management it just
is just a bunch of cables on the ground
it kind of makes me like cringe a little
bit what made you start wanting to make
tech videos I don't know actually what
made me transition to tech videos my
original II started YouTube as a hobby
and I think the first ever video was me
on my motorcycle I was filming having
fun and then like after a month or so
and gained like a hundred thousand views
and that was like I was like whoa people
actually watch my videos
that's kind of what made me continue
making videos but then I slowly
transition into tech because I enjoy
tech how old are you actually answer
this time I very first ask me video I
think but I was born on April 8 1988 so
that makes me 27 what camera or camera
gear do you recommend to beginning tech
youtubers I actually put together a
bunch of gear including a camera for
people that are starting out on YouTube
or their film career and stuff and you
guys can find a link to that down below
but it's basically on every single one
of my videos if you guys ever want to
check them out cuz I will constantly
update them iOS or Android plug old
windows what does your favorite god and
smite gee that's a good question
I love Zeus and I love Ratatat and you
squirrel God that was released like a
few weeks ago that he is Opie what type
of laptop would you recommend for
partial gaming and for music production
for light gaming and productivity if you
have four or five hundred bucks I would
definitely tell you to check out the Zen
book from Asus I'll leave a link down
below for a few of them you should check
out
will you ever stream on twitch TV I
don't know I've never really a screamer
type of guy but right now my main focus
is making YouTube videos but maybe in
the near future or way in the future
when I maybe do gaming videos for fun
maybe can you make a video on best
budget graphics cards yes I did announce
that on my top five CPU video I want to
make that video when I have every single
graphics card in hand so I can do
benchmarks and stuff and then get my
personal recommendation to you guys so
that won't happen until October because
this months gonna be extremely busy for
me so if you guys have patience please
wait for it it will happen
it's under fifty PC build possible to
make maybe in the year 3000 what other
color combos do you like apart from red
and black I like red black and white
what do you drive I actually posted this
on Instagram as well but I Drive a 2013
Scion fr-s and the lease is actually up
this December or November I think and
I'm thinking about either paying off the
rest of the amount owed and just keeping
it or upgrading and getting a different
car but
still thinking about it there will
definitely be a vlog so stick around
which countries would you like to visit
in your life I am planning actually I'm
not really planning but my first country
I want to visit coz I haven't really
been out of the country
ever in my life it's going to be Japan
Tokyo and that's gonna happen sometime
next year but really anywhere in Europe
would be nice after that what is the
thing you like most on your channel you
guys honestly though the most rewarding
thing I would say is your feedback after
watching my videos the way you guys do
comments and the likes and all that it's
just the most rewarding thing ever
how do you manage to be such a cool and
calm guy as well as managed a successful
YouTube channel I may seem like I'm cool
and calm now but when the cameras off I
am very stressed and I'm not as cool so
yeah the power of editing makes me seem
that way but and thank you so much for
calling the channel successful I don't
think I can really stay successful until
I reach the million subscriber mark at
least to me what will you be using big
red for so much Anisa before on my
Twitter and my periscope I think but big
red will be given to Bob temporarily and
he's gonna use that PC to help make
videos for a tech source and then I'm
gonna be building myself a sky like PC
hopefully either this month or next what
is your favorite type of game MMO Moab
FPS I think I meant to say MOBA but my
favorite type of game
it used to be FPS but now it's RPG and I
absolutely love the Final Fantasy and
Kingdom Hearts series those are my top
favorite games of all time are you
thinking of doing vlogs
I've been asked if so many times but I
may in the future or maybe near future
start a vlog channel but it won't be a
daily kind of vlog thing maybe just once
in a while if I have something
interesting going on I'll just bring up
the camera and make a vlog but if I'm
gonna do a vlog it's gonna be well done
it's not gonna be crappy shaky camera
stuff like that so definitely yes how
old is Snowie so snow I appeared first
on my cool tech September video he's
he's my dog he's a Maltese and poodle
mix and he is I think
two years old now or a year and a half I
would say but I here's a picture of him
so that's it for all the questions thank
you guys so much for sending them and
I'm extremely sorry if I didn't get to
answer your question I answer as many as
I can in a short amount of time in this
video but make sure you guys are
following me an instant Instagram yeah
Twitter and Instagram because that is
where I'll be reaching out and asking
you guys to send me more questions
because I will be doing this once a
month real quick a lot of you guys been
asking me about the t-shirts that I've
been posting on Instagram these are my
personal shirts that I made for the
channel I don't I'm not making them for
sale just yet but you guys have been
asking me if I will be doing this and
apparently a lot of you guys want it so
definitely later this year I will make a
few t-shirts available on piece Pring so

later when it happens but also another
thing I want to mention if you guys
