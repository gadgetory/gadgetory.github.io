video we showing you how to create your
very own website so Wix which that
recently and teamed up with me to show
you guys are build your very own
professional website using their
platform you don't have to have any
knowledge of coding to get started so
with these tools are great at helping
you build your online presence it's a
very intuitive and straightforward
process and can be done at no cost which
even provides premium plans of their
sites builder which will unlock features
such as connecting a domain you may
already own as well as additional
storage for your content you can even
purchase a new domain through Wix so
your site can definitely look and feel
polished here's a quick look at the
website I made for myself and in this
video I'll be showing you guys how it
can be made in just under 10 minutes so
once we are on Wix calm and create an
account we have to choose which type of
website we want to create Wix is geared
towards just about anyone whether you're
someone that runs a business a musician
a designer or a photographer for example
but for my website I'm going to go ahead
with a blog the next item we're going to
select is the Wix artificial design
intelligence or Adi for short now I will
be typing in tech blog for the type of
website I'm not going to be selling
anything on the web site or taking any
appointments so we can leave those
unchecked and of course I will be using
the name text source for the website and
I won't be using an address for it so we
can skip that step as well now over here
you can add extra information about
yourself that viewers of the website may
find relevant making all aspects of your
brand easily accessible is very
important so I'll be adding my social
media links as well as the text source
logo
now if we click on next we'll be taken
to where we start using the Wix Adi so
now we have to pick a theme for our
website
none of these really stand out to me but
Wix always allows you to modify it later
on so for now I'll be choosing the agile
theme all we have to do now is let Wix
create the home page and we'll be ready
to make the website into our own okay
this isn't looking too bad so far I
think the first thing I'm going to be
doing is changing the colors so they
match better with the theme of text
source
so I'll click site design on the top
left corner and then customize it now
from here we can change the color
palette the color palette mode and the
fonts set being used on a current theme
now while Wix includes a wide variety of
color palettes none of them are exactly
what I like so I can go in and change
the colors for each part of the website
as exactly as I'd like
okay how's that been looking better now
now the next thing I want to change is
the header because it has a phone number
field if I won't be using this so I'll
have to do is click on the header and
simply uncheck the phone number field
and it's gone Wix makes making any
changes like these super easy now the
rest of the header it looks good but I'm
going to add more pages so currently all
I have is a home page but I do want to
add an about me page as well so the does
that just click on the page in the left
hand corner and then select add page to
make a new one Wix already provides a
wide range of styles to choose from that
can be customized just like the home
page I think I'm going to go ahead with
this one now we are on the about page
and Wix has added a link to the page to
the top of the header it's looking good
so far but the stock image is out of
place and it isn't relevant to the site
we are making so all I have to do is
click on it and select replace option on
the sidebar now I can use any image that
I've already uploaded or upload a new
one to use on this page I think I'm
going to go ahead and pick this one now
that that's done I'm going to go ahead
and move forward to the site editor so
all you have to do is go to the site at
the top right and then click on go to
editor now you must be sure that you are
done using the ADI because you won't be
able to return to it
you go into the editors okay so now that
we are in the editor we can fine tune
the website even further than the for
now the first thing that immediately
stands out to me is this large image
right at the top of the page I'm going
to change this to something more fitting
for tech stores so all I have to do is
click anywhere on the image and select
change strip background now instead of
using an image provided by Wix I'm going
to use my own that I uploaded just like
I did on the about me page I still have
this big block of text covering the
image but I want to remove that and use
something that's more enticing to people
that visit my website so I can easily
click on the text and press Delete on
the keyboard to remove them it's very
simple so what I want to add instead is
a video something that represents Texas
as a brand to do that I click on the
plus button on the left side and select
video from there I'll choose YouTube and
it will automatically be placed in the
center there's a number of options to
edit the video player but the first one
I'll start with is choosing the video to
play for this I'll use my latest video
now there are a few options here for
video playback so I can toggle on or off
autoplay loop and even visibility of the
player controls since autoplay and video
loop can get distracting to the viewers
I will leave those off for now but I
will keep video control set to on hover
so they don't get in the way when
someone is watching the video so video
player is looking a bit on the small
side so I will resize it first before
making any other changes so this looks
good not too big but not too small where
it's hardly visible now for the layout
so you can choose the visibility of the
video title and the player controls I
will hide the video title since those
are usually on the thumbnail anyways and
leave the video controls on the default
the dark color now the last option is
the design of the video frame itself I'm
going to add a slight drop shadow just
so it rests cleaner on the top of the
background image now that's looking a
lot better now scrolling below that is
the section for blog posts I'm going to
keep this as is since I like the way
it's always designed I'm going to add a
social media feed to the
right side so I have to do is click on
the Add button again on the left side
and pick an option from the social media
category I'm going to add a social media
screen since I want to quickly show my
latest tweets alongside the newest posts
to the blog so once the app is added to
the sites I just have to double click
the top and begin connecting my Twitter
accounts to it so over here I will
select feeds and then add my Twitter
account and then from here I can add
another account or even choose which
tweets are visible on the website but I
will leave this lone and let wicks fetch
each new tweets that goes out so now I
can resize just like with the other
elements on the website and move it
around the page I will shrink it however
to match the size of the recent post
archive and even tag element and put the
tweets right below those I'm really
liking how the site is turning out and
it's all been an extremely easy process
but what I want to do next is make the
header always visible no matter how far
someone Scrolls down on a page so to do
that I will go back to the top of the
page and click inside the header then
the gear icon now all I have to do is
toggle on the frees header and now the
text source title and links will follow
when I scroll up and down the page I
just noticed at the bottom of the page
that there is a dedicated section with
contact information since I won't be
needing this I will simply just remove
it just like with every other option on
Wix just click on the section and delete
it it's as simple as that
I will also be doing the same for the
subscription box since I won't be
running a newsletter through the website
since we're this far into the site
design process I think I should check
how it will appear on other devices
which makes this very easy and I'll have
to do is click on the phone icon at the
top of the editor and switch it to
mobile view by default Wix optimizes any
website for desktop and mobile versions
which is pretty cool and just like that
the site looks great and easy to
navigate even on a smaller screen I can
even tab over to the about page and
check how that looks as well from here I
can modify the different elements just
for the mobile view but for now I will
leave it as is so I think the site is
looking pretty good and ready for
publishing just like with any other
website I can go back and add new posts
we organize the elements of it and even
change up the entire design altogether
but I think this is a pretty good start
for now as you
when I check out this website I created
for myself I'll drop a link to it down
below so that's it for the video as you
guys saw is very easy to build a website
using Wix in under 10 minutes even with
the free version of the service
everything you need to get started and
get your name out there is provided as I
mentioned before there are also paid
premium versions that will unlock more
features to take your new website to the
next level I'll drop a link to the
website down below if you guys can build
one for yourselves thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
