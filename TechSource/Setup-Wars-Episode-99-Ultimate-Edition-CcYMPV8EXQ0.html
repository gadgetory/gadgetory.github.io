hundredth episode of setup Wars potato
additions going to be very special video
very excited I can't believe it's almost
been 100 episodes since I started this
and actually one of reasons why the
channel blew up is because of setup wars
and because you guys enjoy watching it
so thank you for that it's been a hell
of a ride it's just getting started I'm
just warming up my god waste any time
let the set up words begin actually
welcome to the fourth episode 99 the
letter set up orders begin
starting out the show we got Francisco
all the way from Italy with a very clean
triple monitor set up featuring three
24-inch LG monitors that are hooked up
to the wall with not a single wire in
sight Daniel that looks good he's also
rocking a logitech Orion spark g9 10
keyboard and G 700 s Mouse both of which
are resting on the extended mouse pad
from glorious I also like the position
of the Samsung microphone right above
the drilled hole for the keyboard and
mouse this way he doesn't have to drill
an extra hole and it kind of covers up
the cables a bit against the wall he has
a pair of Edifier M 3200 speakers with
the subwoofer on the top shelf against
the corner and then below that we got
the cursor void RGB wireless headset but
what I like the most about the setup is
the way the PC is spaced out on the
other side without any cables visible
and before I check out the cable
management let's admire this PC a bit so
this is a custom water-cooled PC however
there is only a single loop going
through the 4790k while the GTX 1080
remains air-cooled there's also a lot of
custom work like the custom painted PSU
cover backplate and even some
motherboard accents there's even some
Star Wars props in there but what
impress me will be cable management not
inside the case but outside usually when
you look at a PC from an angle you can
see the wires sticking out from behind
but what francisco did was very clever
it looks like you cut out some slits
near the back of the i/o and ran the
cables through the case for a very clean
look I'm impressed
and speaking of cable management it's
done very well underneath the desk the
main thing holding up the cables are
dust two very long raceways and of
course we do have some 3m tape and zip
ties holding up the accessories for easy
access the only small thing that kind of
bothered me was the symmetry of the top
shelves when looking at the monitors
directly but other than that this is a
very beautiful and nearly flawless setup
Thank You Francisco for entering
speaking of nearly flawless let's keep
the train going with Harry's quad
display set up between three 24-inch
BenQ monitors and a 40 inch Toshiba TV
on top once again a very clean job with
cable management it looks like Harry
rather the cables behind the wall for
all of his displays actually doesn't
look like it he added a power strip and
host
everything to it instead interesting you
also put in the notes go easy on me I'm
only 15 Oh Harry I don't evil cold war
everybody gets the same treatment all
seriousness though it doesn't look like
you have anything to worry about I mean
if you're only 15 and are able to do
this then I commend you good serve
any parents of course for paying for
most of the stuff I mean you got a lot
of expensive gear here there's no way
you've managed to pay for all this
yourself
we got the Razer BlackWidow chroma
keyboard mama tournament Mouse Firefly
mouse pad and not one but two Xbox
consoles the original 360 and the Xbox
one side by side and I haven't even
gotten to this PC which by the way looks
to be water-cooled it has a CT 700 K and
a gtx 750ti which he said is going to
upgrade it to a gtx 1070 soon I love
that he has a crazy 4 display setup and
then you look down below and see a dinky
little Bluetooth speaker is that your
only audio source
apparently not there's a pair of Astro
a40 s hiding in a drawer he probably
thought I was going to talk smack if he
left it on the desk so we just hit it
away
there's also another setup which he is
calling the recording desk and it's
basically a blue Yeti microphone that's
hooked up to his Acer laptop you know
what though I will give you major props
on the cable management this is a work
of art it does look like you care about
your setup and the amount of time spent
perfecting it really shows excellent
setup Thank You Harry for entering very
impressive Levi's next up and holy cow
the presentation on this one and that
backdrop though damn so Levi is rocking
327 inch Acer monitors a single 24 inch
from LG near the top which is all hooked
up against that backdrop once again not
a single wire in sight except the PC
obviously I was just talking about the
monitors underneath these monitors we
got the drivel caliber 71 RGB keyboard
and Logitech G 403 mouse and that's
pretty much it the setup is kind of
looking a bit empty to be honest but if
that's the theme you're going with then
you did a great job
ok management also seems to be under
control so no complaints here and then
we got the PC that's powering the setup
that has a 3700 and a GTX 10 7
inside the s340 elite case and that
pretty much wraps up the simple and
clean quad display setup Thank You Levi
for entering and number four we got o
dock with a six black and wet setup but
way guys because it gets better later on
so he's rocking the next 34 a star on
the left and an ASIS 24 inch on the
right that's sitting on a desk with
custom carbon fiber wraps that actually
looks pretty cool he's also using Razer
BlackWidow chroma X keyboard and the
Razer Naga Mouse on top of the Razer
Firefly mousepad and that's on top of
another mousepad for audio he's walking
a two full sound bar and the Sennheiser
game 0 headset hanging from underneath
the desk even though it's not using the
pullout keyboard drawer he actually
decided to rap it anyways just to stay
consistent with the whole carbon-fiber
theme K Weismann is great nothing I
would recommend really I mean it's
pretty obvious you know what you're
doing here there are no wires on the
ground things are neatly tucked away
pretty good job overall even the cable
management on the PC is great we got
another water-cooled PC but this time
the GPU is cooled as well it's rocking a
4790k and an EVGA GTX 980 he even has a
remote to turn on his PC from a distance
because it's out of reach I don't know
if that's just being lazy or super
convenient he does have another desk get
over here we got the original
PlayStation and ps2 but I got a feeling
he uses the HTC vive a lot more it
doesn't even stop there he also has a
custom-built arcade machine in a Tron
theme and ladies and gentlemen a coffee
table that has a custom water-cooled PC
built inside along with a 19 inch
monitor we don't know the specs
unfortunately the only thing we do know
is that it's an AMD system if you look
closely you can actually tell that the
floor along with some of the parts are
covered in the same carbon fiber as his
desk beautiful setup
thank you all doc for entering last
knowledge you got Danielle with a pretty
simple black and red setup featuring
three 24-inch asus monitors he's also
got the coarser K 65 RGB keyboard and
asus path wireless mouse it doesn't look
like he uses any headphone so the only
audio source are those giant Cyril and
Vega speakers which are resting on its
side there are a few wall shelves that
are holding up a variety of alcohol and
some Funko figurines you got Jon Snow
venom and
course Wally I like how he zip-tied the
power brick against the monitor mount to
keep it from touching the table and
healed management under the desk is not
bad pretty straightforward stuff Signum
racks zip ties II know the deal the PC
power unit setup has these 50 70 K and 2
GTX 780 s in sli also kudos for keeping
with the color scheme a lot of people do
a good job but when it comes to the
chair they just completely forget about
it or don't think it's as important so
it's nice to see that the chair fits in
with the rest of this setup as well
