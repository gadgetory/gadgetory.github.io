tech source and in this video I'm going
to go over ten of the best power banks
that you can currently buy ranging from
smaller more compact power banks all the
way up to larger and more powerful ones
that can juice up all of your devices
all the power banks I mentioned in this
video will be linked down below in the
order that they appear so without
wasting any more time let's start the
video so starting from the bottom we
have the very popular lithium card this
is the perfect sized portable charger
for anyone who is always on the go and
he's a slight charge to survive until
they get home but I like about the
charger besides it's super thin profile
is the fact that it comes with the cable
tucked in on the side so you don't need
to carry around extra cables it does
come in several different colors and
there is a microUSB version for Android
devices and a lightning cable version
for Apple products which is the one you
are seeing here clicking on the power
button will initiate the charge and will
also indicate how much juice is left by
flashing the LEDs either white for full
charge blue for under 90% and red for
under 10% simply pop out the USB and
connect it to any USB port and it begins
charging and that I mentioned it's super
thin they can practically fit inside a
wallet next up is the older brother the
lithium card Pro and it's essentially
the same thing but with more than double
the milliamps and size I actually did a
video on this charger on my channel
showing off the charging speeds and a
lithium card Pro actually charges your
devices faster than a traditional wall
outlet it's called a hyper charger for a
reason but you guys can check out the
video for the actual results so comes
equipped with a lightning cable or micro
USB cable depending on which version you
pick up and a USB cable tucked in the
sides the USB cable is used to charge
the actual power bank by connecting it
to your laptop or PC in addition to more
milliamps the pro card features an
additional USB out on one side and a
micro USB in on the other if you decide
to charge a power bank using a micro USB
cable instead of the standard also since
it comes with a USB out you can
practically connect any device to it
and charge two devices at the same time
another really cool feature is the
bypass system which means that you can
access the files on your phone by
connecting one end to your PC and the
other end to your phone and actually
find this feature pretty useful another
great portable power bank is the VIN
stick tool battery charger for under ten
bucks you get a tiny rectangular shaped
power bank with 3,200 milliamps of power
on the go it has a single one amp output
and comes with a bunch of colors hitting
the power button will activate the LEDs
indicating how much juice is left and
it's definitely a great portable power
bank for travel next up is the water
resistant power bank from Koo Chi R an
aluminium body wrapped in tough silicone
makes this an awesome power bank for the
outdoors it comes in an optional silver
color and it's built to take a beating
seriously though I tried destroying this
thing and I couldn't even get a single
scratch on it the USB ports are located
on the bottom with a rubber seal to
protect it from water damage and it
features a single one amp output and a
2.1 amp output for larger devices and
you can charge two at the same time
holding down the power button will
activate the built-in flashlight and
pressing it once will indicate how much
juice is left but overall a very solid
power bank for people at camp and hike
outdoors oh and did I mention that it's
waterproof the next three power banks
win in the aesthetics department and are
personally my favorite out of the ten
showed in this video starting off as the
I mix 10,000 milliamp hour bank that
comes in a stunning black and red design
and there's also one available in yellow
and blue so besides the sleek design it
features two smart icy USB ports on the
bottom and a power button on the side
that will show how much juice is left in
the power bank then we have the 10,000
milliamp tech tribe power bank a
super-thin full aluminum design with an
inward curve on the side that gives it a
really cool look and it features two USB
ports and a power button for the
built-in flashlight the tech tribe also
comes with a lifetime warranty the last
of the three is the anchor efore 13,000
milliamp power bank that features power
IQ technology that detects your device
and delivers the fastest charge up to
three apps you can pick one up in a few
color options and it also features a
built in flashlight with a glossy finish
which as you can tell is a finger
prynt magnet the next power bank has
been featured on my channel before
because of its unique design this is the
Vivi's Knight v3 13,000 milliamp power
bank that features an attached micro USB
cable which is great since you don't
need to carry around one unless you have
an iPhone and in that case you just have
to use the USB port on the top on the
side you have the LED indicator button
along with the micro USB port needed to
charge the power bank but what's so cool
about this power bank is that it comes
with a slot for your smartphone which
means that you can charge your phone and
watch hours of video without worrying
about the battery life this next power
bank is no stranger and it's been
featured many times in my past videos
but it deserves a place in this one as
well simply because this is the best
bang for your buck power bank you can
currently buy it features twenty two
thousand four hundred milliamps of
goodness and three USB ports that you
can use to charge up to three devices at
the same time by the way if you guys are
digging these awesome carbon fiber skins
I have on all my devices you should
really check out the first link down
below you won't be disappointed
so the power bank also comes with a
built in flashlight and it's available
in a bunch of colors last but not least
we have the mother of all power banks
the ultra high capacity twenty-five
thousand six hundred million portable
charger from anchor it features three
USB ports with IQ technology that will
once again detect your devices and
deliver the fastest charging available
up to three amps per port or four amps
through the three ports if you decide to
charge three devices at the same time
like the e4 this two has a glossy finish
which will attract fingerprints easily
and has a built in flashlight as well
