might be wondering why I sound like a
dying cow well I just came back from my
six day cruise to the Caribbean which
was awesome by the way
but on the cruise ship I caught an upper
respiratory tract infection so I'm in
the process of taking medication and I'm
getting better so unfortunately you have
to hear this voice for this entire
episode but I promise you will be gone
by next week but with that said welcome
to setup wars episode 124 where you so
much desk setup to get featured on the
channel let the setup wars begin
starting off the episode we got maxim
and his pretty straightforward and clean
setup featuring three AOC 24-inch
monitors that are hooked up against a
wall
the only things he's got on a desk are
the keyboard and mouse and a pair of
Logitech Z 506 speakers it's interesting
how he flanked his desk with two IKEA
drawers and he managed to put his PC on
the right side I feel like this is
always a dilemma for everyone and their
setup if there isn't any space on the
desk they just leave it on the ground
guys there are other ways around this
and Maxim actually showed a great
example of what you can do especially if
you have a good-looking PC like his with
a clear side panel just buy a drawer or
a side table and put it next to your
setup I've seen a lot of people use IKEA
Alex yours right next to their setup
which is a win-win you not only get
extra space for your PC but you also get
tons of extra storage space for cable
management to maximum hold up his parish
tip above his setup and against the wall
which is an interesting location the
rest of the wires under the table are
managed very well with some cable clips
a very clean triple monitor setup Thank
You Maxim for starting off the show
PJ is next up with a stormtrooper
black-and-white setup featuring a 42
inch 4k TV up top followed by a 34 inch
ultra wide from LG near the bottom and
my voice is cracking this is actually a
Productivity setup for his YouTube
channel called peanut jelly because on
the left side he's got an entire audio
setup featuring a MIDI keyboard is
at2020 microphone and a DSLR speaking of
audio he's got quite the
for it Yamaha hs8 speakers we got a
Yamaha a go3 audio interface and two
pairs of headphones the m50x is any
comfortable bose QC 15s he also has a
pair of cloud tubes for gaming which he
didn't take a picture of so his audio
setup is being powered by the MacBook
Pro while his main setup is a custom
built PC rocking the 6600 K in a suit
Strix 970 he does have a busy desk he
kept his antenna switch on the table
along with an Xbox one controller we got
a smartphone and even his MacBook Pro
normally I would find the better place
for all of these so that the surface of
the desk looks cleaner but some people
like the convenience of accessing things
over aesthetics or a minimalistic look
another solution would be to mount your
Nintendo switch to the wall either
behind your monitor so that it's away
from view or next to your setup but
personally I think hooking it up behind
your monitor using this wall mount would
be very nice he does have a bunch of
text so cable management was not easy
for PJ with the help of some zip ties
cable clips and spiral wraps he managed
to clean up the wiring a lot
he used the side of his shelves to hide
most of the wires and power strips and
underneath the desk as well looks like
there's another power strip and a USB
hub that's also connected to his PC if
you guys remember on the last episode of
setup or as I was talking about running
cables from the headset behind the desk
and into the PC that way the cables are
not visible I recommended getting an
extension USB cable but this is actually
another option as well you can hook this
up underneath the desk and connect your
headset to it so that you don't have to
run the wire in front of your setup
overall it definitely needs a few tweaks
here and there but it's definitely a
badass gaming setup nonetheless Thank
You PJ for entering number 3 we got Ryan
and a pretty badass gaming and
productivity setup for him and his
girlfriend the setup on the right is his
gaming and editing setup which features
the 28 inch Samsung 4k monitor and a
Vizio 48 inch TV that's hooked up to his
2014 MacBook Pro that's used for
productivity the setup on the left has a
29 inch ultra wide from LG
which belongs to his girlfriend Ryan is
also using the coursers rave keyboard
with cherry red switches and the
Logitech g600 wireless mouse while his
girlfriend is using the logitech mk2 70
wireless keyboard and mouse combo now
for audio Ryan has a pair of KRK Rokit
speakers and a setup on the left has
just a sound bar from Dell why do I get
the feeling that his girlfriend gets the
hand-me-down tech while Ryan gets the
updated and cool gear I mean she doesn't
even have headphones while Ryan is
rocking a pair of m50 X's to be fair
though I mean maybe she doesn't like
using headphones and I'm just like
giving Ryan a hard time Ryan setup is
being powered by a 6600 K 32 gigs of ram
and an EVGA GTX 1070 while the set up on
the left has a G 4500 and a gigabyte r9
380 seriously seriously if you don't
upgrade it to at least horizon 5 and a
gtx 1060 i will steal you a girl by
giving her a better pc cuz you know i
got the parts for it and also chicks dig
Lambos I'm just kidding please forgive
me I only date girls who have SLI Ryan
also has a ps4 slim underneath his
monitor riser and the Nintendo switch
with a bunch of controllers he even has
an Xbox one controller but no Xbox one
and finally we got the cable management
looks like everything is under control
from both sides I do see a few cable
boxes on the ground which means all the
wires are hidden behind the back board
and also like what you did with the blue
lounge cable clips on the top of the
desk using them to hold the charging
cables very nice I don't get to see many
couple setups on the show so it's
refreshing to come across one every now
and then if you're watching this video
and you're either a girl or have a
girlfriend that has their setup right
next to yours please submit your setup
because I'm working on a special edition
of setup wars which is either a girl
edition or a couple's edition so
depending on how many submissions I get
from either category I will make one of
those happen so please watch the video
linked all the way down below for the
requirements tray is up next with an
interesting setup so the desk itself is
interesting it's a multi-tiered l-shaped
desk from solder and he's
Magnavox monitor up top between a pair
of Edifier are 1700 Bluetooth speakers
so this setup is hooked up to his Dell
Precision 5510 laptop while the set up
on the left is his main one that
features two dell ultrasharp monitors a
Logitech G 610 Orion keyboard and AG 602
Mouse the microphone he is using is the
popular at2020 from Audio Technica but
he also has a steel series arced s7
wireless gaming headset the pc powering
his main set up as a 6700 K and an ABG a
gtx 1070 superclocked and it's sitting
underneath the desk it's a good looking
PC but I would recommend putting
something underneath it so it doesn't
blow dust and dirt into your case aside
from the PC he also has an Xbox one the
cable management is very clean even
though he didn't drill any holes in the
desk he did rout all the cables in a way
so that it's not visible from the front
he even has a Raceway in the back of the
main monitor and took the advantage of
the back of the desk throughout the rest
of the wires across and down in the
corner of the desk I really like this
setup but I feel like it's forced and
not seamless mostly because of the
layout of the desk Trey had no choice
but to put the speakers on the top shelf
and the monitor on the top because there
was no space anyone else and that kind
of resulted in a very strange placement
I'm judging this by the height of your
chair because that monitor looks a bit
too high regardless I feel like you made
the setup work despite the odd layout of
the l-shaped desk Thank You Trey for
entering last but not least we got URI
and a sick looking ultra light gaming
setup featuring the Aces PG 3 4 8 Q
alongside the corsair k70 RGB keyboard
with the logitech g502 RGB mouse it's no
surprise that Yuri is a fan of Tomb
Raider and he's not afraid of showing it
through his wallpaper mousepad a few
figurines and posters on the wall and
speaking of the wall that is an
interesting acoustic foam design he's
rocking at first I thought he was going
for an all-black setup but the green LED
fans inside his PC with the red cables
completely throw that off speaking of
the PC this thing is a monster it's
equipped with a 16 900k which is a 10
core processor it's got 64 gigs of RAM
because why the hell not and a gigabyte
GTX 10 atti it's a sick looking build
but what's up with the green LEDs with
the red cables is this a
christmas-themed build or something
Ferrari Oh is rocking a razer siren
microphone and these Sennheiser HD 650
headphones so this is actually a perfect
example of what I was talking about
earlier
see how Yuri has his cables visible in
the front of his setup a simple fix for
this would be using cable clips and
either a USB hub or extension cable
connecting the headphones straight to
his PC from the back another alternative
would be to use a different head for
anger like the brainwaves hanger that
goes underneath the desk that way it's
not sticking out in front I also feel
like the controller stand can be hidden
somewhere else and the SD card reader
can be easily mounted underneath the
desk with Rhian tape or on the back of
the monitor very close to the edge so
it's easier to access a boom arm for
your razor microphone would also help
clean up the surface a bit and you got
the perfect place for one which is on
the left side of this setup I feel like
the one thing you did get right as the
cable management excellent use of the
Signum rack and the cable clips to keep
everything nice and tidy I will give you
points for that it's a great setup and
it definitely has personality and
purpose just work on a few tweaks and
you will get there Thank You Yuri for
entering but that is it for this episode
of setup wars I'm surprised you guys got
this far with hearing this nasty voice I
apologize once again it is beyond my
control actually son and way worse a few
days ago so it's kind of waiting until I
got a little better but anyways thank
you for watching make sure you guys drop
your comments down below and vote on who
you think has the best desk setup as
always I'm always taking with
submissions especially if you're a girl
or you have a boyfriend or girlfriend I
want to do a couples edition I've set up
pores that'll be pretty cool anyways I'm
about to pass out thank you so much
again for watching I will see you in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
