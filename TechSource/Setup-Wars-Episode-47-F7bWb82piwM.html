linked below without seeking more time
let the setup wars begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below so
about two weeks ago I kind of randomly
started a series on my twitch account
where I basically show the next episode
of setup wars and you guys get the CD 5
contestants and I show you the setups
and we kind of just critique it on my
twitch channel which is pretty cool it's
awesome because we get to interact I get
to answer some of your questions I think
was really fun that one time we did it
so I think I might do it every single
weekend but if you guys have a twitch
account and want to be part of this
really cool really fun series make sure
to check out the links below as always
everyone's gear for the setups along
with anything I recommend in this
episode will be listed below but here
are your 5 lucky contestants we have
julius michael nick cydnus and vincent
congratulations for making it on the
show starting off the episode is julius
with his triple monitor setup we have
three 23.6 inch Samsung curved monitors
and a giant 49 inch LG 4k TV mounted up
top on the desk we have the corsair RGB
slave keyboard and m65 RGB mouse on top
of the course our extended mousepad I
love how you kept the setup symmetrical
by putting the Swan speakers on both
sides along with the two white Xbox one
controllers off the right side we have a
2013 Mac Pro a printer and the PC that's
powering the setup that's running on a
4790k and a GTX 970 superclocked edition
kail management is as clean as I can't
even think of a good analogy but it's
clean the Vulcan power strip is mounted
on the roof and everything is connected
to it job well done
I also like the fact that you drilled a
hole in the desk and routed the keyboard
and mouse wires through ok so here are
the things that bother me first off the
setup isn't directly centered with the
TV it's bothering my OCD and I'm sure a
bunch of people watching this video a
simple fix to this would be to move the
desk to the left a bit and I understand
that there will be more space between
the wall and the desk but at least both
of us can
better at night another thing is the PC
I get why you want to show off the
components inside but you are exposing
the cables in the back this way and it
just doesn't look good in my opinion if
it were my setup I would rotate the PC
so that it's parallel with the desk gets
on and maybe even move that printer to
the far corner of the desk and move that
lamp next to the PC as cool as it looks
I feel like the controllers would be
better off in a drawer somewhere else or
perhaps even off to the side there's a
pretty cool charging system for the
controllers that look pretty sick with
them on but I'll leave a link below if
you're interested everything else looks
good killer setup Julius thank you for
entering next up is Michael with another
try display setup so we have a 34 inch
LG curve monitor in the middle which is
sandwiched by 2 28 inch Asus 4k monitors
talk about pixels on the desk we have
the desk keyboard and Logitech MX master
mouse on top of my extended mouse pad I
think it's safe to assume that it is a
Productivity setup since there is a 2013
Mac Pro in the back so there's a lot of
stuff going on here we have a focus
right audio interface with a USB hub on
top a few WD cloud-based storage units
and a Patriots helmet I'm just kidding
you guys relax ok obviously it's the
Raiders we do have a bunch of headphones
1 2 3 and 4 of them actually chilling on
hangers I think those are the 80 HM 50
X's we also have some beats off their
left and a pair of v-moda LP tubes with
custom shields now that is pretty badass
cable management isn't bad I mean at
least you hooked up all the wires on the
Signum and they are off of the ground
but if you spend some more time with it
I'm sure you can perfect it feel free to
watch my cable management video if you
need some tips I do like the quirky
Cordys to help keep wires organized and
the speaker stands for your behringer k5
studio monitors I'm not really a fan of
keeping stuff behind the desk since it
really takes away from the setup and
makes it look a bit messy but on that
note not a bad setup at all thank you
Michael for entering Nick is next up
with a what in God's name is that
alright so we have a 47 inch Toshiba TV
hooked up to his PC on the desk we have
a courser m-65 keyboard and an m6
five mouths on top of the courser
extended mouse pad off to the left side
we have a few of his personal items like
an HTC m8 some smartwatches and a pair
of sony MDR headphones which are all
resting on the razor goliath mousepad
don't know how the cable management is
since the desk is blocking the view so I
can't really say anything here but the
PC that's powering the setup has a 44 60
and a GTX 960 really great work with the
cable management by the way also here's
the thing about the stock CPU cooler I'm
completely fine with that as long as you
have a non K CPU not much else going on
over here Thank You Nick for entering
cydnus is next up with an ultra wide set
up the 34 inch LG 34 you see 97
sandwiched between a pair of audio
engine a 5 plus speakers on a desk we
have the corsair k95 RGB keyboard and a
Logitech MX master mouse on top of the
cursor extended mousepad there's a lot
of Corsair gear in this episode resting
on the Left speaker is the Sennheiser
momentum headphones and on the right we
have a pair of sunglasses can we also
please take a moment and just stare at
that awesome poster up there in my
opinion Heath Ledger was the best joker
ever and it's going to be really
difficult to top his performance I'm
looking at you Jared Leto excellent work
with cable management it appears that we
have the power strip mounted against the
roof of the desk and we have no cables
on the ground the PCs powering the setup
has these 6700 K which is overclocked to
four point eight cheese with a GTX 980
honestly it's a really sick looking PC
but why did you stick with the custom
cables man I feel like it would have
looked way better with white or even
black sleeved custom cables you might
also want to top that off I'm not a big
fan of having your vaping stuff in the
front of the monitor but other than that
and maybe an acrylic stand for your
headphones I say that this is one of the
coolest setups I have seen Thank You
Cygnus for entering last but not least
we have Vincent with a compact red black
and white setup we have a 24 inch asus
monitor on top of a monitor riser and
below that we have the Focusrite audio
interface and a charging hub to the
right on the desk is the SteelSeries
mechanical keyboard sense a wireless
mouse on top of the qck extended mouse
sticking with SteelSeries we also have
the Siberia v2 headset on top of the
Audio Technica headphones stand I'm
surprised you were able to fit two
monkey banana studio monitors on that
tiny desk of yours you sure then make
the most of it
cable management is pretty good I see
the Signum rack is quite handy in
keeping all those cables off of the wait
a minute Benson was trying to pull a
fast one on us it looks like you put two
rugs over the cables on the ground to
hide them with the holder judge with
that said I do recommend either a cable
channel or sleeve depending on how many
wires you have down there and that
should help clean up the mess not really
sure who still uses landline phones but
hey at least isn't red and black to
match your theme I also like how you
removed the mic cable in order to make
it appear less cluttered
adding a boom arm was a really smart
decision it helps keep the mic off the
desk giving you some extra space to work
with and it's more convenient doing
voiceovers since you could bring the mic
close to your face another smart choice
is going with a monitor riser to free up
some more space on the desk and also for
a place for your audio interface I'm
honestly impressed that you were able to
do all this given the tiny space very 6
setup Thank You Vincent for entering but
