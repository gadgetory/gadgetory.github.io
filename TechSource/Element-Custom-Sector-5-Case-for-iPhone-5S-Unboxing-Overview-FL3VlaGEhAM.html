going to unbox a custom iPhone 5s case
from the company element case this is
the sector 5 model and you can buy the
original one that comes in either silver
grey or gunmetal for one thirty nine
ninety five or you can even customize
your own starting at the same price the
case comes in this neat grey colored box
and once you open them you will find the
case resting on top I decided to go with
the black ultra suede for the back plate
they also have nine of the colors that
you can choose from
as you can see here I went with the red
power button and I'll explain my choices
really soon next up you will find a
speed wrench tool and this is used to
remove the screws for installation
purposes element is also kind enough to
send two spare screws in case you end up
losing originals as well as a spare for
one corner insert in this plastic sleeve
you will find two color trash cards for
all sides of the phone one in silver and
one in black of course they are optional
and if you choose to install them just
follow instructions listed on this piece
of paper in this other plastic sleeve
you will find a microfiber cleaning
cloth to help wipe off any unnecessary
fingerprints so you can install this
screen shield there is also a small
squeegee board to help with air bubbles
after the shield installation lastly on
the bottom is a piece of paper that
explains how to install the element case
on your iPhone and also a small brochure
showing a wide array of element case
products I did leave a link to the
website in the description below for
those of you that are interested they
carry cases for the samsung galaxy s3
and s4 the iPad iPad Mini along with all
generations of the iPhone all element
cases are made and assembled in USA so
you know you're getting a quality build
case the sector 5 is CNC machine using
aerospace grade materials which means
the cutouts are very precise the
aluminum material also feels really nice
in your hand when you're holding it it
does not feel unpleasant at all then it
makes it very simple to slide in and out
of your pockets
what's even great about this case is
that element included small ultra suede
pieces on all the inner walls of the
case as well as in the corners and even
one for the power button to protect the
phone from being scratched by the case
the case does look insanely good by
itself but let's see how a look after
its installed on the iPhone 5s
but there you have it my customized
sector 5 case for the iPhone 5s you can
pick one up for your phone for melanin
case comm you can customize pretty much
any part of this case from the side
rails to the power button screws corner
inserts and even the back plate if you
