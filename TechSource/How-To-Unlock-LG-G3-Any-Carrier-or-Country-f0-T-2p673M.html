today I'm going to show you how to
unlock your LG g3 smartphone so you can
use it on any carrier or country you
like for this demonstration I am going
to use a locked t-mobile g3 and unlock
it so I can use it on my AT&amp;amp;T network so
first off we need to get the unlock code
for the phone before we proceed with the
unlocking procedure I personally use the
unlocking company for all my devices
simply because they are the lowest
prices in the market with the fastest
delivery speeds so head on over to the
unlocking company comm once you're there
you're going to be selecting your phone
manufacturer and the phone model from
the drop down list once you do that
select get unlocking code and that will
take you to the next step which is to
select what country you purchase the
phone from as well as the carrier of the
phone in my case I purchased it from
United States and the carrier is
t-mobile you will need the phone's IMEI
number to continue and I'm going to show
you how to look it up on your phone once
you open up your dial pad at entering
star pound zero six pound the number
will immediately show up and you will
need to enter that on the website to
continue make sure you select the
correct currency for your country before
moving on
once you select get a locking code and
check out securely with PayPal they will
email you the code the price and time
vary depending on the phone but they do
guarantee that you are getting the
lowest price and the fastest delivery
times once you receive your code via
email it's time to unlock your phone so
before we continue make sure that the
phone is powered off go ahead and remove
the backplate of the phone and the
battery as well so you can gain access
to the SIM tray this is where you insert
the SIM card that you wish to use with
the phone if your SIM card is a
different size then you have to adjust
it in order for it to fit I provided you
with the link in the description section
to show you how that's done after you
insert the SIM card in the tray go ahead
and put back the battery and the back
case and power on your phone now once it
powers up and you leave the lock screen
a prompt will appear asking you to enter
an unlock code in that case you enter in
the code that you got via email and you
are done
however if you don't get a prompt like
me then you are going to have to unlock
it manually you are going to have to
open up your dial pad once
more and enter in to nine four five
pound star eight five one and it will
take you to a secret menu once you are
here you have to select network unlock
and it is here that you have to enter in
the lock code that you received in the
email a really important note here the
last three digits may vary depending on
what model you have in my case it was
851 to make sure you are interning in
the correct code you have to find out
what model your phone is and you can do
that in the settings and about phone
page under hardware information so the
code you would input would be two nine
four five pound star and then your
three-digit model number so once you
enter in your unlock code your phone
will accept it and it will be unlocked
immediately as you can see here it is a
t-mobile phone that is now working on
AT&amp;amp;T so that is how you unlock your LG
g3 smartphone if this video helped you
