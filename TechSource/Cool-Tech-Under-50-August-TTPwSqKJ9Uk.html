tech source and welcome to cool tech
under 50 for the month of August if you
guys are new to the series and somehow
missed my previous episodes I'll go to
leave a link to the playlist down below
I went over some really cool products in
the last few months but definitely go
ahead and check it out when you have
time also all the products I mentioned
in this video will be linked down below
in the order that you see them so it's
easier for you guys to find them without
wasting any more time
let's go ahead and start the video all
right so starting off the list is the
quick lock and this is a Bluetooth and
NFC smart padlock it comes in black blue
red and yellow and I've been using this
the past week now and I absolutely love
this thing I hate carrying keys with me
or even remembering combinations and if
you're the same like me then you're
really going to love this lock in the
back you will find the micro USB port
and needed to charge the lock but
there's really no need since a single
charge can last up to two years that's
crazy
so there's a few ways you can unlock
this the first way is through bluetooth
but you will need to first download the
app on iOS or Android then simply open
it up and hit the button on the actual
padlock once it recognizes the lock you
can tap the unlock button and it will
immediately unlock it's simple as that
and you could also even have the auto
unlock feature enabled and it will
automatically unlock as you open the app
that way you don't have to hit the
unlock button every time now let's say
you don't want to go through the hassle
of using your phone well in that case
you can use one of these NFC cards that
they provided and you can keep them
inside your wallet just simply hit the
button on the lock and tap the card once
on it and bam you're in last method is
using another NFC key card but this one
is much smaller and can be attached to
your keychain the lock is very durable
and I recommend this to anyone that uses
locks daily and hates carrying extra
keys or remembering pass codes I do have
two extra ones and black that I'm going
to giveaway out my Twitter soon so if
you guys are interested make sure you
are following me there this next product
is a cool looking portable power bank if
you choose 3000 milliamp of power and it
comes in several colors you will find
the USB and micro USB port on the side
and the LEDs are touch sensitive and
will this
how much juice is left in the Powerbank
but the reason why I'm featuring this in
my cool tech video is because of its
price it only cost six bucks and you get
a really cool looking portable bank that
you can attach to your keys speaking of
keys this next product is called the B
key and it's basically a power bank with
350 milliamps of power this is basically
used for emergencies only and it's
compact the light form factor makes it
super easy to carry it around with your
keys
there was one available for Android as
well and to charge up the B key you
simply pull off the cap and plug it into
your PC laptop or any power in the USB
port next up are these clear cases from
you lack which are designed in Italy
they come in several colors and features
soft silicone material on the inside to
protect your phone and the outer a hard
shell protects the phone from drops the
buttons are really easy to press because
of the way they are designed and the
cutouts are precise with extra room for
third-party accessories but why are they
on my cool tech series well the cool
part is that the silicone actually glows
in the dark which is nice when you need
to find your phone in the dark this next
product is a really impressive one these
are the NX 80 earphones from noise hush
so for only 12 bucks you get a really
good-looking pair of earphones with
amazing sound quality if you guys don't
believe me you can check the reviews
they sound super crisp with a great bass
it also does a great job isolating noise
although I recommend the larger ear gels
for the best noise isolation it comes
with a pouch and three other sized ear
gels in my experience this past week the
smaller sized ones are too small and the
earphones would constantly jiggle their
way out of my ears as I'm working out or
walking around so I strongly recommend
going with the two largest ear gels for
optimum noise isolation and a snug fit I
was impressed with the build quality for
what I was paying these are very durable
and well-made the only thing that I do
not like about these earphones is the
fact that it doesn't have a volume
control option so you have to adjust it
using your smart phone or device but it
does have a button to accept calls or
pause and play music the button is very
tactile and responsive so you always
know when you have pressed it which is
one of the things I like about it over
my beats earphones I mentioned before it
comes in a pouch but I much prefer this
tiny hard case from brainwaves not only
matches the color scheme of the
earphones but it offers more protection
and features to pouches by the way the
earphones also come in three other
awesome
color combinations these next two
products are from phone salesmen
first up we have a completely wireless
Qi charger called the chief stone and I
say completely wireless because well it
doesn't need to be plugged into a wall
this thing is awesome it also doubles as
a power bank and it features 4000
milliamps and you can charge your device
using the USB port while wirelessly
charging another phone on top it's super
compact in size and has a very soft
texture to it that's made to resemble an
actual stone it's also touch sensitive
tapping at once will display the LEDs
which will indicate how much juice is
left this charger is compatible with all
smartphones and tablets that are able to
charge wirelessly like the Nexus lineup
galaxy s6 and even smartwatches like the
Moto 360 if you have a phone that
doesn't feature wireless charging then
all you need to do is pick up these
power slim cards and install them on
your phone just remove the back cover
apply the power card and install the
cover back on and you are ready to
charge wirelessly they have them for
practically all the smart phones and
I'll leave a link down below for anyone
that's interested they even have
wireless charging for iPhones but you do
need a case installed for it to work
just simply plug in the card and fold it
backwards and tuck it between the iPhone
and the case and you're basically ready
to go by the way if you're wondering
where I got these awesome carbon fiber
skins from then I'll leave a link down
below on where you guys can pick some up
so while the charges actually come in a
bunch of other designs as well including
a wood series however these you do need
to plug into a wall for it to work this
next product is really awesome this is
the tp-link wireless USB adapter that
supports speeds up 250 megabits
let's say you built a PC and it doesn't
come with a Wi-Fi adapter built in the
motherboard or the Wi-Fi adapter on your
laptop broke down and you can't connect
to the internet anymore well this little
thing will give you Wi-Fi access just
plug it into your PC or laptop wait for
it to install the drivers and after a
few seconds you have Wi-Fi it's priced
under 10 bucks and the best part about
it is that it's super small and great
for travel next up we have the an Lions
mod mic and this is a detachable
microphone that you can hook up to your
headphones this is great for anyone
that's not looking to buy a headset or a
separate microphone and instead they can
just use their own headphones and add a
mic to it I love my 88 and 50 X's a lot
but it doesn't have a built-in mic
feature and I don't want to buy another
headset that has one built in or even
buy another separate microphone so
instead I can just attach the mod mic to
it whenever I need to use one it comes
with a magnetic clasp attached by 3m
tape that can stick on to any plastic
metal and mesh type material this makes
it super convenient to detach the
microphone whenever you want the arm is
also made out of reinforced steel and it
can easily be bent to fit your
preference here's a quick sample using
the Anne line mod mic without any
editing the mod mic is usually around 50
bucks but you can actually get it for a
lot cheaper through mass drop you never
have to pay full retail price on tech
items if you're using mass drop they
have awesome deals and a bunch of cool
tech products including keyboards PC
parts monitors and more the mod Mike
will be back on mass drop soon and I'll
leave a link to it down below so you
guys can request it and check out the
site these next two products are from
Orrico first up is the car charger with
three USB ports in the form of a cup
instead of a regular car charger that
plugs into your lighter this one is
shaped like a cup so not only can you
charge three devices at the same time
but can also hold your smartphone or
other devices as well the next Oracle
product is one of my favorites and I'll
show you why in a second this is the
Oracle 6 outlet surge protector with
five USB charging ports and they do have
options for 4 and 8 outlets as well it's
super light and I strongly recommend
this for anyone that wants to manage
their cables so a lot of you know that I
have an adjustable desk and my cable
management isn't that great well the
reason is this I do need the cables
loose so that it retracts with my table
as I raise it up so limits how much
cable management I can really do well
not anymore
thanks to these 6 outlet surge protector
I turned this into this
so I touched 6 tiny squares of 3m tape
on the back of it and I attached it to
the roof of my desk I did proceeded to
plug in all my devices in it with some
help from cable drops and raceways I was
able to completely transform my entire
setup I'm telling you guys the 3m tape I
keep using for all my stuff is super
strong strong enough to even hold up my
heavy power brick for my ultrawide
monitor it's been over a week now and
it's still holding it up without any
problems but anyways I'll go ahead and
drop a link to all the stuff I use for
cable management down below if you guys
are interested
these last set of products are from my
gamers that are watching the video I did
not forget about you guys from the 30
bucks you get one of the best budget
gaming gear you can currently buy the
keyboard is a mechanical
but it looks great and features
interchangeable WASD key caps and arrow
keys the window key can also be disabled
for gaming which is a nice feature to
have and the keys have a slight texture
feel to them and are very responsive and
comfortable to type on the gaming mouse
is just as great you can adjust the DPI
from three different settings up to 2000
and features 2 programmable buttons on
the side for navigating forward and back
there's also a button on the top along
with the anti-skid track wheel it's
symmetrical shape makes it a great
choice for both left and right-handed
users and it's very comfortable thanks
to its ergonomic design of course a
mouse and keyboard isn't complete
without a matching mousepad from red
dragon as well there are a few other
awesome designs as well and I'll leave a
link to them down below this next
product is not only a great gaming
headset but it costs under fifteen bucks
by far the best budget gaming headset
you can buy and if you don't believe me
you can check the reviews for yourself
so it's compatible with Windows Mac
smartphones and practically anything
else that has a 3.5 millimeter jack
including consoles like the ps4 just
plug it in the controller and you are
ready to go it comes with a built-in
retractable mic and here's a quick
sample of the audio here's a quick
sample of me talking on headset
microphone enabled without any editing
the headset is made out of glossy
plastic and for only 15 bucks I'm really
surprised at the build quality it's
really durable and I've been wearing it
this past week without any problems the
cushions are really soft for both the
ear cups and the headband so you are
good to gain for hours without fatigue
you can use the mic and control the
volume as well and all three of the
cables from the keyboard mouse and
headset are threaded red and black which
is awesome since they all match last but
not least we need a place for the
headphones this is the thermal take
gaming headphone cradle and I picked
this one up for my set up assembly
because it looks cool after all this is
a cool tech series right if you guys
have a black and red color scheme like I
do then these gaming gear will
definitely make a sweet addition to your
setup oh and I almost forgot to mention
that the keyboard and mouse have red
LEDs which looks awesome and low light
so that's it for the video I hope you
