coming at you live from PAX West 2016
I'm over here at the Intel booth for the
Xtreme rig challenge campaign where
they're about to announce the seven
lucky winners for these crazy custom pcs
which I'll go over in a bit I also want
to give huge thanks to Intel and the
extreme rig challenge for bringing me to
PAX West in order to cover this event
for you guys now each of these pcs is
equipped with Intel's new extreme
processor the i7 69 50x and the intel
SSD 750 series if you guys want to pimp
out your PC's with these parts that make
sure to check out the first link below
so before we get a closer look at these
bad boys here are the winners for each
PC
okay in second place with 24,000 181
votes is origin piece third place with
30,000 its pine boughs and the take home
the cornice paperweights
so the winner of the extreme rake
challenge was NCIX which was kind of
upsetting considering that there were
far better pcs in this entire lineup
this first one is an absolute beast from
cyber PowerPC and this is built inside
the in win age tower case this thing is
like a transformer if you choose the 69
50 X 2 GTX 1080s and of course the Intel
750 series SSD I mean the specs are
pretty much the same on all of these
builds I mean you got the same processor
same 1080 s in sli and of course they
are all water-cooled personally this one
is my absolute favorite out of the rest
in this competition this next one is
from Origin PC and they are calling it
the origin Genesis x2 and what's so dope
about this rig is the fact that it
features 2 different configurations on
one side you have a gaming PC and on the
other side is a streaming setup
definitely one of the more unique builds
that I have seen and they did such a
great job with the cable management
considering there's a lot going on here
at number three we have main gears rig
that was built inside the and when 9:02
case in fact there are three pcs out of
the seven that were built inside in win
cases so not a whole lot going on here
they decided to put only one GTX 1080
instead of filling up the case but then
you on green cooling however those look
pretty badass in that color scheme
velocity micro had an OK rig as well I
mean there were 2 1080 founders editions
in here but no custom sleeving and the
tubing just kind of looked a bit lazy to
me digital storm however blew me away
with their venom which is using a custom
modded inverted case on one side we have
all of the parts and the tubing and on
the other side we have the cable
management and a vertical see-through
water block very nice the PC from Ava
Direct was actually my second favorite
rig from the rest and it's built inside
the N wind s frame and has a gorgeous
white and blue color scheme I would
personally custom paint the sli bridge
and maybe get a different set of RAM
sticks to better match the color scheme
but overall a very solid looking gaming
PC last but not least we have the NCIX
rig which ended up winning the contest I
mean it's a great-looking rig no doubt
come on I mean there are other pcs that
looked way better than this but anyways
that will do for this video again I want
to thank Intel and the Xtreme rec
challenge for sending me to pax West
this year and I hope to return for 2017
and bring you guys more coverage thank
you guys so much for watching and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
