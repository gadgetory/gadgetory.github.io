have with me one of the very first here
active listening systems from Doppler
labs before we get into the review let's
go ahead and unbox this real quick the
packaging is really simple and
straightforward lifting up top portion
we are greeted by the charging case and
right below that you can find a quick
installation guide as well as a micro
USB cable needed to charge the earbuds
and two additional sized ear tips the
charging case is awesome and not only
does it protect and store the earbuds
but the charging process is simple just
drop them in there and they will
automatically start charging there's
also an LED indicator that will display
how much battery is left charging the
actual case is done by using a micro USB
cable which is provided so at first
glance I thought that these were
wireless earbuds that you can use to
listen to music and make calls with but
no these aren't for that instead these
are for live audio augmentation instead
it basically allows the user full
control over that audio environments in
real time here's how it works you
download the free app on iOS or Android
and sync the earbuds together then you
have access to a bunch of controls
within the app like using the volume
control to give your ears a rest and
turn down the world around you or
adjusting the EQ to personalize live
music at a concert or festival you're
basically in control of the sound around
you the here active listening system
earbuds are especially effective for
anyone that attends concerts or
festivals that play loud music the fact
that you can control the level of the
outside volume that's going in your ears
is awesome not only does it protect your
ears from potential hearing loss over
the course of your life but it also
makes the experience much more enjoyable
the earbuds are comfortable and have a
very nice snug fit that virtually blocks
out most of the outside noise I'm gonna
give you guys a quick demonstration of
what it feels like if you were to use
the volume control yourself and this is
extremely accurate
you
I think one of the coolest features is
the tune out tab which is still in beta
but it basically allows you to tune out
everything around you whether you're in
an airplane bus subway or other
environments overall I think that this
is a pretty cool tech product and if you
guys are interested in checking these
out you can sign up for the wait list
and I'll go and drop a link down below
for you I'm also going to be giving away
a pair of these two one lucky person and
you can find the details to that in the
description section as well thanks as
always for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
