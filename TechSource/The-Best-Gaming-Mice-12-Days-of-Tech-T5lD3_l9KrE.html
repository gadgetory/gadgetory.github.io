and welcome to day three of the twelve
days of tech today we're gonna be
focusing on gaming mouse ranging once
again from budget all the way to high
and so that wasting our time let s begin
so starting off the video we are going
to take a look at some really great
budget mice and the first one actually
caught my attention because it just
looks so badass and judging by the
5-star rating this is probably one of
the best gaming mice that costs around
ten dollars so features six buttons - on
the side for back and forward and one on
top which is the EPI button that lets
you select from 1000 up to 3200 dpi this
is also the same button that's used to
select from seven different LED colors
overall a very good looking and
ergonomic Mouse that's compatible for
both PC and Windows and for around ten
dollars you can't go wrong next up is
quite possibly the most popular and
well-known gaming mice which also
happens to be the number one bestseller
on Amazon the red dragon M 601 is still
one of the best budget mice for under
$15 as it offers some extra features
like an eight piece weight tuning set
and a braided cable the downside is that
it's only for left-handed users it works
only on PC and you only get red LEDs
which might be a deal-breaker for most
the jelly chrome 4000 is also a very
nice-looking and comfortable Mouse I
personally like how the LED glows from
the lower part of the mouse that either
looks pretty cool you can use their
software to change the LEDs to anything
you want from the RGB color chart it
also features a dpi cycle button near
the top and a back for button your aside
which has a non-slip grip by the way
which is perfect for gamers that
constantly need to lift the mouse up it
stays that the original price is $60 and
that it's on sale for 17 dollars but
honestly I'm not sure if that's true
regardless for 17 dollars this is an
incredible Mouse if you're looking for a
wireless gaming mouse for under $50 and
you Logitech g600 2 is definitely the
mouse you're looking for it's well known
for being one of the best if not the
best wireless mouse in this price
bracket battery lasts up to 250 hours
and you get a plethora of buttons to
choose from which makes it a great
choice for MMO and RPG as well the bass
is also very accurate you can't really
tell the difference between this and
another wired mouse I have to give
credit where credit is due
Razer has managed to create one of the
most comfortable and minimalistic gaming
mice
pher with a 10,000 DPI sensor RGB LEDs
and one of the best sensors in the
gaming market the DeathAdder chroma is
one of the most popular gaming mice out
there
you don't get any removable weights or
fancy extra buttons just a solid organ
ama gaming mice that gets the job done
the grip on both sides of the mouse is
also very nice to have currently it's
out of stock but if you guys don't mind
waiting you won't be disappointed
here's another very solid gaming mouse
for around $50 now this is a pretty
heavy and large Mouse which is great for
people with large hands and it does have
the most accurate sensor on the market
it features a 12,000 dpi sensor
personalized weight and balance tuning
and 11 programmable buttons if your palm
gripper the side buttons might be
difficult to press during gaming but
overall a very comfortable gaming mouse
if you guys have smaller hands and
prefer a lighter gaming mouse then this
isn't for you and then we got the
coarser m65 pro RGB which is a solid FPS
gaming mouse because of the optimized
sniper button on the left side which
significantly lowers the sensitivity
when you are sniping or need the most
precision during a game this also
features a 12,000 dpi sensor and a
weight tuning system the mouse is really
light with an aluminum structure which
is great for people that constantly lift
their mouse and if black is in your
color they do have a white option as
well both of which are RGB back again
with Razer the Naga hex v2 is d gaming
mouse for MOBAs with seven dedicated
buttons outfitted with mechanical
buttons this thing will give you a huge
advantage over other mobile gamers the
mouse also features a 16,000 dpi sensor
which is overkill and it does come with
RGB lighting so if green is in your
color then you can customize it to any
color you want the SteelSeries rival 700
is an interesting mouse as it has
built-in motors that vibrate depending
on how you configure it so for example
if you get stunned in a game you can
actually set an alert to go off and then
have it stop the instant the duration of
the stun ends which actually lets you
make quick decisions in games
it offers zero recoil which means it
won't affect your gameplay at all it's
also a pretty small Mouse with only two
side buttons and a dedicated dpi button
on the top the grip on the sides are a
very nice thing to have and what's also
cool is that there is an LED indicator
displaying the battery life and other
useful information it does feature RGB
as well but the coolest feature I think
is the modular design you can 3d print
your name in the back or swap out other
parts like the cable for a longer length
you can even swap out the optical sensor
for a laser sensor and even swap out the
top cover last but not least we have the
best high-end gaming mouse in my opinion
that's also wireless it's also the same
else that I'm using the game and make
videos with I absolutely love this mouse
I just wish it wasn't so expensive but I
guarantee you guys that you are getting
what you pay for so you can use this
mouse either in Wireless mode or wired
and honestly you can't even tell the
difference between the two the optical
sensor is incredibly accurate and not
once have I experienced any lag from the
time I've used this the battery life
isn't the best though I get about three
days of use with it and I average around
10 hours a day but the charging cable is
nearby and it doesn't really bother me
it is RGB as well but the only color you
can change is the G logo right on the
mouse my favorite feature on this mouse
has to be the hyper scroll wheel by far
just like the MX master you can click on
the top button and enable infinite
scrolling which is amazing for those
extremely long pages I think this
feature combined with the accuracy in
Wireless mode is what sold me on this
mouse and honestly if I can go back and
buy it again I would so that is it for
my picks on the best gaming mice out
