unboxing / give away from the tech
stores today we're going to be looking
at the brand new Nexus 7 from google we
went ahead and picked up a 16 gig model
you see here which goes for 229 and if
that's not enough space for you you can
buy a 32 gig version for only forty
dollars more now these are the standard
versions which connect to the internet
via Wi-Fi only however there are also
LTE versions of this tablet which are
not yet released I also included some
links below on where you can find them
for those of you that are interested so
let's continue on with unboxing you can
really see how nice the tablet looks
it's really narrow making it really
convenient for you to hold in one hand
but before I get into more details let's
see what else is in the box first up you
got your usual warranty and safety
information you have one in English and
one in Spanish then you will find a
small guide on how to use the Nexus 7
and here is the USB cable needed to
charge the device of course i buttered
up so you guys can get a closer look i'm
not sure why it's pretty standard for
the most part and lastly you have your
power brick again nothing special here
so let's go ahead and put this down and
take a closer look at the Nexus 7 while
I'm taking it out of this plastic I
noticed how smooth the back looks but
before we boot it up let's take a closer
look at the sides and see where
everything is located at looking on the
right side you will find your microphone
volume controls power button along with
your 5 megapixel rear facing camera
moving along to the top and you will see
your speakers along with a headphone
jack and on the bottom of the tablet you
will also find speakers along with your
micro USB port flipping the tablet over
on its back you can see the 1.2
megapixel front facing camera along with
a light sensor just slightly above it
when you first start up your Nexus 7 you
will be required to update it with the
newest software of course but other than
that you are ready to go overall I'm
impressed what I really like about this
nexus 7 is how narrow it is you can see
it how it fits comfortably in my hand I
also like the material it's made out of
it feels nice new hands the screen isn't
too big I think it's the perfect length
with an aspect ratio of 1610 a lot of
people prefer bigger screens like the
iPad Mini but i prefer am
comfortable size rather than a bigger
screen but that's just me I didn't go
over the specs for this tablet for the
sake of time this is just an unboxing
video for the giveaway we are however
working on a quick review for this
tablet which will be up in a few days so
you can definitely check that out once
it's up here at the tech source we go
straight to the point and waste no time
that's why all our videos are less than
five minutes for the most part and that
goes the same for our reviews for all
the devices that we do well that will do
it for the unboxing once again thanks
for watching if you want to win this
amazing tablet all you have to do is
subscribe leave a comment on the video
and like the video in order to qualify I
will announce the winner on august
