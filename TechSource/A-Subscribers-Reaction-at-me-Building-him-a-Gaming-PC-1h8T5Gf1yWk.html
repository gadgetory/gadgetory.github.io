his PC that I built for him a little
back story he reached out about a month
ago and he asked me to build a PC for
him and I said sure why not
so I'm actually excited to see what his
reaction is gonna be and he's actually
downstairs waiting so let's go get him
make it stoked
he's down yet waiting let's check it out
Diego what's up dude nice to meet you in
person man he's not backup cam today
okay all right I'm glad you found this
place cuz usually when you go into maps
it tells you to make a left
yeah yeah then you came back this way
yeah all right big day let's go men's do
it yeah there's been a while you have to
wait for that processor to come in stock
man but I think I think it's worth it
man I think I think the the wait was
worth it
cool cool so here it is man I'll crab me
let me record this thing real quick
hello hello I serious nice you bought a
monitor too right I think nice nice
which one was it
the Asus one yeah nice
yeah for every game IMAX a and he game
you're looking forward to playing like
then you call a duty maybe destiny - yes
for I've got a console guy man he's
switching over to PC master-race yeah
both yeah exactly
this guy - you didn't play on the
freakin console - yeah and I gave him a
brand new PC now he's hooked on that
thing right at the top obviously and one
of you I'm gonna give you the honors of
turning it on first so here's that
reveal you know what it looks like do
you know there we go all right now hit
the power button then Daniel perfect guy
and you it so why did you reach out to
me
why we shout to you um three reasons
pretty much great reasons I thought yeah
there's only one way three guys one main
reason I have confidence in you I knew
you were excess wordings okay for
watching videos after a couple years
I'll take it here to the cable
management oh my god I'll show you the
kale manager by the way I spent I spent
like two hours on the cable management
this thing varies in my country you all
right I'm dirty I don't know about
PC I mean technically I do have build
guys but you know yeah to build
something like this though for your
first time it may take some experience
so you like him and you like let me let
me pop this thing up listen to how quiet
it is dough and these is all overclocked
by the way
push 287 under k2 4.9 gigahertz I over
clock both GPUs so everything is
basically pushed to its max you just set
the girl - ting as a beast let me open
this panel for you just the color scheme
you wanna write black and blue with some
silver accents yeah dude this thing is
heavy you take it was so much it was it
was so heavy to bring this up in the
ground and put it on top of here but
take it out man these are your your 2
SSDs in your one terabyte each I hook
them up and write 0 so it's one drive
and it's extremely fast so there's one
thing that you really like about the PC
what is it like one part you like the
cooler okay nice nice I was hoping you
would pick the cooler because it's
definitely unique is that nice nice okay
one thing you don't like about a PC do
you have to pick one no one the least
thing you don't like how about that is
the least favorite part of the PC you
can even pick the case I guess this
lobster here that the hard drives right
bears yeah there's a lot there's a lot I
was thinking about taking these apart
but it would look so empty just on the
right side there's nothing there so I
left that on there
there's only literally like two SSD you
can if you want
yeah I'll be cool you can take like the
top parts out and put like a figurine on
top to kind of
I named the sub-zero but this is
obviously you can tell by the wallpaper
but you can name it whatever you want
this is just for this is just for the
channel naming purposes but yeah man
everything is there if you want to
change the colors on let's say that grab
his car is in sli bridge everything is
hooked up together and let me show you
real quickly but I want you to test out
doom real quick and see how smooth it is
but it's gonna be a 4k resolution too so
this is like completely maxed out ultra
settings 4k resolution any game you want
to play man your PC can handle it just
just know that ya later down the line if
you want to screen videos if you want to
videos or whatever you have a 6-quart
he's 700 care so you put pretty much
said on that getting like at least a
hundred frames for case settings guys
fully maxed out that's pretty cool go
that way
yeah isn't me some enemies thanks so
much better mo oh is it what computer we
coming from
I think goddess I don't know take a
picture of it - it's a 2001 it was like
a prebuilt yeah people compact compact
O's that Kathleen size - jeez it was a
great great no it's black there's one
one thing I do want to show you before
you head out I install this app it's
called pulse way and if you like it you
can obviously understand it but
basically it gives you the option of
controlling your computer when you're
away from your computer basically so you
let you log in your app and you'll see
the computers you can add as many
computers as you want on it I've added a
subzero this one's over here's my actual
my actual computer and you can send
command props to your computer you can
actually check its CPU usage you can
check the folders on there and the best
thing that I want to actually use a lot
is you can turn off your computer away
from them even have to even be next to
your PC yeah check this up you can power
it down you can we start it you can even
lock your computer so I'm gonna lock it
real quick boom down it's locked so the
next time you come in you have to
basically put in the password I did put
any password on yours obviously you can
set that up later but it's really cool
cuz sometimes when I'm like editing a
video on my personal PC and I'm walking
away it's gonna take like an hour to
render or something I can go do my
errands and stuff and I can completely
shut it off
while I'm like out there and have to be
nowhere near my PC so it's a pretty cool
app it is free I left it on there if you
don't want it obviously you can install
it okay and if you guys want to check it
out I'll drop a link to it down below of
course but yeah man overall rating out
of 10 what do you think what do you
think about this be honest
10 being your expectations were met
you're completely satisfied
we love it please 50 nice real nice one
15 out of 10 goes for deep toast even
the lights right here are very notice
that too did little details that sounds
that's me man you know me I like to pay
attention to the smallest details oh yes
good call good call let me show you what
I yeah do there was as you can see man
there's a lot of cables to work with you
know III busted I grab some coffee man
I'm like I'm okay I mean to me let me
work my magic man so behold
luckily the case had a lot of space for
cable management otherwise I would have
liked Ben Craig gone crazy
oh yeah everything's throughout a nicely
ads and 3m tape I hooked up the NZXT
what is this thing called the hue plus
that's basically for the fans and the
RGB strips as you can see 24 pin you got
your SSD as aceite everything's neatly
wrapped man they say our never had done
this wrap them all computer
I will never wrap this yeah a capable
management is it's an art form you got
to be patient with it then if we use a
lot of velcro straps and zip ties you
gotta learn the best routing pattern and
stuff like that but maybe you guys
submit you're still working on my gaming
room there how's that coming along TV
couch Gary thing going oh nice dude nice
yeah
what do you work oh yeah yeah what
company you work for
