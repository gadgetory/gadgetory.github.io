along with anything I recommend in this
episode will be linked below but here
are your 5 lucky contestants we have
Alec Arnold
Eric castle and Michael congratulations
for making it on the show starting of
the show is Alec and his single display
setup we have a 27 inch asus rog swift
monitor razer blackwidow keyboard and a
Death Adder Mouse also the desk we have
a pair of audio engine a 5 plus speakers
a Bose Soundlink 2 next to the PC and a
Mac Book Pro on the book arc charging
stand we also have a pair of Astral a
50s off to the right side cable lines
red looks very clean it appears all the
cables are behind the back board so you
get an easy pass the PC is powering the
setup has a 4790k and 2 GTX 970 s in sli
the acoustic films on the wall aren't
enough to really make a difference but I
like the aesthetics of it and it really
makes the setup pop especially with
those LEDs behind the 48 inch Samsung TV
overall a really badass gaming and
productivity setup you have there Alec
thank you for entering Arnold is next up
with another single display setup we
have the 27-inch asus monitor a steel
series apex gaming keyboard and a
Logitech MX master mouse we also have a
pair of JBL a 50 headphones and a
Logitech g27 wheel off to the left side
cable management is flawless
not a single wire in sight I wish you
told me the name of the desk because it
looks freakin Baus I do like glossy
surfaces since it tends to reflect the
items that are on top of it and it just
looks pretty badass to be honest now to
mention the LEDs are more amplified due
to the reflection of white the PC that's
powering the setup has an AMD 93 70
which is overclocked to 4.4 and a GTX
970 I really have nothing to recommend
other than a simple headphone hangar to
keep those cans from scratching the desk
a very clean and organized setup Thank
You Arnold for entering setup Wars
shifting to dual display setups we have
Eric with two ASIS 20s
inch monitors side-by-side what is it
with a susan 27 inch monitors this is
like three in a row also plus one on
that wallpaper
you sure have taste by the way this is
the monitor I use for my PC builds each
month since a lot of you guys keep
asking me about it below those we have
the Razer BlackWidow keyboard and a
Death Adder Mouse on top of the reflex
lab extended mouse pad hanging from the
desk are the sony MDR XB 600 headphones
and is what is that is that a mug just
chilling there cable management is
pretty good no cables on the ground
since you mounted them on the left side
of the table and also great use of the
3m tape and even cable clips to keep the
wires organized
I'm sure the protein shake blender and
remotes can be hidden somewhere else to
clean up the desk a bit but overall a
pretty dope setup thank you Eric for
entering castle is next up with a dope
black and red themed setup we have a 24
inch Acer monitor in the middle and a 24
inch AOC monitor to the left we have a
bunch of stuff on the desk a corsair k70
RGB keyboard Logitech G 303 Mouse on top
of the ozone extended mouse pad also on
the desk we have the SteelSeries Siberia
headset resting on the Thermaltake
headphone anger and the go groove bass
pulse speakers that actually featured on
my cool take on their 100 back in
September cable management is great
under the desk but it's a mess on top
there's just too many things going on
there which results in a bunch of wires
I don't know if this table is bolted
against the wall or what but if it isn't
I would suggest running the cables down
and behind the desk to clean up the
surface a bit the PC that's powering the
setup has a 6700 K and a GTX 970 packed
inside the gorgeous NZXT noctus case
another thing out change is maybe
hanging the headphone under the desk
instead to free up some space on the
desk I mean it's pretty cluttered as it
is that way you can move the speaker to
the left side of the monitor so it's not
getting in the way
as for the monitor is not lining up
together a dual monitor arm will
definitely fix that for you this is the
one I recommend for your type of desk
since it doesn't need any clamps to be
installed and just sits on your desk
like this other than those tweaks this
is a really awesome black and red build
Thank You Kessel for entering last but
not least we have Michael a 27 inch
Samsung monitor courser case 65 RGB
keyboard and
by m8000 X Mouse we also have a spray
painted blue Yeti mic and a pair of
audio motion speakers resting on the
desk at the m50 X's and the PC powering
the setup has a 6700 K and a GTX 960
cable management definitely needs some
work and I strongly recommend you to
watch my cable management video I did on
the channel there's a lot of good info
there that can help you clean up your
wires also picking up a boom arm for
your blue Yeti would be better since the
mic is in the way of your monitor and
with the boom arm you can easily bring
it close to you when you need to
voiceover or use the mic and when you're
done you can simply retract it back for
a much cleaner desk setup pretty simple
and straightforward setup thank you
