tech source and in this video we are
going to be doing a detailed speed
comparison between the iPhone 6s and the
Samsung Galaxy s6 for those of you
wanting to my speed test videos I
basically compare the speeds from both
of these phones when it comes to booting
up opening up apps browsing the web and
multitasking I also do a few benchmarks
as well at the end of the video all in
the effort to determine which one of
these two phones is the fastest by the
way the skins I'm using on my devices
are from D brand and they make some of
the sickest skins in the market there's
a bunch of different options to choose
from and they got pretty much all of the
phones covered but I'll go to a drop-in
link down below so you guys can check
out some for yourself so without any
more hesitation let's get right into
this so before I jump into the speed
test let's compare some of the hardware
differences between the two phones the
iPhone 6s is rocking an Apple a9
processor as well as two gigabytes of
RAM the Galaxy s6 has a Samsung Exynos
7420 processor and three gigabytes of
RAM the iPhone 6s does however have a
much lower resolution screen at 750 P
compared to the 1440p screen on the
Galaxy s6 so it might produce better
benchmark scores being it has less
pixels to push both of the phones are
running their most up-to-date software
and no apps have been cleared from the
background we made sure that both of
them are also connected to Wi-Fi and
that the brightness is set to max on
both so with all that said let's start
the speed test with a fresh reboot and
hope you guys enjoy the show
all right so as you guys saw from the
video the iPhone 6s is the better
overall performer this is actually the
first time the iPhone has been an
Android competitor in the multitasking
portion on my channel and I was really
surprising to see Apple definitely made
the right move by upgrading the RAM from
one gigabyte to two from their last
year's model the guys enjoy these types
of speed tests and want to see more on
the channel make sure to hit that like
button and if there's a specific speed
test you guys want to see next then let
me know which phone you want me to use
by dropping a comment down below as
always don't forget to check out the
brand's if you guys want to pimp out
your smartphone you won't be
disappointed I'll drop a link down below
for anyone that's interested thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
