today we're just gonna take a quick look
at a difference in performance between
the standard HTC One m8 and the Google
Play edition we figured the best way to
test this was to play some graphic
intensive games so first up we have
asphalt 8 airborne we have to throw in a
racing game since it's a fast-paced game
and by the looks of it both phones
handle it pretty well if you look very
closely however the GPE does seem to
have smoother gameplay but it's hardly
noticeable
the next game we tested out was the
popular dead trigger 2 game this is a
first-person zombie shooter and it said
that this is one of the most intensive
first-person shooters out there and
that's probably why we got this for the
test once again both phones seem to play
the game very well however if you look
closely the GPU once again seems a bit
smoother when constantly moving around
lastly the most graphically intensive
game we could find on the App Store had
to be GTA san andreas not only that both
smartphones become increasingly hot
during just a few minutes of gameplay
but the GPE proved to be the better of
the two it's pretty obvious in the
gameplay that the Google Play edition
gets more frames per second and a
standard edition and mate has choppy
gameplay so I'm sure we can agree that
the GPE performs a lot better than the
standard edition simply because it's
running stock Android if you are a
hardcore smartphone gamer and want to
get the most out of your intense games
then you should probably pick up the GPE
Edition instead otherwise if you don't
care then either will do but that will
do it for a quick comparison video make
sure to subscribe for more awesome
videos and I will see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
