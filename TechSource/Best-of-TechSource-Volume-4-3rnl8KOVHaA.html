design and I share my experience with
you what with you with you on top of the
world's smallest table I swear my
forehead has more space than this I
don't give a rat's ass if this was
hand-built by Morgan Freeman himself if
I was a millionaire I can think of a
hundred thirty-five thousand other
things to spend that money on imagine a
woman of your dreams your object of
desire her charm her sensuality her
passion try her taste feel her smell
hear her voice using the app calls nice
and I know you guys over the cable
management looks like last night's
leftover spaghetti which means in this
video I will be including the most
overpriced the computer the Mac Pro
Vinson was trying to pull a fast one on
us it looks like you put two rugs over
the cables on the ground to hide them
with the holder ginge have you tried a D
branding your forehead yes
Christian is next up with this
abomination that's right ladies and
gentlemen I don't know if this was a

the set up wars begin
now let the show
let us set up wars begin a number three
we have Marcus and he and an M 65 RGB
mouse on top of the extended mouse pad
from Goro flump flump flump and the left
being a basic 60 Hertz 1080p monitor
I honestly didn't even care about the
horrible cable management or even the
fact that there is a blue and red LED
fan up top but what was so damn
interesting was this sli bridge that's
just hanging from the GPU I don't mean
to crap on your parade but adding an SLI
bridge to your GPU doesn't make it go
faster is that a spongebob cup what are
you seven years old on top of the
extended mousepad flaw McGann got what
what what is fum
there is no L in there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
