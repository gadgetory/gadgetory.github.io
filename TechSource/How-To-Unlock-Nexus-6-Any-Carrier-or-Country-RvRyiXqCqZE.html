I'm here to show you the process of
unlocking your Nexus 6 smartphone so you
can use it with any carrier or country
for this demonstration I will be using
my locked t-mobile Nexus 6 and unlock it
so I can use it on my AT&amp;amp;T network but
you can use this video as a guide for
any carrier so first off we need to get
the unlock code to start the unlocking
process one of the best and most
trusting websites that I use to get my
lock codes is the unlocking company comm
because the prices are unbeatable and
their customer service is the best in
the market so head on over to the
unlocking company comm and select your
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop down list and on the next
page go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is t-mobile so
before we continue we need the IMEI
number of the phone and the way you look
that up on your phone is to open up the
dial pad and enter in star pound zero
six pound once the phone displays the
IMEI number you have to go back on the
website and enter that in once
everything is filled out select get
unlocking code and that will take you to
the final screen where you have to check
out after checking out they will email
you your unlock code the price and
delivery time of your code varies by
phone but don't worry because they
deliver their codes much faster than any
other unlocking website so before we
continue make sure that the phone is
powered off next remove the SIM tray
located on the top and insert the SIM
card you wish to use with the phone I
want to use the Nexus 6 on my at&amp;amp;t
Network so I am putting in my AT&amp;amp;T SIM
card if the SIM card is a different size
then you have to adjust the size in
order for it to fit I have left a link
in the description section to show you
how that's done so after you insert your
SIM tray back into the phone go ahead
and power it back on once the phone
boots up go ahead and leave the lock
screen and immediately after you will
get a prompt asking you for the unlock
code this is where you put in the lock
code that was sent to you by the
unlocking company after inputting the
code your phone will take you straight
to the home screen and your phone will
be permanently unlocked as you can see
here I am using my t-mobile Nexus 6 on
my AT&amp;amp;T network so that's how you unlock
your Nexus 6 smart phone if this video
helped you guys
feel free to leave a like if you run
into any problems or have any questions
at all then feel free to leave them in
the comment section down below and I
will answer them as soon as possible
