welcome to my build guide of my $550 AMD
gaming PC if you happen to miss the
gaming benchmark video I'll have a link
below along with all the parts I used
for this build but without wasting our
time let's begin step 1 take the
motherboard out of the box along with
the i/o shield and one SATA cable / SSD
or hard drive that you are installing
take the cpu and cooler out of the box
and press down on the lever on the
motherboard to release the lock grab the
CPU by its sides and locate the tiny
triangle on one of the corners you're
going to have to match that triangle
with the one on the motherboard once you
figure that out gently lower the CPU
down and let it fall in place it should
sit flush inside the socket if it
doesn't pull it back out and try it
again but do not move it around once
it's in there otherwise you can damage
the pins once the CPU is inside the
socket lower the lever down and lock the
CPU in place next up grab the cooler
which should look something like this
now all rising 5 CPUs come with their
stock cooler and thermal paste is
already applied so go ahead and grab the
thermal compound of your choice
personally I recommend the architects
silver and so do a lot of other PC
enthusiasts I'll drop a link below in
case you guys want to check it out now
there's a lot of methods you can use to
apply paste the most common is the pea
method where you can leave a small dot
of paste right in the center but
recently I've been doing the spreading
method where I basically spread the
paste evenly across the surface of the
CPU I do this to make sure it covers
most of the area now you won't find
significant differences in temps between
these methods I just do it this way for
LCD reasons so once you are done putting
the paste on the CPU you're going to
have to remove the two mounting brackets
so grab the screwdriver and remove all
four of the screws once both of the
plastic mounting brackets are off grab
your CPU cooler and make sure the cable
is going to be in reach of the CPU
header on the motherboard gently lower
the cooler down and screw it in place
using a crisscross pattern don't tighten
one side all the way guys take your time
and screw them in lightly one by one
until they are all fully tightened grab
the cable coming out of the cooler and
plug it into the CPU fan header on the
motherboard which should be too
rekka be above it next up it's time to
do the RAM sticks now if installing two
M sticks then put them in slots a1 and
b1 if you're only putting on one stick
then just put it in slot a1 only so go
ahead and remove the locks and gently
lower the sticks evenly using both of
your hands until both sides snap in
place don't be afraid to apply some
pressure some of these are a bit
stubborn now it's time to install the
i/o shield so rip that plastic off and
make sure that three of the circles on
the i/o shield are facing down towards
the bottom of the case and from inside
the case snap it in the cutout near the
back this is actually the hardest part
of the build believe it or not so you
might need some extra strength and
patience to get this done make sure it
snaps in place and that it sits flush
with the case you guys should hear a few
clicks we do need some extra stand-up
screws before we put in the motherboard
so if we have four of these screws shown
here and install them in these exact
locations inside the case once the
stand-up screws are installed the gently
loads a motherboard down and make sure
to align the Weir ports with the cutouts
of the i/o shield once the motherboard
sits flat on all the standoffs screws
it's time to tighten them up and once
again make sure use a crisscross pattern
now it's time to install the PSU so look
inside the box and you should find four
of these screws that come with your
power supply because we're gonna need
them with the fan facing down gently
lower the power supply in the back of
the case and secure it in place using
those four screws now let's install the
storage you're going to need four of
these screws if you're using a hard
drive which are built just like me
you're going to have to slide it
vertically in this cage until the holes
aligned with the cutouts once they align
you can continue to screw the hard drive
in place two screws in the front and two
more on the back side now if you're
installing an SSD
you only get one spot and it's actually
in the back of the case let's hook up
the hard drive so grab the SATA power
cable that looks something like this and
hook it up to the back of the hard drive
if using an SSD hook it up in the back
of the SSD
the connections are the same next grab B
SATA data cable that we got from the
motherboard box and hook up one end to
the hard drive and the other end to one
of the SATA ports on the motherboard it
should be located just under the ramps
to the right side again this process is
exactly the same for an SSD since we are
connecting things let's connect the rest
of the cables first up are these tiny
connectors for the front panel of the
case grab the one that says reset SW and
insert it in the bottom two pins pin
number three and ten number four on the
bottom row next one is HDD led now with
the words facing down connect this one
to pin number one and pin number two on
the same row power LED plus goes in pin
number one and LED minus goes into pin
number two on the top and finally the
power SW goes in pins number three and
pin number four on the top by next to
the cables we just plugged in for this
one it doesn't matter which direction
you plug it in the cable with the blue
tip is for the USB 3.0 port in the front
and that connects to the port that says
USB three on the motherboard which is
right above the SATA ports the cable
that says HD audio goes into the pins
labeled HD audio which is in the far
left side of the motherboard near the
bottom the cable that says USB goes in
the pins that says you guess that USB
which is to the right of the HD audio
port we just plugged in the huge 24 pin
cable is needed to power the motherboard
and that obviously goes into the 24 pin
socket on the motherboard and finally
the two four pin connectors labelled CPU
are needed to power the CPU socket and
these plug into the ports on the top
left of the motherboard so at this time
your PC should look something like this
we can take this time to work on cable
management now that you know where
everything connects - feel free to
disconnect all the wires and route them
any way you like
once you are done with the cable
management it's time to plug in the GPU
so remove the two screws from the back
that's holding the PCI brackets together
and peel off the two metal brackets by
bending them back and forward until they
come off grab the GPU with the fan
facing down and slide it into the first
PCI slot until you hear it snap screw
back the PCI bracket cover in the back
and grab the cable that says PCIe and
plug it in the GPU so congratulations
you've built your very own gaming PC but
we are not done yet because we do need
to install the drivers and overclock the
PC so go ahead and grab a USB drive with
at least 8 gig
space and plug it into a working
computer we're gonna have to download
and install the operating system files
onto the USB so if you're installing
Windows 10 click on the Windows 10 link
below and if you're doing Windows 8.1
click on that link instead I'll be
dropping links to all the sites that I
talked about down below once the media
tool is downloaded open it up and follow
the instructions it's very simple
on the first page click on the second
option that says create installation
media
then click Next again and make sure that
the USB flash drive option is selected
then go ahead and select the USB Drive
that we are installing the files to and
it will start to download the files make
sure you don't have any important files
on it because it will erase everything
off of it so once it's done installing
the files we're going to have to plug
this into the PC we just built and boot
it up as soon as you hit the power
button on the PC repeatedly hit the f11
button on the keyboard
until the boot menu pops up and from
here we're gonna have to select the USB
Drive after that the PC will boot from
the drive and it will begin installing
windows but first up you will need to
enter the CD key in our u to get my CD
keys from reddit because they are super
cheap but you can buy them from wherever
you want just make sure you're actually
buying the correct version of Windows
that you installed on your USB Drive
after entering the CD key it will take
you to this window over here make sure
to select the correct Windows version
that you bought otherwise the CD key
won't work after you hit next and accept
the terms it will ask you where you want
to install Windows we're going to click
on custom and obviously pick the drive
that you want to install onto in my case
is the 1 terabyte drive so click Next
and it will begin installing the files
now if you have files on your drive and
want to format it you can actually
select the drive and click on format and
then click OK once it's done formatting
you can see that we have one terabyte of
space once again then you can click on
the drive again and hit next and it will
install a fresh copy of Windows on it
everything else is self-explanatory just
follow the instructions on the screen
until it takes you to the desktop and
once you are here you will need to
install the drivers if you don't have
internet access on this PC use a
computer that does and download the
following drivers for your PC once again
I'll drop a link to it below from the
motherboard website we need to install
the following we'll Tex high-definition
audio
and we'll take bland driver the rest of
the stuff is optional
once you install these and restart the
PC you should have internet access when
you hook up your PC to your router and
then we can install the graphics driver
so visit the AMD website and click on
the download link for the automatically
detect and install your driver once
again the link is below
once it's done installing and restart
your PC you are basically done if you
don't want to overclock your PC then
this is the end of the tutorial
but if you want to overclock your cpu to
gain more performance then this is what
you have to do we start your PC and
click on the delete button on the
keyboard so that it takes you to the
BIOS screen move over to the OC Tweaker
tab and make sure the CPU frequency and
voltage change is set to manual this is
where it gets fun now there are some
people that can push their r5 1402 4.0
gigahertz
however mine doesn't get that high so I
left it at 3.9 at one point three eight
seven five volts so I recommend you to
copy these settings that you see on the
screen for the frequency and the voltage
and then you can hit f10 on your
keyboard to save the changes and then
boot to the desktop I recommend running
Ida 64 for about an hour to see if your
PC is stable now it is a free program
and you can download it from their
website or you can click on the link
below once you download it and open up
the program click on the little graph
icon up top and click on start let it
run for about an hour and if your PC
doesn't crash that means its stable I
would also check the temperatures to
make sure it's not getting too hot
honestly anything over 85 degrees is
considered a bit too hot if your PC is
stable and doesn't crash I would bump it
up to 4.0 gigahertz and we run the test
if it crashes go back and up the voltage
then we run the test rinse and repeat
until the PC is stable at 4.0 gigahertz
if you can get it there whatever you
guys do do not increase the voltage past
1.45 volts it can damage your CPU over
time if for some reason it's crashing at
3.9 lower to three point eight and
adjust the voltage accordingly once you
find a stable clock and voltage you can
actually enable XMP and mess with RAM
overclocking but I kept that out of
default since it doesn't really make a
huge difference but anyways that's it
for the video if you guys enjoyed my
build guide and it helped
tossing a like would be really awesome
as it takes a very long time to set up
these types of videos if you have any
questions at all let me know in the
comments section below because I'm sure
my fellow subscribers will help you out
I'll also answer a few questions here
and there thank you guys so much for
watching I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
