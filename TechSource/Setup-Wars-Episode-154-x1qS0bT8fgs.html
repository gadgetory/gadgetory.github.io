welcome to setup wars episode 154 where
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on that channel if you guys
want to submit your setup to get
featured make sure to watch the video
link down below with that said welcome
to setup wars episode 154 kicking off
the episode is this gorgeous set up from
bent who lives in the Netherlands so
uses it for gaming video and photo
editing along with some 3d design he's
rocking a 29 inch ultra ride from LG as
the main monitor and he's got a 23 inch
on the side which he probably uses for
photo editing on the desk we got the
corsair k70 luxe RGB keyboard with the
m65 pro RGB mouse and it's interesting
to see that he routed both the wires
using a cable raceway on the desk I mean
even this approach looks cleaner than
just running the wires across the desk I
respect the fact that bent did not want
to drill a hole for the cables but he
did come up with a different solution
for hiding the wires so I will give him
points for that I don't necessarily
agree with the location of the Xbox
controller and the phone but it's not a
big deal now for audio he's using the
Logitech z3 33 speakers but he's also
using some headphones as well we got the
Razer Krakens and the Audio Technica m50
X's which are chilling on a desk now
obviously I would recommend the
headphone hanger for both of them I mean
it's kind of a staple of setup boys at
this point this one from anchor has a
spot for two headphones and it only goes
for 12 dollars just slap it under your
desk and keep your headphones on there
when you're not using them it will
definitely help clean up your setup a
lot I'll drop a link below if anyone
wants to check it out the rest of the
cable management is pretty good the net
underneath the desk is holding up most
of the cables and it looks like he added
a spiral sleeve for some of the wires
going down towards the sub it's not the
cleanest cable work I do see a lot of
loose wires hanging down on the left
side what you can do with those is by
using these cable clips and hook them
against the desk and it will pretty much
prevent the cables from sagging down the
PC powering the setup has an i-5 7500
eight
of RAM in the GTX 1060 if you're using
your PC for a lot of 3d design or video
editing work I strongly recommend
throwing in another 8 gigs of RAM for a
total of 16 you're bored it does have
two extra DIMM slots so I would make use
of that only if you're using the PC for
heavy editing because I feel like 8 gigs
of ram just isn't enough the build also
looks really clean I feel like if you
added a white backplate to the GPU it
would look even better make sure to
check out v1 Tech and their awesome back
plates if you're interested your setup
has come a long way from before just
using a laptop and a single monitor to
dis it's a very clean setup with purpose
and I feel like with some minor tweaks
I'm confident you can make this even
better think you bent for entering Jules
is up next from Germany and his setup
that he uses for gaming editing
live-streaming and photo editing ok he's
using a kitchen countertop from Ikea
with some capital eggs as a riser on top
of to Alex drawers he's walking to 24
inch monitors that I hooked up against
the wall and I like how he covered the
wires going across the wall looks like
he used some sort of tube or Raceway to
route the cables very nice he didn't
drill a hole for the keyboard and mouse
because he said in the notes that he's
eventually going to switch to a wireless
setup which is understandable he's got a
pair of bose companion 3 speakers on the
desk and the HyperX cloud headset
hanging underneath it he also uses a
microphone which he hooked up to a boom
arm but I'm curious why he extended it
all the way up if he's not using it I
much prefer folding the arm and hiding
the mic behind the monitor because I
mean it just looks weird this way
doesn't it maybe it's just me I don't
know cable management is really clean it
looks like all the cables are hidden
behind the drawers and down here he's
got a few things for easy access like a
few USB hubs and his remote for RGB
lighting the PC part in the setup has an
87 jack a 16 gigs of ram and the msi gtx
970 and that's pretty much it not much
else - the setup is very clean and
straightforward Thank You Jules for
entering Lazaro is up next from Greece
and his awesome modded water-cooled PC
desk even though he sent me potato
pictures I decided to feature this
anyways because it's such a dope desk
setup so he's got a single 24 inch
monitor that's hooked up on the wall
with a race
to hide the cables and below that ladies
and gentlemen is a custom-made all-glass
desk that's mounted against the wall the
keyboard and mouse are both from cooler
master and is rocking a pair of Logitech
Z 333 speakers surprisingly he's not
using a headset with this setup so on
the left side is where the main
components are located we got the
motherboard the CPU Ram and even the GTX
1050 Ti with a single 360 mil radiator
and on the other side is where the pump
reservoir and the other 360 mil radiator
is at obviously he's a fan of Razer not
because of the color scheme but because
of the obvious razor plaque he created
also if you look closely you can see
that he skinned the reservoir and black
carbon fiber it's really interesting to
see something this high-end on a low
budget PC it's almost seems like a waste
of money to me I feel like the water
cooling parts cost more than the actual
PC itself I mean at least he didn't go
with a GPU block so that's good
I'm guessing saving enough money to buy
a more powerful GPU and water cool that
as well this is a very unique PC desk
setup and it's been a while since I've
seen one of these on setup words but
Lazaro's I hope you get to upgrade that
GPU at one point and throw that in the
loop as well once you do feel free to
submit your new setup pictures thank you
for entering the number four is standard
from New Jersey and his setup for gaming
and photography work so he's rocking
dual monitors that are mounted on the
desk and it's interesting that he went
with two mounts instead of one so on a
desk we got the courser k95 RGB keyboard
with the asus rog spatha mouse and the
Tartarus keypad from Razer I don't know
where he got that dope mousepad from but
I'm loving it the white caps give off a
nice contrast between the keyboard and
the mouse pad I also love how you drill
a hole on the desk for cable management
and added a cover so it looks a lot
cleaner by the way if I find out where
that mouse pad is from I'll drop a link
below but feel free to help me out if
you guys find it faster than me alright
so for audio he's rocking a bose
companion 5 speakers and the corsair
void RGB headset I do like the placement
of the boom arm holding his microphone
it's not on the actual desk but on the
monitor
itself very nice cable management is
neat thanks to both the Signum racks and
I like how he zip tie the power strip
underneath the rack that's actually a
really great idea if you don't have any
extra space on the rack itself if you're
watching this video and have the same
issue feel free to use this hack to
solve your problem the pc powering the
setup is a beautiful beast it's the
water-cooled build with the 77 2k 32
gigs of the Trident Zr GB RAM sticks and
these tricks 1080p I really amazing job
on all the custom work from the acrylic
panels on the sides of the PC to the PSU
shroud and even the decals across all
the parts the attention to detail is
just amazing
even the case has been modded for better
airflow the cutouts in the front as well
as the extra vents on the top contribute
to better airflow really awesome work
but I gotta say the icing on the cake
definitely has to be the five piece
mural of attack on titans on the wall
this is a well balanced gorgeous setup
and I think that standard did an awesome
job putting it together and keeping it
very contrasty thank you for entering
wrapping up the episode Assyria from
Israel and his setup for gaming and
music production by the way I'll drop a
link to his SoundCloud below if you guys
want to check it out and show him some
support his PC is the first thing that
caught my eye I'm not gonna lie it's
gorgeous but we'll get to that in a bit
so the setup itself is pretty heavy
there's a lot of things going on here
but he did keep it very organized
we got a gaming all tried monitor from
Asus the courser k95 Platinum keyboard
and the mm 800 RGB Polaris mouse pad
there was a few other things on a desk
like his focus right audio interface a
MIDI keyboard and some statues I mean he
still has some extra space on the desk
so it's not really that cramped this is
a music production setup so you better
expect his audio game to be on point
he's rocking a pair of Yamaha hs7
speakers that I mounted against the wall
and underneath the setup he's got the
Sennheiser HD 650 s and the m50 X's now
since he used capital leagues to raise
the desk above the drawers he did manage
to squeeze a few extra things in here
like the ps4 Pro and his router this
setup doesn't have a lot of cables but
the Signum is there to help out with
what he's got right now because the
monocle PC and
side a modded coarser 570 X case it's
rocking a 69 Andrew K 64 gigs of RAM Wow
and the gigabyte GT X 1080 Ti I'm just
loving the mods inside the case you got
the rear fan cover with a custom
backplate on the sound card not the GPU
but the actual sound card has a
backplate that's crazy and the custom
power supply shred with the asus rog
logo i also love that he went with red
coolant to make the pc pop just
beautiful work and a beautiful setup
