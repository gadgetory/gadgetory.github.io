really been stepping up its game but
will its latest flagship be enough to
take down the other Android Titans like
Samsung and HTC this is ad from tech
source then let's unbox this and find
out
so the z2 comes in three available
colors black white and purple and you
can pick up an unlocked version for only
660 bucks
I will leave links below if you are
interested but before we move on with
the unboxing let's take a quick look at
the specs the z2 comes rocking a
Snapdragon 801 chip running a 2.3
gigahertz quad-core processor along with
an Adreno 330 graphics processor the
battery has also been upgraded to 3200
milliamps which can last you up to six
hundred ninety hours on standby time and
about 15 hours of talk time one more
thing to note before I move on is that
the z2 is also waterproof with a rating
of IP 58 that has become a standard for
almost all Sony phones and the device
can be submerged one meter underwater
for as long as thirty minutes according
to Sony so removing the cover we are
greeted with the z2 but before we take a
closer look at it let's see what else
the phone comes with so they included a
standard USB charging brick and
earphones it's good to see that so many
threw in some earphones even though a
lot of people tend to use their own it's
really nice to have spares even though
there is no volume control you can
accept calls because it has a built-in
microphone
lastly they included the micro USB cable
for charging and transferring files
along with some warranty info and
paperwork since the phone is waterproof
and dust resistant there are flaps that
cover the port's on the phone sony has
brought back the famous design
signatures from z1 which are the
dedicated power button volume rockers
and the silver power button they also
brought back the micro SD card slot but
instead increased the maximum expansion
size to 128 gigabytes instead of the 64
both the micro SD card slot and the sim
slot have these trays which can be
pulled out for convenience the
microphone is located on the bottom of
the phone along with some lanyard holes
on the opposite side you will find the
charging pins which
are used to dock the phone for charging
and beneath the flap are the sim tray
and charging port unlike the z1 the z2
has a slightly bigger screen coming in
at 5.2 inches with 424 pixels per inch
the front-facing camera also got an
increase in pixels coming in at 2.2
megapixels similar to the m8 sony has
added front-facing stereo speakers which
should be a must to every smartphone at
this point we do have a sample video to
share with you guys later in this video
although there aren't many changes to
the camera sensor the z2 does come with
some cool features one of which is 4k
recording that we will definitely look
at later other than that the camera
sensor aperture and flash are the same
as the z1 and like most Android phones
the z2 also comes with NFC capabilities
finally getting to the handset we can
see that Sony hasn't strayed too far
from their already classic Omni balanced
design which according to Sony creates a
balance and symmetry in all directions
of the device the full glass back on the
z2 leaves you wanting to pick up the
phone just to hold it that combined with
its metal skeleton makes this device one
of the most premium Android handsets out
there right along with the HTC One m8
the 1080p full-hd triluminos display
Dwarfs the front of the device one thing
to note here is that Sony's been known
for their bad smartphone displays but
this one is supposed to be a turn in the
right direction and from first glance it
does look really good the blacks look
deep and the screen is very vibrant
definitely a competitor for the best
screens out there currently it's good to
see that Sony has addressed a common
complaint with previous iterations of
Xperia smartphones if we do specials to
the left and right of the screen to
allow for easier one-handed use here's a
sample video comparing the speakers on
the z2 to the speakers on the m8 you
guys can be the judge here
you know what it is I love about being
spider-man
watch up
you okay spider yeah I know costume
gives it away huh max doing it your
badge Oscorp
nobody but nobody Hey lick that your
eyes and ears huh
damn girl see you like this amazing
spider-man
as you can hear the results are actually
pretty impressive compared to the HTC
One m8 however it still falls short but
not by that much jumping around the UI a
little bit here we can see that the skin
has not really changed that much over
the years which isn't necessarily a bad
thing it does however feel a little bit
snappier than the past versions of the
software you do have an easy access to
Google now from the home key which is
nice to see the software is not stock
but does add some great value I
definitely see myself using this more
than a phone running TouchWiz so taking
a closer look at the phone's 20.7
megapixel sensor we can see that Sony
has included all these special modes
which we will take a closer look at in
another video but one thing to note here
is the 4k video option the camera does
look very promising and we will
definitely have to take a closer look at
the z2 camera in a later video where we
are going to put it up against phones
like the galaxy s5 iPhone 5s and VMA to
see where it stands but for now we are
left impressed with the quality sensor
outputs I am left at the end of the
sandboxing satisfied it might not be a
major update over the z1 but it does
improve on everything sony was
criticized on with the z1 it's not
coming to the u.s. anytime soon and we
might get an unlock model this summer
which is probably going to be really
expensive which is too bad because from
my first hands on this phone it does
feel like it were the Android competitor
this might actually replace my iPhone 5s
and become my primary phone but I will
need some time to play with it but I
wanted to hear what you guys think about
the z2 do any of you own one and if not
is this a phone that you see yourself
purchasing let me know in the comment
section down below we do have a bunch of
videos coming soon for the z2 including
benchmarks camera tests and speed tests
so make sure to subscribe if you haven't
already so you don't miss out on the
coverage this is that from tech source
and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
