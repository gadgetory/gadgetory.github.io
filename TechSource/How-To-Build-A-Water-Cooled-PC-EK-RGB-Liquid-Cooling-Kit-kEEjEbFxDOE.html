to my water cooling bill guide this
video is a step-by-step guide on how you
can water cool your own PC using the ek
RGB 360 kit this is the perfect place to
start for beginners who don't know
anything about water cooling or for
someone that wants to water cool their
current or new PC you guys don't have to
stress about finding the correct tube
size or the correct fittings or just
running into any compatibility issues
you got everything you need right here
in this kit so the kit comes with a CPU
block a pump and reservoir combo and of
course the radiator itself now that you
have two versions currently you can pick
up a 240 millimeter or a 360 which is
what I'm using for this build
and they're also RGB so not only are the
fans RGB but also the CPU block itself
and of course the reservoir it's gonna
look really dope inside the PC the only
thing that doesn't come in this kit is a
GPU block to water cool your graphics
card and actually prefer that think
about it what is the most common part in
your PC that you guys always upgrade
storage maybe Ram but mostly the GPU the
graphics card is the most easiest part
to upgrade you just pop it out and slap
on the new one whenever you're ready so
adding a GPU block will make it
inconvenient to upgrade besides I feel
like cooling the CPU is more important
for overclocking anyways the cool part
about this kit pun intended is that it's
expandable if you ever decide to add a
GPU block or a second radiator down the
line then you'll be pleased to find out
how easy it is EK sells individual
blocks and radiators and all you have to
do is add them to your build
they provide plenty of tubing for this
in their liquid cooling kit in fact this
is how much soft tubing I have left
after my build it's enough for a GPU
block and an extra radiator if I ever
need to upgrade alright so with that
said let's begin the build guide these
are the parts I'm going to be using for
the tutorial your parts don't have to
match these exact ones as long as you
guys have the ek RGB kit and you are
good to go either to 240 or the 360 it
doesn't matter as long as it fits in
your case this actually is compatible
with most AMD and intel socket types
which I'll list here on the screen so
make sure it does match your current CPU
but yeah with that said let's begin
alright so before we begin the build
you're gonna need the following a pair
scissors to cut the soft tubing at least
900 milliliters of distilled water
please make sure it's distilled and not
drinking water you're also going to need
a power supply bridge so that we can
turn on the pump only and not the whole
PC so that we can pour in the coolant
and of course a funnel is strongly
recommended to make it easy filling the
system hey guys real quickly before I
continue to build guide I do want to
share this awesome deal on office 2016
you can now get the entire suite that
includes office Excel spreadsheet and
the rest of them for just $35 instead of
paying full retail price of over 200
I'll draw a link below if you want to
check it out also make sure to use my
code TSS 2 for an extra 10% off all
right let's start off by grabbing the
parts that you will need right now which
is the motherboard CPU Ram sticks and
the CPU water block go ahead and remove
the motherboard from its box along with
any accessories you need for example the
i/o shield SATA cables etc place the
motherboard on top of the box make sure
to always grab the motherboard from its
sides so you don't end up bending or
damaging any of the components on it if
you're gonna install a numbed out to SSD
like I am in the video then grab that
and install it in the MDOT 2 slot on the
motherboard in my case I had to remove
the shield covering the M that 2 slot in
order for me to install it alright next
it's time to install the CPU so go ahead
and locate the golden triangle on your
CPU whether it's AMD or Intel and make
sure to match that with the triangle on
the actual socket cover on the
motherboard open the cover by releasing
a lever or levers and gently place the
CPU inside while holding it on its sides
make sure to not touch the surface or
the bottom part of the CPU once it's
fully seated lower the cover and lock
the CPU in place using the levers the
black plastic cover usually pops off but
if it doesn't make sure to peel it right
off we can put on the thermal paste now
so grab the thermal grizzly paste that
came with the ek CPU block and add some
to the surface of the CPU I can start
off with a line and spread it across the
surface using a spreader but you guys
can just use the P dot method in the
center remember it's always safer to add
a little extra than not adding enough ok
now it's time to add the water block so
take a look at the instruction manual to
see which screws you will need for your
socket type the best way to find out
what socket
type your CPU is using is by looking at
the box itself so once you figure out
what parts you need proceed with the
installation in my case it was very
simple all I had to do was install the
four screws now before putting on the
block make sure to remove the sticker
underneath it otherwise it's gonna cause
some overheating issues afterwards we
can lower the CPU block gently down and
then proceed by installing four of these
Springs on each of the screws before
locking them in place with he provided
thumb screws just make sure not to fully
tighten them just enough until it grabs
onto the thread you can start with one
of them and then move to the opposite
corner and you can continue to do this
until they are all fully tightened
evenly the CPU block is RGB which means
it comes with a cable that needs to be
plugged into the 12 volt RGB header on
the motherboard thankfully ek has
included a couple RGB splitter cables
you can go in and grab one of the four
cables and connect it to the CPU block
cable it's very important to make sure
that the arrows line up on both of them
alright let's install the RAM sticks
next the order matters if you're
installing two or more on the board with
more than two slots usually the order is
listed right on the motherboard but if
it's not take a look at the manual and
it will tell you which slots to occupy
first since I'm using four RAM sticks
the first slots I need to occupy for
quad channel support is a1 b1 c1 and d1
make sure to align the notch on the slot
with the gap on the RAM stick and gently
press down on both sides until it snaps
in place once all the RAM slots are
installed it's time to put the
motherboard inside the case first off
you have to install the i/o shield on
the back of the case so do that before
and the motherboard I'm using in the
video already has an IO shield built
inside the motherboard which is awesome
and convenient so I'm gonna go ahead and
skip this step most cases come with
standoffs already installed however if
your case doesn't then you're gonna have
to manually screw them on just like I am
the best way to find out where to
install them is by looking at the holes
on your motherboard and trying to match
them with the holes on the actual case
itself once all the standoffs are
installed to gently lower the
motherboard in the case at the same time
trying to align the holes on the
motherboard with these standoffs on the
case you're gonna need these type of
screws to secure the motherboard you as
looks slightly different these screws do
come with the case itself once the
motherboard is secured in your case it's
time to hook up the radiator and the
fans and this part is very important so
listen carefully depending on the layout
of your case and the fan configuration
you might have a different setup in mind
so let's take a look at the fans the
side with the cable showing is the side
where the air is going out from that
side is the exhaust while the opposite
side is intake so if you hold it to the
side like this air is being pulled in
from the right side and out the back
ideally you want to mount the fans on
your radiator so that the sticker is
sitting on top of the radiator just like
this now because the way my case is
designed it's going to be pulling in a
cold air through the radiator and out in
the back so here's my recommended fan
configuration for your PC option number
one mounting it in the front of the case
if you're gonna mount the radiator in
the front then I recommend putting the
fans in the front with the sticker
facing the radiator so that way it sucks
in cold air from the front and blows it
through the radiator and inside your
case alternatively you can mount them
behind the radiator in the same
direction now it's not gonna be as
effective but there isn't really a
noticeable difference in temps or if you
have a space you can do a push and pull
configuration what that means is you can
add fans in the front for intake and
also fans in the back for exhaust
additionally if your case will allow it
I do recommend adding one or two fans on
the top of your case as exhaust you will
have better airflow and this method is
more effective so if you do have the
space I do recommend occupying them with
fans also adding an extra fan as an
exhaust for the rear is a plus option
number two mounting the radiator on the
top of the case this configuration is
very common because of how most
mainstream cases are designed most
people put the fans on the bottom of the
radiator and use it as exhaust blowing
air through the radiator and out of the
case nearing the top however if you're
gonna do this I recommend using at least
two additional fans in the front of the
case as intake so that fresh air is
being pulled into the case from the side
once again adding an extra fan as
exhaust in the back is a plus so those
are my two recommended configurations
make sure to pick the best one that
matches your needs and goes with the
case now because of the type of case I'm
I have to install the fans on the
radiator itself first before I can mount
the whole thing to the case so I'm gonna
be using these long screws that came
with the radiator to secure them also
sight note make sure the cables are
facing a direction where it's going to
be easy to cable manage you don't want
cables going across the case it doesn't
look good so in my build I position the
wires towards the right side so that way
I can route them around the case and
behind the radiator for a much cleaner
look to actually mount the radiator on
the case itself I have to use these
smaller screws that also came with the
radiator and I can tighten them from the
back unfortunately due to the unique
case design this radiator is too big for
the case and the holes don't exactly
line up for me obviously I can drill
holes and make this happen but just for
the sake of video and keeping things
simple I only install the three of the
screws just to keep it up alright so
once you hooked up the rad to your case
it's time to install the pump and the
rest combo so go ahead and remove that
from the box along with the accessories
and this part is also a bit tricky
because there are multiple ways to mount
this depending on what your case
supports but before all that you're
gonna want to tighten the clamp around
the pump once you release it you can
rotate the whole unit in any direction
you want maybe you want the holes facing
a certain direction for easy access I
mean whatever angle you want just make
sure to lock it in place once you have
figured that out you can then proceed to
tighten the clamp using the two thin
screws that it came with alright so here
are your options for mounting the pump
and res option number one using the
provided pump bracket so this pump gets
mounted to the bracket itself and the
bracket gets mounted to a hundred twenty
millimeter fan or any space that can fit
a hundred twenty millimeter fan it can
be on a spot on a radiator on the fan
itself or in any bracket where a fan
would normally be installed on it's
because the holes on the bracket align
perfectly with a 120 millimeter fan now
you can mount the res sideways or up
right but you can't mount it upside down
option number one is the easiest and by
far the most convenient but it's not my
favorite because it's not the cleanest
option number two using a clamp to hold
the pump and res most high-end or
enthusiast level cases have pre-drilled
holes like mine to mount the clamp
however EK doesn't provide a clamp with
this kit unless you buy it separately
you guys remembered I actually used a
clamp to mount my resin pump combo on my
PC if your case supports it and you do
end up buying a clamp then you can just
hook it up by screwing it in from the
back afterwards you can attach the rest
to it and tighten the clamp from the
side it's very simple option number
three if all else fails model yourself
this is my preferred method because I
would rather mount the pump directly to
my case without any extra brackets or
clamps it just looks cleaner in my
opinion but sadly none of the holes on
my case align with the holes on the pump
itself so I drilled in myself the PAS
brass combo comes with a template which
makes this so easy just peel it off
stick it wherever you plan on mounting
the pump and start drilling just make
sure to cover up any components nearby
to prevent debris from flying into them
and possibly damaging them and once the
holes are drilled simply use for the
thicker screws to mount it against your
case from the opposite side so at this
point you should have all the water
cooling components hooked up to your
case and now is the best time to plan
your loop ideally it's recommended to
put a radiator between each block but
since we only have one block and one
radiator it doesn't really matter so
when you're actually planning the loop
make sure that the in and out indicators
match with the loop direction for
example on the pump you can see in and
out this means that the loop order has
to match that order you'll see what I
mean by this soon this is also labeled
on most CPU blocks but this one from ek
for some reason doesn't have it the left
is in and the right is out so this is my
loop pattern out from the CPU into the
read out from the read into the pump out
from the pump into the CPU block the
order here really doesn't matter what's
more important is the direction of the
flow now that we have our loop planned
it's time to finish up building the PC
so go ahead and grab the power supply
and install it in your case in most
liner cases you have to install a PSU
with the fan facing downwards if it's
being installed sideways and make sure
that the fan is facing outwards the
power supply this come with four screws
which is located in the box so use those
to secure it in place if your power
supply is in a very tight spot to get to
I do recommend hooking up the cables
first before installing it into your
case this part is very easy just read
the labels on the connectors and match
them with the labels on the back of the
PSU they only go in one way so RB
it doesn't fit then it's in the wrong
spot these SATA power cables are
optional you're gonna need it only if
you're installing hard drives SSDs or
any other part that requires a SATA
power cable you'll know if you need one
this is a molex cable it's similar to
the SATA power cable as it provides
power but it has a different connector
you need at least one of these to power
the pump so go ahead and hook this up to
the back of the power supply now that
all the cables are plugged in it's time
to plug the other ends to the
motherboard starting with a 24 pin which
goes in the 24 pin socket on the edge of
the motherboard the connector is
labelled CPU plug in the top of the
board my board uses an 8 pin and an
additional 4 pin while most motherboards
just use a single 8 pin however many
connectors your motherboard has I do
recommend plugging them all in for
better stability during overclocking you
can take this time to plug in the front
panel cables the USB 3 plug usually has
a blue tip on it and that plugs into the
USB 3 header on the motherboard while
the regular USB plug goes into the USB
header the plug labeled HD audio
connects to the audio header which is
usually on the far left bottom of the
board and finally these little guys if
you case has a reset switch then you'll
have either one or two more cables than
me otherwise in this exact same order
with the words facing the top you're
gonna plug these into the front panel
header usually on the lower bottom right
of the board sometimes this is labeled
as jf p1 or something similar on other
motherboards there's a total of seven
pins on this header now these plug into
the first four pins on the top like this
HDD led and the reset switch plug in
right underneath those two so before we
finish up with the rest of the cables
we've got to install the GPU we move
however many PCI brackets from the back
of the case and with the back plate
facing up slide it in the top PCIe
bracket until you hear it snap in place
proceed to tighten the GPU by using a
thumb screw we have to supply power to
the graphics card so we have the cables
labeled PCIe
or VGA in some cases and plug those in
the power connectors now to finish up
the rest of the cables grab the fan
splitter cable that came with the ek kit
and proceed to connect the fans from the
radiator these are what the plugs look
like so once all the fans are hooked up
we can plug the other
to the CPU fan header on the motherboard
which is usually on the top right if you
guys have any extra fans in the cases
you can either plug those into any fan
header labelled CPU CH a or CPU opt or
you can use another fan splitter if you
have one and do the same thing like we
did with the other fans now since these
fans are RGB we have to plug in an extra
cable so that we can control the
lighting
remember that RGB splitter cable that we
plugged in earlier for the CPU block but
we're gonna use that same splitter and
plug in the three fans from the radiator
the pump also has RGB lighting however I
used up all four the connectors from the
splitter three for the fans and one for
the CPU block so how to take out another
splitter just to hook up the pump
lighting thankfully Ek provides two of
these with the kit now once you finished
hooking up all RGB cables you're gonna
have to hook up the other end to your
motherboards 12 volt RGB Heather the
header is usually in white and has four
pins so it's easy to spot but before you
hook that up we move the four pins from
the cable and make sure that the arrow
on the cable lines up with the 12 volt
symbol on the pins
luckily my motherboard comes a to RGB
header so I can plug the other one as
well the next cable we're gonna hook up
is the one for the pump this one hooks
up to the pump header on the motherboard
now if your board doesn't have a
dedicated pump header then you can hook
it up to any other fan header instead
finally we have to provide power to the
pump so grab the molex connector from
the pump and connect it to the molex
cable from the power supply alright so
at this point you should have everything
hooked up the only thing we have to do
now is the tubing and filling it up with
liquid by the way if you guys are
enjoying the build guide so far tossing
a like would be appreciated if it take
me a full week to put this entire guide
together for you alright now it's time
to do the tubing so grab your scissors
the soft tubing and the fittings take
apart the fittings and insert the male
portion inside all of the holes I know
that sounds sexual but bear with me plug
up the two holes on the CPU block the
pump and the radiator grab your soft
tube and insert one end of it into the
out hole from the CPU block
feel free to twist the tube in a
circular movement so that it slides in
easier instead of just forcing it
straight in now it's time to measure and
cut the beauty about soft tubing is that
you can be as flexible as possible
you can stretch out the tube to make it
shorter and simple or leave it loose so
looks more full in the build I like to
keep the slack loose so that it looks
more curvy so once you're happy with the
desired length grab your scissors and
cut the tube make sure you are cutting
perpendicular to the tube don't cut the
tube at an angle otherwise it won't sit
flush on the fittings and can cause
future leaks so after cutting the tube
go ahead and grab the two fitting caps
and slide them through the tube you can
tighten the CPU block end and then hook
up the tube to the radiator and then
tighten that in as well make sure it's
nice and tight to prevent leaks do this
exact same thing for the other fittings
measure the distance cut the tube slide
in the fittings and then tighten them in
place once you're done you are now ready
to pour in the coolant but before that
you will need at least 900 milliliters
of distilled water over here I have a
full gallon or 3.7 6 litres of distilled
water so the way I measured it was by
using an empty smaller water jug which
was about eighteen ninety millilitres so
I filled it about halfway with distilled
water which would be around at nine
hundred millilitres it doesn't have to
be exact but you can use whatever method
works easiest for you an actual
measuring cup would be a lot easier in
this instance so anyways after you have
your nine hundred milliliters of
distilled water in one container shake
up the coolant and the smaller bottle
before pouring it all into the water
I do recommend using a funnel for this
as it makes the filling part a lot
easier okay so now your coolant is ready
to pour in the system but we have to do
it while it's off never turn on your PC
or run your pump with no liquid in it if
it runs dry it will get damaged the best
way to run the pump separately without
turning on your PC is by using a power
supply bridge tool like I mentioned in
the beginning of the video most power
supplies do come at one however if yours
doesn't I strongly recommend picking one
up I'll drop a link below on where you
can find one this basically allows you
to turn on the power supply by itself
without booting your actual system
before anything happens connect your
power supply cable to an outlet and make
sure to switch off the power supply by
clicking to the circle setting in the
back next remove the 24 pin cable hooked
up to the motherboard and connect it to
this device instead pop off the top
cover from your reservoir and
to put paper towels underneath every
fitting just in case something leaks
you don't want liquid damaging your
parts go ahead and insert the funnel and
slowly begin pouring in the coolant this
is very important guys don't rush this
process and don't overfill the res it
will get filled up quickly since that's
turned off once there's a good amount of
coolant inside the case remove the
funnel and switch the power supply to
the on position the pump will turn on
and it will begin pushing the coolant
through the loop as soon as you see it
get low on coolant immediately shut off
the power supply again do not let the
pump run dry once you get the hang of
things you can actually switch the power
supply on and leave it like that while
you gradually fill the res with coolant
the reason why I don't recommend this
method for beginners is because it's
easy to misjudge how much coolant to
pour in and oftentimes people overfill
and then you help cooling all over the
place if this is your first time stick
to the first method pour in coolant stop
turn on the power supply for a few
seconds shut it off and then rinse and
repeat until there's a steady amount of
coolant left in the res don't worry if
your coolant is bubbly like it is in the
video that's completely normal and it
will flatten out very soon this next
part isn't really important but what I
like to do is tilt the system on all
four sides one by one to get all the
trapped air inside the system out you
have to be very careful not to over tilt
otherwise the coolant from the res will
spill out
I do recommend putting the cap on the
res while doing this it actually helps
but make sure to leave the top hole open
so that the air can escape I left the
cap off on mine cars I like to live life
dangerously so after removing all the
air bubbles you can go ahead and tighten
the cap and screw on the plug ideally
you want to leave the system running for
at least 12 hours to make sure that
there aren't any leaks once you're
confident that your system has no leaks
shut off your PSU from the back and
proceed to remove the bridge from the 24
pin cable and plug that back into the
motherboard ladies and gentlemen you are
now ready for your first boot if you
follow my instructions carefully then
everything should light up and you have
built yourself a badass water-cooled PC
if you want to customize the RGB
lighting from the ek kit just download
the RGB software from your motherboards
driver page now I'm using the asus board
so I downloaded the Asus ARA and it
actually allows me to sync and change
all
the lighting that's connected to it so
after installing the ek kit I was able
to push my 78 20x to 4.7 gigahertz
compared to 4.6 using the courser h 150
I Pro and the best part is the CPU is
way cooler now playing fortnight on max
settings in 4k resolution I was
averaging between 45 to 55 degrees
Celsius if you guys remember on my last
build this exact same CPU was averaging
75 to 80 degrees with a lower clock
speed that's 30 degrees cooler guys
using the ek kit that's huge
aside from the crazy low temps you also
get a much quieter PC this is actually
how it sounds like while gaming
so that wraps up my build guide on how
to water cool your PC using the ek RGB
360 kit I hope you guys enjoyed the
video if you did or if you at least
learned something from it dropping a
like would be awesome I really
appreciate it because it took me seven
they used to put this entire video
together it was a lot of work and I've
been it for you guys also I'm gonna be
rebuilding my current PC big red which
is back at home using this case because
when I was building in it I absolutely
fell in love with it I think it looks
badass it's currently my favorite case
and I think it's gonna look dope on my
desk so make sure to stick around for
that because it's coming up in the next
few months also I'll jump a link below
if you guys want to check out the ek
liquid cooling kit and for the people
that stuck around to the end of this
video you guys set through I think this
video is over 20 minutes long or
something crazy if you sat through this
entire video then I want to award your
patience so I'm actually doing a
giveaway on the ek 240 kit this is
worldwide you can live anywhere on this
planet even on different planets I'll
find a way to ship it to you all you
guys have to do is visit my Instagram
account and comment on the post with
this PC featured in it and let me know
in the comments what your specs are for
your current PC obviously I want to try
and make it as fair as possible so I'm
gonna give this kit away to someone that
can use it right now in their current PC
I will require a screenshot obviously
afterwards to confirm but anyways that's
it the link to my Instagram account with
the post is linked down below it so that
twice already anyways they you guys so
much for watching really do appreciate
it and I'll see you in the next video
