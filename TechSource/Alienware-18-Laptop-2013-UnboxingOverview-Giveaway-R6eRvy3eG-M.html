you a very special unboxing and giveaway
of the new Alienware m18 laptop you guys
asked for it so here it is so this
particular model that we are unboxing
goes for $24.99 they do come in a
variety of specs that start at just 2099
and you can even customize the right one
for you on their website I did include
some links in the description for those
I want to check it out this video is a
giveaway and we are going to give away
this laptop to one loyal subscriber so
definitely make sure to stay tuned for
the instructions on how to enter so once
you open the box you notice that there
is a good amount of foam padding so your
laptop does not arrive damaged down here
is the laptop itself and next to it are
the cables needed to charge the device
under a laptop you will find a few
things mostly paperwork so I'll try and
make a quick as possible first up you
got the Quick Start Guide then you got
some warranty information installation
disk and even a small brochure where
Alienware thanks you for being a
consumer and briefly states that their
goal is to provide us with the best pcs
ever made the model that you see here
has an Intel i7 2.4 gigahertz processor
that can be boosted up to 3.4 gigahertz
it has 8 gigabytes of RAM 750 gigabytes
of hard drive space and 2 nvidia geforce
gtx 770 m with a total of 3 gigabytes of
memory this laptop is also made out of
anodized aluminum shell reinforced by
magnesium alloy frame to protect the LED
display I personally think it matches
the Alienware theme very well and also
feels great when you are holding it for
gaming you gotta have an HD big screen
so obviously anywhere it gives you an 18
point 4 inch LED display with a
resolution of 1920 by 1080 P and on the
top they also included a 2 megapixel
front facing camera for face time along
with to digital microphones so let's
talk about the keyboard for a second so
the main keyboard is split into three
parts allowing you to customize the
color schemes for each area and this
time I only were included a trackpad
that lights up and you can also
customize the color on it they also
included a set of macro keys above the
10 key area and another 5 button macro
set on the left side of the keyboard
now here's what's cool there's also a
mode shift button on the top of the
macro
and what it does is it allows you to
shift modes up to three times allowing
for a total of 15 macros plus the four
that you have on the top right for a
total of 19 macro keys looking at the
left side of the laptop you will find
your headset headphone microphone ports
along with two USB 3.0 s one mini
DisplayPort and HDMI slot your power in
any Kingston lock if you don't want your
laptop to get jacked now on the other
side you will find your CD tray and SD
card reader two more USB threes and an
Ethernet port if you choose to connect
via cable so only where did decide to
remove the portable battery tray in the
back for some reason but the battery
fully charged will get you around 2
hours and 30 minutes for browsing the
web with Wi-Fi and for gaming it will
ask you around 1 hour and 50 minutes
just because it has dual video cards and
they also kept the same vent design
allowing the hot air to escape in the
back while playing so it does not
interfere with your hands so that pretty
much wraps up the unboxing and overview
of the Alienware 18 you can't call it an
alienware without the light so with that
said let's move on to the main event
thanks for watching the video if you
want to win this amazing laptop you have
to complete two requirements the first
part is to comment like and subscribe

Facebook page the link is listed in

winner on September 30th this is the
