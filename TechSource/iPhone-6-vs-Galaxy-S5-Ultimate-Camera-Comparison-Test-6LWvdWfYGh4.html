coverage is cell cashier com they
compared iPhone prices on the internet
and give you a quick coat and the most
cash for your iPhone so go ahead and
check them out it's simple fast and
secure hey guys it's ed once again from
Texas and today we're going to do
another camera comparison this time
between the iPhone 6 and the galaxy s5
but Before we jump into samples let's
take a quick look at their camera specs
so rival six has an eight megapixel rear
facing camera with an aperture of 2.2
the maximum resolution they can shoot in
is 1080p and some notable camera
features include cinematic video
stabilization 60fps while recording in
1080p exposure control and slow-motion
video at 240fps cs5 on the other hand
has a 16 megapixel camera with an
aperture of 2.2 as well
unlike the 6 it can shoot videos in 4k
resolution and some notable features of
the s5 include ISO control digital image
stabilization and night mode lastly the
iPhone 6 has a 1.2 megapixel
front-facing camera while the s5 has a
2.1 megapixel front facing camera and
with that being said let's sit back
relax and take a look at some samples I
hope you guys enjoy the video
what does it be guys it at from Texas
and this is a video test between these
two phones there will be an audio icon
either on the top right or top left of
the screen notifying you which phone's
being used at the time also all phones
are strapped to one device so they are
equally balanced if the phones have 4k
capabilities then it is enabled for the
test after all it is a video comparison
and the point of this video is to show
what each phone is capable of which
means putting them on its highest
settings
so unfortunately like the iPhone 5s the
iPhone 6 also does not have autofocus
during video recording as you can
clearly see here I'm not sure what's
taking apples so long to implement this
very useful feature in their phones but
it's getting really annoying to have to
focus every time by tapping on the
screen which is what I'm doing here the
speed at which it manually focuses is
also kind of slow compared to other
phones I'm trying to focus as fast as
possible here between the two figures
and you can clearly tell that it's
taking a few seconds
I honestly expect that Apple's who have
improved this by now the galaxy s5 as
well does not have an auto focusing
feature during record mode which means
that you have to manually tap on the
screen to focus when needed like I am
doing here however I did notice that the
s5 has a much faster focusing speed than
the 6
I am constantly focusing between the two
objects here as fast as possible and if
you look closely you can really tell the
difference
anyways that concludes the camera test
between the iPhone 6 and the Galaxy s5
it's a pretty hard decision to decide
which one did a better job because both
phones are great and bad at certain
shots for example the Galaxy s5 was
atrocious at low-light conditions and
the pictures were just awful and I don't
want to even start on the video part of
that I'm sure we can both agree that the
six wins hands down in that category but
for night shots with flash I have to
give it to the galaxy s5 for pulling out
stunning pictures and you can really see
what I'm talking about from these two
pictures here both at a great job during
the day and indoor shots so I will leave
it to you to decide which phone did the
best and why you can't just pick a phone
because you hate the other that's not
how it works here I want to read
legitimate reasons why you made your
decision so make sure you guys leave
them in the comment section I will be
responding to the comments and once
again thanks for watching I will see you
in the next video so before I go I
wanted to share an awesome website with
you guys cell CARICOM is a site where
you can sell your iPhone for the highest
dollar amount so I'll guess your only
purchases iPhones and they currently
operate in the United States they do
accept although iPhones listed on its
page simply visit their website get a
quote ship your iPhone and get paid it's
simple fast and most importantly secure
you can either have them send you a
check or get paid directly through
PayPal here is a list of their current
prices and you can compare it to their
competitors so if you have an iPhone
that you want to sell don't go anywhere
else because cell cachet will pay you
the most this is at pump tech source and
I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
