today we're gonna be taking a look at
the msi ages TI which is the bigger
brother of the agus that i reviewed on
the channel a few months back if you
guys somehow miss that i'll drop a link
to it down below I think we can all
agree when I say aesthetically this
thing is a complete eyesore msi claims
improved cooling performance which I did
find to be true by a few degrees but
couldn't we have gotten something that
appeals to consumers outside of the age
25 so the front is where you will find a
DVD drive 2 USB 3.0 10 gigabit ports USB
type-c port audio jacks and an HDMI
pass-through for VR and finally an
overclock button that will boost both
clock and fan speeds you may wanna put
on a seat belt
where is RGB lighting wrapped around the
front and the aggressive design is
carried all around the case awkward is
the best word I can come up with to
describe its looks a mess I did at least
include a sturdy metal handle for when
you're moving the ages around moving
down onto the second platform and yes
there are platforms we can see the 850
watt 80 + platinum power supply as well
as 2 3.5 inch hard drive bays I actually
like the placement of these bays I don't
have to disassemble anything when I need
to add extra storage in the near future
our testing unit includes an Intel Core
i7 6700 K 32 gigs of DDR 4 Ram clocked
at 21 33 megahertz we have 2 msi gtx
1070 s we also have 2 m dot 2 drives in
raid 0 with a total space of 500 gigs as
well as a 2 terabyte hard drive needless
to say this thing devoured all of the
benchmarks i threw at it so let's go
ahead and take a look at the results
the performance area of course is off
the charts with such Opie hardware
inside but what really caught me
off-guard was the lack of improvement
attempts I thought I would see from what
msi calls their silent storm cooling
there are separate chambers that cool
different components and although there
could have been a positive effect from
this design I am only able to draw
conclusions based on the temperatures
from similar build I've had in the past
the numbers are very similar with the
only improvements being seen with the
GPUs now because MSI separated the cards
from the other components they were able
to boost up to 1800 megahertz for a
longer time compared to the more
traditional case design MSI ships the
computer with a few game focused
applications all of which can be
uninstalled by the user MSI's gaming
center is the only one I kept in our
testing machine and through here you can
create custom profiles that have
different color themes audio profiles
and even overclocking settings so how
much of a premium is MSI charging for
the ages versus how much the hardware
actually costs if you were to go out
there and build a PC yourself naturally
I went on to new egg and Amazon inspect
out a computer as close as possible to
this one parts like the computer case
and the custom motherboard I obviously
couldn't match but nevertheless the
total came out to just about 2,100 the
price of the Aegis I have here hovers
over $3,000 depending on where you look
for me the design and convenience factor
is not worth that markup honestly I
suggest anyone that's looking to buy
this PC to look at a few how to build
guides and build one for themselves
the money that you could be saving can
be put towards to 1080s and even other
possible upgrades with its unique design
chamber cooling and beastly hardware
this thing is nothing to take lightly
MSI has definitely build one hell of a
machine here but honestly the price is a
bit steep compared to what you can do by
building your own machine that's pretty
much it for the video thank you guys so
much for watching if you want to check
out the msi ages TI i'll drop a link to
it down below as always i'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
