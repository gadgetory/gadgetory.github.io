and welcome to my desk setup tour early
2016
I've made quite a number of changes
since last year so without wasting any
more time let's begin so everything I
mentioned in this video will be listed
down below in the order that they appear
so it's easier for you guys to find them
but let's start off with my PC that's
powering this setup this is big red my
custom painted and modded PC running on
a 49 30 K which are overclocked to 4.5
gigahertz and a gtx titan ex i upgraded
from 2 780ti s2 to 980 TI s and then
made the jump to to Titan X's only to
realize that it was overkill and the
performance difference was marginal so I
took the other one out and kept only one
the custom Titan X backplate is from the
guys at v1 Tech and actually most of my
monthly PC builds usually feature
products from them because they do such
an amazing job well like I said I'll
have links below if anyone is interested
apart from that I have 32 gigabytes of
Corsair Dominator Platinum's 512
gigabytes of storage and raid 0 on both
of my Samsung 850 pros and 250 gigabytes
of space on my Asus radar PCIe SSD
packed inside the NZXT s340 case making
our way towards the left is where my new
docking station for my iPhone 6s plus is
located this is one of my newer
additions to my setup that I actually
featured in my cool tech on their 54
February I picked this one up because it
not only looks cool but it can also
support my iPhone even with a bulky case
on finding a charging dock is extremely
hard since most of the stands don't
support bulky cases I love having my
phone stand because not only does it
keep my phone juiced up all day but I
can see any notifications as they appear
on my phone by next to that under my
monitor I have the new anchor sound core
Bluetooth speaker that actually replaced
my previous anchor premium speaker 90%
of the time I'm always wearing
headphones but the 10% is when I'm
actually shooting a video and I'm always
listening to music otherwise I just
can't focus it just gets me in the mood
the sound core is really loud and has
extremely crispy sound with a clear base
the battery life is also pretty
incredible now it states that it can
last up to 24 hours on a single charge
which is actually really accurate from
what I've experienced overall it's an
excellent sounding Bluetooth speaker
that's not overpriced speaking of sound
over to the left of my monitor is where
my voiceover setup is located I have the
scarlett 2i2 audio interface which is
hooked up to my C m25 condenser
microphone that actually came with the
package I also have the newer boom arm
attached so that I can position a
microphone at an angle that's
comfortable for voiceovers on top of the
interface I attached the transcend as
the card reader which is extremely
convenient when transferring audio and
video files after I've done recording
the headphones I used to monitor my
sound are the popular a THM 50 X's which
have custom skins on to better match my
theme these are from the brands and they
actually have skins for the m-40 X's the
M 50 s and a bunch of other devices like
smartphones gaming consoles laptops and
more so if you guys want to pimp out
your devices make sure to check out the
first link down below so when I'm not
using my headphones they are resting on
the Thermaltake headphone hanger which
isn't flashy or anything it just looks
cool and well it's black and red
speaking of headphones I do have two
other pairs resting on my anchor
headphone hanger underneath my desk
which are the HyperX cloud 2 gaming
headset and these so drop Bluetooth
headphones the hyper X's are usually
what I wear most of the time just
because they are so damn comfortable I
use them for watching movies listening
to music and especially gaming whereas I
use the snowdrops for when I have to
move away from my desk over the years
there has always been something missing
from my setup
until recently I have finally added some
personality the acoustic films that I've
attached on the walls not only absorb
sound which helps improve the overall
sound quality my voiceovers
but also goes well with my black and red
setup in the center I've mounted my most
prized possession the silver play button
awarded for surpassing 100,000
subscribers I've mounted that directly
above my monitor to constantly remind me
that I'm in the right path it's more of
a motivational piece than anything
really it reassures me that I'm doing
something right I've also spent hours
trying to make everything symmetrical
and parallel with each other since I
have major OCD another Neeley addition
to my setup which also contributes to my
personality is this bottle ladies and
gentleman which you are looking at here
is one of the very few black vodka
drinks in the world hence the name black
odd since I was born in Moscow Russia
and I love drinking vodka what a better
way to represent myself
than with a black and red vodka bottle
unfortunately this wasn't available in
the States so I had to get it imported
from the UK and I want to give you huge
thanks to my buddy Ashe Taylor for
helping me get two bottles of this and
I'll drop a link to his channel down
below so you guys can go over and thank
him for me the bottle is resting on top
of my game of Thrones coaster not
because it's black and red but because I
happen to represent House Targaryen on
Game of Thrones if you guys watch the
show let me know which house you
represent in the comments section down
below onto the gaming peripherals I use
the Corsair strafe RGB keyboard and the
Logitech MX master mouse which sits on
top of an extended mousepad which
actually recently replaced my reflex
mousepad as you can see there are no
logos anywhere on this mousepad which
was the main reason why I replaced my
previous one I definitely prefer a
cleaner look so thank you to whoever it
was on Twitter that showed me these
finally the monitor that I'm using is
none other than the 34 inch ultra wide
curved monitor from LG I went from a
triple monitor setup to a dual 4k
monitor setup and then to this I had the
monitor since June 2015 and I absolutely
love it since I did a review on this
back then I've never looked back that
34:40 by 1440p resolution is perfect for
me when it comes to editing since I can
fit everything on the same screen my
productivity has increased dramatically
now even though it has a 60 Hertz
refresh rate I still use it to play
games in fact I've been really addicted
to blade and soul recently so I've been
playing that for hours each day without
a problem
I also have it mounted on the ergo tech
freedom arm which allows me to position
it at practically any angle I want no
setup is complete without LEDs now I've
used some really crappy ones in the past
that either fall off after some time or
just die out but these these are the
best and I can say that with certainty
because they are not cheap I had these
since April of 2015 and they have given
me zero problems but what I love about
these LEDs other than their amazing
quality is the fact that you can control
them right from your smartphone or
tablet any setup can be made to look
good on top but what about underneath
the desk I recently spent the entire
night and completely redone my cable
management I actually have a video on
cable management that will give you guys
tips and tricks and you can find a link
to it down below as well if it's already
uploaded but what I basically did was
attach a long cable Raceway on the roof
my desk and ran the wires through
they're using some cable clips to keep
everything organized and hidden I also
used some 3m tape and attach the power
strip and power brakes against the roof
so that they are not visible what I love
about the surge protector that I use for
my cable management is that it also
comes with built-in USB ports which I
can use to charge devices my iPhone
charging dock is actually connected to
it I only have one wire plugs into the
wall which is the surge protector and
the reason why it's hanging down like
that is because my desk is motorized and
I need cable slack so that it can be
retracted as my desk Rises but overall
I'm 100% satisfied with my cable
management and more details on how I fix
my cables will be in that video so make
sure you guys stick around so my
question to you guys is this is my setup
worthy of the seal of approval be honest
and let me know by voting using the
strawpoll link in the description
section also let me know what you guys
think of my setup anything you would
change or modify feel free to critique
me as I have done on my setup boards I
promise I won't ban you anyways that
will do it for this video thank you guys
so much for watching if you enjoyed it
make sure to hit that like button and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
