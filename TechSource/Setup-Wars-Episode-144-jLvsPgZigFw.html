and welcome to setup wars episode 144
where you cement your desk setup to get
featured on the channel if you guys want
to participate you know what to do make
sure to watch the video linked below but
with that said let the setup wars begin
starting off the episode is Dave from
the Netherlands and his manga inspired
setup that he uses for gaming streaming
and Photoshop I don't know what anime
that's from but it appears he's going
for a similar color scheme with green
and pink he's walking a 27-inch lg
monitor that's sitting on top of the
riser that he built himself and below
that on the desk we got the courser Gear
K 65 luxe RGB and the glaive RGB Mouse I
gotta give you points on that cable
management on the left side we have a
skin the Nintendo switch and the
splatoon controller which actually
matches the color scheme and will serve
an Xbox one as controller for audio dave
is using the SteelSeries Octus v gaming
headset which is hanging from the side
of his drawer and we also got some
speakers two clips speakers on the top
shelf which is actually a nice place to
hide them and a Sony subwoofer on the
bottom I don't have any complaints on
the cable management I mean everything
is off the ground thanks to the built-in
rack from the IKEA Mackay desk
and finally the PC powering it all is a
custom-built Rison build featuring
horizon 5 1600 X and an msi gtx 1070 i
also like how you split the colors on
the RGB strips to be half green and half
pink just like the color scheme the
setup looks very clean the only minor
adjustment i can give you is for the
controller's maybe just put them in your
drawer if you're not using them or at
the very least pick up a charging dock
so the controller has a dedicated place
on your desk this one on amazon costs
only 15 bucks and it has space for your
other two joy cons as well a job holding
below if anyone wants to check it out
other than that minor tweak this is an
awesome and very clean setup thank you
Dave for starting off the show fat jon
is up next with an insane triple monitor
setup featuring two BenQ gaming monitors
and an Acer predator
that are hooked up to the wall-e desk
mount it's obvious at this point he's
going with a black and red color scheme
and I really liked the painted IKEA lack
shelves in red but I feel like that kind
of throws off the color balance
I feel like red is more of an accent
color in this setup I feel like if the
backside of those shelves were painted
black and the horizontal shelves were
pane in red what I've actually fit the
color scheme a lot better that's just my
opinion I was so like that he went with
an extra wide table top to accommodate
not only all three of the monitors but
also the giant PC which is a beast by
the way an 8700 K and an msi 1080 Ti
inside the courser 780 t case I really
like the layout of the keyboard and
mouse he tilted the Razer Firefly on its
side so that he can route the cable
underneath his keyboard and he also
wrapped both the wires together using
velcro very very clean for audio he's
rocking a pair of Logitech speakers and
a subwoofer underneath the desk but he
does have a hyper X headset chilling on
a custom hanger I really liked that he
hooked up the surround sound remote
underneath the desk so that way whenever
he needs to use the headset all he has
to do is plug it in the cable management
is done really well also the power
strips are hooked up nicely
the wires are wrapped up together and
even the cables behind the monitors are
nicely routed well done this is actually
a really nice setup for a 15 year old
damn
thanks for entering and number three is
John from Singapore and his razor themed
setup that he uses for gaming and
editing video and music his loyalty to
razer is real all the peripherals are
from Razer apart from the obvious Razer
keyboard mouse and mouse pad he's also
using eraser hammerhead earphones and
even the PC case is the Razer edition of
the H 440 the only thing missing are the
razer kraken headphones sound bar and a
microphone to complete the razer
collection sandwich king the x 340 prism
ultra-right are a pair of Presonus a 5
speakers for monitoring audio and that's
pretty much everything on the desk all
the essentials he needs to game and edit
nothing more and nothing less
under the desk he's hooked up a few
Signum racks to hold up all the wires
and finally the PC pairing at all has a
700 and an asus strix 1070 TI
it's a pretty straightforward setup for
gaming and productivity nothing fancy
going on here but at the same time it's
not super simple thank you John for
entering this next contestant needs no
introduction he is no stranger to setup
words in fact this is the third time
he's actually been on the show normally
I don't accept previous applicants
unless they have significantly improved
their setup
well that so happens to be the case this
time as well I'm not gonna go over all
the tech in this setup because most of
it is the same and you guys can watch
episodes 84 and 116 if you want to see
everything so it looks like the Asus
ultra whites and the peripherals are all
the same however the layout of the setup
is different I think he actually moved
the entire setup on the opposite side of
the wall because if you saw the last
episode the curtains were actually only
the left side and now it's on the right
other than the new layout he did change
up the wall designs of bits we now have
a giant plaque of the ROG logo that was
designed similar to the Porsche logo I'm
guessing it's because he owns a Porsche
Macan or Masson not even how you say
that and they even gave him a symbol
with his name on it if I had to guess
the two things that lock is most into
its Porsche pin a Supes I just have a
hunch sandwiching the giant plaque are
two banners that says respect all and
fear none he actually said that in the
notes that it represents himself that he
shows respect to everyone but he doesn't
fear anything are you telling me that
you don't have any ounce of fear sitting
in front of that giant plaque what if
one day comes slamming down on both of
the monitors and hits the side of your
face will you fear then I'm just kidding
it looks very stable it might be even
super light you know the hell do I know
one of my favorite things about this
dual setup has to be the desk it's
extremely wide it's actually custom-made
with a glossy finish and despite it
being very long
there is no bowing in the center and
that's mostly thanks to it being
wall-mounted and lastly we can't forget
the RGB ROG logo on the ceiling which is
still there the computer is powering
both setups are mostly the same however
the first PC on the ground has a
like upgrade from a 68 50k to an i-9
7900 X it also looks like he picked up a
new laptop he said the last one was too
heavy and bulky for business trips so he
sold it and he bought the GX 501 instead
good choice some really nice
improvements to an already FX setup
Thank You Locke for entering wrapping up
the video is URI from Israel and his
setup that's used for gaming and
photography he was actually featured in
episode 124 and he listened to all my
recommendations and improved his setup
and well now he's back again he's
actually improved a lot on his setup and
I'm very impressed so the first thing I
noticed is the wall he took apart most
of the acoustic panels and he added a
landscape painting over it which I think
looks way cleaner he also listened to my
advice and picked up a boom arm for his
blue yeti microphone
I guess he replaced the Razer siren
microphone he had before and then our
movement from before was the headphone
placement he actually picked up the same
headphone hanger I recommended and he
routed the cable behind the desk this
time and straight into the PC using some
cable clips see I told you this will
look a lot cleaner nicely done you also
put the SD card underneath the desk
closer to you instead of leaving it on
the desk so nice job there the cable
management was great last time so
nothing different this time around he
did a really good job keeping everything
nice and tidy underneath the desk I
think the biggest upgrade from last time
has to be the PC he switched from the
nasty Christmas colour scheme to a black
and red with grey accents to complement
the setup and he also went soft tubing I
much prefer this new system over the
last one you had even if it is soft
tubing it looks so much better nicely
done
the only minor recommendation I
recommend is routing the mouse wire
underneath the keyboard now you can
leave as much slack as you want but I
feel like if you combine the mouse wire
with the keyboard wire it will look so
much cleaner but it's not a huge deal
and I'm still very impressed with all
the changes you have done you even hit
the ps4 pearl underneath the desk and I
just noticed that you know it's examples
like these why I still do the show I
love helping people improve their setup
even if it is to improve its light
and a lot of you guys actually get ideas
from looking at other people's setup and
that's kind of the purpose of the entire
show so and I also love reading your
feedback in the comments section so then
guess so much for the amazing support I
feel like the community is really
awesome and I'm really really happy to
be a part of it but anyways with that
said Thank You Yuri for entering
make sure you guys drop your comments
below and vote on who you think has the
best that's setup I'll announce it on my
Instagram page thank you guys so much
for watching as always I'll try being
set up boards more consistently I'll try
and do it every single Monday if I can
it just been pretty crazy here at the
headquarters but anyways love you guys
thank you so much and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
