and this is portal my very first
powerful mini ITX build on the channel
how powerful you might ask well I threw
in a 7700 ka 16 gigs of ram from g.skill
and packed it with a massive 10 80 TI
from Asus this thing is no joke it's
long and thick that's what she said
seriously though it barely fits inside
the case but more on that later I'm also
using the a cz 270 i motherboard because
it's packed with a bunch of features
it supports overclocking features four
SATA ports dual PCIe gen3 and two
support for raid configurations Wi-Fi
connectivity it's got three four pin fan
connectors and it even has RGB for
storage I'm using a one terabyte hard
drive from Western Digital for mass
storage however the main drive that runs
the OS is an MDOT two SSD from a pacer
which I picked up really cheap and
finally the power supply I had to go
with was the Corsair SF 600 because the
standard ATX power supplies do not fit
inside this case
and speaking of case this is a very
interesting mini ITX chassis it's unique
for several reasons reason number one is
it doesn't have a side panel and instead
the clear panel is actually near the top
showing out the GPU and only the GPU but
I do have a version without a clear
panel second reason is the motherboard
layout is inverted and sadly that's the
only option available and finally you
can actually separate the case giving
you access to the key components inside
my initial reaction while I was building
inside this case was holy crap this
thing looks awesome it's basically like
a transformer case I love it it is my
favorite media attacks case by far well
after the excitement's died down and I
finished building the PC and played
around with it for a while I realized
that the pull out method was just a
gimmick isn't the pull out method always
a gimmick so yeah here's a problem that
I ran into after finishing the build
it tilts and it doesn't really matter
what parts you've used once you pull out
the tray - at least halfway out it's
gonna tip over because it's lacking
support to balance so doesn't that kind
of defeat the purpose of having a case
that you can pull out if it's just gonna
tip over
also not to mention that you need to
remove two thumb screws from the back in
order to pull it out and actually one of
the thumb screws is blocked off by the
PSU cable so you can't even use a
screwdriver to remove it you're just
gonna have to use your fingers in the
hopes that is not over tightened I mean
don't get me wrong I still love this
case it's actually still my favorite
mini ITX case out there because the
design is really awesome it looks really
cool on any desk you put it on and I had
so much fun building inside of it for
several reasons everything was really
easy to install there was plenty of
space to hide the cables everything was
just easily within reach it's got two
hard drive bays and one SSD trade near
the top and both the USB 3.0 ports are
on its side speaking of cable management
I decided to go with the white
extensions to match the white and black
team but soon after I realized that it
was a stupid idea since you can't even
see any of it because of the extensions
I had a lot of extra cable slack to work
with making the cable management a bit
difficult thankfully though I had the
entire bottom slot of the hard drive bay
which I wasn't using to route and hide
the cables in if you're gonna get this
case and used up both of the hard drive
bays then sadly you're gonna have a
tough time managing cables that's for
sure I even had to route some cables on
the exterior of the case since there was
no more room inside and thankfully there
was still some clearance left on the
sides of the case which let me barely
slide it back inside the only real
clearance issue I had was the gravis
card the Strix 1080 Ti is noticeably
thicker than the 1060 and 1070 and
because of that the corner of the shroud
scrapes against the case as I slide it
in and out so if we can use the same
card inside this case it's gonna fit but
barely and it's gonna scrape your GPU
every time you slide it in and out all
right so let's talk temps I had some
mixed feelings about them because these
7700 K easily hits 5 gigahertz at 1.3
volts I've actually done it unto of my
other 7700 K chips but this one in
particular runs a bit harder for some
reason not only did I not achieve the 5
gigahertz clock speed but the temps are
in the high
80s during full load so I had to knock
it down to 4.8 gigahertz at one point 25
volts instead to keep the temps under 80
degrees so I either have a bad CPU or a
bad cooler the thing is I've used the
120 X before which kept my 6700 K really
cool on the Trigon build so I know that
these coolers are great from deep cool I
just think I got very unlucky this time
around however I did overclock the ram
and GPU as well I was only able to push
the Strix 10 atti a little under 50 mega
hertz on the core clock and almost 200
megahertz on the memory for the most
part the case isn't closed but there are
fangirls located on all four corners of
the case to provide some airflow and
there's even a concave near the top
which lets additional hot air escape
from the back 4-5 spec benchmarks that
scored 22,000 167 putting this right
below the titania build i did back in
january which had to tighten axes
alright so with all of that out of the
way here is what this pc can do in 4k
gaming in max settings let's check out
the benchmarks
I'm definitely happy with the way this
bill turned out it's powerful portable
and looks amazing on any desk they do
have a black version as well and I'll
drop a link to all the parts using this
PC down below if you guys enjoy my
monthly PC bills leaving a like really
helps me out a ton thank you so much for
watching as always I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
