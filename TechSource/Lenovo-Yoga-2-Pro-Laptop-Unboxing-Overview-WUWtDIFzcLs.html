and today we are going to be taking a
look at the Lenovo yoga 2 pro the
convertible two-in-one PC so they named
it yoga because this device can fold
into many positions which I will go over
in this video and there are a few models
that you can choose from that range from
an Intel Core i3 all the way up to a
core i7 with different memory and hard
drive space so I happen to pick up the
base core i3 model just to show you guys
a product and I will leave links in the
description section for pricing and
availability so opening up the box you
can find the yoga2pro inside this black
cloth it actually looks similar to the
surface pro 3 that I also unboxed
earlier on my channel and it's made out
of the same material similar design
except it has a keyboard attached to it
whereas the surface pro 3 does not in
these compartments you will find the
power cable which is needed to connect
to the power brick to charge the yoga 2
and they state that it's supposed to
last up to 9 hours on a single charge
which is pretty damn good for an
ultrabook if you ask me
ultra ebooks are becoming very popular
and it seems to be the choice for most
students instead of a traditional laptop
but what is the difference between a
laptop and an ultrabook you might be
asking well ultra ebooks are more geared
towards mobility whereas laptops are
more towards gaming and editing with a
dedicated graphics card ultra ebooks
don't have a CD or DVD drive and they
use SSDs which is why they're always
much lighter than laptops so taking a
look at the side of the yoga 2 we can
see the charging port USB 3.0 slot HDMI
and the SD card reader on the opposite
side there is another USB 3.0 a
headphone port volume rockers and a
button that controls the automatic
orientation feature further down the
same side you will find the power button
to power on the Ultrabook one downside
to ultrabooks however is the fact that
they rely heavily on the Internet
unlike some laptops that can connect to
3G networks ultrabooks have to be
connected via Wi-Fi overall the design
is great it's super light compact and as
I said earlier it can last up to nine
hours on a single charge making this
ultra book an awesome choice for travel
now it's called yoga for a reason you
can fold the ultra book in two different
positions into a total of four modes if
you fold the completely
all the way like this you get tablet
mode the keyboard is disabled in this
mode and you can use the Ultrabook well
just like a tablet then you have the
basic laptop mode which is well
self-explanatory and then there are two
other modes for basically watching
movies one is called the stand mode and
the other is the tent mode there is no
real difference between the two Lenovo
just designed these two modes to give
you more options on how to watch movies
depending on the surface you are using
all right so let's talk about pixels the
yoga to sports a 13.3 inch LED screen
with a resolution of 3200 by 1800
needless to say that the images look
stunning I was also impressed with the
viewing angle you can definitely have a
few friends around you while watching a
video an experience wouldn't be that
much different as far as lag is
concerned it is definitely present
that's for sure again this is the base
core i3 model so I don't expect complete
smoothness it's especially obvious when
zooming in and out of webpages
and it is even worse when it comes to
multitasking now let's take a look at
the video playback and see if you can
handle 1080p and 4k video here is a
1080p video sample with maximum volume
the mic is placed about 1 feet directly
in front of the laptop
alright so with handle 1080p playback
very well now let's see how it does when
watching 4k content
I've already buffer this video 75% so it
does not interfere with loading the
video
so yeah it definitely can handle 4k
content and again it doesn't have a 4k
screen so you shouldn't be watching 4k
content on it anyways so what are my
thoughts on the yoga2pro
well I think it's a decent ultrabook at
best if I were to consider buying one I
would definitely pick up a core i7 model
or even a core i5 to have a much better
experience using the Ultrabook I
definitely hate lag with a passion when
comparing it to other ultrabooks
this is actually a really great deal
considering the price per performance in
the end I'm not into laptops or
ultrabooks anyway so I'm definitely
going to have to pass but let me know
what you guys think about the yoga2pro
in the comments section down below is it
something you guys might consider buying
let me know anyways thanks for watching
the video this is that from tech source
and I'll see you guys in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
