episode of set-up wars the first 500 of
my subscribers to use the link below
will get a 2 month free trial yes guys I
know trust me I know the madelief panels
in the back are not symmetrical I know
there's gonna be a bunch of people in
the comment section what are you doing
which trust me I know that and the
reason why is because it's missing a few
panels I've ordered them they're coming
and once I install them they're gonna be
perfectly symmetrical but I did change
up the background a little bit in case
you guys haven't noticed number 1 I
installed more leaf panels of course
number 2
that cable running down from one of the
panels is no longer there because I know
I was driving a lot of you guys crazy
trust me it was driving me crazy as well
I took care of that and moved it all the
way to the far left side so that way you
guys can see it and finally I added
three lie fix RGB strips underneath the
wall just to kind of give it a nice glow
but yeah so far I think is looking
pretty good what do you guys think let
me know in the comment section down
below as they log intro let's just let's
just get started
welcome to set of four is episode 158
which means there are two more episodes
left for everyone's favorite episode of
the worst set up edition but anyways
yeah what that said let the set up wars
begin
I don't want to give huge things to
Skillshare for sponsoring this video
Skillshare is an online learning
community for creators with more than
25,000 classes in design business and
pretty much anything you can think of I
know you guys like my PC build guides
but there's a class on there that
actually goes more in-depth on how to
design and build your own PC what I like
about this course is the fact that he
goes over how to select your parts and
he explains everything in detail so not
only do you learn the process of
building but you also learn how to
troubleshoot pcs if problems arise the
premium membership gives you unlimited
access to courses like this so you can
join the classes and communities that
are right for you and your new year
goals it's also really affordable
after the free trial is just less than
$10 a month
the first 500 my subscribers to click on
the link below will get a free two month
trial we haven't seen a music production
setup in a while on the show so we're
gonna kick off the episode with a
beautiful one from alexey coming from
new jersey other than music production
sessions on his twitch channel he uses
this setup for gaming I really like how
he made good use of the space with all
of that gear
he built a riser using the IKEA wall
shelf for both of the d√°il monitors and
he even installed a pullout drawer
underneath the desk for all three of his
launch pads for peripherals he's rocking
a cooler master keys light L keyboard
and mouse combo you know despite having
a pullout drawer under the desk you can
still drill a hole for the keyboard and
mouse wire you just have to use a cable
clip to keep the wire against the desk
but I'm assuming he didn't want to cut a
hole in his mouse pad so it's all good
placing the speaker's on those stands is
actually a great idea compared to
mounting it on the wall because they
won't interfere with the acoustic foams
by the way side note I really like the
design and I'm also impressed that
you're able to keep those foams so white
usually they turn a yellow after a few
weeks so you got some really good ones
there sandwich in both monitors is the
complete audio interface which has the
MXL 770 microphone hooked up to it using
the rode boom arm and underneath the
desk we got a pair of audio technica m4
TX's cables are managed beautifully
using a couple sleeves to wrap the cable
going into the cable box on the floor
although I'm curious as to why that one
cable is not included inside the sleeve
the rest of the cables are routed
through the channel Raceway and we have
a bunch of cable clips helping out down
here is the PC which has a 67 GK 32 gigs
of ram and diesel tank gtx 1060 i like
that you made an effort to keep with the
white and black color scheme like adding
a GPU backplate with white fans but
there are some other things you can do
to spice up the pc like SSD covers
custom sleeve cables and of course an a
i/o sleeping kit for the cooler if you
do end up spicing it up with those I do
recommend removing your PC from the
ground and placing it on an Alex your
next to your setup otherwise it kind of
defeats the purpose of having a
see-through side panel if it's just
gonna sit underneath your desk you know
I really like all the small
modifications here and there to make
everything accessible and convenient I
think that a great job building
something that works for you and what
you do well done and thank you for
entering coming in hard from the dark
side is Hans and his epic triple monitor
setup that he uses for pretty much
everything from gaming productivity
editing and crypto mining that's right
guys this is technically a dual setup
the Left PC is actually a server with a
rising 3 and an EVGA GTX 1080 while the
other PC has a 6700 K 32 gigs of ram and
2 EVGA GTX 1080s so we have the Acer X
34 in the center sandwiched by 2 27-inch
BenQ monitors and they are all mounted
against the wall but what I want you
guys to look at is how he routed the
cables because he did such a clean job
so he basically grouped all the wires
using velcro straps and he ran them
across the wall and straight down behind
the Alex drawer the rest of the wires
are channeled through a couple raceways
and since both of the PCs are hooked up
to the same monitors he has a port
switch on there here so that he can swap
his mouse and keyboard with a click of a
button speaking of which I would rather
run the mouse wire underneath the
keyboard since you already drilled a
hole in the desk for it but it's not a
big deal
picking up a few stands for your phones
would also be a great idea and
leaving them flat on your mousepad this
way you're also able to look at
notifications as they come through
there's a bunch of them on Amazon that
can do the job but here's one that cost
fifteen dollars and it can hold two
phones you can actually place this
underneath your monitor in the center
since you like to keep things
symmetrical anyways
I'll drop a link below if you want to
check it out and finally for audio we
only got a pair of Mac ECR four speakers
just barely making it on the desk you
know it's always recommended to position
the speaker's at ear level so I do
recommend picking up stands like these
which will help lift the speaker's 9
inches off the desk and you can even use
these isolation pads to prevent
distortion but they'll also allow you to
pick from five different angles
once again I'll drop a link below if you
want to check it out you didn't include
pictures of his old setup and it's quite
the improvement over the time but I'm
confident with some more minor tweaks
you can improve this set up even more
Thank You Hans for entering shutting
down the gears a bit we got a super
clean and minimalistic set up by Luciano
he uses this for gaming and productivity
I'm assuming productivity is priority
because of the ultra ride unfortunately
it's capped at only 60 Hertz maybe 75 if
you can overclock it for peripherals
he's using the Logitech G 810 or Eon
spectrum keyboard with the G fellow to
Mouse and I just love that little hole
he drilled for both the cables and he
even covered it very clean for audio
he's using my favorite pair of speakers
in the world
the Edifier Eclipse and he was smart
enough to pick up the HD version nice he
does have a gaming headset as well the
g930 threes which are hanging underneath
the desk and take a look at the wire
management ladies and gentlemen if this
doesn't give you any wood I don't know
what will first off he has a cable tie
on the left side holding up the wire for
his headset and moving over to the
opposite side we can see a memory card
reader for easy access and towards the
back or music to my ears
I love what he did with the channel
Raceway it's actually really smart so
instead of installing one large Raceway
he picked up three individual ones or
maybe he cut them into three pieces I'm
not really sure but this way he's able
to route the wires in between each one
instead of having the wire go over the
raceway I gotta give you mad props on
this mess
it looks way cleaner also down here we
got the PC powering it all which has the
7700 K paired with the gigabyte GTX 1080
and 16 gigs of RAM one thing I would
recommend is to bring the GPU to the top
PCI slot just to make sure using the
full potential of that card but you
might have your reasons for keeping it
down there I do however like that you
put something underneath your PC instead
of leaving it on carpet like I see
people do so many times on this show
also I just realized what a hell is
everything plugged in I don't see any
wires anywhere what sorcery is this is
there an outlet underneath your PC
because I do see a cable going in there
and I do see a cable going underneath
your door which is then plugged into the
outlet on the other side but I could be
wrong the only minor thing I would
recommend is raising the speaker's a
little bit now because of the color
scheme you got going on I do recommend
you do something like my setup back at
home where you can use IKEA wall shelves
and Capet the legs to raise them up well
like I said it's not a big deal and I'm
sure you wouldn't want to drill holes in
that beautiful desk oh and don't think I
didn't see that entire shelf of Predator
collectibles it's pretty obvious whose
side you're on
it's nice to take a break from the crazy
setups and look at something super clean
and minimalistic thank you Luciano for
entering well that didn't last long back
to crazy setups now this one is from now
or all the way from Israel and I'm so
sorry that butchered your name can we
just take a moment and look at the
wall-mounted
ps4 pro with both of his controllers all
right so this setup is used for gaming
streaming and programming and it's got
an interesting setup with three displays
so we've got an ace use 34 inch ultra
wide in the center and a secondary
monitor towards the left it looks like
both of them are mounted against the
wall and they're being used with the PC
the 50 inch TV from Samsung up top is
used for console gaming and most likely
watching videos below all that we got
the add-on unit from Ikea which looks to
be kind of supporting the monitors
weight but surprisingly the desk is not
bowing even though it's got a linen
tabletop so the add-on unit is great for
additional storage plus it can prop up
your monitor if you need a monitor riser
however in this situation I don't think
it's that useful because the left drawer
might have some clearance issues with
the
keyboard so you can't even open it all
the way making it somewhat useless but
the right one should be fine if you move
the mouse around I'm thinking those
custom white key caps on the corsage
wave keyboard by the way I think those
look very clean alright so for audio
he's only got a wireless headset from
Logitech which I'm assuming is used
mainly for the ps4 however I don't see
why he can't use it for his PC as well
either way I do recommend picking up
some speakers for this setup at some
point you can even put them next to your
monitor these over here cost $22 and
they have really high ratings on Amazon
and I think they go really well with
your setup so the acoustic panels kind
of seem out of place and I'm assuming
you put those there to cover up the
cable Raceway maybe add some spice to
the setup but to be honest is kind of
looking a bit bland going across like
that maybe go with some sort of design
like the first setup and you can also
pick up the white and blue foams so that
it matches your setup colors even better
I feel like the black kind of sticks out
the most since your setup is mostly
white cables are managed fairly well
thanks to the Signum rack so there's
nothing really to complain about here
and finally the PC powering everything
is a dope looking water-cooled rig it's
packing the 87 decay which is belated by
the way and overclocked to 5.1 gigahertz
a.m. we also got 60 gigs of ram and the
EVGA 1080 TI FTW three of that right
there
is a beast now here's one thing I would
do differently if this was my setup now
obviously white is the most dominant
color here and because of that the black
case seems out of place I would have
gone with the white version of the
crystal 460 X which I think personally
would have looked so much better with
the blue coolant and the black fittings
you could have even gone as far as to
replace the black fittings with white
ones if you really wanted to stay
consistent with the color scheme and
this way it would be a white and blue
setup with minor black accents but
anyways that's just my two cents and
everyone has their own preference and
tastes either way you got a killer set
up there Thank You naor for entering and
again I'm sorry if I butchered your name
wrapping up the episode is Worley and
his enemy theme setup rocking 3 LG
monitors that are mounted on the wall he
uses a setup for gaming as well as photo
and video and
the desk is made up of the IKEA lemon
top and to DIY cabinets one of which has
the PC inside and my first reaction is I
hope that PC doesn't have high temps
because there is no exhaust on the top
for the hot air to escape
despite the front being open I don't
think it's an issue considering the
specs but you know what I got a point
out those awesome RGB fans and you might
ask me Edie what's so special about
those fans well for starters it has an
RGB ring on both sides let me repeat
that guys both sides have RGB rings and
I've never seen that on a fan before so
regardless of how you position it you're
gonna get that RGB goodness sadly these
are not available in the US
why hasn't course our thought of these
already for peripherals he's using the
Kim a text to keyboard and Nutella Mouse
both of them are from a company called
RAC which I'm guessing are from the
Philippines because that is where Worley
is from Braulio he's got a pair of
Logitech Z 213 speakers and the Razer
Kraken pro v2 headset he does have a
siren microphone from Razer as well but
it doesn't seem to be a part of the
setup
our ladies waiting for a boo mom or
something there's not much going on in
this setup for me to recommend changes
it's pretty straightforward I would try
and put the PC on the right side of the
desk
because it does look like there's enough
room and also if you're going with an
order to be build with tempered glass
panels just to put the PC on the meet
your desk then what's the point of you
and having it pretty simple setup Thank
You Orly for entering it under the first
episode of setup wars as always makes
you guys vote down below in the comment
section and which of these setups is the
best it's actually a pretty tough
episode so let me know what you guys
decide I'll announce the winners as
always on my Twitter and it's the fail
accounts that you guys so much watching
drop a like if you liked the series and
a dislike if you didn't and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
