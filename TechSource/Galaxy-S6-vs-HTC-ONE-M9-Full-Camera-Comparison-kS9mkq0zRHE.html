One m9 is sponsored by cell cashier com
they compared iPhone prices on the
Internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iPhone what's up
guys it's ed back again from Texas and
welcome to another full detailed camera
test between the galaxy s6 and the HTC
One m9 but before we jump into the
samples let's take a quick look at their
specs the galaxy s6 and s6 edge both
have the same cameras which is a 16
megapixel rear-facing camera with an
aperture of 1.9 and I can shoot up to a
resolution of 4k at 30fps the m9 has a
twenty point seven megapixel rear facing
camera with an aperture of 2.2 and I can
also shoot up to 4k resolution at 30fps
for front-facing cameras both the Galaxy
phones have a five megapixel camera that
can shoot in 1440p at 30fps whereas the
four megapixel camera on the m9 can
shoot up to only 1080p at 30fps so
that's a photo specs now let's sit back
relax and enjoy the show
when it comes to focusing the galaxy s6
does a fantastic job no problems
whatsoever trying to focus the object
and the speed is insanely fast in my
last camera comparison it even beat the
iPhone 6 plus
Samsung has definitely improved this
feature greatly from their last year's
model the m9 on the other hand does a
decent job definitely not as fast as the
s6 but it does get the job done
regardless also there are times where
the camera would focus in and out a few
times to try and capture the object but
other than that it's pretty accurate for
daylight video the galaxy s6 takes some
stunning footage and quark a resolution
it has great colour reproduction and
just the overall video is a lot more
vivid and you also get a wider field of
view the m9 does a great job in 4k as
well with warmer colors and sharp
footage besides the annoying lens on the
m9 going in and out every so often while
filming I think both phones do a great
job at 4k recording however I am leaning
more towards the s6 for the point moving
to low-light video there's really not
much to be said here everyone knows that
the m9 flunks during low-light recording
so the obvious point goes to the galaxy
s6 with more clarity brightness and
overall sharper footage than the m9 what
does it be guys and welcome to the
stabilization test and the microphone
test between both of the phones that you
see on the screen and also make sure you
guys check out the audio icon somewhere
on the screen and it will basically tell
you which phone's microphone is being
used also all the phones are being shot
in 1080p to ensure optical image
stabilization is enabled if the phone
does have optical image stabilization
for stabilization and microphone quality
the s6 easily takes the point with a
much louder and clearer microphone audio
and buttery smooth stabilization the m9
doesn't stand a chance then again that's
expected since the m9 doesn't even have
optical image stabilization what is
going on HTC moving to daylight pictures
the m9 seems to have warmer colors
compared to the galaxy s6 and it also
seems to have slightly more exposure
value giving the colors a slight washed
out look whereas the galaxy s6 pictures
look more vibrant the dynamic range on
the s6 is
a lot better than the m9 the image looks
super crisp and you get a nice balance
of the shadows and highlights the Essex
even has a better front-facing camera
with a wider field of view which is a
good plus for taking selfies with larger
groups of people so for delight pictures
the s6 definitely deserves the point
moving indoors and away from the Sun the
s6 captures more detail in every picture
if you pay attention to the red cup you
can see the hefty logo in the middle and
the texture of the cup on the s6 shot by
the way it helps if you're watching my
camera comparisons full screen on a
monitor blacks are also very sharp on
the s6 this one is a bit harder to see
but there is an ext abbreviation right
below the PlayStation button and you can
see that on the s6 image and not on the
m9 dimming the lights a little bit is
where the m9 starts to struggle once
again the images become blurry and noisy
whereas the s6 maintains a great balance
thanks to its 1.9 aperture now let's
talk about the flash the s6 doesn't have
the best flash on a smartphone I have
concluded that on my previous camera
test video in fact the 6 plus has a
better overall flash but the s6 flash
certainly beats the m9 there is just too
much light coming out of the camera and
it completely washes out the image every
time especially when taking pictures of
light objects the reflection of light
certainly doesn't help either camera's
flash so the final verdict we pretty
much have a clear winner here I think
that the only thing the m9 does decent
is 4k video and daylight pics and even
then it's not better than the galaxy s6
I'm really disappointed in HTC this year
I think we all expected much more from
them but instead got a second-rate
smartphone so tohis that is it for the
video I really want to hear what your
