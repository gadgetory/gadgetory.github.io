and in this video I'm going to show you
step-by-step on how you can build
yourself a five hundred dollar gaming PC
with a fresh install of Windows this PC
will get you 60fps and high settings in
most games but if you want to see the
full benchmarks make sure to check out
the video I did on the channel and I'll
drop a link to it down below so first up
you will need the parts obviously I'll
link them all down below and it's also
nice to have some sort of a container to
keep the loose screws inside along with
a large surface area to work with and
finally the last thing you're going to
need is a screwdriver step one is to
take apart all of the side panels from
the case two on the sides and one on the
top there should be two thumb screws
holding each side panel together once
all of the schools are off pull out all
three of the side panels as I mentioned
before I recommend keeping these screws
in a separate container so that you
don't lose them take apart the tied
cables and remove the bag that has the
installation screws inside pull out the
motherboard box and take out the
following the i/o shield Wi-Fi module
connector two SATA cables two antennas
and of course the motherboard itself
remove the board from the plastic bag
but keep the pink foam underneath it and
place it on top of the box we're going
to install the CPU next so take that out
of the box along with a stock heatsink
you don't need to apply thermal paste
because the cooler already comes pre
applied with some as you can see however
if you're using a cooler and don't have
thermal paste on it then you need to buy
one and put some on the CPU I did leave
a link to a really good thermal compound
down below that I use for all of my
builds grab the CPU from the sides do
not touch the surface of the CPU
otherwise it will pick up some dirt and
oil from your fingers align the CPU so
that the gold triangle on the processor
matches with the black triangle on the
socket cover once you figured out the
orientation pop open a CPU cover by
pressing down on the lever and gently
lay the CPU on the socket whatever you
do do not apply any force it should
easily fall in place once the CPU falls
in place make sure that it is fully
seated and you can do that by checking
the two notches on each of the sides
gently lower the cover and press down on
the lever and lock it in place don't
freak out if the cover pops off its
supposed to do that now we're going to
install a ram stick if you have only one
Ram stick then open up one of the slots
if you have to well you get the idea
match the gap on the RAM stick with the
notch on the RAM slot and simply insert
it in and apply some force until you
hear it click now we're going to install
the CPU cooler you have to match the
four holes on the motherboard to the
four pins on the cooler position the
cooler so that the Intel logo is right
side up and gently lower it while
aligning the four pins with the
motherboard holes once the cooler is
resting on the CPU press down on the
four pins one at a time until you hear
it click once you are done just pull on
the cooler a bit to see if anything is
loose grab the white connector from the
heatsink and plug it into the CPU fan
header on the motherboard which should
be located right above the RAM slots now
we're going to put them on the board
inside the case so go ahead and grab the
plastic bag with all the screws inside
and remove it from the larger bag these
are the four screws that you will need
to install the motherboard in the case
but before we do that we need to install
the i/o shield so make sure the three
circles are facing towards you while you
insert it inside the back of the case
where the cutout is make sure to apply
pressure on all four corners until the
shield snaps in place if you did it
correctly it should sit flush with the
case grab the motherboard by the
heatsink and lower it gently by aligning
the i/o shield with all the ports from
the motherboard then you have to install
the screws you may have to push the
motherboard slightly in order to align
the holes before you start screwing them
in do not over tighten them just enough
so that the motherboard doesn't move in
place now it's time to install the power
supply so remove the final two thumb
screws from the bottom of the case and
slide off the panel you will need four
of these screws which came with the case
so flip the case upside down so that the
bottom part is sticking out and insert
the power supply make sure the power
supply fan is facing out or in other
words it's facing down and then go ahead
and tighten all four of the screws next
we are going to install the Wi-Fi module
so that you can connect your PC via
Wi-Fi this part is going to be really
annoying and it requires your patient
so please don't rush it otherwise you
can damage your motherboard grab the two
gold-plated Wi-Fi connectors that come
with the motherboard and remove the
module from the motherboard by
unscrewing it carefully grab the tip of
the cables and connect each one of them
to the module these are extremely tiny
and may take some time
you will hear a faint click if you do it
correctly and go and do the same thing
for the second cable it doesn't really
matter which one connects first or
second both of them are the same so this
is what it looks like once it's
installed these do come off very easily
so try not to move them otherwise they
will come off and you will have to do
this all over again
gently lower the module back into the
motherboard and screw it back in place
again trying to be very careful not to
touch the cables because they will pop
off easily
next grab two of the gold-plated washers
and place one on each connection you can
then proceed to insert them through the
hole on the i/o shield near the back of
the case next grab to the gold-plated
nuts and tighten each one using your
hand unfortunately there isn't a tool
that was provided so you're just going
to have to use your hands for these
finally grab both of the antennas and
screw them both in they don't tighten
all the way and they might feel very
loose which is fine next we're going to
install the hard drives there should be
two more thumb screws holding the trays
together now if you're only installing
one storage device then remove only one
of the trays I will be showing you the
process of installing both a hard drive
and an SSD depending on what you are
putting in your PC if you're installing
a hard drive you need four of these
which consists of four screws and four
rubber grommets if installing an SSD you
only need four of these tiny screws
instead let's start with the hard drive
installation so grab four of the rubber
grommets and insert them in the holes on
the tray put them in the larger hole
first and slide it in the smaller hole
if you did it correctly the tray should
be in between the rubber pieces repeat
this for the other three holes grab your
hard drive and with a sticker facing
outwards place it on the tray and align
the holes on the hard drive with the
rubber holes on the sides once they are
aligned screw them in if you did it
correctly the drive should be nice and
tight against the tray without any
movement
DSS the installation is a lot easier
just place it against the tray with a
sticker facing out and align the holes
on the back with the tray some SS these
have four holes and others have three
like mine so go ahead and screw them in
and you are pretty much done so now
let's connect them to the PC you're
going to need one SATA data cable for
each drive you are connecting your
motherboard usually comes with two or
more of these put back the trays but
don't put in the thumb screw just yet
locate the SATA ports on the motherboard
which should look something like this
and insert them into the slot again one
for each storage device that you are
hooking up connect the other end of the
SATA cables to the hard drive or SSD
that you are installing we also need to
power the drives so grab the SATA power
cable that's connected to your PSU which
should look something like this and plug
it into the back of the hard drive or
SSD as well so this is what your hard
drive or SSD should look like once you
plug both of these cables in one is for
data and one is for power you can then
proceed to put back the thumb screws and
tying both of the trays back into the
case next we are going to hook up the
case fans and the front panel ports so
grab a set of cables that look like this
which are connected to the case we're
going to hook up the case fan first so
grab the cable that looks like this with
a black tip and plug it into the
motherboard chassis span header which
should be right next to the CPU fan
header now we connected earlier next up
we are connecting these cables which is
the most annoying but before we do that
look at your motherboard and locate the
set of pins located panel 1 which should
be on the bottom right of the
motherboard the first cable we are
connecting is the reset switch so make
sure the words are facing down and plug
it in the third and fourth pins near the
bottom just like this next up is the
power switch you're going to plug this
one right above the reset switch again
with the words facing down the third
cable is the HDD led once again make
sure the words are facing down and plug
this one in the first and second pins
near the bottom the last two cables are
the power LEDs the positive one goes in
the first pin and the negative one goes
in the second pen here is what is
supposed to look like on the top and you
can pause the screen and make sure that
your cables
just like the ones on the screen and
then here's what it's supposed to look
like on the bottom again you can pause
the video and make sure you always match
with what I have in my PC as you can see
all the letters are facing downwards
next cable we are plugging in is the
audio which says well HD audio depends
for this one are located near the bottom
of the i/o shield so plug it in while
the words are facing towards the i/o
shield as you can see in the video the
last cable we are connecting is for the
USB 3.0 ports in the front and it looks
something like this with the blue tip
locate the USB 3.0 header on the
motherboard which should be right below
the 24 pin ATX socket with the notch
facing the right side gently lower the
plug and snap it in place now we are
going to give some power to the CPU and
motherboard so first up is the CPU so
grab the power supply cable that has the
words CPU on them and plug only one of
the four pin connectors into the four
pin socket located near the top of the
motherboard which should be right behind
the i/o shield next up is the 24 pin ATX
cable and this one is pretty obvious
where it goes the only large socket on
the motherboard which should be located
on the right side it's really important
that these cables are fully seated guys
otherwise your PC won't turn on so make
sure to apply some pressure if needed
until the clip is fully hooked over
finally let's install the graphics card
so pop up in the cover near the back and
remove the two screws that are holding
the PCI brackets together gently lower
the GPU down and apply some force until
it snaps in place the gold portion from
the GPU should not be visible if it's
fully seated make sure what you have on
your PC matches with what you see on the
screen so once the GPU is fully seated
install both of the screws back on and
put back the cover finally we are going
to plug in the PCI connector into the
GPU so grab the cable that looks like
this and stick it inside the 6 pin slot
on the GPU so this is what your PC
should look like after plugging
everything in don't worry about the
cable management just yet we need to
make sure the PC boots perfectly fine
plug your PC into the wall outlet and
hook up the monitor keyboard and mouse
and go ahead and boot it up
if it takes you to the bio screen then
that means everything is working if the
GPU fan doesn't spin don't freak out
because that's normal if your PC doesn't
boot up or some errors popping up make
sure to go back through this entire
tutorial and make sure you've connected
everything correctly so now that you
know where everything is plugged in take
this time to work on cable management
you can unplug cables and route them in
any way you like for a cleaner look
here's what my PC looks like after I was
done with the cable management the best
tip I can give you guys is to use velcro
straps instead of zip ties because zip
ties are more permanent and not as
flexible as velcro straps and I'll drop
a link to some velcro straps down below
if you guys want to pick them up also
use the bottom part of the case to store
majority of the cables as you can see I
have a ton of cables wrapped up and
hidden here the power supply after all
there is no clear side panel so you
don't have to worry about them being
visible once you are satisfied with the
cable management go ahead and put back
all for the side panels and screw them
in alright so now it's time to install
Windows you will need a four gigabyte
flash drive and Internet access on a
different computer first thing you need
to do is visit the Microsoft website to
download the windows media tool I did
leave a link to it down below so make
sure to click on it and follow these
steps step two open the program and
follow the steps click on create
installation media for another PC and on
the next page make sure all of the
options match with what you see on my
screen if not uncheck the box and change
them after hitting next you will need to
select where you want Windows to be
installed on so make sure to select the
USB flash drive before hitting next
again go ahead and select the USB Drive
from the list and hit next one more time
and it will begin downloading depending
on your internet speed it can take up to
20 minutes to download but once it's
done you should get a message stating
that your USB Drive is ready so take out
the USB Drive and plug it into your new
PC and turn it on continuously tap on
the f11 key on your keyboard so that the
boot menu comes up and once you see this
window navigate to your USB flash drive
and hit enter what this does is it
allows your PC to boot from the USB
Drive so once the windows screen shows
up follow the instructions until you
reach the CD key prompt and here is
where you need to enter the
cd-key for Windows 10 you can either pay
full price for them or get them for like
40 dollars from the reddit cd-key
swapper I'll drop a link to it down
below if anyone is interested but
wherever you get your CD keys from just
make sure it's the same version as the
one you downloaded from the Microsoft
site so after printing in the CD key it
will take you to this screen make sure
to select the custom option and this
part is important guys you need to
select which drive you want windows to
be installed on obviously if you have an
SSD I would install it there because it
would boot faster than any hard drive so
in my case I chose my one terabyte SSD
to be my main operating system hit next
and just wait for Windows to do its
thing until it takes you back to the
home screen now let's say it doesn't
take you to the home screen and instead
gives you one of the three options one
it reboots itself and takes you to the
BIOS two it reboots and takes you to the
install page again or three it just
reboots and then states that there is no
operating system installed if any of the
three is happening to your PC here is
what you need to do to fix it reboot the
PC and hit the Delete key to get into
the BIOS once you in the BIOS hit f6 to
switch to Advanced Mode if you have a
different motherboard it may be f7 or a
different key so once you're in Advanced
tab navigate to the boot menu near the
top and switch your boot option number
one to your drive that has the operating
system installed on in my case I install
the operating system into my WD one
terabyte hard drive so I selected the
WDC option as number one
once you change that hit f10 and restart
your PC it should either take you
straight to the home screen of Windows
if the installation is complete or it
will take you to where you left off on
the installation process so once you're
at the home screen you need to download
the drivers otherwise you will run into
problems once again I did leave links to
the drivers home page so all you have to
do is click on them and download the
following for the motherboard driver you
have to click on the download link which
is located on the left side and then
select the operating system in my case
it's Windows 10 64 bit and then over
here you will need to download the
following audio driver blue through the
driver Intel management engine and the
LAN driver
once those are downloaded and install
you will need to download the graphics
traveling next again I did leave a link
to it down below this one is very easy
just visit the link and click on the
download now it should be under the
automatically detect and install your
driver tab remember that this is only
for AMD graphics cards if you have an
Nvidia graphics card you'll need to
install GeForce experience instead from
the Nvidia website so once all the
drivers are downloaded and installed you
may need to restart your PC and you're
pretty much good to go so if you're
actually building a PC congratulations
for building your very own gaming PC it
took me a few days to get this video
done for you guys so I hope you find it
useful and if you're feeling awesome
dropping a like would really help out
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
