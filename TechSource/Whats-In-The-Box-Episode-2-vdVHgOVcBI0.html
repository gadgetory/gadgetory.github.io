welcome to another what's in the box
video I love doing these and if you guys
enjoy watching and be sure to slap a
like and I can continue the series so
this time we actually have three boxes
and you know it's really difficult
because these are sitting in the corner
for like weeks and even days and I can't
touch them until I have at least three
boxes to open up in front of you guys so
without wasting any more time finally
got my knife ready let's go ahead and
open these up let's hold off the Asus
box until the end because I have a
feeling there's something really good in
there
and open up the EM ad Amazon Amazon box
first
oh yes cut away from me I've heard I've
seen those comments you guys left me
concerned about my safety I can say that
so alright we we have a set of combs
I forgot I already slasa we and we have
one little box in here I think this is
my adapter art oh I ordered a lot of
stuff from Amazon usually from for the
cool tech series but sometimes there are
personal items oh yes this is the
adapter for a universal adapter
basically for traveling around it's got
a European plugs UK and USA so this is
pretty handy I'm gonna go to events and
it comes with a little cool bag here so
that's pretty sweet
alright so let's open up the FedEx box
and just remind you guys that don't know
what's in these boxes even reading the
sentence information is not helpful at
all because it's a random name and some
random warehouse so let me just figure
out how to open this box they take this
one pretty damn good Wow okay
so seems to be an unmarked box a box
within a box great Oh more MORE
I did not expect to get this this soon
guys
ladies and gentlemen this is the new AMD
our x 480 graphics card that doesn't
even come in this retail box wow this is
crazy that cannot wait
ah great now I have more work to do
check that out guys I'm gonna get some
close-up shots and you guys can see the
beauty honestly this is a very ugly
looking card but I can't wait to see how
it performs that's for sure looks can be
deceiving
they say all right so let's put this
back in the bag turn it off inside and
open up the Asus box already
I am excited and happy so I wonder what
Asus is sending me got the official
issue sticker that's when you know
naming business
all right so first up is oh yeah they're
sending me their Mouse that's right
there ROG spatha or spatha how do we fit
Mouse this is a wireless mouse it has
all the bells and whistles and it's
pretty pricey I think like 150 bucks
hundred 60 bucks something like that but
I have to do a review on this so I'm
very excited this may this may even be
my new Mouse I've been looking for a
wireless mouse that's also black and
went to the setup and last but not least
oh yeah this thing the 10th anniversary
this is the ROG rampage 5 edition 10
motherboard this is the mother of old
motherboards it has a buttload of
features I mean I can seriously talk for
days but there will be a review on this
of course in fact I might get started
after I'm done with this video let me
open the box actually show you guys
inside who opens up really nice actually
let me open that one more time in front
of you guys
that opens up really nicely
that's pretty cool all this motherboard
looks insane so good pretty freakin
heavy - here it is ladies and gentlemen
the 10th anniversary ROG rampage 5
