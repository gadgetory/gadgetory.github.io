and today we are going to look at the
wireless charging dock from ghost tech
the holidays are around the corner and I
think this will make a great gift for
someone who has an Android phone and a
car it also costs under 50 bucks which
won't dent your wallet so the dock comes
in one color and it charges your Android
phone wirelessly without having to plug
in any cables it also has a reinforced
suction mouth different orientations and
a high efficiency Qi wireless
transmitter built in I'm not really a
fan when it comes to charging phones in
cars because of the cables I like to
keep the inside of my car clean which is
why I prefer tiny charging bricks that
fit in my wallet but when I heard that
there is a mount that charges your phone
wirelessly I had to pick it up and give
it a try so inside the box you get the
USB cable a special mount that allows
you to mount it to your dashboard and AC
vents a USB car power adapter manuals as
well as the phone mount itself so here's
the mount something I notice right off
the bat is that it does not have any
buttons on the side to open the clamps
this is the only downside to this
product place your phone on it you have
to insert one side of the phone first
and then use your finger to open the
other clamp just enough to slide the
phone in now this isn't convenient at
all but with some practice on shorter
process will become a lot smoother each
time so there are a total of three
different ways you can mount this
charger either on your windshield
dashboard or on your ventilation fins so
they definitely give you a lot of
options so it becomes really convenient
and comfortable to reach now you may be
wondering how is the galaxy s5 going to
charge it's not compatible with wireless
charging devices well for some smart
phones that don't come out of the box
ready to charge wirelessly you can
purchase these adapters from ghost tech
as well and install them to the back of
your smartphone to enable wireless
charging it's really simple to install
just remove the backplate of the galaxy
s5 and match the two pins from the
adapter with the two pins on the phone
and press down firmly it's super thin
and won't interfere with the backplate
at all when putting it back on now this
isn't the most effective way of charging
your phone is plugging it in directly
into the USB converter in your car will
probably be more efficient but this
isn't far behind that method and it is a
lot more convenient
the only thing you need to connect is
the actual charging mouth into your
auxiliary port in your car which is a
lot better than connecting it to your
phone every time you need to charge it
alright so that is it for this video I
hope you guys enjoyed it I will leave

interested in checking this item out and
