what's up guys it's ed back again from
tech source and in this video I'm going
to be performing a detailed speed test
and benchmark test between the Galaxy s6
and the galaxy s5 now we know that the
s6 will be the faster phone with higher
benchmark scores than the s5 so the
purpose of this video is to see how much
of a difference there really is between
last year's model and this year's so
with that said let's start with the
booth test
you
you
all right so that's it for the video as
expected the galaxy s6 did a better job
than the s5 it actually did a lot better
than expected
Samsung has made a fine device and
currently it's the best smartphone in
terms of performance and camera actually
did a speed test and a camera comparison
between the s6 and the iPhone 6 recently
and I'll leave links to those videos in
the description if you guys want to
check it out if there's a specific video
you want to see the galaxy s6 go up
against then let me know by dropping a
comment down below as always if you
