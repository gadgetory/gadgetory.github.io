welcome to another episode of what's in
the box so this one's gonna be very
short because we only have four boxes to
open up and that is because we're not
opening up any fan mail
since I haven't been to my P o box and
over a month now I think
which reminds me by the way if you guys
want to send some stuff and have it
featured in the next episode of what's
in the box I'll have my PA box linked
below how many times did I say box
already
but anyways with that said technically
we have three boxes to open up because
this one arrived just like this without
a packaging box and this is pretty
obvious that's gonna be an alienware a
laptop open it up wow this is I think
the Alienware 13-inch I could be
mistaken but as you can see it's got
some really nice custom v-band skins on
there feel like this laptop was
purposely skinned with me and mind this
is exactly my color scheme and oh wow
even inside we got black carbon fiber
that is pretty sick so black carbon
fiber inside and then the outside we got
red and black mats and we have skin so
we have skins in the back as well wow
that is a sick color scheme I know black
and red is overused and a lot of things
guys especially in laptops but I don't
know to me I just can't get bored of
seeing black and red that's just me
personally guys I haven't done a video
on an alienware product over in over two
years I think which is crazy so it's
gonna be definitely interesting to
finally review one on the channel so
yeah very excited this is the 13 inch
I'll drop a link to it below if you guys
want to check it out with the specs and
everything but this thing is walking the
I 770 820 HK this is an eight-core
processor guys and it has 32 gigs of ram
a gtx 1070 wow this is pretty much
decked out I think this is their
high-end 13-inch laptop if I'm not
mistaken I don't know if you can get the
1080p option but I'm not sure if they
have a GTX 1080 variant but anyways I'll
drop a link below if you guys want to
check it out yeah there should be a very
interesting video
but yeah Thank You D brands for sending
us out we're gonna we're gonna have some
fun with this all right so this next one
is clearly from EMA side judging by the
MSI tape so let's see what they sent me
no way do you guys remember the last
crappy episode I did of what's in the
box and I had a little skit in there
because of something either now receive
I've been awake every night since then
contemplating
wondering why
this made me question the choices I've
made
I thought we were friends
[Laughter]
it's here oh my goodness I feel like
either AMD or MSI heard my cries and
they sent me thread Ripper guys they
send me the 1950 X I'll take it you know
what let's unbox this I'm excited let's
let's unbox this right now because I
didn't get a chance to make a video on
this better late than never I am
seriously happy right now okay so far so
good
so under here looks like there is a
little brochure installation
instructions which I don't need because
I've seen enough videos to know what the
hell I'm doing and then you got the
tools down here which is needed to
install the CPU on the new TR 4 socket
so with that out of the way let's open
up the actual CPU how does this thing
open oh okay oh my god that is gorgeous
just look at it don't even touch it just
look at it look at the beauty now to get
this out of here looks sexy looks like
there's a clip
oh you push down on the clips here okay
duh Wow oh my god orgasm
whoa that was close so pops out just
like this so this is the actual part
that you slide into the tr4 socket on
the motherboard I'm not gonna doing this
video because I'm sure you guys have
seen it a thousand times but seriously
MSI you guys are amazing thank you so
much for hearing my cries and sending
out the 1950 ex for me to check out I
cannot wait to do an awesome build and
show you guys what this thing is capable
of doing
I got a had at AMD for the packaging
though this is definitely one of the
best unboxing experiences when it comes
to CPU until definitely needs to step up
their game a lot of you guys are
probably freaking out there was no CPU
in that box I purposely took it out
before I threw it because I knew you
guys were gonna be screaming in the
comments section so I like control you
guys sometimes so this is the
motherboard I'm gonna be using for the
1950 ex a PC build if it isn't obvious
at this point this is Emma sighs new X
399 gaming Pro carbon a/c motherboard it
does come equipped with the new socket
tr4 that way I can use it with the 1950
X let's pop this baby open and let's
take a closer look at this bad boy so
here's the motherboard itself MSI
honestly has been stepping up their
motherboard game recently and I've just
been a huge fan of their design so I'm
gonna put this aside will quick check
out the rest of this stuff inside the
box so we got a 2-way SLI bridge
the usual SATA cables IO shield the
4-pin RGB cable to sync your LEDs to the
motherboard okay so the motherboard
doesn't come with built-in Wi-Fi so I'm
guessing they sent over an optional
Wi-Fi adapter via PCIe in case you guys
do want to install it on your
motherboard and here are the antennas
included with that they've even included
a USB extension cable wow this is very
rare to find in motherboards believe it
or not I've done so many builds and this
cable here literally can change
everything a huge props to msi for
including this in their box it's gonna
make my life so much easier when
building pcs believe it or not there are
some cables out there that are way too
short to reach the USB header on the
motherboard and that is where this cable
comes in to save the day wow are these
swappable heatsink covers looks like
there's one in gold and one in silver
personally I'm not a fan of gold or
silver I just don't think there are
popular colors not a lot of people use
these color schemes in their PC builds
but I would love to see red blue maybe
even green but the best part about it is
actually you can custom 3d print your
own if you guys don't like to stock ones
alright so this is something I've never
seen on any other motherboard and I feel
like MSI is always coming up with these
pretty cool inventions for their
motherboards
so check this out guys this is a fan
holder you might be asking what is a fan
holder well it's to hold a fan but
there's an actual purpose for this fan
hold or let me show you guys so
basically this is right above the CPU
socket right over here and it has come
with some standoffs screws and thumb
screws to install this on your
motherboard and the fan sits directly on
top of the bracket they're actually
labeling it the overclock fan stand and
because of that I'm going to assume that
it's gonna help with overclocking
temperatures I mean theoretically it is
a fan sitting above the CPU socket
pushing cold air through the CPU area
whether using an air cooler or an a i/o
cooler theoretically it's supposed to
help lower temps but I'm gonna have to
test that to see if it actually does
anything but that is definitely a pretty
cool feature that I've never seen
anywhere so the X 399 gaming Pro carbon
has a
teen phase premium PWM design to
maximize the Red River performance so
best believe that I'll be overclocking
the 1950 ex to its maximum potential it
also comes with three turbo MDOT two
slots with MDOT two shields I don't
think the end that to shield offers much
in terms of cooling performance based on
previous benchmarks but it honestly adds
a really cool aesthetic to the
motherboard and it protects your MDOT
too especially if you're rocking those
ugly blue or green pcbm twos these will
not only cover it but it also add a nice
aesthetic to your overall PC build it
does support for way SLI and four-way
crossfire and as I mentioned before it
does have Wi-Fi support and delivers
wireless AC speeds up to 867 megabits
per second I mean this thing is packing
all the bells and whistles as expected
from a high-end motherboard from MSI so
this is the ex 399 gaming Pro carbon AC
I'll jump a link below in case you guys
want to check that out but I will be
doing a build with this and I'll be
overclocking in 1950 X as well so yeah
because I excited let me know in the
comments section below and let me know
what color scheme I should focus on for
this specific and B build I kind of want
to stay away from black and red I've
done so many of those in the past so
give me a unique color scheme justjust
don't say black or gold
I don't like gold last but not least we
are saving the biggest box for the end
of course
so yeah there's obviously something from
Razer inside this box I'm sure a lot of
guys I already know what it is but the
interesting thing is I've never reviewed
a Razer product ever on tech source so
the first ever review on tech source is
gonna be on wow this thing is heavy
heavier than it looks
so as usual cables and accessories I'm
not gonna really go through here but
this ladies and gentlemen is the Razer
Blade Pro 17.3 inch gaming laptop Wow
so the specs on here are somewhat
similar to the Alienware laptop I opened
up earlier in the video it's got a 72 20
HK 8 core processor 32 gigs of ram but
this has a GTX 1080 inside of a 1070 but
what I love about this keyboard is this
the 17 inch 4k display with g-sync
and it's also a touch screen another
thing I love about the laptop already is
the keyboard layouts as you guys can see
the trackpad is all the way on the right
side and then the keys are on the left
so while you're typing or gaming you're
not constantly coming into contact with
the trackpad which is pretty cool by the
way is what that said I think I'm gonna
wrap up the video then guys so much for
watching if you enjoy be what's in the
box series let me know by leaving a like
and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
