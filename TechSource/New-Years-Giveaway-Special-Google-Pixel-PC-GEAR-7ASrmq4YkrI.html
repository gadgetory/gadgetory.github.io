2016 is nearly over and it's actually
been the best year on tech source
because of you guys I'm all your likes
your comments your dislikes sharing the
videos and all that stuff you made 2016
the best year for Texas I just want to
thank you guys I was actually looking at
the stats the other day and I was
completely blown away that we were able
to achieve these numbers in such a short
time and because of that I want to show
my appreciation and I want to thank you
guys for your amazing support so I want
to do this little giveaway for you guys
so this time I'll be giving away Google
pixel and five different prizes that are
worth a hundred dollars each so I could
be either processors or GPUs or just
other gaming gear just like last time
you guys get to pick what you want to
enter for and its really simple all you
have to do is download the nice app
which I'll have a link down below and
like the products you guys want to enter
the giveaway for liking the product on
the app actually puts it on your wish
list and from that I can actually
randomly select five people and announce
the winner is within the app as well the
giveaway will end on January 10th so
make sure you guys do this before hand
and I will also select the winners
within the app so six random individuals
will be selected and they'll be notified
within the app based on what items you
add on your wish list so make sure you
guys have push notifications enabled
within the app if you want to get
notified and I know a lot you guys
already know what the app is about but
for those of you who are just joining in
nice is a great app that lets you watch
videos while browsing products at the
same time it even allows you to save
stuff to your wish list it's essentially
a fusion between YouTube and Amazon riaz
Commission we watch videos and check out
the products within the same platform
the best part is that it's completely
free you guys don't have to pay for
anything on the app but anyways more if
it will be linked down below if you guys
