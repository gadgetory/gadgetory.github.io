we're gonna be taking a look at the new
Lenovo Legion Y 520 gaming laptop that
gives you an i-5 7300 HQ eight gigs of
ram and a gtx 750ti for around nine
hundred dollars that is a starting price
and it does go up depending on what
configuration you'd go with so I've been
using laptop for about a week now and
even though Lenovo Center South will
review and sponsor this episode I will
be sharing the things I don't like about
this laptop as well as things I do like
about it so that's it let's go ahead and
start off with the build quality so the
plastic frame throughout the laptop is
actually built pretty sturdy with very
little band where the keyboard is
located the display however does have a
little bit of flex which is to be
expected on most laptops but nothing too
flimsy one thing I noticed immediately
is that the coating on the laptop
attracts fingerprints and it also gets
scratched easily as you can see the
laptop has a few scratches aren't
already from carrying it around in my
backpack the hinge is built really well
you can open the laptop with one hand
very easily and your overall size and
weight of the laptop is perfect for
being mobile it's not too big or too
heavy so you can throw it in your
backpack when you're on the move the
extremely thick bezel display has a 15.6
inch 1080p IPS panel with anti-glare
coating which means that it's great for
outdoor use or places where there is a
lot of sunlight but with that anti-glare
coating you don't get as vibrant colors
or great viewing angles despite it being
an IPS display but it's not really a big
deal on a gaming laptop they did throw
in a 720p 30fps camera near the top
which surprisingly has good low-light
performance compared to other laptops
I've checked out on the channel oh yeah
this is the camera on the Lenovo Legion
Wi-Fi 20 and I'm going to take wiper
blade you guys can hear the background
noise the keyboard however is built very
well there's this crimson red accent
around each key as well as the trackpad
the keys itself are backlit which is
great for gaming at night and provide
1.7 millimeter of key travel which is
satisfying to type on and provides great
feedback
you can also control the brightness of
the backlighting from low to high by
pressing down on the function and
backspace key the numpad is sort of in a
weird spot which took some getting used
to but I love the fact that lenovo added
LED indicators for the lem lock as well
as the caps lock which surprisingly some
manufacturers tend to ignore the
trackpad is also nice it's very
responsive with no lag and the taps
register every single time the two
buttons however do require a little
extra force that I'm used to for it to
register but I have no complaints and
overall I'm actually a fan of a design
of course being black in red is also a
nice plus for me one of the features
that shocked me about this laptop with
is speakers they are actually pretty
good I don't think I've ever heard
better speakers on a gaming laptop until
now and that's because they're a custom
tuned with dual two watt Harman speakers
with Dolby audio and there are actually
fun firing speakers as well so you get
the full audio experience so if you're
someone that doesn't use headphones or
even a gaming headset then you'll be
pleased by the sound quality of these
speakers
can't you
imminent destruction of everything we
know and love business when it comes to
connection the l√©gion y 520 doesn't
fall short on the left side we got the
security lock followed by the charging
port Ethernet and one USB followed by
the headphone jack on the opposite side
we got an hdmi two USB 3.0 ports a
full-size SD card slot and a USB type-c
port to access the internals you will
need to remove 12 screws and pop off the
back cover unfortunately the only
Hardware you can replace or upgrade is
the m2 SSD located on the left side the
heat pipe and exhaust are also located
near the back of the laptop so you won't
feel any heat near your hands while
gaming I was actually very impressed
with the thermals I have gained for one
hour straight and not once have I felt
any heat coming my way one of the
reasons for this is because the fans and
vents are located close to the CPU and
GPU so basically the hot air keeps on
moving while the rear exhaust removes
that heat so you can stay cool during
those long gaming sessions the fan noise
on the other hand is noticeable if there
is no other sound present just like most
laptops but if using headphones or even
the speaker is on a laptop then you
won't hear them at all here's a quick
demonstration so this is how loud the
fans get while gaming and as you can see
there's no game sounds currently present
now I'm going to turn on the game sound
and play a little better you guys can
hear defense
good eyes on the target
let's move submachine gun laptop does
come with a 256 - goodbye PCIe SSD and
this thing is wicked fast it literally
takes around seven seconds to boot up
all right let's talk gaming so what does
the i5 7300 HQ paired with the gtx 1050
TI get you in games on GTA 5 high
settings we get around 48 FPS without
any lag or stutter however I was able to
hit closer to 60 after lowering the
settings to medium
although 40 FPS is definitely still
enjoyable for me csgo is a much lighter
game so I was getting well over 100 FPS
and max settings suddenly my skills have
not improved from benchmarking this game
multiple times overwatch is another game
that's not as GPU intensive however I
cranked up the settings to ultra just to
see how well it would run and to my
surprise I was hitting more than 50 fps
if you want to hit that 60 mark lowering
the settings to high or even medium will
get you that extra push but I kept it on
ultra because the FPS difference didn't
really affect my gameplay at all
battlefield 1 is a pretty intensive game
however I was able to achieve 52 fps in
high settings for the single-player
campaign using DirectX 11 and finally we
got Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon wildlands
which is the most GPU intensive game in
this list and because of that at the
lower the settings to medium in order to
achieve 44 FPS overall I was pretty
happy with the gaming performance it
delivered for a gaming laptop that costs
under $1000 all the games I tested were
playable in 1080p and this would be the
perfect laptop on-the-go for anyone
battery life was also fairly good in
terms of everyday use and streaming
video so I tested a laptop at 100%
battery life for gaming and also
streaming video and here are my findings
screaming non-stop video will get you
approximately 4 hours and 12 minutes
until it dies from 100% full charge this
was tested under a balanced power plan
with 75% brightness gaming however was a
different story
so after gaming for 60 minutes on the
dot the battery percentage dropped from
100% all the way down to 9
percent this was also tested under the
balanced power plan and seventy-five
percent brightness needless to say if
you're going to be gaming on this laptop
for more than an hour it's best to have
it plugged in so to recap the video when
we talking about the things I liked and
the things I didn't like definitely a
fan at the design it's got the cool
looking black carbon fiber look for the
surface as well as the red crimson
outline around the key caps and the
trackpad the build quality is also on
the positive side with very little bang
on the keyboard and the fact that I can
open it with one hand is a nice plus the
laptop doesn't get hot which I can
appreciate on any mobile device the
speakers are some of the best I've heard
although I personally don't use a
headset or even headphones so I feel
like it's kind of wasted I much prefer
to have crappy speakers and spend that
extra money on a better GPU or CPU but I
digress
I also love typing on this keyboard and
the trackpad is very accurate and
responsive I have no complaints when it
comes to the keyboard and trackpad the
overall form factor and weight is
perfect for travel and finally the
performance the GTX 1050 is a tiny beast
that can provide an enjoyable experience
when it comes to gaming while the i5
7300 HQ does a great job on the
productivity side not to mention
incredibly fast 5 second boot time that
was pretty impressive
so things I didn't like the coating on
the surface attracts fingerprints easily
and I'm not sure how on earth the laptop
got scratched so easily as well the
display has thick bezels and the battery
life is subpar when it comes to gaming
on balance mode and finally there is
pretty much no upgrade ability what you
buy is what you get the storage is the
only part that is easily accessible and
replaceable so there are more positives
than negatives when it comes to the
Lenovo Legion Y 520 gaming laptop around
manage dollars you guys get a solid
built gaming laptop with great
performance now if you're looking for
something a little beefier you can
upgrade the GPU to the gtx 1064 around
$75 more and this will get you 60fps
across most titles in high settings so
you don't have to compromise the quality
of the game but anyways that wraps up my
honest review of the lenovo Legion Y 520
gaming laptop if you guys enjoy these
types of review videos on laptops make
sure to drop a like so that I know if
you guys didn't enjoy
the video feel free to dislike as well
that is completely fine too
I'll drop a link to the laptop below if
you guys want to check it out a huge
thing to Lenovo for sending this in and
sponsoring this video thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
