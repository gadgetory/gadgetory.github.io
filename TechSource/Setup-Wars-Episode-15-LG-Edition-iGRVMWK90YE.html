john joseph Jayson Calton Marcus Mike
Sven and Tom congrats for making it into
setup for episode 15 first up is a male
with his simple dual monitor setup we
have an Asus 23 inch and a Dell 19 inch
display on the IKEA Malm desk we have a
pair of ath m50x headphones Logitech k7
40 keyboard and an MX anywhere Mouse
from Logitech kill Benjamin is great and
you have a simple and clean PC build as
well with a 4790k processor and a gtx
760 nothing bad to say about this setup
really straightforward and really clean
productivity type setup and number two
is Herrmann with his triple displays
I'll give you a point for showing off my
channel but I much prefer to see an
awesome wallpaper on those monitors we
have three Asus 24-inch monitors on the
table and we also have a razer
blackwidow keyboard along with a Death
Adder Mouse is that is that iPad screen
cracked I'm not sure why you would show
off a cracked iPad but you got a six set
up to compensate Caleb management is
really good and I'm digging those LEDs
you have on their desk I also see that
you listen to my advice and attach to
your remote on the top of the table or
at least I'm assuming that you got that
idea from setup Wars
does it look so much better that way we
are really straightforward triple
monitor setup thank you for entering and
number three we have Jonathan with a
wireless dual monitor productivity set
up we have two 22 inch monitors one from
LG and the other from sannio
both of them are hooked up to a coggan
dual monitor stand and on top of those
we have a 40 inch sony bravia tv on the
desk we have a dell wireless mouse and
keyboard and a bunch of debris and
scratches and stuff kale management is
pretty decent at least you wrapped them
together with some zip ties so not bad I
also notice that you have a pair of
Logitech Harmony 650 speakers mounted on
the top of your bed which is an
interesting place and I'm really liking
the blue walls but nothing much else to
say pretty clean setup for the most part
next up is Joseph and his team green
setup we have 324 interview sonic
monitors a Razer BlackWidow chroma
keyboard
Razer Naga Mouse and an orb weaver all
the way on the left side all of this on
top of the razor Goliath this extended
mouse pad we also have a pair of riser
tiamat headphones hanging from one of
the monitors and an 80 20/20 condenser
microphone job well done sticking with
the green tea
even what a better way to complete the
build than a PC walking a nvidia gtx
980ti
inside that case and omar dog when in
God's name is going on in that case what
what's up with those cables bro besides
they run this cable management inside
the PC let's take a look at the cable
management of your setup and oh my god
you can't fool me with those two boards
I can very well see that it's a mess
back there as well
anywho besides the cable management I
say that you have a pretty solid setup I
would strongly recommend getting a
bigger desk though because that looks
super cramped next up we have another
triple monitor setup but this one is
from casein we have three issues 24-inch
monitors on the Ergo tech desk stand
Joseph if you are watching this take
notes my friend this is how a triple
monitor setup is done I think I'm in
love under desk we have a Corsair k70
RGB keyboard Naga epic Mouse and yet
another orb-weaver keyboard on the left
side even till today I still don't know
what those are useful I mean what can
you possibly need a second keyboard for
you guys only have two hands anyways
back to the setup we also have a
charging cradle for the ps4 controllers
a high-rise stand for your iPhone and my
favorite a cursor extended mousepad can
you impress me anymore good sir let's
take a look at cable management and of
course as expected it's spotless let's
go and take a look at the PC so we have
a black and red build inside the air 540
case 2 GTX 760 s and an FX 8350
beautiful work on the cable management
and I approve of the color combination
I mean I'm speechless this setup is
amazing and I give it a ten out of wait
a minute
you
why are your headphones just hanging
from the desk like that I was so close
to give you the first-ever 10 out of 10
seal of approval from setup wars until I
saw that I know I said I wasn't going to
recommend stuff but I just have to in
order to complete this setup so I'll
leave a link for an awesome headphone
hangar that works with your setup down
below but other than that you get a
solid two thumbs up for me absolutely
gorgeous setup this is how old triple
monitor setup should look like kiloton
is next up with yet another productivity
setup and it's actually a lot of these
in this episode so on the desk we have a
23 inch ioc monitor which is hooked up
to the 2011 13 inch MacBook Pro also no
desk we have the Apple wireless keyboard
and mouse and on the left side is a pair
of Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen 2 I headphones it's
interesting that you have your MacBook
on one side and your monitor on the
other I would just put them together and
use both of the screens but if that
works for you
then it works for me excellent job on
wire management and I see that you
attached to Ikea LED remote on the roof
of your desk just like the other set up
I really want to know if you guys got
this idea from setup wars or did you
already have it set up like that I'm
really interested to know we are overall
a very clean productivity setup I don't
have any complaints at number 7 we have
Marcus with a triple display setup an
asus 24 inch and a 21 inch monitor on
the bottom with a massive 40 inch TCL TV
mounted on top on the desk we have a
Vengeance k70 keyboard SteelSeries qck
mouse and a pair of razer kraken
headphones let's go and take a look at
the cable management there are a lot of
cables but at least you try to keep them
off the ground by placing them on the
rack
not a bad PC we have a 34 70 paired with
a gtx 960 graphics card you could work
on cable management a bit for both the
PC and your set up but overall it's a
really dope setup I also like how you
put the LEDs under the shelves and
behind the TV as well good job there
next up is Mike with his ancient setup
is that oh never mind for a second there
looked like a setup straight from the
80s not a bad time piece to add to your
setup it definitely spices things up so
we have a 27-inch Dell monitor with a 2k
resolution and vertical mode don't tell
me the only purpose of that is for the
wallpaper because I will cut you on the
other side we have a 32 inch 4k Mon
from bang key with a Corsair k70 RGB
keyboard and am 65 RGB mouse on the
table also no desk we have a pair of
Edifier speakers and a pair of
sennheiser HD 650 headphones on the
copper color headphone stand plus one on
that mod Mike you have installed on the
headphones by the way kill management is
great all the wires are behind a desk so
not much work is needed to hide them I
must say you have a pretty sweet PC
build I've never seen a more colourful
build in my life it almost reminds me of
Christmas morning with the green and red
cables definitely one of the more
interesting builds on setup or is maybe
you should enter PC Wars just saying
well yeah man overall a really sick
setup thanks for entering at number 9 we
have Savannah with his triple monitor
setup starting from the top we have an
Acer 22 inch monitor and below we have
two Asus 24 inch monitors at least you
arrange them from largest to smallest so
I won't give you crap about them other
that's we have a Logitech G 19 and G 13
keyboard a Logitech G 700 mouse with the
Z nano 6 speakers also on the desk we
have a SteelSeries Wireless H headphones
and the road NT USB mic cable management
is great I love how you rattle them
through that Raceway against the wall
that's a really great idea I also like
the Shelf of figurines and the little
fan that you have hooked up there as
well there are a few extra items on the
desk for my taste but overall it's a
pretty sweet setup last but not least we
have Tom and Jerry and his dual 2k
monitors from Hasbro we have a Corsair
k3 keyboard and a steel series Kinzua
gaming mouse I'm definitely digging
those genius gaming speakers you have
with the red LEDs balls on the desk we
have a pair of Sennheiser RS 180
wireless headphones and a 55 inch sony
bravia tv which you stated is used as a
third monitor Kayle management is really
great and you have a pretty sick
water-cooled PC build as well it's
rocking a 4930 k with a gtx 770 and
there's something about water-cooled
builds using stock PSU cables that makes
me want to cringe but overall it's a
pretty solid setup anyways that's it for
