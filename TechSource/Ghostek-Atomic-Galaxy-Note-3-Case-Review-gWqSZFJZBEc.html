and today I'm bringing you a case review
now normally I don't do case reviews on
my channel because they aren't
interesting enough but I came across one
the other day that caught my attention
this year is the ghost tech atomic case
for the Galaxy Note 3 and in case you
didn't notice it is waterproof but what
I really like about this case is not
only is it very sleek but it is designed
to not add additional bulkiness to the
phone like most other cases do the case
by itself is actually really light
weighing only about three ounces the
back also has a leather feel and look to
it even though it's made out of
polycarbonate because well you know
leather does not work well together with
water one of my concerns about
waterproof cases is the difficulty of
pressing the buttons which we will be
testing once we install the phone later
in this video looking at the top of the
case we can see the cutouts for the
infrared blaster microphone and a
screwin cap for the headphone jack on
the bottom we have some cutouts for the
speakers microphone and a rubber seal
which protects the USB port so inside
the case you will find a microfiber
cloth the QuickStart guide with some
useful information a waterproof 3.5
millimeter headphone jack adapter and a
lanyard since the case is waterproof it
does already come with a protective
shield and here is a sample of the
clarity that you can expect when
installing the case taking a look at the
back cover you can see the seal that
goes around the case which provides the
tight seal that is needed to prevent
water from entering the case now the
installation is quite simple just lay
the phone on the back cover and place
the front piece over the phone once you
do that just go around the edges
pressing both sides firmly together to
seal the phone inside if there are any
bubbles then you can easily remove them
by using a squeegee board or something
else with a flat edge but for the sake
of time we didn't bother with it in this
video so I was actually surprised how
soft and easy the buttons were to press
since the note 3 has touchscreen buttons
the Edit rubber pads on the front which
are very sensitive and really easy to
press you can even tap on it and it will
recognize your action that was
definitely impressed with that now the
side buttons are a little more tough
since they are polycarbonate but with
waterproof cases you can't take any
chances but it was still far more easy
to press the
than other waterproof cases that I had
in the past with some usage they will be
broken in and get much looser so you
don't have to worry much about that
looking at the top of the phone we can
see cutouts for the front-facing camera
the speaker grille for phone calls
various sensors and the notification
light everything about this case is
simplistic and convenient even when
trying to access the USB port down below
this too is made out of rubber which
acts as a seal when closed they made
sure to provide enough room for the
charging cable as you can see here now
for the fun part we can't do a
waterproof case review without testing
it so here is a quick test with the case
inside water with most phones the screen
is so sensitive that it will register
each water drop as a gesture so in order
to actually use it without any problems
the screen has to be wiped clean
beforehand but as you can see the phone
is still functioning fine even when
submerged in water so yeah the case is
waterproof the build quality is really
great for the price I do feel like I am
holding a premium case in my hand and
when I compare it to cases like
lifeproof and OtterBox it amazes me how
much money I could have saved if I
picked up one of these for my phone
instead I strongly recommend you guys to
check them out for your smart phone they
have a variety of colors for each device
and they make them for almost every
phone I will leave links in the
description section if you guys are
interested in checking them out anyways
this is that from tech source thanks for
watching and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
