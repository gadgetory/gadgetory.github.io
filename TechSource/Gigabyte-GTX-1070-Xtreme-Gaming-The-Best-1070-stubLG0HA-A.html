and in this video we're gonna be taking
a look at the gigabyte gtx 1070 extreme
gaming a massive graphics card with a
custom PCB and gigabytes win four stack
3x cooling system that features three
100 millimeter fans I've gotta hand it
to gigabyte for coming up with such a
clever cooling system not only are the
fans overlapping each other to cover
more heatsink area but the middle fan
spins in the opposite direction which
optimizes the airflow to dissipate the
heat more effectively this isn't even a
marketing tactic it actually does work
the car receives noticeably cooler temps
compared to the other 10 Series GPUs
that I've tested before it would peak at
67 degrees during full load and hover
around 40 degrees on idle 67 degrees on
full load guys that's seriously unheard
of the other cards don't even come close
unfortunately because the fans are
stacked like this gigabyte had no choice
but to make the GPU slightly wider
occupying an additional PCI slot for a
total of three aside from the extremely
cool temps the card also features a
custom backplate RGB lighting and an 8
plus 2 power phase with an 8 plus 6 PCI
connector unfortunately I don't know the
TDP of the card since that info wasn't
shared with me but looking at the power
draw the whole system peaked at 350
watts during full load and remain at a
constant 130 Watts during idle so a
single 500 watt power supply should be
sufficient enough to power your PC with
a single gigabyte gtx 1070 extreme the
card also comes with two modes overclock
and gaming mode which both provide
different clock speeds 1873 for boost
and 1670 for the base clock in gaming
mode the card also features eight gigs
of gddr5 memory a 256 bit bus and a
memory clock of 8320 megahertz and
overclock mode in terms of ports not
only do you get the usual three display
one HDMI and one p VI but gigabyte has
also added two additional HDMI ports on
the opposite side of the card to provide
convenient access to VR or other HDMI
devices very nice the design on the
other hand looks very cool
personally I think it looks better than
EVGA superclocked and FTW edition cards
the aluminum chassis is around the GPU
gives off this armoured look
it's very attractive speaking of
attractive that backplate though the
only gripe I have with the backplate is
the dark orange lines that run across it
now although it's not a huge deal I
personally would have loved to see a
more neutral color like white or even
silver I feel like something this minor
can really interfere with a build that's
trying to keep a certain color scheme I
mean it sure as hell would bother me the
build quality on the other hand is
something I question there are some
parts of the GPU that flex and honestly
feel pretty flimsy for a board partner
gtx 1070 that cost more than the
founders edition I expected a more solid
build aside from that the card also
features RGB LEDs which you can control
with gigabytes extreme gaming engine you
can set a static color or give it some
pretty cool effects the front of the
card along with the GPU name on the side
has the ability to light up and
additionally there is a fan indicator
that also lights up which will notify
you if the fans have stopped spinning
also with the software you can set the
mode of the GPU either an overclock mode
gaming mode or eco mode which consumes
less power and operates at a much lower
fan setting you can also manually
overclock the graphics card using the
overclock tab you have access to voltage
core and memory clock as well as the
power limit I did manage to overclock
the card with a very positive result but
more on that later
and finally the fan tab gives you
complete control to the fan speed you
can select one of the three configured
settings from up top or manually set
your own fan curve using the graph
speaking of fans here's a quick sound
test
alright so the moment of truth how does
this card compete against the GTX 1080
and the gtx 980ti superclocked let's
find out
so there you have it the gtx 1070 pretty
much outperformed the gtx 980ti
superclocked edition which is currently
twenty dollars more than the 1070
there's really no reason to compare it
to the gtx 970 or even 980 if you can
hold up its own against a 980 TI also
the scores weren't that far off from the
1080 founders edition now when it comes
to overclocking I was impressed even
though the card comes heavily
overclocked I was still able to push it
even more using the Xtreme engine
software I managed to squeeze out an
additional 50 for a total boost clock of
2012 megahertz and for the memory I was
surprised to achieve an extra 700
megahertz putting the card at 88 74 for
total memory clock this gets you a nice
boost in gaming I mean 5 to 10 FPS
increase across most of the games I've
tested is not bad at all I mean sure the
GTX 970 extreme gaming is priced pretty
high even more than the founders Edition
but what you are getting in return is a
great looking card with extremely low
temperatures RGB lighting and a very
impressive performance overclocked or
not the only negatives that stood out
with a build quality extra PCI slot
usage and the minor orange accents other
than that if you have around $500 in
your pocket and are shopping for your
next graphics card then the gigabyte gtx
1070 extreme gaming has to be on your
list as always if you guys enjoy these
types of videos and want to see more PC
