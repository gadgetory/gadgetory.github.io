welcome to setup wars episode 129 I'm
also trying something a little different
with the lighting as yes can see it's
kind of them in the back and there's
more light in the foreground so I'm
trying to change things up if you guys
have any feedback or if you guys like a
new lighting setup let me know your
feedback in the comment section I would
greatly appreciate it but with that said
let's set up for is begin also guys
before I begin the episode I am
accepting more submissions so if you
want a Scimitar setup for setup Wars
I've said setup so many times
make sure to watch the first make sure
to watch the video
oh also guys I have room for a lot more
setup so if you want to submit and be on
the show make sure to watch the video
linked below it's the very first link in
the description section submissions are
very open so please submit your setup
starting off the show we got our Ken who
is a coder and the purpose of this setup
is for gaming and development he's
walking a two monitor setup featuring
one ultra-right from LG and a 27 inch
from AOC a very unusual layout
considering that the ultra-wide isn't
the main monitor but I'm assuming that
he's using the aoc display for gaming
since it does have a higher refresh rate
and the ultra white is used for
productivity now if this was my setup I
would remove the monitor stand from the
AOC and mount both monitors on a desk
mount with the ultra light on top so
with the monitor mount you can actually
lower both of the displays closer to the
desk and that way the ultra light isn't
too high up there and both monitors
actually kind of level with your eyes
that's actually a much better solution
than putting the ultra wide way over
there on the left side for audio he's
rocking a pair of Logitech Z 120 mini
stereo speakers and the turtlebeach px
22s that are hanging neatly beside his
monitor I like the way that he managed
the wires for both of the keyboard and
mouse this is actually the method I
always recommend to everyone that
doesn't want to drill holes in their
desk it's just so much cleaner than just
running both wires straight across the
desk the cables behind the desk are also
under control thanks to the Signum rack
and that massive backboard that's
blocking everything however I do
recommend using a few velcro straps for
the PC wires so that they are grouped
together just like what you did with
your keyboard mouse and modern wires
speaking of the PC it's rocking an
overclocked 6700 K 16 gigs of Dominator
Platinum's and the asus strix 1080 I'm
guessing he was going for a white and
blue color scheme judging by the gear
and the RGB lights but the wooden desk
and the cat completely throw it off it's
really hard going with a certain colour
scheme while you have a wooden desk but
either way it's a kick-ass set up how
much else I can really recommend thank
you for entering coming all the way from
France we got Charles and his setup
that's used for graphic design motion
design and of course gaming when I first
looked at the pictures I assumed that
Charles is an Apple man and that he was
rocking a MacBook for his setup but
turns out that he's actually part of the
PC master-race
with that custom built rig underneath
his desk it's packing the 4690k and an
MSI GTX 1080 TI very nice specs the desk
is from ikea and it's the popular linman
tabletop and on it we got a nice
contrasting white and black theme going
on he's using a 27-inch philips monitor
that is being flanked by two white
speakers from Logitech and it appears
that he went with wireless peripherals
which is interesting since he said that
this setup is used for gaming also the
cable management is done very well with
the help of the Signum rack and a few
cable ties I don't have any complaints
here I also loved the fact that he kept
a set up a symmetrical with the
stormtrooper helmet on one side and the
IKEA plant on the other another thing I
really like is the convenient access to
the USB hub the charging cable and the
SD card reader that he attached on the
left side of his desk overall it's a
very nice minimalistic and clean setup
that gets the job done
thank you Charles Xavier for entering
from the united kingdom comes Carlos and
his setup built just for gaming the
Samsung ultra light is hooked up to an
arm and below that are a pair of
speakers from Logitech and right off the
bat I'm gonna recommend something that I
saw from the last episode of setup wars
if you want to get those speakers off
your desk so that they are not being
blocked off by your monitor I recommend
picking up two of these tablet holders
and hooking them up to the sides of your
monitor just like how Kaiser did in the
previous episode also on a desk he's got
the razor Deathstalker keyboard and the
our mouse with the Tartarus on the left
side it is a glass tabletop so drilling
a hole in it would be out of the
question however I would recommend
running both of those wires directly
underneath the keyboard and then you can
use a velcro strap to tie all three
cables together for a much cleaner look
instead of just having those three wires
going across your desk the wire
management underneath the desk however
is a lot better the cables have a
certain path and everything is attached
underneath the desk it looks very clean
also down here are the two pair of
headsets that he's using
we got the Kraken pros and the Kraken V
to them from Razer you know what's
interesting that he has all Razer gear
however he doesn't have a Razer theme
set up this is actually the first time
I've seen all Razer gear and not an
eraser themed setup in fact I don't even
think he has a color scheme in mind you
know I'm a huge fan of showing off
posters and paintings on the wall but at
one point it becomes a bit too much if
you start overlapping your posters on
top of each other I personally think it
just makes it look messy the PC powering
the setup looks pretty dope with the
alien figurines inside adding stuff like
this in your PC is actually a great way
to fill up the empty space and kind of
give it some spice a very top gaming
setup nonetheless thank you Carlos for
entering matthias is up next all the way
from Denmark and holy cow for a 15 year
old you did a pretty damn good job it
also says in the notes that he's the CEO
at code F Webb DK and this setup is made
for gaming and work a 15 year old who is
managing his own website and has a
killer setup like this
Wow I mean when I was 15 this was my
setup no joke it was something like this
at a crappy CRT TV and a Nintendo 64
underneath it were like one game no
laptop I had no PC I didn't even have a
phone at the time so yeah it was some
awesome tough times it's crazy to think
that some teenagers out there have crazy
multi-monitor setups and high-end gaming
pcs I mean more power to you Matthias
I'm actually very impressed with what
you were able to achieve at such a young
age if however you actually purchased
these with your own money now if your
parents bought these for you then that's
a different story
anyways okay so the setup features an
ultra right in the middle
in between to 24 inch monitors which are
all from Asus and on the desk he's got
the element mechanical Eagle keyboard
with he lies like g6 out to Mouse and
that's pretty much all that he has on
there aside from his custom-built PC
it's equipped with his 6600 K and the
Radeon r9 390 not bad the setup itself
is very straightforward
it's clean with great cable management
and behind the setup is actually his
console gaming setup featuring a Philips
Smart TV we got some speakers and of
course the ps3 he even has a MacBook Air
for when he needs to go mobile I gotta
say that's one hell of a room setup you
got there for just being 15 years old
either way thinking Mathias for entering
wrapping up the episode we got Stephane
from Germany and his homemade setup
that's built for gaming and
entertainment it's featuring 27 inch
Acer predator we also got the lion cast
elk 830 mechanical keyboard and a
logitech g930 simple setup powered by
his custom built PC that's equipped with
the 3770k
and the msi gtx 1080 the cable
management is on point thanks to a few
cable boxes some cable clips and even
the Signum rack that he hooked up on the
side of his desk that's actually a smart
decision putting the rack on the side
considering that there is no wall behind
his desk to hide the Signum rack
actually I just noticed that he has a
couch in front of his desk in this other
shot so nevermind what I just said I
actually like the way his desk is
positioned it's directly in front of his
TV on the other side so when he wants to
watch something from his setup he can
easily do that instead of moving over to
the couch which by the way is where he
games on his xbox one he's got that
hooked up to the 66 inch curved 4k TV
from Samsung nicely done
it very simple and straightforward setup
