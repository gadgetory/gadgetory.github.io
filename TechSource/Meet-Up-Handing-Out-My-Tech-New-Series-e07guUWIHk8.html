to a quick update video there's a lot of
exciting things happening a lot of
changes here at the headquarters but
before we get into any of that to my
website my other websites tech stores
IMT comm has a completely new design
we've been reading the feedback that you
guys left on the previous video where we
announced the website in the first place
and a lot of guys didn't like the design
of it so we went ahead and fired some
designers we hired some you
I'm just getting we didn't fire anybody
we work together and we completely we
did we completely redesigned the website
and I think you guys are going to like
it it's a lot cleaner it's a lot more
modern check it out I'll double link to
it down below it's got some new features
we even have new category that you guys
wanted us to cover most of the stuff on
there is relatable content that you
probably will be interested in tribes
are if you like my content on YouTube
you will probably love the content on
the website so tell your co-workers tell
your friends tell your family tell the
milkman to check out our website if you
guys are really into tech even consider
bookmarking the website because you do
have articles being uploaded
continuously throughout the week and if
you guys hate reading like I do believe
me I hate reading through articles but
the articles on our website are actually
very short they're concise they go
straight to the point and they don't
waste any time
but anyways I'm very excited about the
new we launched our website check it out
guys let me know what you guys think in
the comments section we do have a
Facebook page as well as a Twitter
account so if you guys are feeling
awesome and do want to help support the
channel dropping by and leaving a like
would be honestly so amazing so thank
you guys so much
all right so moving on to other updates
and speaking of moving on I'm gonna be
moving guys this is going to be the
final video here at this location this
is the apartment I've been living in for
the past almost two years about a year
and a half and I'm moving to Santa
Clarita which is about 30 minutes north
of where I am now because I bought a
home there here's the deal guys I have a
bunch of tech here that's leftover in a
storage that I'm not going to take with
me I'm not going to sell it I'm not
going to give away because shipping will
kill me
because most of these boxes are big so
here's the deal if you guys live in LA
or anywhere near LA and Chatsworth is
pretty close to you and you guys are
willing to come down here I'm going to
be giving away my text I got a crap ton
of PC cases as you guys can see we've
got some keyboard headsets mice a lot of
miscellaneous tech as well
nothing really expensive though I feel
like most of these are under 100 bucks
but maybe we have a few things here
worth a couple hundred but you guys just
gonna have to come down and check it out
I just don't have the use for them and
honestly I'd rather just give it to you
guys I might even give away some PC
parts obviously nothing too extreme I'm
not gonna be giving away ten 80s or tiny
maxes or stuff like that but a lot of
the older tech definitely I'm going to
be giving away like FX processors from
AMD maybe even some cheap motherboards
stuff like that but it just really
depends on the stuff that I'm not going
to take home with me so yeah if you guys
live near la here is the address here's
a time and date Mimi here at this
location this is my actual apartment
I'll bring you over to my unit number
and I'll start giving away giving away
all of my tech depending on how many
people show up I might limit it to three
tech per person but that will depend on
how many people show up and who wants
what even if you guys don't care about
taking home any of the tech and just
want to meet me in person I feel like
it's a really cool and awesome
opportunity to meet a few you guys out
there maybe sign some stuff take
pictures I'll give you guys even a tour
of my apartment and where I did my
videos it's going to be pretty much
empty but I think it'd be pretty cool
behind-the-scenes kind of
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity I would
think but anyways guys information dates
and all that stuff will be linked below
and final update of the video I am
starting a new series and just for fun I
kind of just threw out a random series
idea AK with my voice and just for fun I
threw out this random series idea at one
of my setup wars episodes and the
feedbags holy it's been nothing but
positivity you guys loved the idea so
it's got me thinking a lot more it's got
me thinking that entire day and
coincidentally the next day coolermaster
saw the video and they reached out
immediately and you wanted to team up
they want to team up with me basically
to make this series happen are you guys
ready for this I'm calling it pimp my
setup I can't use that I'm calling it
setup takeover where I go across the
country into people's homes and
completely redo their setup from scratch
I'm talking new desk new freaking PC
monitor keyboard mice the whole shebang
it's going to be an awesome series and I
feel like with the help of Coolermaster
we're going to make this we're going to
make this happen to you guys now I will
be releasing the official announcement
video to take submissions for the setup
makeover series
sometime later this month so end of July
make sure you guys keep your eyes peeled
if you guys want to toss in your
submission again I'm only focusing on
California specifically closer to LA for
the first episode just so I can touch
the waters this is just for this is for
the pilot of the episode for the season
I should say lots of exciting stuff are
happening I cannot contain my excitement
I'm going to be opening up a studio very
soon hiring two full-time members to
help push content we're going to bring
you guys daily uploads just like before
who is texting me a lot of stuff is
happening guys honestly so make sure
you're subscribed to the channel if
you're not already obviously you're
watching this video you probably are
subscribed but anyways thank you guys so
much I love your faces I will see you in
the next one
