to show you the process of unlocking
your Samsung Galaxy s5 mini so you can
use it with any carrier or country for
this demonstration I will be using my
locked 18 t galaxy s5 mini and unlock it
so I can use it on my t-mobile network
but you can use this video as a guide
for any carrier in the world so first
off we need to get the unlock code to
start the unlocking process now there's
a bunch of expensive unlocking websites
out there but the cheapest one that I
use for all my phones is the unlocking
company comm and they also have the
fastest delivery times as well so head
on over to the unlocking company comm
and select your phone manufacturer and
the phone model from the drop down list
and on the next page go ahead and select
the country the phone was originally
purchased from and the carrier of the
phone in my case I purchased it in the
United States and the original carrier
is AT&amp;amp;T so before we continue we do need
the IMEI number of the phone and the way
you look that up on your phone is to
open up the dial pad and enter in star
pound zero six pound once the phone
displays the IMEI number you have to go
back on the website and enter that in
once everything is filled out select get
unlocking code and that will take you to
the final screen where you have to check
out after checking out they will email
you the unlock code the price and the
delivery time of your code varies by
phone but don't worry because as I said
before you are getting the cheapest
price online with the fastest delivery
times so once you receive your unlock
code from the locking company it's time
to unlock your phone before we continue
make sure that the phone is powered off
next go ahead and remove the back cover
and the battery as well so you can gain
access to the SIM tray next insert the
SIM card you want to use with the phone
now I want to use the galaxy s5 mini on
my t-mobile network so I'm putting in my
t-mobile SIM card if your SIM card is a
different size than actual tray you have
to adjust the size in order for it to
work there is a link below to show you
how that's done after you inserted the
SIM card go ahead and put the battery
back in and the backplate and power on
the phone once the phone boots up it
will display an invalid SIM card message
which is fine however once you leave the
lock screen a prompt will appear asking
you for the sim network unlock pin this
is where you enter the unlock code that
you receive from the locking company so
after inputting in the code and hitting
unlock you will get a message stating
that the unlock was successful and your
phone will take you straight to the home
screen and when it does that your phone
is permanently unlocked and you can
begin using it on any GSM carrier as you
can see here I'm using my 18 t galaxy s5
mini on my t-mobile network so that's
how you unlock your Samsung Galaxy s5
mini for any carrier or country if this
