and have a special video for you guys
today so my good friend Peter actually
has a new modded PC desk and going to be
going through some of his previous work
and also showcased a brand new one he
built recently that's going to start so
this is Peters most recent creation and
it's called the TT desk which is an old
glass open-air style PC the main
difference between this desk PC and the
rest of them is that this one is split
into two sides leaving the middle
portion open I honestly like this one a
lot better because you don't have the
keyboard mouse and monitor resting on
top of the desk blocking the view of the
components at least this way the parts
are more visible on one side we have the
6700 K processor 2 Asus GTX 980 Strix
gravis cards and 16 gigs of a fixer
Tesla RAM with the electric style LEDs
on the other side is where the reservoir
and pumps are located along with the
second radiator honestly though the
thing that really made this setup
complete was the badass ROG logo
illuminated through the glass desk from
the ROG ultrawide monitor I can without
a doubt say that this is the best PC
desk that I've ever seen on the channel
but we're not done here guys we're just
warming up next up we have cross which
was one of Peters earliest creations
this is essentially 2 pcs in one desk
since we do have two separate
motherboards and GPUs I don't have the
specs for this build so instead we can
just drool at these high-resolution
photos it also appears that the RAM
sticks are water-cooled and it's safe to
assume that anything that is able to
overclock is most likely overclocked in
terms of storage there actually doesn't
seem to be a lot of space just a lot of
smaller capacity SSDs which are most
likely in a raid configuration my guess
would be for aesthetic reasons I also
like how conveniently placed the knobs
are to control the pump speed off to the
right side a number three we have
something very familiar this is the same
desk tiles featured in setup boards
episode 53 this is the black and neon
green themed desk mod running a 59 60 X
and 2 GTX 980 s and SLI this is
definitely one of those builds that look
a lot cooler at night so this is what I
was talking about earlier guys the
keyboard and mouse are pretty much
blocking the view of the component
inside which is why I much prefer the
previous layout as there aren't that
many things
away and finally we have the razor desk
which is another black and neon green
themed PC again I don't have the specs
so we can just stare at these pictures
with envy I really like the layout of
the reservoirs with the eraser snake
logo on them and it appears that even
the hard drives are water-cooled because
why not after the left side is where the
two graphics cards are located which are
probably gtx 980 s knowing peter and
then we have the storage units right
below a very consistent theme that we
have seen across all of Peters desk mods
also I'm not too sure what's going on
over here on the right side it appears
to be a test bench style setup with a
single graphics card but anyways that is
it for this video you guys can put the
tissue paper away let me know which one
