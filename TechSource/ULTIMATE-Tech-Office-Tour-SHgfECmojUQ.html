Texas and welcome to the long-awaited
office tour this here is the
headquarters of Texas and I'm going to
be giving you guys a quick tour by the
way everything you guys see in this
video will be linked down below in the
order that you see them so it's easy for
you guys to find them so that wasting
any more time let's start the show
alright so starting off the tour I'm
gonna start off from the first entrance
this is where I usually walk in and to
the left of that we have a little clip
here to hold my earphones so whenever
I'm on the way out I can just simply we
have the fruit here and then move on
over here is one of Justin mother's
finest pieces of work lots of you guys
been asking me where I get my wallpapers
from and I get them from Justin Mahler's
website I think it's called facets da la
and you guys can check them out I'll
drop a link down below for you guys but
I basically purchased one of his artwork
and I had it framed and I put it on the
wall just cuz it looks so badass over
here is a bunch of stuff going on but
quickly I'm going to show you my pretty
cool trashcan this is the automated
trashcan for a bunch of lazy people like
myself but basically you hover over it
and it opens up and then slowly closes
which I think it's pretty cool I don't
know why I'm showing you my trashcan but
anyways over here we have a bunch of
bunch of things going on first thing
we'll talk about is the wall of tech
which is a bunch of product boxes EIC
I've used these personally and even for
the channel and I absolutely love the
quality and I guess you can call it the
tech sources approved products because
these are products I enjoy using and I
personally approve their quality that
we've done did I say that so down here
is the docking station that I use for my
smartphones and their basic purpose is
to rest here and charge up until I use
them in my videos for comparison's
there's really no other reason to have
this but I kind of don't want to keep
them locked up in a drawer somewhere and
I figured I would showcase their beauty
by docking em over here
so back here I have some cable drops
hooked up to micro USB cables so I can
use to charge the phones
there's a USB type-c like
Kable basically for all types of
smartphones in case you guys haven't
noticed black and red is my color scheme
and you'll see that throughout the
channel and I'm sure a lot of you guys
are already sick of seeing this color
combo but that is what I'm into and I do
have a custom skin on these they're from
the brands I've used actually a few
other skins before but nothing matches
the level of precision that the brands
offers and if you guys don't believe me
I'll drop a link down below so you guys
can check out for yourself
another cool modification I did with
this table is a hidden drawer down below
here I've attached it to the roof of the
desk and just offers a bunch of storage
space so I have my laptop some power
banks my unboxing knives and some USB
Drive so it's a really cool addition to
any desk really another cool small
modification I did is attach the gh4
battery charger under the desk so
basically which down and I grabbed the
batteries without looking and that kind
of just really cleans up the overall
look of the desk and I kind of memorized
where it goes so bring it down there
snap it in place good to go also moving
further this way is the lounging area or
the gaming area if you call it I got my
PlayStation 4 console over here with the
Nitro charger I've actually mentioned
this in the cool tech September video
but it's like a docking station it's
magnetic it's really cool snap in place
and it charges automatically um this
year is the samsung 55 inch 4k Smart TV
the only purpose of this TV is either
Netflix or YouTube that's basically all
I use it for come here chill on my couch
we have my iPad and I have this hooked
up to the TV so I can pair it with the
YouTube app and I watch my YouTube
videos on here and some occasional
gaming on the PlayStation 4 console
which I'm sure you guys have noticed is
also skin by D bands there was one more
thing I want to show you guys before I
move on and this actually came in a few
weeks ago I haven't had a chance to make
a video on it but this is the 100,000
subscriber silver play button that I
received I was so stoked to get this in
the mail but I can't wait to mount this
at my new place speaking my new place I
haven't actually told us to anyone but
yeah I'm moving out of this office in
November as you can see I'm actually
running out of space to put my products
in and PC parts so that's kind of what's
going to happen in November there will
be a vlog stick around real quickly in
this corner just some minor things here
like some paper plates napkins for food
trash bags and then here are some boxes
for the smartphones that I've used in
the past nothing really special but
let's go to move on to the good stuff on
that side so this is the filming area I
guess you can start off with the lights
I'm using two soft boxes from flora easy
softbox I've done this the hard way but
I've used many cheap lighting before and
they always break down after a few
months so I've learned my lesson I'll
spend a little bit more for lighting
that way it last you a long time I had
this for almost two years now it's been
rock-solid I love the quality on these
so does a few tripods I use for filming
most of these products are from madam
photo because I absolutely love their
quality and that's not a plug I live it
by man photo products I don't know the
name for most of these and I'll have a
link down below but this is the mobile
tripod set up this is what I use to grab
a nice if you walk around with because
it's light as you can see it's got the
camera or slider and another Manfrotto
fluid head but for basic videos that
really don't require much movement this
is the setup I use moving on to the
other complicated setup this is the
other tripod set up I have we got the
photo tripod you got the fluid head and
another fluid on top of the actual
slider this slider is from I footage
this is the carbon-fiber shark slider
with the wireless motorized unit
attached on it
let me guys let me show you guys a quick
demonstration so comes with this really
cool remote control and you can
basically control a wirelessly that's
the point but I want to show you guys
how smooth this thing is I use this for
most of my cinematic videos for the
slide shots and the pans and all that
but come in come a little bit closer you
guys can see how smooth it is you can
adjust it to one millimeter a second
look how look at smooth egos it's
actually moving you can't tell that's
how slow it is you can get closer if you
want so yeah you can adjust the speed
using this controller but the best part
about it is all I need is one take
before I used to use my hand and I would
have to do with multiple takes but use
this one time you're good to go
yeah this is definitely one of the best
investments I made for the channel quite
far so the camera I'm using to film this
video is the Panasonic gh4 which
currently has the wide angle lens
attached to it but I also have the Sigma
18 to 35 millimeter with the meta bones
feed booster as well and I use that for
on camera videos and close-up shots but
if I want a cinematic style video the
wide-angle lens is definitely my go-to
lens so I'm liking what I used to record
my on camera videos is the Sennheiser or
Sennheiser I should say MK m KH 416 I
can't even say that but yeah this is a
really good microphone and solid I use
this for set up Wars PC Wars and every
time you guys see my face in front of a
camera it's adjustable and it's pretty
cool stand so I can get the right angle
for my shots the microphone I'm using to
record this video is actually the h5
zoom which is attached to the gh4 right
now so it may not be as crispy so I
mentioned this before this is the atomic
Shogun 4k monitor that I use attached to
the gh4 it's an external recorder that
records on an SSD and also outputs
10-bit color it has an awesome 1080p
display and it's honestly one of the
best things I've purchased for the
channel and I strongly recommend this
for anyone
making videos last but not least this is
the table that I do my inbox scenes and
reviews on this is the boy desk
it's the adjustable desk I'm sure you
guys have seen as many times my previous
videos but anyways yeah this is
basically the filming area this is where
all the videos get done and shot moving
on to the production and gaming area
this is my setup I'm not going to go too
much into death here because I do have a
video on my setup tool you guys can
check out by clicking on the link to the
top right of the screen and I think as
where it is so I got the 34 inch ultra
wide curved monitor from LG this thing
is hooked up to the ergo tech arm which
can do a lot of pretty sweet things you
can lift it up you can rotate this you
can even bring it out yeah absolutely
love this map you can basically do
anything we can even tilt it this is the
custom PC that is essentially powering
tech source I did a video on this as
well but it's a custom painted custom
made PC I call it big red it has two 780
is a 49 30 K CPU bunch of good stuff in
there definitely check out the video
here I want info one thing I do want to
show you before I leave is the LEDs I
installed on the setup these are from
friends of Hugh and I can control them
with my smartphone it's pretty sweet
actually did feature this in my cool
tech video once again the link will be
up there you guys want to check that out
but I usually keep it on the red color
to match my overall theme this year is
my dxracer chair that was sent in to me
a few weeks ago absolutely love this
shirt I don't know why I didn't pick one
up earlier it's great for gaming it's
great for productivity it's got lumbar
support and also support for the head or
neck up here but yeah this is basically
where I game and get work done
my neat little station which is also on
a desk like before alright so moving on
to the second desk area this is a Bob
station this is my alternate backup
station where basically what gets done
we have a hundred thirty four inch ultra
wide curved monitor we have it on the
Flex stand which is an equivalent to the
Ergo tech arm it does the exact same
thing it just looks cooler and it's in
black so you can twist it you can rotate
this you can bring it out lots of really
cool stuff with this thing of course our
products down here we got the another
Logitech MX wireless mouse that's Z on
the $650 PC I built for October which is
going to be giving away video coming up
soon and this is actually one of the
really cool desks I have this is called
a stand esque and it's just like the
vertex but it's more advanced I would
say there are some dedicated buttons
over here that you can select that are
pre-configured so let's say if I want
number two press number two and it will
automatically raise the desk to that
configurate setting so you basically
don't have to constantly hold your hand
here to raise it up which is pretty cool
it also has an automatic function so if
you hold down the button for a second
and let go it will basically go all the
way down until it stops and the same way
upwards so yeah this is the second
station aka Bob station where he gets
videos on for text source what's up with
the wallpaper though LaBeouf's a legend
dude alright
whatever alright so by finally moving on
to the final area of the office the
poker table so yeah this is the
executive poker table that you guys
would see in Vegas but it's not as fancy
of course we got cup holders for the
players around we would have poker
nights sometimes in the weekends but
lately we've been slacking on our poker
game over here is the lockbox where all
the chips are and these are I think 14
grams I'm not really sure about the
weight but these are really high quality
poker chips so yeah that's basically it
for the poker table not much really to
talk about there and now I guess we can
talk about the insurance one more time
so we have a mini fridge over here which
most likely has nothing in it that
matters I saw it's been there since we
moved in it's like a year and a half old
we have a microwave to heat things up of
course and a little table here right
next to the entrance or exit if you way
if you may this little valley tray VIP
here I keep my sunglasses and my keys on
it's just a nice place to keep these
that way I don't lose track of them I
can just simply grab it and then head on
out
so that's kind of what the purpose of
this is yeah it's basically night that's
the office I hope you guys enjoyed the
video if you did let me know by hitting
that like button I recently had 300,000
subscribers and I owe it to you guys
thank you so much for your support none
of this would even be possible without
you guys so thank you guys so much for
your support I love you
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
