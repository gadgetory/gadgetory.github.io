episode 24 where you submit your custom
PC to get featured on the channel I know
it's been ages since last episode guys I
can only do these series if I have time
because I'm working on other more
important projects so please hang in
there I'm not canceling PC Wars like I
said in the previous episode but anywho
let's not waste any more time and let
the PC wars begin
also guys if you have a badass pc you
want to be on the show make sure to
watch the video linked below it will
tell you exactly what to do to enter
alright so starting up the show we got
death sit from Aaron which is running on
a 59 30 K 16 gigs of RAM some cursor and
an EVGA gtx 980ti in a custom loop it
kind of looks like a military themed pc
with that gunmetal case and army green
liquid the case he is using is from case
labs and it's the SAS model really great
work with the cable management as well
for benchmarks that scored 17,000 to 31
starting the episode strong Thank You
Aaron for entering next up is Peter with
a gorgeous black and red custom loop
inside these antics evolve ATX case this
beast is running on a 6700 K and 2 EVGA
GTX 10 70s in SLI I feel like if you
painted the sli bridge red as well it
would have completed the look because it
kind of sticks out right now the
benchmarks are scored 24,000 to 33
already taking first place for this
episode a pretty straightforward black
and red water-cooled build thank you
Peter for entering you guys might know
dead John from the incredible nature
build from episode 13 that blew everyone
out of the water well now he's back
again but this time with his number one
best-selling novel all about
Coolermaster this thing is a PC guys I
don't think I've ever seen a more
realistic paint job than this apparently
it's airbrushed on actual wheel leather
he even went of his way to take pictures
in a library of some sort
Bravo I gotta give you props on the
presentation take a look inside you will
find a 6600 K and an asus rog rx4 70
which isn't anything to be excited about
but god damn is this an awesome modded
PC or what unfortunately I don't have
any benchmarks to show you guys but we
can assume it'll be near the bottom with
a single Rx for 70 regardless it's nice
to see you again Vijay and thank you so
much for blessing my eyeballs with this
now here's a pretty sick overwatch
themed PC from Ray he's calling it Black
Watch Widowmaker and his features the
6700 K 32 gigs of ram and two gtx 1080s
in sli we got custom sleeving a custom
backplate custom painted at the library
which
looks very clean and the bottom and
front panels are also custom-made it's
also very refreshing to see a black and
purple build for benchmarks that scored
twenty four thousand nineteen barely
getting beat by Peters PC and taking
second place for this episode mad props
on this build and thank you for
answering so the last PC had an
overwatch team and now this PC has a
doom theme this is called the doom
machine
it's rocking a sixty six hundred K 16
gigs of ram and two gtx 980ti s
in SL eyes those are definitely some
sick looking back plates which he had
made himself by the way props on that as
well as the painted sli bridge that
looks pretty dope although it won't
score higher than 210 eighties it sure
as hell looks dope and thank you SAS for
entering so that is it for this episode
