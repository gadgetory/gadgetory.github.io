functional PC build that acquires pure
bass 680 X Tower as what you're looking
for it's completely sound insulated with
gambling materials in all the relevant
places features a modular design with
removable OD d and hard drive bays for
various cooling solutions and it comes
pre-installed with two pure wings two
fans one of the things I love about this
case is the cable management area there
are plenty of pass throughs and grommets
to help with cable management something
I don't often see in most cases the pure
bass 600 comes with a three year
warranty and it's available in black and
silver accents if you want to learn more
check out the first link down below so
entitles the seventh gen CPUs are
finally here and I'm kind of late to the
party and that's because I couldn't get
my hands on them but Intel was kind
enough to send me a few units a few
weeks back so in this video we're going
to be comparing the i-5 7600 K against
the i7 at 7700 K on both stocks and
overclocked frequencies also guys in a
separate video on we comparing the G
4560 against the i3 7350 carry since
both of them are dual-core processors
but yeah with that said and done let's
dive right into the video so before I
even get into the benchmarks let's take
a look at the new Z 270 platform and
what it offers compared to the last
generation is v 170 skylake platform for
starters it provides an additional four
PCI lanes which may not see much but it
can definitely aid builders that want to
use multiple m dot 2 slots since
sometimes these are disabled depending
on which PCIe slot you occupy on the
motherboard the other difference is that
the Z 270 boards will now support
Intel's obtain technology the obtain
drive that connects via PCI instead of
theta will have improved file access
times which means faster transfer speeds
and boot up times so the second 600k
will cost you $240 and it's an unlocked
quad-core CPU with a base frequency of
3.8 gigahertz
while the 7700 carry will cost you $250
this too is a quad-core CPU plus with a
higher base clock coming in at 4.2
gigahertz the test fret i'm using
features the new already 270 gaming 9
motherboard 16 gigs of ram from crucial
an EVGA gtx 1084 the win to ensure that
there is no tree
few bottlenecking and finally the be
quiet dark rock pro three and cooler I
did manage to push both CPUs to 5
gigahertz even the 76 in Newark area
with a core voltage of one point three
eight and one point two seven five on
the 7700 K on idle both processors are
fairly cool hovering around 30 degrees
Celsius even when overclocked however I
did notice that the 77 GK got pretty hot
while rendering it reached times of 73
degrees while the 7600 K stayed in the
low-60s rendering out a 60 second 4k
file in handbrake using the h.264 codec
took about 2 minutes and 12 seconds on
the 7600 K while it took a minute and 38
on the 7700 K which is about 25 percent
faster
however when overclocked the gap
increases there's almost a 40 percent
difference in render speeds render times
on sony vegas however don't have a large
gap compared to handbrake the same file
took three minutes and 57 seconds only
7700 while it took 4 minutes and 35 on
the 7600 that's only 14% difference in
speed for stock and only 9 percent when
overclocked so we can see that the gap
gets smaller after we overclocked both
CPUs obviously these numbers strongly
depend on the length of the video being
rendered as well as the editing software
you are using the point of these
benchmarks is to show you guys the
difference and render times between
these two CPUs now let's take a look at
gaming benchmarks starting off we have
GTA 5 and high settings there seems to
be a 34 frame difference between the two
on stock frequencies that's a 25% FPS
increase if you go to 7700 K however if
you take a look at the overclocked
benchmarks we can see that the gap
narrows down to only a 14% difference
next up is Metro last light the 7600 K
is showing a 9 SPS spike after
overclocked
while the 7700 carry only received a for
FPS bump
still there's around 20% difference in
FPS between the two
overclocked or not ashes of the
singularity is the third game I tested
as no surprise that the 7700 once again
showing a noticeable lead in frame it's
proving to be the obvious choice when it
comes to the best performance but we're
going to be taking a look at the
performance per dollar at the end of
this episode to see how
bang we are actually getting out of
these CPUs not a huge difference on
hitman for the overclocked scores but
once again a 10 FPS lead from the 7700 K
on the stock frequency and finally we
got to later however the benchmarks kind
of made no sense to me it appears that
the overclocked scores were lower than
these stocks frequencies for some
reasons but the game is GPU heavy which
makes sense that the scores were very
similar taking a look at the performance
per dollar we can see that the 7600 K
will give you the most bang for your
buck points 42 frames per dollar
while the 7700 K offers only point 34
and the same goes for the overclocked
results as well the decision is very
simple here if you want the most
performance out of the two and you edit
lots of videos then the 77 ZK is for you
however if you're on a budget and you
want the best bang for your buck CPU and
gaming is what you use your PC for
mainly and the 7600 K is the ideal
choice especially if you overclock it
but anyways I'll drop a link to both of
the CPUs down below if you guys want to
check them out a huge thanks to Intel
for sending these in for review and if
you guys want to see a build using one
of these processors let me know by
dropping a like on a video and let me
know which processor I should use and
build by leaving your comments down
below thank you guys so much for
watching I hope this video was helpful
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
