your 5 lucky contestants we have Abdul
Bogdan Chris Lane and Jes
congratulations for making it on the
show so starting up the episode we have
Abdul and his build inside the BitFenix
pandora case finally a tower that hasn't
been featured on the show yet I think so
we have a black silver and gold theme
going on over here which is refreshing
to see we also have the i-5 6600 8 gigs
of ram and NZXT cracking x31 cooler with
the EVGA GTX 970 some custom mods
include a custom acrylic GPO backplate
painted thumb screws a custom PSU shroud
and Vanille stickers on the RAM GPU fans
SSD and even a CPU cooler I really like
that backplate it's very sleek I just
wish you didn't have to tape it from the
front
no benchmark scores from Abdul so this
PC is not eligible for the best PC of
2016 but anyways thank you for entering
holy jellybeans Batman take a look at
this joker color scheme build from
Bogdan I'm not so sure why you would
name it placid but this is one
sexy-looking rig it's rocking the
skylake 6700 K which is overclocked to
4.6 and it's paired with the ACS gtx
980ti Poseidon GPU it also has 32 gigs
of RAM which is water cooled by the way
in case you guys missed that and
everything is packed nicely inside in
fantex and through evolve ATX case 4
benchmarks Placid scored a 16,000 333
automatically taking first place for
this episode the mods are quite obvious
Plasti Dip extension covers GPU cooler
and even a tiny motherboard fan is
plasti dipped in paint since when the
mother wars have fans no but seriously
it's the small things that attention to
detail that really make this build
unique like the painted square on the
Samsung SSD SATA cable clip and there's
even a layer film in front of the PSU to
better match the color scheme job well
done Bogdan thank
for entering chris is next up with a
black and white build inside the NZXT h
440 case we have a 4790k at 4.4 and an
msi gtx 980ti with custom white sleeping
we also have 16 gigs of Dominator
platinum and h100 GTX to keep the CPU
cool and my good friend Kyle Oh chillin
on top of the GPU some custom mods
include the acrylic GPU backplate and
fangirls from v1 tech we also have
sleeved cables from cable mod and a GPU
support contraption from puget or Puget
systems I'm not so sure why it's not
mentioned in the notes but it appears
that the case is wrapped in some carbon
fiber as well the benchmarks the PC
scored a fifteen thousand twenty one
taking second place but overall a badass
black and white build from Chris thank
you for entering next up we have lane
with a razor themed PC inside the in win
909 case we have another 6700 K but this
time with two gtx 980ti s and sli black
and green sleeve cables from M sourced

twenty one thousand nine sixty nine

episode but a very clean and powerful
razor thing PC Thank You Lane for

very popular we have a 6600 K clocks
24.6 and a GTX 770 inside the corsair
750 be case some mods including carbon
fiber PSU cover and painted parts like
the corsair fan wings decal on the SSD
