to take to get on the island
Gareth in or get off in however you say
and then it's pretty cool the LA except
lining stuff we append the dolphin
and it's a lot of cool activities so
can't wait it's gonna be fine
all right so I guess we're gonna go
snorkeling first just because we're
super hot and then afterwards hugging
was the blinding and then explore the
rest of the park so hope you guys
enjoyed the vlogs I'm trying to get as
much footage as I can and that's the
same time I'm trying to enjoy this trip
as well so I hope you guys
water is so clean I like it because
there's not many people around it's just
basically us and then the other half
it's like barely anybody here but that
again we do have the VIP pass
there is that 2% so I'm have to put this
back in the locker and get my little 6s
plus and recorded that so yeah again
marked for disappointment
so now we're here at the other park
where we can swim with dolphins so it's
gonna be pretty fun I don't know if I'm
allowed to bring my camera but I will do
my best to try and record everything
so I guess these are like the little
areas where you
people
obviously getting fresh I wouldn't
alright guys so now it is day five here
in Cancun and this is the last day here
in Mexico so I'm gonna be taking our
flights back home tomorrow around two
o'clock so when I try and enjoy the
lecture today I think it's gonna be
chillin by the pool for a few hours I'm
probably go and jet ski a little bit and
then later on we have a spa and then
dinner and then that's pretty much it
for today so also I'm really sorry for
not bringing the camera yesterday to the
dolphin experience they're really strict
on cameras because you know they gotta
gotta make their money so we were forced
to buy their photos instead of bringing
out on camera so I'll probably post some
pictures somewhere on the screen you
guys when I check that out but it was
honestly an incredible experience
definitely something you should you guys
should do at least once in your life it
just you know I have experience with
dolphins and stuff but yeah overall an
awesome time here in Cancun this is
definitely needed just to take a break
from YouTube and stuff like that but
anyways I'm done rambling and now I'm
gonna go downstairs in the pool I'll
bring you guys with me let me know if
you guys enjoy watching these vlogs by
leaving a like if you do enjoy watching
these I'll definitely continue to do
these wherever I go but anyways guys
I'll see you soon so we just had our
breakfast Briana's getting dressed so we
can go to the pool in a few minutes I
hope and she got bit way above
she got bid right there
I saw back here at the hotel after a
long day at the pool and jet skiing was
definitely a fun day
it's 5:30 p.m. right now and our spa
appointment is at 6:00 that lasts till 9
p.m. and Brianne was to go out around
10:30 so I don't know what we're gonna
do her excuses it's the last day in
Cancun we should go out and have fun and
go all out but I don't know we're gonna
do honestly cuz I'm really exhausted I
just wanna get some rest before I before
we head to the airport at one o'clock
tomorrow but almost getting hungry so I
don't know we're gonna do but we want to
spawn first and then I guess decide
afterwards
this is pretty nice
oh honey and full-body their whole body
over here go
marry equinox unlike me 200
they found me and my sister here because
they're both getting the tissue and they
thought or a couple and had told her I'm
a sister so they what they get Breanna
now because she's getting Swedish and
I'm getting the big tissue so it's two
different massages but this is a setup
right now
pretty romantic I would say got some
candles over there in the wall sink area
two and a half years of doing YouTube I
need this
