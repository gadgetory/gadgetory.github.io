gotta let you know that nice is having a
Cyber Monday special just for my
subscribers by now most of you guys are
probably familiar with the nice app it's
where you can watch my videos early find
amazing deals and try some really cool
tech for free the best part is that the
app is free and it combines the best of
shopping and watching videos from any
other youtubers so make sure you guys
click on the link down below if you're
interested in checking out the app and
maybe save some money on Cyber Monday
alright so before we get into the juicy
deals anchor is having a cyber week deal
on their products from portable chargers
wall charger speakers iPhone cases and a
bunch more the discount codes are listed
on the page so all you guys need to do
is click on the product which will take
you to Amazon and then you can check out
using their discount code on top of that
anchor is doing a daily giveaway so if
you guys sign up you'll be eligible to
enter anchors daily giveaways I'll drop
a link with more details and the link to
their page down below so definitely
check them out guys so for example one
of the deals on their website is their
power drive - which is an advanced car
charger that features power IQ which
provides the fastest possible charge up
to 2.4 amps per port if you put in a
discount code you can pick it up for
only $6 next up is a solid budget gaming
headset from said's that features a
flexible microphone and it's compatible
with PCs Xbox one and the ps4 but if you
guys put this code in you can save 10%
off this headset bringing the total down
on their $20 here's another cool deal on
a wireless gaming mouse from habit so it
features seven buttons and three LED
colors to match your setup and based on
the reviews you can't go wrong picking
this up especially at $20 but if you
guys want 25% off make sure to use this
code which will bring the total down to
$15 making it one of the best deals out
there for a wireless gaming mouse eBay
is killing it with their cyber monday
deals in fact most of these might be
already sold out by the time you guys
are watching the video but regardless
here they are so the first deal is a 34
inch ultrawide monitor going for 250
dollars now this is a 2560 by 1440 P
display that features free sync not the
best for gaming but for productivity and
casual gaming it is perfect there's also
a canon pixma color printer with scanner
and copy
going for $41 which is currently 72% off
and the reason why I'm recommending this
printer compared to the others is
because their ink is much cheaper if you
buy in bulk I personally use a Pixma
myself an unlocked note for is going for
a ridiculous price of a hundred and
sixty dollars but keep in mind that this
is refurbished but regardless it's a
hell of a deal the Logitech G 9/10 orion
spectrum mech keyboard is also
discounted to ninety dollars this exact
same keyboard is going for one hundred
and forty dollars on amazon and features
full RGB lighting macro keys and a spot
to hold your smartphone which is pretty
cool the new google chromecast is not
only discounted to twenty-five dollars
but also comes with three months of HBO
now for free this thing is sold over
16,000 units and it's almost depleted
and finally on eBay is the popular 6600
K quad-core processor which is excellent
for mid-range gaming PC's and it sold
more than 95% of stock so apologies if
it's already depleted by the time you
guys are watching this video but those
shopping around for a solid
plug-and-play microphone and check these
deals out the snowball ice microphone is
going for 40 dollars which is normally
around 50 dollars and if you guys want
to hear some sound test check out my top
5 microphone video under $50 which I'll
link down below this was actually the
best sounding microphone compared to the
other four featured if you guys have a
bit more to spend then the blue Yeti is
the next best choice for around $100
perfect for voiceovers screaming and
even recording music right now it's at
the best price ever as always Amazon is
having a sale on their own devices so
the Amazon tap is $40 off and their echo
is $10 off for my Sony boys out there
the DualShock 4 controller is going for
a ridiculous price of $34 which is the
lowest I've seen on these normally they
would be discounted only by $10 so I
decided to grab two of these for backup
speaking of consoles the Xbox one s 500
gigabyte minecraft bundle is going for
only 212 dollars the regular 500
gigabyte xbox slim goes for $300 so this
is a really awesome price this is the
perfect gift for Christmas for your
younger relatives or maybe you guys have
children out there but definitely snag
it now while it's this cheap the popular
UE boom 2
speaker is going for $130 and there are
a few deals on mice this time around the
Logitech g600 2 which is going for $40
the Razer DeathAdder chroma for $48 and
the Roccat Italian Gaming Mouse for a
solid 50 bucks
if you guys remembered the video I did
on this a few weeks ago but didn't pull
the trigger on it yet then you're in
luck because it dropped in price by $200
making it the best drum you can buy for
this price tag but just in case you guys
did buy it a few weeks back you can
actually return it back to Amazon and
buy this one instead if you want to save
200 bucks a jaybird X tubes are still
the same price since Black Friday still
making it the best pair of Wireless buds
for that price point finally let's take
a look at some awesome GPU deals now
first up is the cheapest GT X 1080 that
you will find anywhere guaranteed the
MSI GTX 1080 is going for five hundred
and seventy-five dollars after a male
and rebate you guys won't find a cheaper
ten eighty anytime soon if you guys have
a bit less to spend then check this deal
out instead I did find one of the
cheapest 1070 s available online so this
one happens to be one of my favorite
GPUs as well the EVGA 1070 Super clock
Edition then there's the gigabyte g1
gaming 1070 also for $400 so it depends
on what color scheme you're going with
that matches your current build for the
people that have budgets out there the
XFX RX 484 gigabyte variant is currently
the cheapest rx 4ad out right now coming
in at just 210 dollars as opposed to 240
dollars from other brands and finally on
Amazon we have another deal on the AR X
480 from gigabyte
but with a slightly higher core clock
and this will cost you $10 more than the
XFX but in the form of a rebate these
last five deals from you egg are all PC
parts as well first up is the cursor h
115 i cpu cooler going for $95 after a
mail-in rebate then we have the 6800 k-6
core processor which is still on sale
since Black Friday coming in at 380
dollars and then there are three more
GPU deals the XFX rx 480 at $210 which
is actually a better deal than the 4
gigabyte from Amazon since this one is
the same price but you get 8 gigabyte of
memory and
stead here's another awesome deal on a
gtx 1080 from gigabyte is going for six
hundred and thirty dollars now this is a
much faster 1080 with a higher clock
speed compared to the msi armor at 575
which we just looked at so in the
scenario you are paying a little more
for performance speaking of gigabytes
they also have a deal on their 1070 and
it's actually cheaper than the one on
amazon by fifteen dollars assuming you
guys are okay with email and rebate and
the reason why i include multiple deals
of the same card is in case the other
one is sold out so those are all the
best deals I've found for cyber monday
if you guys live in the UK or canada
make sure to check out the links down
below I will leave some really awesome
deals for you guys as well and also guys
make sure to bookmark deals or tech
because we will continue to upload daily
tech deals throughout the rest of this
week for cyber monday and there will be
awesome deals for UK in Canada as well
thank you so much for watching I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
