this video we showing you how to build
your very own badass project gaming PC
around $350 this is a step by step guide
from the beginning all the way till the
end guys I'm gonna be showing you how to
flash the BIOS as well as install
windows if you guys want to see how this
PC performs make sure to watch my
benchmarks video that I did a few weeks
back I'll have a link down below so now
that you have all your parts needed to
build the PC you need to make sure you
have all the correct tools the
screwdriver is needed obviously and a
large flat surface to work on having an
anti-static mat or wrist strap isn't
really necessary unless this is your
first time building and wants to be
extra cautious I'm going to drop a few
good ones down below as well for you so
step one is to install the CPU into the
motherboard so grab the g 4560 or
whatever CPU you are using for your PC
and make sure the Golden Triangle on the
processor is facing the triangle that's
sketched on the motherboard generally
grab the CPU biocides and place it down
without touching the surface area do not
apply any pressure it should just fall
in place once it sits flush inside the
socket lower down the cover and lock it
in place the black cover should pop
right off so don't freak out if it does
if you're not installing an aftermarket
cooler then proceed to grab the stock
heatsink that came with the processor
and make sure that the Intel logo is
facing right side up just like in the
video you need to align the four pins on
the heatsink to the four holes on the
motherboard
afterwards gently lower the heat sink
down evenly while making sure the pins
match with the holes on the motherboard
once the heat sinks just on the CPU
press down on each of the pins until you
hear them snap in place feel free to
make sure that it's nice and snug by
pulling on the heatsink that way the
entire motherboard lifts up make sure
all four the pins are inserted into the
holes as you guys can see here I'm kind
of a noob and I didn't check one of the
pins while making this video so I have
to go back and obviously snap it back in
place next we're going to connect the
fan to the motherboard so we have the
white connector and insert it inside the
socket labeled CPU underscore fan one
which should be directly above it now
it's time to install the RAM so if you
have two sticks then obviously put both
of them in the
Lots but if you have one then put it in
the first slot make sure you put
pressure with both of your hands and
press down equally until it snaps in
place and the notch is fully seated so
for the rest of the build we're going to
be needing the screws inside the tiny
bag that's hanging from the case so go
ahead and remove that and take out four
of these screws that are needed to
install the motherboard but before we
even do that we need to install the i/o
shield so grab that out of the
motherboard box and snap it in the back
of the case make sure the three circle
cutouts are closest to the bottom of the
case while you're doing this once all
four corners snap in place it's time to
slide in the motherboard gently lower it
down and align the rear ports with the
cutouts from the i/o shield then we can
go ahead and screw in the motherboard
there should be one hole in each corner
so a total of four use the four screws
that we took out of the bag earlier for
this once the motherboard is secured
down it's time to hook up the power
supply so take that out of the box and
with the fan facing down slide it to the
top cutout of the case
next you need to take out four of these
screws to keep the power supply secured
at the top since we're back here let's
remove to the PCIe brackets so it
doesn't get in the way of our GPU when
it comes time for that the ones you're
gonna have to remove are the second and
third one you can simply bend them back
and forward until they get loose enough
and then you can just pull them out
that's what she said the case has two
spots for SSD which is really easy just
put it flat against the back with the
holes facing down and then screw them in
from the other side of the case now if
you're using a hard drive like me then
you have to slide it in the bottom rack
with the internals facing down then you
can proceed to screw it in place by
aligning the holes with the hard drive
on the opposite side of the case insert
the final screw to secure the hard drive
in place so we're pretty much done here
all you have to do is hook up the cables
and snap on the GPU so let's start off
with the hard drive
grab the SATA power cable that looks
like this coming from the power supply
and hook it up to the back of the hard
drive then grab the black SATA cable
that we took from a motherboard box and
insert one end to the back of the hard
drive and hook the other end to the SATA
ports on the motherboard either one of
the four slots over here work now let's
go ahead and hook up both of the fans
before we forget them so grab
front and the rear fan cables and hook
them up together like this using the
molex connectors do not touch the other
connector zombies next up is the USB 3
cable which has a blue tip this one goes
right below the 24 pin socket near the
edge of the motherboard you can't miss
it next cable is labeled HD audio when
this one goes way in the back right
below the i/o shield hook this up to the
pins labeled HD audio one on the
motherboard then we have the regular USB
2 cable and this one goes right below
the USB 3 cable that we just connected
earlier remember guys if it doesn't fit
then you are either putting it in the
wrong way or it doesn't belong there
every plug or cable belongs to a
specific socket now it's time for these
annoying connectors you can also refer
to the manual to see a clearer diagram
of how to connect them in case you guys
need it and there's even a smaller
diagram right on the motherboard but
I'll show you guys here as well the
first cable is the HDD LED and this one
goes on the bottom right two pins with
the words facing to the right next up is
the power LED plus and minus cables and
these go to the left of the HDD cable we
just connected but basically start from
the bottom and make sure to connect the
positive cable first and then the
negative one right on top of that next
one is the power switch and this one
goes right above the power LEDs that
we've just connected and it doesn't
matter which direction this one goes in
finally we can put in the reset switch
and this one goes to the right of the
power switch that we just connected
again it doesn't matter which direction
you put this in the next cable we are
connecting is to power the CPU sockets
so we have the two four pin connectors
labels of CPU and plug this into the
socket right above the CPU heatsink now
we can hook up the giant 24 pin cables
needed to power the entire motherboard
this one is really hard to miss because
it is the biggest cable obviously and
the final cable we are plugging in is
the molex connector which is needed to
power both of the fans hook this one up
to the other two molex plugs that we
connected earlier for the front and rear
fans again it doesn't matter if you plug
this in the front or in the back it's
all the same so now we're ready to plug
in the GPU so grab your graphics card
and slide it into the bottom PCI slot
make sure it snaps in place and that the
metal
brackets sits flush with the case to see
to tighten the GPU in place using at
least one of the screws that was
provided with the case once the GPU is
secured grab the final cable which is
labeled PCIe and plug it into the GPU so
that's pretty much it your PC should
look like leftover spaghetti he can take
this time to cable manage if you like
all I did for mine was wrap the cables
together and shove them into the odv
cage up there for the sake of finishing
this video on time you guys can actually
use the back of the PC and wrap the
cables through there as well for a much
cleaner look alright so now it's time to
install Windows and flash the BIOS so
you guys are going to need a USB Drive
for at least 8 gigs of space you also
have to buy a CD key before we go any
further guys whether you are paying full
price for it or grabbing it for a lot
cheaper on the reddit CD key swapper it
doesn't matter just make sure you select
the version of Windows that you want to
install so for this PC I'll be
installing windows 10 pro I'll drop a
link to the CD key swapper if you guys
want to pick one up for really cheap
next we're going to need the windows ISO
file so click on the windows media tool
link down below which will take you to
this website now listen carefully guys
there are two links down there one of
them is for Windows 10 and the other one
is for Windows 8.1 so click on the link
that applies to your PC once the program
is downloaded go ahead and open it up
and follow the instructions at this time
please plug in your USB stick into your
current PC not the one we are building
we're going to click on create
installation media for another PC and
then click on next and then select the
USB flash drive option select the USB
Drive that we are going to install the
files onto and then hit next again and
wait for the download to complete once
it's complete you'll get a message
stating that your USB Drive is ready to
go so just hit finish and remove your
USB sticks now you can take the USB
drive and plug it into your new PC and
boot it up now if your PC doesn't
automatically boot from a USB Drive and
gives you an error stating that there is
no boot device then you have to restart
the PC and hit f11 so you can get into
the boot menu so once you restart your
PC and hit f11 continuously it will take
you straight to the boot menu so from
here select the USB Drive that's
connected to your PC and it will take
you straight to the Windows installation
setup
now the USB device doesn't show up here
that means you didn't plug in the USB
connector to your motherboard so we
watch that part of the video to make
sure you did it correctly you can also
try putting it in a different USB port
so try one of the ports behind the PC
instead so once you get to the setup
page enter the CD key that you purchased
and hit next make sure to select the
correct Windows version that you want
installed otherwise your key won't
activate so I bought the Windows 10 Pro
key so that's the version I selected in
this video hit next and then you'll have
two options here so make sure you select
the custom option instead of upgrade and
over here you have to select which
storage device you want windows
installed on if you have an SSD I
strongly recommend installing you OS on
the SSD but if you only have a hard
drive like me then select the hard drive
option and hit next if you're using an
old hard drive with files on it then a
message will appear stating that you
will overwrite all the files if you
continue so just make sure you don't
have anything important on there before
proceeding let the PC do its thing and
finish up the installation process and
once it's all done it will take you
straight to the desktop and you are
pretty much almost done with the entire
build now it's time to install the
drivers and then flash the BIOS
afterwards I drop links to all the
drivers that you're going to need to
install so all you have to do is click
on them and they will automatically
download make sure you extract each one
of them and install all the files if you
want your PC to work properly
installing the GPU driver is very easy
if using in a video card click on the
g-force link below and if you're
installing an AMD card click on the AM
billion now that all the drivers are
installed it's time to flash your BIOS
so take a new USB Drive or you can even
use the same one that you installed
windows on and make sure you format it
before we continue you can either
download the BIOS file directly by
clicking on the link below or visit the
azrog website and click on the BIOS
download link and then click on the
instant flash version once that's
downloaded open the folder and extract
the file to your USB Drive take the USB
drive plug it in to your new PC and boot
it up while hitting the delete key
immediately this will take you to the
BIOS menu and from here all you have to
do is click on the instant flash icon
from the main menu and let it install
once complete it will reboot your PC and
take you to the desktop and you are
officially done congratulations for
building
our very own gaming PC so if you guys
enjoyed this video please leave a like
as it does help me out a ton making a
video like this definitely takes a lot
of time and I hope you guys enjoyed it
thank you so much for watching I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
