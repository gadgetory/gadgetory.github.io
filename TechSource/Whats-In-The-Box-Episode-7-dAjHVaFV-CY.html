Texas and welcome to another episode of
what's in the box now the reason why I'm
wearing this hat is because my hair was
a mess and I can't fix it so I apologize
if you're cringing but I assure you that
you'll be cringing even more if you were
to see my hair thank you train all right
now the train is gone as you can see we
have a buttload of boxes and we have a
massive one right here in front of me
now normally I would start from the
small boxes and move our way up to the
big boxes but I need to get this out of
the desk because it's pretty much
covering the entire surface area so
ladies and gentlepeople let's get this
going
now the cops
the struggles real oh yeah we have to
stand up for this one there was
literally a small box inside a huge one
there was a lot of padding though yes
baby that's what I'm talking about guys
we got the what is this even not a name
the unique typhoon H which is the other
high-end drone I'm going to be comparing
against the DJI phantom4 like I
mentioned last week
I don't even want to get this out of the
box so apparently this one comes in a
Styrofoam type briefcase as well just
like the DJI phantom4 so let's check
this out
we had a nice stealthy looking black
journal honestly this looks a lot better
or a lot cooler than the e GI phantom 4
Wow
carbon fiber legs guys check that out
that is pretty sick so rest of the stuff
in here are basically dischargers and
the blades and remote holy crap just the
remote Jesus Christ this thing is
massive whoa oh I know why it's massive
because I guess this comes there comes
with its own screen whereas the Phantom
4 we actually need to put in your own
tablet or smartphone so that's pretty
cool definitely excited to give this
thing a go and see how well it compares
to the Phantom 4 video coming up in a
few weeks alright so moving on to the
next biggest box we're going backwards
today
I also want to address a concern that
you guys had in the past few episodes so
a lot of guys are upset that I'm getting
these products for free that is not the
case okay I'm getting these products in
exchange for my service
so ya guys are sent as review purposes I
Spencer well this is actually the
exception this is an actual gift Oh have
you got a basket of some goodies wow
they're not anymore this smells like
sugar this is very awesome you got a
flock of cheese we got some uh raspberry
honey mustard pretzel dip and some
crackers this is awesome thank you to
whoever sent this to me why isn't there
a note AHA here it is hey Edgar it's our
first birthday and we're super excited
he's thanking you for being an important
part of our journey thank you for all
the love and support and we're surely
looking forward to celebrating many more
birthdays with techies like you Cheers
the dot tech squad you guys are awesome
thank you so much for setting this and
say that guys back to the original topic
these are not being sent as gifts
they're being sent in exchange for a
video and change for review or unboxing
so yeah am I getting any of this for
free so hopefully that makes some of you
feel a little better oh this is just a
little of something I ordered from
Amazon to strip off paint cuz I kind of
left some paint on the floor in front of
my house and yeah the owner is not happy
with that so I'm gonna have to use this
remove some of that paint off already
moving on to these next ups package who
is calling me right now this is why I
put your phone on silent before you
begin recording
hahahahaha these are C brand skins why
are they in white
yeah the brand I ordered different
colors I didn't order white only some
buddies were supposed to be in green and
some of these are supposed to be in red
but all I got were white carbon fiber
and mat headphone skins
this was disappointing alright moving on
to the next package we have a USB
charging cable oh it's so this is a
lightning cable that also converts and -
wait what the hell am I saying oh so
this is a magnetic charging cable that
has a microUSB tip and a lightning tip
which is pretty sweet
so basically what you do is so you
connect one of the tips to your
smartphone depending on if it's an Apple
phone or an Android and then you would
just bring in the other tip and it would
connect magically well not magically but
magnetically I should say so yes I think
this is the point of this is to make
connection a lot easier and this is
actually gonna be featured in my cool
tech alright so you got two more boxes
to open up this is oh this is my fat hub
that I ordered for my rx 480 build but
came a little too late but it's fine
because I'm gonna use this for my next
PC build in case I need it last but not
least
this is very dirty Jesus where the hell
did they toss this feel like this is
upside down Oh help knows not oh yes
haha yes my very first gaming laptop
guys this is the HP omen gaming laptop
I'm so excited to do a video on this
because I haven't reviewed the gaming
laptop in freaking ages so very very
stoked let's go and open this up for you
guys what else very nice definitely love
the black and red theme that's going on
right here
holy shrooms this looks amazing
and it's pretty heavy Wow I'm too sure
about that logo in the front though kind
of like a flower but this this I like
carbon fiber surface looks very very
sick oh very very nice so we still got
some more carbon fiber over here
actually it's not even carbon fiber
material it just has that look on there
but yeah this looks pretty sick I can't
wait to boot it up play some games on
here actually let me see if I can check
out the specs for you guys actually you
know what it's probably my email give me
