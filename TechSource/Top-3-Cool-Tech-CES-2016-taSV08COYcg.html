master ah they are an online community
that allows enthusiasts to harness the
power of group buying for amazing tech
products the more people that join a
group buy for a product the more the
price goes down right now my strap is
sponsoring a giveaway for the chic smart
s1 electric scooter and all you guys
have to do to enter is sign up using the
link in the description section down
below so went over the top WTF tech I
saw at CES 2016 already on my channel so
it's time to go over some of the cool
tech that I saw this time around let's
do this LG is always turning heads every
year at CES and this year is no
different I my number 3 spot is the
ultra-thin g6 TV which is as thin as for
stacked credit cards the frame is just
point 11 inches thick and they were able
to achieve this by using an oled display
you also have to get rid of the
integrated speakers so instead the TV
sits on top of a large forward-facing
speaker which will provide clean and
detailed audio without any Distortion
it's also equipped with extra woofers to
bolster the power of the speakers and
the g6 is set to go on sale later this
year in both 65 and 70 7 inch screen
sizes with no firm price points or
release date the number two spot in this
video goes to the razor blade stealth
and the core add on unit this is razors
new ultrabook that they announced which
is available now in stores and starts
around a thousand dollars it's insanely
thin measuring at point five inches at
its thickest point and weighing only two
point 75 pounds it sports a multi-touch
12.5 IGZO display that's available in
two resolutions either 3840 x 2160 or
2560 x 1440 p you also get a core i7
6500 you processor 8 gigabytes of ram
and an intel HD graphics chip but that's
not even the cool part the cool part is
that you can use the razor core and hook
up your own pcie-based graphics card to
the Ultrabook if you want more power it
connects via Thunderbolt 3 which is a
USB type-c connection and practically
transforms your notebook into a desktop
gaming experience at the number one spot
of cool tech that I have seen this year
at CES goes to these guys at maybank's
collectibles they essentially make
collectible versions of everyday tech
products for this demo they actually
partnered up with blizzard and created
docking stations and power banks based
on the new warcraft movie which is being
released this year the idea
the behind it is this tech products get
obsolete over time whether they wear
down or a better version gets released
so if they create collectible versions
of these tech products instead then
people are more inclined on keeping them
since they are well collectibles they
were showing off some horde and Alliance
power banks in the form of weapons and
stones and the idea behind this concept
is cool enough for me to feature this at
that number one spot so there you have
it my top three picks of cool tech from
CES 2016 now I'm sure there were a bunch
of others that I did not get a chance to
see but out of everything I came across
these were the top three if you guys
enjoyed the video make sure to leave a
like and as always I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
