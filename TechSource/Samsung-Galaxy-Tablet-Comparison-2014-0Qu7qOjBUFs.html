and i'm back once again to get a final
look at all the tablets side by side
we're gonna be looking at the Tab pro
8.4 10.1 and the Note pro 12.2 and
compare them with each other to find out
what tablet works best for you so let's
just jump straight into this so all
tablets are pretty much the same width
with the exception of the 12.2 being
just slightly thicker due to its size
whereas the 8.4 and 10.1 are very
similar all the tablets come rocking
with a 2560 by 1600 resolution with fake
leather backing which resembles a larger
version of the note 3 Samsung really
likes to keep the same design I'm also
devices as we can clearly see here using
the tablets however drew up very
different experiences the increase in
the size from tablet the tablet made a
drastic difference when it came to
actually using the device I personally
like my tablet on a smaller size so I
can safely say that the 8.4 inch suited
me really well it was very convenient to
hold and it has a big enough screen to
enjoy playing games or watching videos
on and it can also be used to get some
light work done as well what that
question portability is the 8.4
strongest suit and I'll recommend this
to anyone that Oh is always on the move
and likes to depend on a large screen
for videos and games but at the same
time hates carrying something large and
bulky moving up in size we take a look
at Samsung's middle child the Tab pro
10.1 I got an enhanced experience when
using the tablet stationary but with
some negatives a bigger tablet obviously
means an increase in weight and decrease
in portability however with a 10-inch
screen you can get enhanced user
experience when using apps that are
optimized for larger screens like games
and especially when it comes to reading
articles and watching videos I would
recommend this tablet to someone who
doesn't mind sacrificing a little
portability for a bigger screen size and
who also thinks that a 12.2 is too big
and the F 8.4 is too small finally
moving to Samsung's largest tablet and
no pro 12.2 we see and feel a clear
difference in both size and weight this
tablet feels noticeably heavier at one
point six pounds when holding it in your
hands it felt very uncomfortable as time
passes
I mean I can safely say that I got a
pretty good workout holiness for ten
minutes its massive size also adds to
the discomfort and portability factor
ever being a tablet however the size
also gives us some advantages as well of
course watching videos on it is a huge
plus but having a bigger screen in
general it's also a huge benefit for
browsing the web and using applications
or even games that are optimized for
such a large display but you know at
what point is it too big I guess that's
up to the user to decide really we will
recommend this tablet to someone who is
looking for a laptop replacement
essentially this tablet goes perfectly
with a Bluetooth keyboard as composing
documents or doing anything that would
benefit from a physical keyboard really
brings out the potential in that massive
display and the best part of it is that
you get the best of both worlds you can
use a keyboard and you can swap to the
touchscreen whenever you want there is
one last thing you take into
consideration when looking to decide
between these tablets and that's the S
Pen yes only the Galaxy Note pro 12.2
comes with a pen and along with it comes
a plethora of features that are not
accessible on the other tablets for
example using features like multi window
are fantastic on the screen of the size
I mean call it gimmicky if you want but
these features were great on a large
screen truly a Productivity tablet if
you ask me the fact that you can have
multiple windows up at the same time
makes it really convenient for me for
example here I opened up a calculator on
top of this webpage to add a few things
together without exiting the browser
which eliminates the need to swap
between them and that's just one example
of how the s-pen is very useful here's
actually a sample of how much content
you can see with all the tablets with
the same resolution across all of them
there really isn't more content it's
just enlarged on each device making it
more readable and finally to conclude
the comparison let's take a quick look
at some sample video that I took and I
even recorded the sound to kind of give
you a better idea of how each one sounds
when going from the largest to the
smallest tablet
well this brings the comparison to an
end - something's up the bigger the
tablet the less portable but with more
productivity and the smaller the screen
size means smaller content less
productivity but more portability in the
end that does come down to personal
taste and what you guys decide to do
with your tablet I would personally go
for the top row eight point four as I
mentioned before simply because of its
size I do move around a lot and I want a
tablet that I can carry around with ease
and you know if I want to get work done
on the move I prefer a laptop and again
that's just my personal preference
however I would love to hear what size
you guys prefer and why feel free to
leave a comment down below this is that
from tech source and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
