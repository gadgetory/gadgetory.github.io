today we're gonna check out the new
gaming router recently released from
d-link
so this rod is gonna run you around
$1.99 u.s. dollars and it is the first
of its kind to offer scream boost
technology looking at the back we see
that d-link has given a brief
explanation on why scream boost is
special and there is also a picture
showing us the software that this router
comes with so on the side of the box we
are given a look at the ports on the
back of the device and we are also given
some more information about this router
flipping on to the other side we can see
that picture showing us advantages of
having screen Boost technology which we
will go over soon
so this platter also supports the
next-generation 11ac Wi-Fi that gives up
to 867 megabytes down and for 50
megabytes up this router also has
gigabyte cables which offers 10 times
faster speeds than traditional Ethernet
cables and lastly this router also
supports both 2.4 gigahertz and 5
gigahertz bands sliding out the box we
see that we have some paperwork on top a
power cable and an ethernet cord as well
as a piece of paper with the router
access information on the front of the
device we have a power button and an
internet connection button and on the
back side we have 4 gigabyte lan
ethernet ports 1 gigabyte w and ethernet
port 1 USB 2.0 port a power switch and
your power import now let's talk about
stream boost screen boost is a
technology that sophisticated leave
manages and shapes traffic now the
router automatically reserved segments
of bandwidth when the application
detected by the router does not need it
so instead of a more traditional setup
where everything connected to the router
would get the equal amounts of bandwidth
this automatically detects which
applications are being used by what
device and separates the bandwidth
accordingly so for example if your
parents are streaming Netflix downstairs
and you are watching a YouTube video and
your brother is walking off in the
bathroom on his smartphone
no one will experience lag because the
d-link router will make sure everyone
gets the right amount of bandwidth
needed so that's it for the quick look
at the deal in gaming router with screen
Boost technology we are currently
working on our next giveaway which is
the Alienware 18 laptop that just came
