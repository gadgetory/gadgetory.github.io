further ado let the setup wars begin
this episode of Star Wars is brought to

again g2a offers the best deals on CD
keys for practically any platform click
on the link below to see for yourself so
with that said the five chosen
contestants for this week are AJ Amy
Liam termination and Ryan that's for
making it to this week of set-up wars by
the way all of the products I mentioned
in this video will be linked down below
as well as any product I recommend in
this episode it will have a special
section down below as well so starting
off the episode is AJ and his dual
monitor setup from Dell I'm so glad you
have two of the same monitors finally
off to a great start on the desk we have
the rapper keyboard along with the S
action mouse on top of this Itachi desk
mat I'm really digging your white theme
and you even have the whites Itachi
airbase speakers and a Galaxy Tab s 10.5
with the Tab s keyboard I mean it's
pretty obvious that you are a Samsung
fan and I'm actually surprised I don't
see a galaxy s6 phone on that wireless
charging pad of yours
why management is pretty good I mean you
tie the cables together using some zip
ties which is cool but you kind of
forgot to cut the long extra pieces and
yes I do notice these things it's a
curse I also like the long white custom
made monitor riser you have underneath
the monitors it really cleans up the
overall desk this is one of the reasons
why I recommend these in the first place
if you have stuff on the desk I mean
this is a prime example of how you can
keep stuff under it to organize your
desk job well done AJ the only thing
I'll recommend simply because I don't
see it anywhere it's perhaps a pair of
headphones since you have a Productivity
type setup I didn't leave some links
down below to a couple of really great
pair of headphones and white that I
think you would like but I don't not
Thank You AJ for entering setup wars
next up is a me and it looks like we
have ourselves a game room just because
it's called setup wars it doesn't mean
you can't show off your game room as
well I don't know what it is about
orange walls but this is the second one
that I've seen in setup wars but anyways
it looks like a really chilled place to
hang out and game so on the desk we have
two 24 inch LG monitors a cm storm
devastated keyboard and mouse combo and
a PlayStation wireless headset hanging
from the side great job on water
management I can
see that you ratted them along the legs
at the desk and behind the stands I was
going to question why there was a random
horse and cactus upside down on a
ceiling but then I saw the picture and
then suddenly everything made sense now
this is just a personal preference but I
hate to pull out trays for keyboards not
only does it force you to sit further
away from the monitors but it's very
inconvenient to type on or game on
since there's barely any room and by the
looks of it it seems pretty cramped so I
would recommend moving the keyboard to
the top of the desk along with the mouse
but if you're used to that setup then
that's all good another thing I noticed
are those booklets and papers you have
on the right side of your desk and it's
just kind of sitting there so maybe a
wooden tray would help organize some of
that stuff and it goes well with your
table I was also going to recommend
moving the toys and your pet rock off
the top shelf so that doesn't distract
you but I'm starting to nitpick a lot so
I will leave it at dads I'm not going to
even recommend a headphone anchor
because I think I said too much about
this setup but anyways awesome game room
Amy thank you so much for entering setup
wars Liam is next up with his dual 24
inch monitor set up one from Dell and
the other from Asus why are you doing
this to me also on the desk we have
another Coolermaster CM storm Devastator
keyboard and mouse bundle along with the
logitech z5o six speakers I can't help
but notice that red boom arm you have
there and in fact as soon as I opened up
your files and saw that I went had about
one for myself so thank you so much for
that you also went with the Audio
Technica m50 red Edition and even have
the red LEDs in the back I think he
purposely entered setup Wars to make me
jealous I wish the m50x s came in red as
well I would easily buy that in a
heartbeat since I'm too afraid to paint
mine kela management is actually pretty
good I see that you attached an outlet
on the roof of your desk kind of like
how I did with mine and you can have an
omni mount system through some of your
cables now I would recommend getting at
least one more to cover up that bundle
of cables connecting to your subwoofer
though so you have a bunch of stuff on
your desk I do applaud you for getting a
headphone hanger but those speakers are
taking up a lot of space on your desk
it's one of the reasons I stay away from
wired speakers and go wireless
now if you must have wired speakers
that's fine but in case you are looking
to go wireless
I will leave a link to the pair of
speakers I've been using the past few
months that I keep getting asked about
they pair together to give you a
surround sound theater experience they
are loud they are awesome and I would
recommend them to anyone for gaming and
especially for watching movies other
than that and perhaps getting a larger
mousepad I'd say that you have a very
sick black and red setup Thank You Liam
for entering setup wars next up is
premonition with his single 29 inch wide
AOC monitor on the desk we have the
Logitech G 110 keyboard and a vengeance
m65 mouse from Corsair on a razer
mousepad talk about diversity also on a
desk we have some Logitech HDC 525
speakers and some crazy-looking robot
arms that's holding up your smartphone
I'm going to ignore the fact that you
have a blackberry since this is a video
based on setups but if this was
smartphone wars I would have booted you
out immediately I'm just kidding I don't
have any beef with black bear users
no but seriously while you're still
using a blackberry cable management is
immaculate and I'm digging the PC you
have over there an FX 8350 paired with
two gtx 970 Strix Edition inside the
awesome define are five case from
fractal I like the fact that you put the
controllers on the bottom instead of on
top of the desk and well normally I
would suggest not putting other
miscellaneous items like the car
replicas on the desk it is your setup
and you can do whatever you want to it
you managed to keep it very organized
and clean and for that I will award you
a point the only thing I would recommend
is perhaps a monitor riser so that you
have a place for the charger that's on
the far left of your desk you'll also
have a place for that car replica and
the speaker controller as well it just
keeps everything nicely tucked away and
really cleans up your desk other than
that you have a really awesome setup
thank you premonition for entering setup
wars last but not least we have Josh so
this isn't a desk setup instead it's a
console setup we have a 47 inch LG Smart
TV hooked up to your Xbox one and Xbox
360 as well understand we have a beats
pill speaker some Skullcandy headphones
and an iPad Mini definitely looks like a
really chill place to relax and get some
gaming on and I can only imagine how
comfortable that couch looks I hope
you're not gaming on those Skullcandy
headphones if you are then I left a few
options of Wired gaming headsets that
you can connect your Xbox controller and
the quality is a lot better so they're
fully check them out when you have a
chance also if you're going to keep the
controllers on the stand like that then
it would not only look a lot better on
controller stands but you can also
charge them at the same time and I left
a few options down below for you other
than that you have a really chill gaming
setup Josh thank you for entering setup
