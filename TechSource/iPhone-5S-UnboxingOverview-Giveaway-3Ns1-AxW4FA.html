you another special unboxing and
giveaway today we're looking at the
brand new iPhone 5s we went ahead and
picked up to 16 gigabytes Space Gray
editions one of which will be given away
to one lucky subscriber it seems that
the silver and gold edition were
available in very limited quantities
unfortunately so like usual you can pick
up either 8 16 32 or 64 gigabyte version
of the iPhone 5s at this time if you do
want a silver or gold version you are
going to have to order it at your store
and they stated it would take a few
weeks before you get one so let's get
inside this box and find out what Apple
has included this time you notice right
off the bat that the box is white
regardless of what color iphone you
choose as you can see Apple kept the
same design as the 5 the back side is
slightly lighter if that bothers you
like it does me you can always get a
case to cover it right below the iPhone
you will find some stickers a warranty
information and a diagram of the phone
which I won't go over then you have your
standard accessories you got the 32 pin
USB cable a wall charger and your ear
pods let's go and put all this aside
walk quick and take a closer look at the
iPhone 5s
so that's pretty much it for the
unboxing iPhone still has the same
design they did up with a few things
inside the phone however the 5s now has
an a7 chip which makes the phone 40%
faster than the five and a 5s is also
the world's for a 64-bit smartphone they
also included an m7 processor which
tracks motion while preserving battery
they also added a neat feature where you
can unlock your phone with your
thumbprint and I gotta say it works
really well and lastly they improved
their eyesight camera by increasing
their aperture sensor and pixels I won't
get into much details about the phone
because this is just an unboxing but we
will upload a comparison video very soon
comparing the 5s and the 5 and we'll go
over features in more detail
overall I'm loving this phone it's super
smooth there's zero lag I'm glad they
improved their camera and I think my
favorite feature is definitely the touch
ID I no longer have to enter my password
to access my phone or even download apps
so what feature the 5s are you guys most
excited about definitely leave a comment
down below as I'm pretty curious to find
out so thanks for watching the video if
you guys want to win an iPhone 5s simply
