another special unboxing and giveaway
today we're looking at the brand new
iphone 5s we went ahead and picked up to
16 gigabyte Space Gray editions one of
which will be given away to one lucky
subscriber it seems that the silver and
gold edition were available in very
limited quantities unfortunately so like
usual you can pick up either 8 16 32 or
64 gigabyte version of the iphone 5s at
this time if you do on a silver or gold
version you are going to have to order
it at your store and they stated it will
take a few weeks before you get one so
let's get inside this box and find out
what Apple has included this time you
notice right off the bat that the box is
white regardless of what color iphone
you choose as you can see Apple kept the
same design as the five the back side is
slightly lighter if that bothers you
like it does me you can always get a
case to cover it right below the iphone
you will find some stickers a warranty
information in a diagram of the phone
which i won't go over then you have your
standard accessories you got the 32 pin
USB cable a wall charger and your ear
pods let's go on and put all this aside
we'll quick and take a closer look at
the iphone 5s
so that's pretty much it for the
unboxing the iphone still has the same
design they did up with a few things
inside the phone however the 5s now has
an a7 chip which makes the phone forty
percent bastard in the 5 and 5s is also
the world's for a 64-bit smartphone they
also included an m7 processor which
tracks motion while preserving battery
they also added a neat feature where you
can unlock your phone with your
thumbprint and I gotta say it works
really well and lastly they improve
their eyesight camera by increasing
their aperture sensor and pixels I won't
get into much details about the phone
because this is just an unboxing but we
will upload a comparison video very soon
comparing the 5s and the five and we'll
go over features in more detail overall
I'm loving this phone it's super smooth
there's zero lag I'm glad they improve
their camera and I think my favorite
feature is definitely that touch ID I no
longer have to enter my password to
access my phone or even download apps so
will feature the 5s are you guys most
excited about definitely leave a comment

out so thanks for watching the video if
