Squarespace the one tool needed to
create your own professional website or
online portfolio for a free trial and
10% off your first purchase use the
offer code text or 11 through the link
below what's up guys Tech source is here
with the new Xbox one from Microsoft
this bad boy goes for $4.99 if you
pre-ordered yours you get a launch
edition which comes in a black box along
with an achievement and a day one
marking on the controller otherwise you
get a green box like the one you see
here we actually ended up picking up
five of these and we will be giving away
one to a lucky subscriber so make sure
to stick around to find out how to enter
when I first picked up the box it was
noticeably heavier than the ps4 I mean I
knew it came with the Kinect but that
does not weigh much by itself the Xbox
one is much bigger than the ps4 thus
weighing a lot more so inside the box
you will find the headset on top along
with the manual and warranty paperwork
as well as the necessary cables you got
the power cable the power brick one
controller that comes with two batteries
which they are rechargeable finally and
an HDMI cable with the Kinect sensor
before the change you needed to have the
Kinect in order to play with the Xbox
one but after Microsoft embarrassed
themselves at e3 they changed a lot of
things around and made it no longer
mandatory to keep the Kinect on in order
to play so let's take a close look at
the controller Microsoft said that they
spent a hundred million dollars on a
development of the new Xbox one
controller and they came up with
something that looks very similar to
that of the 360 I mean they could have
given me that money now would have made
the same thing I mean it does have
improved buttons of course the gamepad
is more clicky and analog feel more
smooth giving a precise feeling so it
was an overall upgrade for sure the
vibrating motors also have been improved
providing better feedback during games
and a battery box has been integrated
into the controller's frame and does not
stick out like the previous model moving
on to the headset I can say that it is
much better than the ps4 is it's not an
earpiece and it fits comfortably on your
head the controllers are located on the
bottom near the Kinect there
and here you can control the volume and
mute yourself if you choose making it
really convenient for you this part also
connects to the controller and powers
the device but honestly a majority of
the gamers especially me use their own
headsets like turtlebeach or trying to
play instead of using a stock headset
this is the Kinect sensor and it
basically tracks the users movements and
it can do some cool stuff like using
your hands to resize windows or even
recognizing your face and login into
that user you can also say things like
ok Xbox and it will listen for commands
like launching a game powering on and
stuff like that if you are too lazy to
use the controller the design of the
Xbox one is not that bad as some people
say I mean it obviously doesn't compare
to the ps4 but it could use something to
spice it up instead of looking like a
cable box or DVR on the back of the Xbox
one you will find most of the ports
starting with the power followed by the
HDMI out and in two USBs the Kinect jack
a digital audio out and lastly the
Ethernet port we also included a button
for Wii syncing your controllers which
is located on the left side next to the
optical drive as well as an extra USB
slot on the left side of the Xbox one if
you are looking at it directly after an
embarrassing event at e3 Microsoft's
seem to have recovered but the console
or has not ended yet until we see the
results of the units sold overall I do
like the Xbox one I think the software
is great and much more advanced than the
ps4 but when it comes down to console
and control design I'm leaning towards
the ps4 however I will always choose PC
over any console but I would like to
know what systems you guys prefer and
why so please feel free to share your
ideas down below so that wraps up the
unboxing and overview of the new Xbox
one as I mentioned before this is a
giveaway and if you want to be entered
