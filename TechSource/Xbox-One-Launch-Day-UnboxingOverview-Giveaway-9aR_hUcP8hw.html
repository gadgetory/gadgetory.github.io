link below what's up guys tech sauce is
here with the new xbox one from
Microsoft this bad boy goes for 499 if
you pre-ordered yours you get a launch
edition which comes in a black box along
with an achievement and a day one
marking on the controller otherwise you
get a green box like the one you see
here we actually ended up picking up
five of these and we will be giving away
one to a lucky subscriber so make sure
to stick around to find out how to enter
when I first picked up the box it was
noticeably heavier than the ps4 I mean I
knew it came with the Kinect but that
does not weigh much by itself the Xbox
one is much bigger than the ps4 the
swaying a lot more so inside the box you
will find the headset on top along with
the manual and warranty paperwork as
well as a necessary cables you got the
power cable the power brick one
controller that comes with two batteries
which are they are rechargeable finally
and an hdmi cable with the kinect sensor
before the change you needed to have the
Kinect in order to play with the xbox
one but after microsoft embarrass
themselves at e3 they change a lot of
things around and made it no longer
mandatory to keep the kinect on in order
to play so let's take a close look at
the controller microsoft said that they
spend a hundred million dollars on a
development of the new xbox one
controller and they came up with
something that looks very similar to
that of the 360 I mean they could have
given me that money now what it makes
the same thing I mean it does have
improved buttons of course the gamepad
is more clicky and analogues feel more
smooth giving a precise feeling so it
was an overall upgrade for sure the
vibrating motors also have been improved
providing better feedback during games
and the battery box has been integrated
into the controller's frame and does not
stick out like the previous model moving
on to the headset I can say that it is
much better than the ps4 is it's not an
earpiece and it fits comfortably on your
head the controllers are located on the
bottom near the connector
and here you can control the volume and
mute yourself if you choose making it
really convenient for you this part also
connects to the controller and powers of
device but honestly majority of the
gamers especially me use their own
headsets like turtle beach or trying to
play instead of using a stock headset
this is the Kinect sensor and it
basically tracks the users movements and
it can do some cool stuff like using
your hands to resize windows or even
recognizing your face and login into
that user you can also say things like
okay Xbox and it will listen for
commands like launching a game powering
on and stuff like that if you are too
lazy to use the controller the design of
the Xbox one is not that bad as some
people say I mean it obviously doesn't
compare to the ps4 but it could use
something to spice it up instead of
looking like a cable box or DVR on the
back of the xbox one you will find most
of the ports starting with the power
followed by the hdmi out and in two USBs
the Kinect Jack a digital audio out and
lastly the Ethernet port we also
included a button for we sinking your
controllers which is located on the left
side next to the optical drive as well
as an extra USB slot on the left side of
the xbox one if you are looking at it
directly after an embarrassing event at
e3 microsoft seem to have recovered but
the console or has not ended yet until
we see the results of the units sold
overall I do like the Xbox one I think
the software is great and much more
advanced than the ps4 but when it comes
down to console and control design I'm
leaning towards the ps4 however I will
always choose pc over any console but I
would like to know what systems you guys
prefer and why so please feel free to
share your ideas down below so that
wraps up the unboxing and overview of
the new xbox one as I mentioned before
