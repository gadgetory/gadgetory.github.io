and welcome to another episode of what's
in the box it's been a while since I've
made a video on the channel that's
because we're really busy moving stuff
into a new office this is actually the
first video we are shooting at the new
office and I promise you guys the
background is gonna change we're gonna
be doing a lot of things to this place
to make it look awesome and because of
the change and transition we actually
have around 50 boxes to open up this is
just half of the stuff and I think we're
gonna make 2 videos otherwise it would
take like a it will take an hour to
unbox everything so anyways with that
said that's going to dive right in
before I begin this episode I will give
a huge thanks to I funny for sponsoring
this video I funny is one of the most
popular entertainment apps in the u.s.
it's packed with fresh memes videos gifs
and other user-generated content
the team selects the funniest content
and releases it in the form of feature
sets seven times per day however users
can also view new memes through the
collective section at any time the app
has a dynamic and loyal community of
users and recently following feedback
from the users we actually created a new
chat feature which allows users to chat
privately amongst each other and then
there's meme Academy with Mia Khalifa
yep the one and only you might recognize
her from those special videos but
anyways they got the course that
involves a variety of assignments and
the most active participants will
receive diplomas signed by Mia herself
the app is free to download if you guys
want to support the channel or want to
check it out I'll leave a link to it
down below I don't actually have a knife
with me so we're gonna be using a
flathead to open these episode should be
an interesting episode but yeah welcome
to another episode of what's in the box
alright it's not off the unboxing with
this one over here they want to open up
the bag ones first and then get to the
actual boxes because these are a lot
easier to open up alright so looks like
we have a bunch of cables from Volta oh
okay so this is a lightning cable with a
magnetic tip and it actually has three
different tips on here we got lightning
cable we have USB type-c and a microUSB
cable so I guess the idea behind this is
you can plug in your devices a lot
easier just being close to the port and
the snaps in place and one of the
benefits of this is actually it's a your
phone or device is charging on a table
and somebody walks by the cable and
instead of dragging your whole device
with you and having it fall on the
ground the cable will pretty much just
disconnect so I think that's one of the
benefits of going with this type of
charging cable they do have several
different colors they got black they got
silver with the different lengths as
well I think that goes up to like two
meters which is pretty cool and there's
even a coupon code written on here if
you guys want to check them out you guys
can get 10% off using this code listed
on here also drop links down below to
this and everything you guys see in this
video so yeah huge things to voltar for
sending these out this is actually
pretty cool I might use one of these in
my setup so yeah with that said let's go
ahead and move on to the next box
alright the next bag is a DHL bag from
TL sourcing whatever that is
I'm not gonna open it but this looks
like the 24 pin cable replacement cables
for big red if you guys watched the
first episode I stated in that that the
psu was actually defective but after the
video I went ahead and tested each
single cable and turned out the 24 pin
cable was defective not the power supply
so of course sir I apologize your power
supply was good there's actually 24 pin
cables this one came into my P o box
this is uh either fine though or
something else I guess by Mel it is you
got the crying laughter emoji I don't
know if they're laughing at me or my
failure videos but yeah I think I'll put
this in my lambo
okay this one is from v1 Tech and this
is actually for a subscriber bill that
I'm doing on the channel it's coming up
very soon let me just let me show you
guys what they set it whoa look at that
this is gonna be a Batman theme the PC
we got the old black frame with the
mirrored silver accents this is gonna
look sick these are the fan grills let
me show you guys the backplate I want I
want to make sure you guys have some
tissue next next to you guys because o
day look at that fun of you guys can see
that the reflection on that yeah this is
this is sick this is the sick is gonna
be a sick Bell I'm not gonna be one tech
man those guys always always impressed
me and haven't really done a gothic like
an old black build so this was gonna be
a black with silver and gray accents so
it's gonna be a little different than my
previous builds but I am stoked guys
actually some of these parts might be is
the other parts for the build so I went
to unbox them
ladies and gentlemen after three weeks I
have finally received the replacement
parts or screws for my case these are
the installation screws and the power
supply cable needed to install and put
together the case the hex key are 40 ok
so this is the AO sleeping kit for the
subscriber build it's actually a white
AIO sleeping kit which I'm gonna be
painting over it either in silver or
gray but yeah
this is going in this bill
oh dude liquid came in ha ha
this is guts so we ordered a bunch of
props and figurines to use as much
background pretty much for our videos
and for b-roll and this is actually one
of things me and Bob thought about
bringing in because we're such a fan a
big fan of berserk Oh
oh look his cape actually is separate oh
guts himself
ladies and gentleman Sam okay stand and
look at the sword yeah it's like his
like the same height I was bigger than
him
what look at that that is freakin
awesome the fact that you can move
around his arms and his legs we can
actually put him in different poses for
different videos so that's that's pretty
awesome I think this was a goodbye
oh speaking of props we got a on the BBC
guy here I'm like the biggest DBZ fan
ever so Super Saiyan for Goku obviously
actually this isn't really DBZ this is
Dragon Ball super but yeah I Goku Super
Saiyan I said Super Saiyan 4 I'm such an
idiot
Super Saiyan God how am I saying so much
for being number one fan what you get
different Goku hairstyles that stick and
hands Oh what you can you have to put
this together from scratch so this is
actually a plastic model kit I had no
idea I thought this was an actual
figurine but I guess you're supposed to
put them together from scratch using
pieces okay so this is gonna be an
interesting long project but what it's
finished this is basically what it's
supposed to look like I think we want to
do the one with the Kamehameha stance
which I think looks cool so yeah I got
another background problem
I think we're halfway done okay so we
got some stuff from Coursera these are
also going into the subscriber bill we
got some our itv fans we had we have we
have the RGB LED trip I don't know what
this is
and the commander Pro and speaking of
subscriber builds I do subscriber bills
on the side if I have free time these
are high-end bills of course if you guys
are interested in me building a PC for
you and you live in the States
hit me up in the emails and I might be
one for you oh my god I think I think I
know this is no it's not I thought this
was the keyboard we're gonna send me the
white keyboard I've been waiting for
they sent me uh I don't know why do you
send me a b-17 I might give this away so
if you guys want you guys one inch let
me know the comments section this is us
only by the way so please if only if you
live in the u.s. drop a like and let me
know in the comment section if you want
the k70
oh I think I know what this is
okay so these are essentially wireless
lighting we're supposed to put these on
the top of shelves and it's gonna give
off a nice glow effect the fact that
they're Wireless and they don't need to
be hardwired inside or connected to
anything there's other reasons why you
pick this out so it comes with some 3m
tape we attach to the back hook it up on
top of the shelf and it gives off some
nice glowing effect to whatever it is
underneath it so it could be figurines
it could be props whatever it is so
that's why we picked up six of these oh
okay so this is the 3d hand it's
actually this is actually gonna look
really cool at night I'll show you guys
a demonstration real quick so yeah the
idea is to give off a really nice glow
effect in the background that's gonna
look really good in low light situations
and the cool part is you can change the
colors on it so blue yellow purple we
got white red like five colors to choose
from anything actually add a flash
effect I think I think it's gonna be
more distracting videos to be honest
well we just keep a static color on it
but yeah pretty cool little toy picked
up and this here is a poster of the one
and only
guts so this is a six piece poster and
that's what the image is supposed to
look like if you put it together
essentially these are high quality
prints so sick this is actually gonna be
on top of Bob's setup I think he's going
on your setup right yeah yeah so he's
the he's a perfect guy and I'm gonna
have some DBZ stuff on top of mine so I
thought this would actually come with
some frames but
oh yeah it is that this is actually 20
bucks so shuffling you guys want to pick
it up okay some more goodies for the
office so obviously the first thing I
had to pick up was something to protect
our tech there's a lot of expensive tech
here at our office and we're not gonna
be your at nights and we need something
to essentially watch over our stuff
and if you guys watched my ultimate
smart home tech episode one then you
what do you know what this is this is
actually the camera system I've been
using at my home so I picked up an extra
pair to use around the office one of
these I absolutely love about this is
it's so easy to use and it's so small
you don't have to plug it in anything
they're not the hardwired or anything
you'd have to pay a monthly stupid
subscription just to look at your files
everything goes on your smartphone you
can look it up on your smartphone it's
got motion detection HD Live View
basically you can watch the video
straight from your phone and it's I
think you get up to what is the two
gigabytes of space of storage space on
your phone and you don't have to pay for
it so it's awesome but whatever the
amount of space you get you could
obviously it either download those files
or completely delete it and you get that
extra space back again so yeah
absolutely love this we also picked up
some floor lighting so this is actually
RGB and this is gonna give up some
really nice effect for example if I put
it behind me it's gonna look like some
light is glowing from my butt cheeks
so we'll probably find some good use for
this somewhere in the office but this is
definitely a really nice by last mile
nice ladies and gentlemen one enormous
box
okay so this is just kitchen stuff so we
got some cups and this is a trash can
I'm not going to open it because it's
not fascinating it's not really tech
it's a basic trash can because we're
gonna obviously want that trash so
that's what that is
anyway is that pretty much wraps up this
episode hope you guys enjoyed it stick
around because episode are the next
unboxing videos gonna be coming up very
soon everything mentioned this video
will be linked below I love your faces
as always and I'll see you guys very
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
