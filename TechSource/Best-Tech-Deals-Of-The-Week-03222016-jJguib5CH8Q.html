and as you can tell my voice is back to
normal and I just wanna say thanks to
everyone who is wishing me to get well
soon before I start this really short
episode I just want to let you guys know
that you can help support the channel
only if you want to simply click on the
country you are from and bookmark the
Amazon link to your page so whatever you
decide to buy stuff on Amazon just use
the bookmark page and I get a tiny
kickback anything I get goes directly
back into the channel and I can continue
bringing you guys content every single
day I don't you guys notice but it's
really difficult to pump out videos
every single day especially since I'm
doing it all by myself but anyway just
out I'll let you guys know if you want
to help support the channel I really
appreciate it if not I still thank you
guys for watching my videos so I start
off with a really great deal I found on
ebay the m50x s are going for only 100
bucks which is ridiculous it sold
hundreds of units and there aren't that
many left driving to Amazon you can find
a decent deal on a pair of 8 gigabytes
of ram sticks or 40 bucks which looks
pretty badass the 16 gigabyte nvidia
shield is still the same price at 200
but you do get a remote with it so
that's kind of where the deal is on this
one and speaking of remotes the xbox one
controller for Windows got a price knock
down as well over the weekend all the
way down to 43 bucks so if you play
games on your PC using a joystick or
controller and this is something that
might be of interest to you the popular
empower wireless bluetooth earphones are
going for 26 bucks using the coupon code
listed on the screen which is a pretty
good discount moving forward we have a
PNY 64 gigabyte microSD card slot that's
going for twenty bucks and the popular
ampa bluetooth speaker that I featured
in my top five bluetooth speakers is
going for thirty-six dollars this thing
is really around 50 bucks and it's not
only water and shockproof but it doubles
as a power bank that's right guys that
has a 1,000 million power power bank
built inside that you can use to charge
your devices which is pretty cool these
next two deals on amazon our consoles
first up you have the PS Vita going for
160 bucks and keep in mind that this is
the Wi-Fi version this usually goes for
200 bucks so it's a steal right now
speaking of consoles we have a one
terabyte xbox
one bundle that comes with tom clancy's
the division which by the way i'm
addicted to going for three hundred and
fifty dollars you're basically getting a
free game with it paulson amazon is this
twenty inch viewsonic monitor that's
going for only 80 bucks but there's only
six left and stock so i don't know if
you'll be available by the time you guys
watch this video i'm not a really great
deal is this 480 gigabyte SSD from a
data that's going for 112 bucks and just
to give you guys a reference the 512
megabyte 840 pros are going for around
three hundred bucks so this is a pretty
damn good deal on an SSD finally on
amazon you can find a really cheap
wireless charger for only twelve dollars
finishing up the episode is the popular
evo 212 cooler that has a five-dollar
bill and rebate which is pathetic to be
honest but hey a deal is a deal thank
you guys so much for watching as I
mentioned in the beginning of the video
if you guys want to help support the
channel feel free to bookmark one of the
amazon links below for your country and
just use it to shop on amazon like you
normally do it doesn't cost you anything
and it really helps support the channel
but anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
