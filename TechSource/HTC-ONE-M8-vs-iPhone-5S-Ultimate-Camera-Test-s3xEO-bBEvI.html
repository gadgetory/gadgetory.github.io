source and I'm back again with another
comparison between the HTC One m8 and
iPhone 5s but this time we are going to
be comparing picture and video samples
to determine which phone has an overall
better camera quality so Before we jump
in the samples let's take a quick look
at some specs the iPhone 5s has an 8
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.2 whereas the m8 has a 4
ultrapixel camera with an aperture of
2.0 moving towards the front side of the
devices the iPhone 5s has a 1.2
megapixel front-facing camera while the
m8 has a 5 megapixel camera alright now
that we got that out of the way let's
chillax and look at some samples I hope
you guys enjoy the video
you
you
so one thing I want to mention here is
that both the iPhone 5s and the m8 don't
have a continuous autofocus feature
during the video like the s5 does that
means that you have to manually click on
the screen while recording the video and
have the phone autofocus it to whatever
you are shooting like I am doing here in
the video I am showing you this footage
to give you an idea of the focusing
speed now let's look at the m8 once
again it doesn't continuously autofocus
so I manually adjusting it as I move
between the objects and you can tell
here that the m8 is noticeably faster
when it comes to focusing
anyways that is it for the camera tests
I hope you guys enjoy the video please
leave a like if you enjoyed it or leave
a thumbs down if you didn't and let me
know in the comment section on what bone
you think is the best when it comes to
pictures and video I am very interested
to read your thoughts so once again
thanks for watching this is Ed from tech
source and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
