giveaway at the end of this episode
welcome to setup wars episode 100 potato
Edition what the set of wars begin
as always guys these episodes are done
for purely entertainment reasons for
those of you who are new to channel so
don't get offended by anything I say
obviously don't mean it these actually
these setups were sent to me purposely
to be on the worst set up edition
so it also guy's the worst set up will
win $100 as always and you guys get to
vote on that again this video as well so
first up we got Andre with a pretty
ghetto setup he doesn't even have an
actual desk
this dude set up is right next to his
bed you can literally wake up and start
gaming within minutes now I don't know
if that's genius or just plain sad he's
using his PC as a monitor stand to hold
up his 24 inch display and he has no
choice but to put his keyboard and mouse
on his bed I mean how do you even game
without a mousepad that surface does not
look flat enough to be using a mouse
also how do you even game with the
monitor being that high up and the
keyboard being that low your neck must
be killing you after just a few minutes
I also love that your windows isn't even
activated he does have a Bose speaker
for audio along with a pair of cool nice
v8 3 headphones and I'm not even making
this up guys this brand name is
literally called cool nice like what the
if you ask me it kind of looks like one
of those ripoff Chinese brands of the
Audio Technica m50 X's and finally the
PC that's powering this amazing setup
has a 6700 and eight gigs of RAM sadly
there is no GPU you seriously need to
get an air duster and clean the insides
of this PC it looks atrocious I do
recommend drilling a hole in your bed
throughout the keyboard and mouse wire
through as well as hook up a cable box
against the wall to hide those cables
since you don't have an actual desk you
can even buy a wall mount and hook it up
to your monitor if you want but let's be
real you can't afford any of this if you
can't even buy a GPU for your PC Thank
You Andrei for entering and good luck
next up is Majid and what appears to be
an actual desk setup I mean at least he
has a table but on that table he's got a
crappy Acer 17-inch monitor with a 1 to
1 aspect ratio and that really sucks
when you're gaming or watching videos
because you're always going to have that
black bar on the top and bottom
keyboard and mouse are both from havoc
and for audio he's using a pair of
earbuds I feel really bad for him
because using one of those cheap $1
microphones you find on ebay I mean it
doesn't even have real headphones or
speakers Keele management is also pretty
bad I mean there's a bunch of stuffy
crammed down here with no organization
at all and then we got the PC once again
no GPU so it's running off the i3 2100
integrated graphics chip and eight gigs
of ram definitely one of the worst
setups I've seen Thank You Mudgett for
entering and good luck coming in at
number three is praying with honestly I
don't even know what the hell this is it
kind of looks like a setup
I mean there's a chair with a small
coffee table and then there's a Lenovo
laptop on it but then what the hell is
that behind him is that supposed to be a
workbench or something I mean I do have
to commend plan for using a seat from a
car as his chair that's actually
brilliant I mean those are pretty comfy
so it appears that the larger desk is
his work area he's currently working on
a project I guess what kind of confused
me was the compact PC he had next to it
that's kind of why I thought it was an
actual set up but I guess it's not
really his main setup his main setup is
this one a Lenovo z5 70 laptop with a
broken keyboard so that's why using the
wireless one from Samsung excellent work
of cable management probably the best
I've seen on the show yet Thank You Fran
for entering and good luck next up is
Ralph with a much better setup really
like finally we are getting somewhere
he's got a real monitor wheel keyboard
and mouse but unfortunately he doesn't
have a wheel desk so he's combined three
schools together to form a desk what for
the mouse one for the keyboard and
finally one for the monitor
that's actually pretty creative the PC
that's powering this glorious setup is a
pre-built gateway PC running on a
Pentium and he also has a Radeon HD 4850
GPU I wonder this gateway still makes
pcs I haven't heard of these guys for a
long time he doesn't have any headphones
or speakers so the only form of audio
are those V sonic earbuds and the cable
management yep there is no hope for you
is that a gaming controller just laying
down you know what just forget about it
Thank You Ralph for entering and finally
thank God it's almost over we got rish
AB and here
actually decent-looking set up the first
thing that comes to mind when looking at
this isn't the nasty-ass cable
management or the bug spray believe it
or not but the fact that he has a dry
iron next to his monitor what possible
reason would you need to have that right
next to your monitor seriously like I
understand if you're going to iron
clothes on the same desk as your set up
but even so shouldn't you put that away
I don't know maybe next to your desk I
mean there's plenty of room down there
on the side but anyways back to the
setup so reshef is rocking a Dell
monitor another one of the one-to-one
aspect ratio and we also got the Dell
keyboard and mouse combo I love the fact
that he routed the keyboard wire towards
him instead of pushing it through the
other side and into his PC through the
back on the top shelf
I mean why I seriously think he did on
purpose just to trigger me and he
succeeded and for those of you who are
wondering there's actually a logical
reason why the bug spray is on his desk
he stated in the notes that it's used to
keep the insects away so I kind of get
it I'm not going to even talk about the
cable management because it's pretty
much a lost cause but yeah it's pretty
much a setup thank you and good luck we
shad for entering and also good luck
with those insects well then that was an
interesting episode definitely let me
know which of these setups was the worst

keep people from cheating like the last
