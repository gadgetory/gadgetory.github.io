Texas and welcome to the gaming PC bill
for the month of November this is ray
zaps the ultimate gaming PC running to
Titan X's and SLI it also has Intel's
newest 67 educating skylake processor
which I overclocked to 4.7 gigahertz 16
gigabytes of ddr4 Ram from Corsair annex
61 CPU cooler from NZXT and 400
gigabytes of storage from Intel's newest
PCIe SSD s
powering all of these components is the
unnecessary ax 1200 i PSU from Corsair
and everything is packed inside the
stunning Razer Edition s340 case from
NZXT the case has a backlit Razer logo
in the front with a non let logo inside
along with green LEDs that glow from
underneath and you also get a green lit
power button up top with green USB 3.0
ports needless to say if you're going
with a build that has some green in it I
strongly recommend picking up this case
a lot of you know that I recently
switched to an s3 40 case myself and I'm
absolutely loving it some minor mods I
want to point out are the fan grills the
custom cables GPU back plates and the
sli bridge which were all done by these
guys at v1 tech they did a phenomenal
job with these and they have a bunch of
other different parts that they can make
it any color you can imagine so if you
guys want to spice up your custom PC
definitely check them out I'll drop a
link down below to their website along
with any of the parts are used for this
PC build so onto the temps and
benchmarks a lot of you guys don't
really care for those so I left a
screenshot down below on where you guys
can check that out if anyone is
interested for video editing Razak's
managed to render a one-minute 4k file
in just under four minutes using these
export settings and you guys can find
the link to the template if you guys
want to download and compare speeds to
your current PC alright so with all that
said and done moving on to the best part
of this video I should say the second
best part of this video the gaming
