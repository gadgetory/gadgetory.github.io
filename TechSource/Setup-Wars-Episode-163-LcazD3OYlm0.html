Vikings for free using the link in the
description section you guys will also
get a special bonus of 200 gold coins
and a protective shield which will be
extremely useful at the start checking
off the episode we have Evan and his
epic triple monitor setup that uses for
music production and light gaming he's
got a single 24 inch Acer monitor in the
middle sandwiched by 2 24 inch HP
monitors but it looks like one of them
needs to be color calibrated the best
keys using is the popular IKEA Carl the
countertop that's being supported by -
Alex yours pretty much the stable of
most set ups on the show the benefits of
going with a kitchen countertop from
Ikea is the length giving you lots of
room to work with Evan took advantage of
all that and mounted his speaker's
scratched at two sets of speakers we
have the Yamaha hs7
sitting on the stand and he Mikey CR
threes right on top this is actually the
first time that I've seen something like
this especially in a music production
setup I wonder why anyone would need two
sets of speakers for monitoring audio
maybe my music producers could let me
know in the comment section for
peripherals he's rocking a Logitech G
403 wireless mouse and a DC 60 keyboard
with gmk camping keycaps which i think
looks really clean aside from the
speaker's he does on a pair of cans as
well we got the ath 8900 X's which are
hanging from his PC
underneath the desk there's an i7 6700k
32 gigs of ram and EVGA gtx 1018 here
with custom sleeve cables and a
backplate from v1 tech a very clean
looking PC inside the NZXT s340 ali case
it's a shame that beautiful PC has to be
on the floor dough kale management is
very clean we have a Signum holding up
the cables no complaints here I guess
the only thing I would suggest is maybe
colour correcting the first monitor and
then fixing some of the acoustic panels
because the gaps between some of them
are big enough to be noticeable
I feel like small things like that take
away from the overall appearance and
presentation of this setup I would also
try and find a way to put the PC above
the setup because if you took the extra
time to mod it and make it look that
good then it deserves to be seen more
maybe grab an extra luggage or and
squeeze it on the right side of your
setup either way it's a killer setup
thank you for entering now this guy
knows how to treat his PC right up there
on the center shelf so this is Jasper
from Sweden and his cluster phobics set
up for gaming design and video editing
in case you guys haven't noticed to use
a big fan of Star Wars hence the
wallpaper and the theme of the entire
setup to match his synth build it's got
a 9 383 50 K 32 gigs of ram and the
NVIDIA Titan XP galactic empire edition
which fits beautifully with the bean
there's some serious bottlenecking in
this build but who cares
look at how dope that sfx case looks
right below that we got the Acer x 34
all Troy that's mounted against the wall
and underneath that is an interesting
combo the Apple magic keyboard and a
razor lancehead Mouse so Jasper is an
art director and he's so used to using
Apple products because of their design
but he also loves to gain hence why he
compromised with the Razer Mouse I gotta
get points for the commodore 64 that's
being proudly displayed in the shelf
above nothing must go for a lot now he's
also got a few oh gee consoles up there
like the original Nintendo Sega
Dreamcast and the Mega Drive also from
Sega for anyone that's in their late 20s
or early 30s you guys remember the Sega
Genesis even till today I remember some
of the best games I've
on that console Golden Axe three Sonic
x-men Clone Wars we got Battletoads and
even Street of rage - if you guys have
played any of those games you are a true
og and you've earned my respect chaos I
managed beautifully with a single
channel raceway hiding the wires from
the PC and the monitor all the way down
to the cable rack excellent use of space
for a compact gaming and productivity
setup
well done Jasper and thank you for
entering at number three we have Joachim
from Sweden and I know I butcher the
crap out of your name so I apologize but
we have here his gaming and productivity
setup featuring a 48 inch curved 4k TV
from Samsung and a 27-inch monitor
that's mounted vertically this is an
interesting way of setting up two
different sized displays he even managed
to pick up the perfect size so it fits
flush right next to it he did do a good
job keeping the surface of the desk
clutter free we have a bar mellow
keyboard and a large tech g43 Mouse and
next to that is a tray holding his
remotes and other miscellaneous tech I
know I recommend this a lot of my videos
but this desk has plenty of space to add
a pullout drawer under it so that he can
hide those items instead of leaving it
in plain sight for audio he does have a
few sources he's got the Sennheiser RS
185 s and you guys remember that super
expensive speakers from that rich guy in
episode 161 well this guy's rocking the
same pair the keV LS 50s with the iso
acoustic stands he does have a mic setup
as well a blue yeti hooked up to a boom
on the desk is using is custom made with
a built-in cable management rack and all
the wires are routed straight to the pc
which has a 5820k
16 gigs of ram and the ACS GTX 1080p is
tricks
it's a beautiful yet powerful
productivity and gaming setup but I feel
like it's missing some personality I
feel like it's all work and no play
maybe got some posters or even a wall
shelf with some of your favorite stuff
on there to give it some spice but yeah
overall it's a solid setup thank you Joe
Kemp for entering and again I apologize
for butchering your name kuba from
Poland is coming in at number four with
his gaming and photo editing
so he has a 43 inch TV sitting on a
shelf that's really close to his bed and
he uses that for gaming through his Xbox
controllers and this display is also
connected to his PC the main setup has a
24 inch asus monitor hooked up to
another core oblique counter top down
these tables are popular apparently so
on the desk we have yet another compact
keyboard this one is from moto speed and
it's the CKD 61 with custom sided led
key caps and a self-made coiled cable
which looks really cool and kind of
blends in with the keyboard LEDs for
audio he has a pair of fender r50
speakers and the HyperX cloud headset
resting on a hanger powering it all it's
a custom PC rocking 860 600 K 32 gigs of
ram and the gtx strakes 1060 cables are
neatly managed underneath the desk with
an SD card reader attached for
convenience no real complaints support
this setup I feel like it's organized
very well with purpose
however it could use some more lighting
maybe adding an LED strip behind the
desk will brighten up the setup a bit
more but I got a feeling you like a
dimly lit setup either way Thank You
kuba for a to me last but not least we
have Trevor and his gaming setup he's
actually using my favorite tabletop from
Ikea the halas dad and he's got to alex'
yours as support mount on the desk are
two different 27-inch monitors from Asus
and below that we got the corsair k70
luxe RGB keyboard and the Razer
DeathAdder elite mouse which he drill a
hole for nicely done per audio he's
using a pair of DT 990 headphones and
the blue Yeti microphone which is next
to a Lego NASA Apollo Saturn rocket and
next to that we got the PC powering at
all which has an 8700 K 16 gigs of ram
and the gtx 1070 from asus an
interesting color choice he's using
green sleeve cables with RGB lighting
but then the lighting from the keyboard
mouse and RGB strip are purple so
nothing's really consistent here what is
consistent is the cable management a
signal rack to hold the cables
underneath the desk and a mounted power
strip obviously I would recommend the
hangar to all of your headphones but
other than that it's a really clean and
straightforward setup Thank You Trevor
for entering
and that wraps up this episode of setup

who has the best desk setup in this
episode I'll announce the winners on my
Twitter and Instagram accounts thanks
