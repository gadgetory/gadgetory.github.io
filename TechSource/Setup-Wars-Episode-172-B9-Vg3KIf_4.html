welcome to setup wars episode 172 where
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel if you guys
still haven't submitted those photos
what on earth are you waiting for click
the link below and participate on the
best setup show on YouTube with that
said let the setup wars begin so some of
you guys know that I use a dot tech
domain for my business website deals or
tech where you can find the best tech
deals posted from various sources and I
also have Edgar Tech which can direct
you straight to my youtube channel I got
my dot Tech domain back in 2015 when it
first launched and it was one of the
best decisions I've ever made it just
makes sense to have a dot tech domain
making tech content on YouTube the
domain extension has grown over the last
four years even brands like Viacom CES
and Intel have moved to a tech domain so
if you're a programmer a developer or
just a tech enthusiast like me go get
yourself a dot tech domain for your
dream startup passion project or your
personal portfolio visit go Tech slash
Edgar or click the link below and use
the code Edgar to get $90 off one and
five-year registrations kicking off the
episode is Bryce and his cozy setup from
Iowa so he's a student who also works as
an auto detailer and he uses this setup
for studying photo editing and light
gaming because a single 27-inch monitor
mounted against the desk and a second
monitor against the wall off to the side
which I'm guessing he uses to watch
videos from his bed the desk is custom
made out of a laurel oak laminate table
top and some IKEA legs and on top of
that we got the curser k55 RGB keyboard
and the main reason why this setup is
used for light gaming the logitech and
310 wireless mouse he doesn't have any
headphones so instead he uses a sound
bar for all the audio also a side note
those drawings in the wall are
incredible if you did those you have
some serious talent but I do recommend
putting those in a clear sheet so it
doesn't get damaged over time a fun
little fact when I was in middle school
growing up leaving high school I used to
draw a lot I was a big
I'm drawing and I was actually pretty
good artist and I was a big fan of
Dragon Ball Z and a bunch of anime so I
used to draw a bunch of characters at
the time and if I wasn't doing YouTube I
would definitely be an animator at some
point but growing up we were poor and my
mom couldn't afford to send me to
driving school so here I am doing
YouTube and I always say everything
happens for a reason
anyways back to the setup so Bryce also
uses a MacBook Pro for mobility
however the PC powering the setup is a
blacked out custom built rig and it's
got the 7700 T 32 gigs of ram and the
EVGA GTX 1060 super-clean work with the
cables by the way and the same for the
rest of the setup we have a Signum
holding the wires up and a bunch of
velcro that he used to tie the cables to
the legs and very cozy and productive
setup with purpose Thank You Bryce for
entering next up is cheb from Canada and
his venom inspired gaming setup he's
rocking to 27-inch monitors that are
mounted on the IKEA ragas stat desk
which has an interesting design actually
I just checked and apparently it's
supposed to be like that but it looks
like it's slightly modded so that it can
mount against the wall without the legs
interfering also this is a much deeper
desk than usual so as monitors are
further from his eyes obviously the
further away your monitor is the smaller
it appears so a 27-inch monitor probably
looks like a 25 inch monitor from that
distance for peripherals he's rocking a
Logitech g13 keyboard and the G 300s
Mouse which he drilled a hole for and
his audio gear consists of an RCA sound
bar and the turtlebeach week on x50
headset which he keeps in his drawer
when he's not using it cables can
definitely be improved by using a longer
Raceway like these which also have a
corner cover and this will do a better
job hiding those cables the PC powering
the setup is also venom inspired with
the red lighting and the aio tubing
which can represent Venom's tongue I
guess depending on how you look at it I
mean it's pretty badass setup but it
does need some cable tweaks to improve
Thank You shed for entering speaking of
Marvel at number three we have a
Deadpool ish inspired setup I mean I
guess it's not that pill inspired just
because he has a few wallpapers and a
figurine on the desk so we'll just call
it a black and red
anywho ZZZ so my man denim is rocking an
ultra-wide and a 27-inch monitor which
he mounted against the desk and he still
has space for his massive gaming pc
which by the way looks like the company
ripped off of Cougar I mean isn't me
order these cases look very similar so
the desk is from ikea it's a generic
glass tabletop with steel legs but it's
built really well apparently if it's
able to support all that gear without
bowing he's using the asus rog claymore
gaming keyboard with the rog spastic
gaming mouse and a corsair RGB mousepad
I do like that he tied the cables
together instead of running them
straight across the desk like most
people someone who thinks on a desk
included skin next box 1s and a
Bluetooth speaker from Sony which is the
only audio source he has the PC powering
everything is actually his first gaming
PC that he built which was inspired by
my videos that's pretty cool it's black
and red themed but it has RGB lighting
and it's packing some serious power with
the 8700 K and the r-tx 2080 this is a
really nice rig for your first PC build
nicely done
even the cables are managed beautifully
lots of zip ties velcro straps and cable
sleeves were used to keep everything
underneath the desk and for some reason
we have another table down here where
his printer is obviously I would try and
move the printer somewhere else in your
room it just doesn't seem comfortable
down there or as a last resort you can
also install a wall shelf underneath the
desk to hold up your printer it will
free up a lot of space giving you more
leg room regardless it's still a sick
gaming setup and I'm really happy that
my videos inspired you to build such an
awesome gaming PC thank you for entering
coming in at number four is Imus I think
and has awesome laptop powered
productivity and gaming setup the Lenovo
Y 700 is the star of the show giving
power to a couple displays we got a 32
inch LCD monitor and a 22 inch Dell
monitor mounted vertically I misplaced
that this is temporary and that he will
be building a gaming PC in the coming
years that will replace his laptop
eventually ok so on the desk we got the
omen gaming keyboard and mouse which is
basically a rebranded SteelSeries apex M
350 keyboard and a rival 300 Mouse
that's pretty much it on the surface he
did keep it clean and minimalistic we
also got a pair of artists
seven headphones resting on the side of
the desk and no cables and sites oh and
there's also a Nintendo switch on the
other side it's a pretty straightforward
setup not much else to it really it's
simple and straight to the point
Thank You IMS for entering and I'm sorry
if I butchered your name and finally we
got Fabio all the way from Portugal with
a badass modded PC desk he used this for
gaming watching youtube videos movies
and anime you can't forget about anime
so he built a desk out of the egg back
in countertop from Ikea and a large
piece of glass
he 3d printed the fan grilles and
painted them in black the RGB strip is
connected with his Wi-Fi and can be
controlled by Alexa that's pretty sweet
and finally check out the dope custom
predator led logo in the center of three
reservoirs obviously those reservoirs
serve no purpose other than aesthetics
since the entire build is air-cooled but
it would have been awesome to see
something like that on a water-cooled PC
disk on the side of the desk are two
cutouts one for the motherboard and one
for the GPU but I also love how we use
grommets to cover up the holes that he
drilled in the desk the rest of the
setup consists of a 34 inch ultra wide
monitor that's mounted against the wall
and the cooler master master set
keyboard with the SteelSeries rival 110
Mouse not much you can do with the
cables because of the glass tabletop
however the rest of the wires are
managed pretty good underneath the desk
he also built a custom mount for his TV
that's right in front of his bed for
watching videos and he channeled the
cables back to the setup using a wall
raceway I guess my only concern with the
desk would be air flow I don't see any
positive airflow going on if those four
fans are intake then where is the
exhaust and if those are exhaust then
where does the air get pulled in from
I'm worried that the two cutouts on the
side don't do a good job exhausting air
out personally I would have added a few
more fans in the back of the desk as
exhaust but what do I know I haven't
built anything like this before it's
still a pretty sick project Thank You
Fabio for sharing this awesome setup
with us and that's it for this episode
but I've set up or as always make sure
you guys comment below and vote on who
you think has the best desk setup and
why if you guys want to see any sneak
peeks and upcoming projects that I'm
working on you know where to find me
thanks again so much for watching as
always I will see your beautiful faces
and
