next GPU that's probably why you clicked
on this video
unless you're broke in are just watching
this because you're bored I'm not going
to bore you guys with any specs and a
bunch of nonsense I'm just going to show
you the prices and then jump into the
benchmarks and at the end of the video
I'm going to give you guys a recap and
show you guys the performance per dollar
for all of these graphics cards so the
top 5 GPUs that cost $200 or less are
the following the EVGA GTX 1063 gigabyte
variant that goes for $1.99 and please
keep in mind that these are the prices
at the time of making this video and
they will change over time we also have
the msi RX 470 also going for $200
however this one has a $15.00 mail and
rebate but i'm not going to count
discounts we also have the asus strix r9
380 that's going for 190 then we got the
gigabyte gtx 1050 TI overclocked edition
for 160 dollars the asus strix
RX 460 overclocked edition as well for
$135 and finally as a bonus card the new
gigabyte gtx 1050 which retails for 120
dollars here is a list of the PCI cables
needed to power each GPU and you guys
can pause the screen to check it out if
you need more time and finally here is a
list for all the port's that each card
comes with for benchmarks I use my
trusty old test bed that's rocking me 59
30 K that's overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz
16 gigs of RAM and an Asus x99 Strix
motherboard just to make sure that there
are no bottle making in the results I've
also reran fresh benchmarks for all of
these cards using the latest drivers so
with that said here are the benchmarks
so what did we learn here well if you
want the best graphics card for $200 the
obvious choice is the EVGA GTX 1060 /
the RX 470 it also has the second
highest score in terms of price to
performance now if you want the best
bang for your buck the gtx 1050 is the
obvious choice coming in at just two
dollars and eight cents per FPS the
second card it gives you the most value
is the gtx 1060 like i just mentioned
and then in third place is the RX 470
regardless in the end it comes down to
what your budget is and how much you are
willing to spend there is definitely a
huge gap between the performance of the
gtx 1050 TI and the gtx 1060 for only 40
dollars i would definitely save up and
buy the gtx 1060 instead but if you only
want to game in 1080p and want to get
the most value out of your money the
obvious choice is the gtx 1050 once
again I'll drop a link to all these
cards down below surprisingly the GTX
1060 is also the smallest card out of
the six which tells you guys size does
not matter so a lot of you guys keep
asking me ed where do you get all your
music from to use in your videos well I
actually have a few sources but the main
one is audible
in fact the music that you guys are
listening to right now in the background
as well as the benchmark music that you
guys listened to earlier are both from
audible if you guys haven't heard of
them audio blocks has one of the largest
stock audio libraries on the internet
with over a hundred thousand audio clips
loops music and even sound effects the
reason why I like using them is because
all their audio clips are royalty-free
which means I won't run into any
copyright issues now normally the
subscription will cost 99 dollars a year
but just for my subscribers only they
are offering an exclusive $50 discount
so you guys can get an entire year for
just $49 that's unlimited downloads for
music sound effects and even loops so
definitely check them out if you guys
are interested visit audio blocks comm
slash holidays or click on the link down
below I'm gonna give huge thanks to
audio blocks for sponsoring this episode
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
