son or even your best friend a gift for
this Christmas but you guys have no idea
what you want to get them while you're
in luck I actually have two videos that
are going to help you out a bit in this
video I'm going to be going over the
best gaming tech that you can buy for
this holiday season and then the other
video which will be coming shortly will
be on the best non gaming tech that you
can buy
so that wasting our time let's begin
alright so let's start off with a few
gaming laptops in case you're feeling
extra generous for your gift idea first
up is the 15.6 inch Dell gaming laptop
with a core i5 eight gigabytes of RAM
256 gigabytes of SSD space and an nvidia
geforce gtx 960m graphics card this
laptop will get you around 40 to 50 FPS
on fallout 4 on medium settings this
laptop is well-known to be one of the
best given its price tag moving up the
ladder we have the Asus 17-inch that
comes equipped with an i7 16 gigabytes
of RAM and one terabyte of hard drive
space with an nvidia gtx 970m graphics
card which will surely kick some ass in
games let's jump into some console
gaming will quick an obvious gift for
the holidays is a brand new console
whether it's an Xbox one or a
PlayStation 4 in charter bundle which
are both $50 off but let's say they
already have consoles well you guys can
actually pick up some pretty dope
accessories for them like this portable
gaming station for the PlayStation 4
it's a traveling bag that holds your
controllers power supplies and other
accessories
it features shoulder straps to keep the
console tucked in and a 19 inch 720p LED
display which you can use to either game
on or watch movies DVDs or even screen
media if you travel a lot and take your
console with you then this is something
worth looking at there's even a version
for the Xbox 360 let's take a look at
some more accessories for consoles like
charging stations we have a few
available for the PlayStation 4 the one
from PDP which has a pretty cool stand
and then we have the Nyko charger which
is the one I'm actually using for my
PlayStation 4 I like this one better
because the charging process is really
easy you basically hook up the
controller with a dongle and snap it in
place using the magnetic base for the
Xbox there are a few options we got the
same design from energizer that comes
with to 700 million power battery packs
and one from BD and a which uses the
same
style of charging like the nichael
charger as you need to drop your
controller off and it will start
charging instead of having to connect it
to something
the last charging station is from dream
gear and this one has a really cool way
of charging now to mention the dope
green LEDs and two extra rechargeable
batteries that come with a charger
speaking of charging controllers this
one has a different approach this is a
2600 milliamp hour power bank that you
can attach to the PlayStation 4
controller and it will charge it one
point six times which is perfect if you
need to game longer another add-on for
the controller is this type pad from
don' which is a Bluetooth keyboard you
can hook up to your controller which is
a much better way of typing than using
the directional pads there's also one
available for the Xbox one but it's from
Microsoft which means that it's
overpriced as hell last accessory for
the console Department is this vertical
stand for the PlayStation 4 that has a
cooling fan that will prevent your ps4
from overheating and burning your table
from long hours of play there's also
three USB ports built-in that you can
use to charge your controllers alright
so that's enough about consoles let's
talk PC gaming we have a set of awesome
LED speakers that come in blue green and
red which I went over on my cool tech of
September these things not only look
cool but they have an amazing base that
will definitely wake up the neighbors so
if you're looking for something to spice
up your set up and in the market for
speakers you should definitely check
these out speaking of setups lots of you
guys have been asking me to show off
some gaming desks well here is one
that's been on my list for a long time
this is the Atlantic gaming desk that
first made its appearance in set upwards
episode 26 made out of steel rod
construction and silver metallic steel
with carbon fiber finish this gaming
desk has it all a cup holder headphone
hanger on the side a tray underneath the
desk to keep some notebooks and other
stuff in a rack for DVDs or console
controllers on the right side and
another rack which you can use to keep
phones and other flat devices on it also
comes with a monitor riser but all the
things I mentioned can be removed if you
want including those speaker trays
located on the corners getting some
skins for a gift is also a great idea
whether they have a SmartWatch laptop or
even a gaming console the brand has you
covered with premium skins that have the
most precise fit in the world from
carbon fiber to mat and even leather
style skins they have it all I'll gonna
leave a link down below if you guys
check them out I'm not gonna go over any
gaming monitors since I already did a
video on it then you guys can check it
out by clicking on the card on the top
right but I will talk about some gaming
gear my all-time favorite budget gaming
keyboard and mouse still remains the
same with the red dragon s101 set which
is only at 26 bucks right now we also
have the popular CM storm Devastator
combo that's only 5 bucks more and
lastly another keyboard and mouse combo
by e-sports which has replaceable metal
key caps and blue LEDs for headsets we
have the Turtle Beach ear force recons
which are compatible with the
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and a more
premium headset for $80 the HyperX cloud
gaming headset still remains one of my
personal favorites even till today and
this will also work both for the
PlayStation 4 and PC however if you're
still on a budget that sent a gaming
headset is extremely hard to beat for
the price point if you want to keep your
headphones and add an external mic then
I strongly recommend the antlion mod mic
which I featured in my cool tech of July
video it has a magnetic clasp which is
easily detachable and the boom arm is
flexible the kinivo 3 port HDMI switch
is also a nice add-on for any set up you
can plug up to 3 HDMI devices into this
thing and switch between them using a
wireless remote or with a button on the
actual device so basically you can hook
up your gaming console DVD player and
your cable box to your monitor using
this device last night at least let's
take a look at some really great TVs for
gaming first up is the Samsung 32-inch
TV with a 60 Hertz refresh rate for
around 220 bucks next up is the sony 48
inch smart TV and this thing has some
really thin bezels the last TV on my
list is the LG 43 inch and this one 2
has extremely thin bezels all of these
are extremely great TVs and you can't go
wrong with either one of them so that's
it for the best gaming tank you can buy
for this holiday season if this video
helped you guys out please hit that like
button and make sure you subscribe to
the channel so you don't miss out on my
other video coming out within a week but
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching I will see you in the next
