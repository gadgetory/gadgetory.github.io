One m9 that's sponsored by cell cashier
com they compare iPhone prices on the
internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iPhone
what's up guys it's ed back again from
Texas and welcome to another camera
comparison video this time we are facing
off the HTC One m9 against the galaxy
note 4 but Before we jump into some
samples let's take a quick look at their
specs so the m9 has a twenty point seven
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.2 that can shoot up to 4k
resolution at 30fps and e note 4 has a
16 megapixel camera with an aperture of
2.2 which can also shoot up to 4k
resolution at 30fps both phones feature
continuous autofocus and digital image
stabilization but only the note 4 has
optical as well and four front-facing
cameras the m9 has a 4 megapixel camera
that can shoot in 1080p and the note 4
has a 3.7 megapixel camera that can
shoot in 1440p alright so that's it for
the specs let's sit back relax and take
a look at some samples
what does if you guys it said from Texas
and welcome to the sound test and
stabilization test between the m9 and
the Galaxy Note 4 now I did enable
optical image stabilization on the note
4 just so you guys can see the
difference between both phones that
means both of them are being recorded in
1080p unfortunately because 4k disables
the optical image stabilization
the m9 seems to be focusing really well
here there are times where the camera
goes in and out to try and capture the
object but nonetheless it's really
accurate and quick the note 4 also does
a good job although there are times
where the focusing just gets stuck and
it's not as reliable as the m9 which can
get annoying sometimes if you need to
swap between objects really quickly
so both phones did a great job during
the day not a whole lot of differences
the note for pick seemed to be slightly
more saturated but not to a point where
it ruins the image the m9 does have
trouble picking up reds and instead
gives it a pinkish and saturated look
even the note 4 can capture it's real
rosy color but at least it did a better
job than the m9 there is no denying the
amount of detail and sharpness in the m4
picks due to its higher megapixel count
but I think both phones do a fantastic
job for daytime picks moving inside and
away from the Sun the note 4 seems to do
slightly better with sharper and more
detailed images it even captures blacks
without over exposing the background
however the m9 takes the point once
again when it comes to selfies for
low-light performance the note 4 takes
the point the pics just have lot less
noise and a good balance of exposure
which lets you see everything in the
shot even though the note 4 is flash
isn't the best out there it still does a
lot better than the m9 so for overall
low-light pictures the note 4 wins
switching to daylight video on 4k I
think the note 4's footage looks so much
better but that can be a personal
preference I just like the color
reproduction on the note 4 compared to
the m9 and the footage just seems to be
more sharper too sadly the m9 doesn't
have optical image stabilization so it
already lost the stabilization test as I
mentioned in my previous video I would
have preferred to see optical image
stabilization instead of 4k capability
if they had to choose between the two
for next year's model for low-light
video once again the m9 crashes and
burns there's really no competition here
as the note 4 does a phenomenal job in
low-light settings the footage is a lot
more clearer and has a lot less noise so
the final verdict I would say overall
the note 4 does a better job it has a
fantastic camera for low-light scenarios
and does a great job during the day as
well so you can't go wrong with picking
the note 4 however if you don't think
pictures at night at all and love taking
selfies the m9 would be a much better
choice for you but obviously comes down
to personal preference and some people
don't even care about the camera
performance when deciding on a
smartphone anyway that's it for the
