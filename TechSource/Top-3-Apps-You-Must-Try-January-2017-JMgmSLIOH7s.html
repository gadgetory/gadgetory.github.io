source and welcome back to another
episode of top three apps
you must try just like the previous
episode all these apps are available for
free on Android and iOS so with that
being said let's start off the list
first up we have prismo which is a
really cool photo editing app with tons
of unique filters and tools the standout
feature of Prisma is being able to
transform any image into a work of art
there's tons of styles to choose from my
favorite being the van Gogh and Picasso
but there's also Leviton for example the
filters can really help your photos
stand out and the best part of this all
is that you can easily upload these on
to social media a cool little trick that
I found with this app is actually to go
to the discover section where you can
check out other people's pictures and
get a sense of how they're using the
filters so at number 2 we have wonder
list this is a great heavy to do list
app that actually makes getting things
done a little bit more convenient so in
addition to creating tasks you can add
subtasks notes and also add files to
each one so you can have all the info
you need on a note every to do tasks can
be sorted into their own lists and you
can even share them so you can
collaborate with others on the same note
the app also lets you set due dates and
reminders for important deadlines but
best of all wonder list syncs across all
of your devices so whether that's your
desktop smartphone and even your
SmartWatch you can check your notes
anywhere lastly at number three we have
digit travel which is a trip planner app
this app is super useful for those of
you who would like to travel a lot since
it actually allows you to find the crisp
itinerary and guides in the application
itself what separates this app from all
the other travel apps in the market is
it actually goes deeper than that by
providing you weather forecast distance
and time estimates for your routes as
well as some other filters that allow
you to find interesting things based on
your searches
just like with wunderlist phidget travel
also allows you to share your trip info
with other people so you can plan
together there is a premium version at
25 bucks which is kind of a ripoff but
luckily you won't need it at all and the
free version gets the job done anyways
guys that's all for this video thank you
guys
so much for watching please leave a like
if you enjoyed and I will talk to you in
the next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
