your very own desk set up from the desk
to the PC or is a laptop monitor
keyboard headphone speakers the whole
shebang $1500 to build whatever you want
for your dream setup or maybe you want
to upgrade your current setup well when
we give it away to $1,500 set up
packages for my 100 episode of setup
wars the worst set up Edition coming up
so if you guys are excited make sure to
leave a like and also guys I'm still
accepting potato setups or crappy setups
for my 100th episode so if you guys
still haven't submitted them make sure
to send them to setup wars at gmail.com
you can use wetransfer calm or Google
Drive and send in ten pictures of your
setup and different angles of course
that make sure you list all of the items
on your setup to that email just so I
know what I'm looking at but the
deadline is April 15th that is the last
thing you can send your submissions in
but anyways all that mumbo jumbo out of
the way welcome to setup wars episode 98
let the setup force begin
starting to show off we got Henrik and a
beautiful symmetrical setup just look at
those monitors they're practically bezel
asst these are the 24 inch dell
ultrasharp displays and it looks like he
mounted them against a desk mount and
did an excellent job on hiding those
cables sandwiching the monitors are a
pair of Prisma 55 speakers and on the
countertop we got a CM storm rapid eye
keyboard and the MX master mouse but he
does have a cue pad Mouse as well for
gaming I'm assuming I don't know why but
that's great keyboard wire is just
satisfying to look at maybe I'm just
weird
off to the left side of the desk he's
got a set of headphones
we got the m50 X's and the other two I
have no idea since he didn't les them
the PC does pattern setup is on the
ground and it's equipped with a 6600 K
16 gigs of ram and an msi r9 290x and
while we're down here cable management
seems to be under control everything is
neatly wrapped up together with some zip
ties and tucked away under the desk a
satisfying and symmetrical setup Thank
You henrik for entering next up is kevin
&amp;amp;
I'm going to be right back
you
all right so Kevin is rocking a 29 inch
ultra wide from LG because the Corsair
RGB keyboard and a nexus wired silent
Mouse when on earth is a silent Mouse
exactly I'm not liking how you drilled a
separate hole for the mouse because not
only do you have two holes in the
mousepad but it just doesn't look there
this way it would have been better if
you hit the wire underneath the keyboard
like everyone else and use the same hole
as the keyboard cable management is
pretty good now that's something I
haven't seen before on the show instead
of mounting the power strip underneath
the desk you somehow use zip ties to
hook them up against the wall and then
use curtains to cover them that's pretty
creative
regardless it's off the ground so I
can't really complain also down here we
got the m50x headphones hanging from the
elevation labs anchor and finally the PC
that's powering the setup has an FX 8350
and an EVGA GTX 970 a very clean setup
indeed
thank you Kevin for entering and number
three we got standard and his SiC triple
monitor black and wet setup featuring
three quad HD 144 Hertz 27 inch monitors
from Dell hooked up to a monitor arm the
desk is using is the IKEA Mickey and he
also has not one but two Alex drawers to
hold up his massive ass Corsair 780 T
tower pushing these pixels are three i
repeat 3 gtx 980ti is in sli and then we
got a 5820k processor looks like it's
water-cooled as well under that's we got
the Corsair k95 RGB keyboard rog spatha
wireless gaming mouse and that mousepad
though it's a custom made dead space 3
mouse pad from Inked gaming that's
pretty sick Bharati oh he's using the
bose companion 5 speakers and the
Corsair void wireless headset hanging
under his desk I don't know what those
red spire looking things are but I'm
gonna assume it's from dead space 3 or
something because I think I saw
something similar to that when I was
playing the game but I liked it though
it goes well with your setups team also
points on keeping it symmetrical
excellent work with cable management not
a single wire on the ground everything
is neatly tucked away and we even have a
USB hub attached on the bottom of the
desk and away from site I love the setup
what can I say great works download and
thank you for entering to is next up
with a multi set up one for productivity
and one
for gaming it seems the productivity
side is being powered by a 13-inch
MacBook Pro and that's hooked up to a 27
inch HD monitor we got some Bose
speakers and wireless keyboard and mouse
nothing crazy on the gaming side we have
two 29 inch ultra wide monitors from LG
a mechanical Eagle keyboard and a pick
tech wireless gaming mouse
there aren't any speakers for the set up
but he is using the Beats Studio
headphones that are resting on the a
venturi steel head don't stand which has
some space below to store cables that's
pretty cool and he also has a ps4 in the
corner over there cable management is
great and this is actually a pretty cool
setup pack looks like he used some cable
clips and cable drops to hang these
earphones and lightning adapter under
his desk that's pretty creative and
finally the PC that's powering the setup
has a 6600 K and an EVGA GTX 970
I like to set up I think it's made with
purpose but it's lacking a few things
like a color scheme or theme for that
matter and I feel like it's missing some
personality as well there's a lot of
empty space above your monitors maybe
hanging a mural or a simple poster of
your favorite anime or movie or perhaps
even a wall shelf with some figurines or
props or something like that would add
some more personality to this setup but
I don't really have any other complaints
other than that great work and thank you
for entering - and finally we got Z with
a very clean and minimalistic setup what
on earth did you do with those monitor
wires though looking very clean he's
rocking a 34 inch ultra wide from Dell
that sucked up to the wall along with
the creative EMU speakers leaving a desk
with lots of extra space speaking of the
desk it's a custom-made one with a steel
frame and reclaimed wood the top which
apparently came from the barn
where his mom grew up that's pretty cool
keeping a really clean on the desk he's
got the wireless rabu keyboard and MX
master mouse which is resting on the
ikea Whistler desk pad he definitely has
some audio game he's got the creative or
ivana live headphones and the awesome
Sound Blaster x7 to deliver that crisp
audio the audio game isn't the only
thing that's strong take a look at his
cable management Daniel such precision
and attention to detail absolutely
stunning
however there's something missing from
this setup but you guys already notice
it what is powering this setup what a
hell is his
see it's freakin built inside his desk
and I like the other PC desk mods his
can actually be pulled out like a drawer
and it's hidden away nicely it's rocking
a 57 GK and a gigabyte r93 ATX a very
beautiful and nicely modded setup if I
say so myself
Thank You Z for entering so that is the
fifth episode of setup or thing guys so

comments down below and vote on your
best setup all of you guys vote within
