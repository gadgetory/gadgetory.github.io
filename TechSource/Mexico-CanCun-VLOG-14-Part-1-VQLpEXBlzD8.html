Oh he pushed in.
WOW, this is huge.
Woah. &amp;quot;Where's our bags?&amp;quot;
They're gonna bring it.
There's our king-sized bed, Shower right next door. As always.
Closets, TV.
And the balcony.
But that view though!

Is this what you pictured, when you heard of Cancun?
'Cause this is what I pictured.
My lens is getting foggy because it's so humid.
♪♪♪
So yeah guys, so far this is day 1 of Cancun.
And we've only been here for about 4 hours and so far i'm loving it.
Like this is definitely exactly what imagined in Cancun.
So I think I am going to swim maybe an hour more and then,
we are going to go change up and relax a bit, go get something to eat,
and actually guys everything in this entire trip is inclusive, like all the drinks, all the foods.
The drinks from the bars, the foods from the room service, and anything inside the hotel.
Is completely free, so I don't have to pay anything extra which is awesome, and it's unlimited.
So unlimited booze, unlimited food, its freaking ridiculous.
We actually have a bunch of things planned for the next few days,
I'll do my best to try and vlog guys, but honestly I just kinda want to enjoy myself and...
the point of this vacation was to stay away from YouTube and stop making videos so,
ill try vlog here and there, but I am also going to try and enjoy this vacation so yeah.
&amp;quot;I want to take a picture like this&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;mine looks so stupid, I don't want to post this.&amp;quot;
Say hi to my subscribers mom!
&amp;quot;Hi&amp;quot;
First time she's ever on the camera too.
Drinking her non-alcoholic drink, in Cancun!
There's also a few other pools on that side, and there is one up there.
I think there is a total of 4 pools at this hotel.
♪♪♪
Alright so we're done swimming in the pool, so now we are going to go upstairs,
shower, rest up, and then go back downstairs to get some food,
and I think we are going to call it a night, cause we're honestly still exhausted from the flight.
and then tomorrow, and the next few days we got a lot of really cool things planned so,
Ill try and vlog all that, and yeah ill see you guys soon.
♪♪♪
It's time some, romantic dinner.
(conversation)
&amp;quot;How's vacation spot?&amp;quot;
So far, so great, having the best time ever.
&amp;quot;This is so pretty.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Thankyou.&amp;quot;
♪♪♪
Cheers babe, here's is to a good week in Cancun, I love you.
&amp;quot;aww love you babe, let me put down my phone.&amp;quot;
and yeah, can't wait for this to be a good memory.
These aren't even glass.
