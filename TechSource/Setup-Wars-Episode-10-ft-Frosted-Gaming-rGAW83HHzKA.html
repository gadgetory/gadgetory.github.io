announced an entirely new series called

setup Wars but we're focusing only on
custom pcs everything is basically the
same the only difference is I'm going to

beginning of every month for now and the
reward is a hundred bucks instead of 25
but guys somehow missed it you guys can
click on the video over here check that
out or the link in the description
section spoiler alert it has a pretty
badass intro alright so moving on with
the show on this episode we have a
special guest Sean from frost gaming I'm
gonna be featuring his setup IP end of
this episode also all the products I
mentioned this video will be linked down
below as well as any products I
recommend it would also have its special
section down below a little that said
let's go ahead an ounce the contestants
the four chosen for this week are Johnny
Jonathan Jr productions and mark
congratulations for making it this week
of setup wars anywho let's jump straight
into Johnny's setup so we have two 24
inch asus monitors attached to a desk
mount and a 32 inch vizio TV mounted on
the wall on the desk we have an NVIDIA
shield TV a Logitech G 710 keyboard g700
Mouse and Logitech speakers with bass
point for the awesome dxracer chair and
- the point for using a clip as your
headphone hanger for the logitech 930
headphones cable management could be
better and I strongly recommend you and
everyone else to check out my next video
where I show some really cool cable
management techniques I posted this
picture on my Instagram showing the
before and after and like I said I will
explain what I did in my cool tech of
August which is coming this Wednesday it
will definitely help you guys out on
cable management
I also recommend getting rid of that
ghetto clip that you are using to hold
your headphones and put an actual
good-looking one I actually went ahead
and left a few options down below for
you and they're all under the $10 mark
now let me rant about your monitors for
because I'm sure everyone is thinking
the same thing why is there a huge gap
between them it could be due to personal
preference or it can be due to the fact
that the amount you have doesn't allow
you to bring them together otherwise
they will stick out more towards you if
it's a personal preference that's fine
but if it's not then there is the amount
I listed down below that will work for
your set up and it will allow you to put
both of the monitors side by side I'm
not going to question the fact that your
mouse pad is vertical because I'm sure
that works out for you but I don't in
those recommendations you have a kugel
set up and I like the fact that you have
your TV mounted on the wall next to you
so you can watch stuff while you're on
your PC Thank You Jonny for entering
setup Wars next up is Johnathan and it
looks like a triple monitor setup we
have three Asus 24-inch monitors hooked
up to a desk mount we also got some
Razer gear the Black Widow 2013 edition
keyboard an Ouroboros mouse with an
extended mouse mat and that makes me
very happy to see good job Johnny
there's also a Logitech Z 506 speaker
system and your custom-made hanger
that's holding up your razor Megalodon
gaming headset and I hope I didn't
butcher that I absolutely love how clean
this setup is it's symmetrical organized
and well put together cable management
is also spot-on and I'm digging that USB
hub you have attached on the roof of
your desk you also have some shelves on
top holding some of the PC parts and
other products and you can have a
mini-fridge right next to you
pretty sick PC as well we have an Intel
i7 4790k paired with a geforce 660ti
inside the awesome Aero cool predator
case a brilliant setup Jonathan I have
nothing bad to say about it thank you
for entering setup wars next up is Jeff
productions and it looks like a
Productivity type setup let's go team
Apple whoa whoa whoa relax I'm just
kidding jeez so we have a 2014 iMac with
a 2013 MacBook Pro and the famous
Logitech performance X Mouse and VK 750
wireless solar keyboard I'm not sure if
you have a YouTube channel or not but it
looks like you film and edit videos
since you have the boom mic extension
hooked up to the Focusrite audio
interface also the gh4 box on the far
right of your desk is a big giveaway but
you didn't give your channel name or any
social media to mention so I don't know
who you
our excellent work with cable management
and I see that you have a dedicated
place for your headphones off of the
table one thing I would recommend simply
because I don't see it anywhere on your
desk is a micro SD card reader that you
can attach on the top of your focus
right Ã¡i with some 3m tape kind of like
what I did with mine
and it should really help you transfer
files from ugh for more conveniently
especially since it's right in front of
you but that's all I got you have a
really great setup Thank You junior for
entering setup Wars last but not least
we have mark with his super sexy black
and white theme set up to asus rog
27-inch monitors hooked up to a desk
mount and damn those bezels are super
thin definitely really nice looking
monitors on the desk we have the corsair
k70 RGB keyboard a white m65 RGB mouse
along with the extended corsair gaming
mouse pad
excellent choice on the gaming gear and
you even went with the glacier white ps4
I'll give you a point for the color
coordination but I'll have to take the
point back because of that random GPU
that's sitting in the middle of the desk
which is very distracting why would you
do that you do have a pretty sweet PC
though an i7 3770k and a single gtx
980ti inside that massive 780 t case
from coarser cables are not visible so
you're in a free pasture and also notice
that the Astro a40 is hanging from the
monitors since you have a pretty small
desk I would obviously remove that GPU
off the desk and that astro amplifier
what you can do with that is attach it
to the right side of your desk using 3m
tape not only will it free up space on
your desk but you can still access it
easily but yeah overall a very awesome
black and white theme setup thank you
Mark for entering setup wars so before
we move on to the main event now it's
time to vote so go ahead and drop a

gaming I'll go to leave a link to that
down below but it's got a triple 144
Hertz Acer 24 inch monitor set up with a
Samsung 40 inch 4k smart TV as an
overhead on the desk he's walking the
worldcat gaming keyboard a logitech g502
gaming mouse on top of the ikea make a
desk we also got the JBL pebbles 2.0
speaker system right behind the monitors
and his blue yeti Mike Duggan marm why
do we have the exact same boom arm on my
desk setup and it's awesome on the right
we have the Corsair Vengeance H 2100
headset on the mov headphone hanger and
then you xbox one to the right you know
what will look awesome on your xbox one

from v brands and I've gotta leave a
link to that for anyone that's
interested down below I'm really diggin
LED setup you got going on though I mean

desk or even under your bed that's
pretty badass

organized person just by looking at your
setup and you got a pretty badass living
room as well cable manager in a spot on

PC as well
