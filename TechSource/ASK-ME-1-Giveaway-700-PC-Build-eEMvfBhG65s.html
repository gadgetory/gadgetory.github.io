what is up you guys is that from Texas
and welcome to a Q&amp;amp;A slash channel
update kind of video and I normally
don't do these types of on-camera videos
I'm normally behind the camera doing
unboxings reviews and stuff like that
but I want to get to know you guys at a
more personal level so I'll try and do
these as often as I can but to stop the
video I'm just gonna answer some of your
questions I asked on Twitter and if you
do have any additional questions you
want to ask me you can do a hash tag ask
Edgar through Twitter or you can drop
them in the comment section down below
and I will feature it in the next video
alright so the first question comes from
Anne Tomlin and he asks is YouTube your
main job also are all these computer
components review samples like they
Gettys and I'll try and be as short and
concise as possible but youtube is my
main and only job currently I am a
one-man team I do all the researching
the editing the scripting the voiceovers
and all that so yes it currently is a
full-time job also the computer
components are 99% of them are funded by
me they are not review samples
unfortunately I wish they were but I
think the only sample I received was the
NZXT case which is actually right there
behind me and the the in one case which
I did a review over from in when those
are only two products I believe that
were review samples everything from the
Yeti video and that's my ultimate PC
number one by the way if you guys
haven't noticed but those parts are all
founded by me next question comes from a
zat I hope I pronounced that correctly
she asks do you prefer Santa Monica or
Malibu definitely the Bahamas so neither
those yeah
Chihuahua duardo Silva asks do you like
Mortal Kombat if yes the new ones or the
old ones or both okay so we're getting
kind of off topic here but that's cool
definitely the old Mortal Kombat series
specifically the Super Nintendo
those are the best ones of all times
Lavanya main is asked which phone are
you more excited about the s6 the s6
edge or the m9 I know you asked us about
a few weeks ago before the m9 actually
came out but if I would answer at the
time I will definitely say the s6 the m9
they're really they really weren't that
many improvements on the phone and
actually you really disappointed on the
m9 currently I actually made a video on
that explaining five reasons where you
shouldn't buy the m9 and the s6 edge
kind of seems gimmicky so I was actually
more interested and the s6 because of
its build quality Samsung finally
finally after five years decided to go
with a more premium build so I'm really
excited to see the s6 in hand and see
how well it compares to other flagship
phones so yes it's that lovely philip
Glickman asks in your how to paint your
GPU video how did you keep the 780ti
letters black after you sprayed them
quick and easy answer to that is I used
a black fine point sharpie and I just
traced over the 780ti letters
simple as that sar faz asks can we have
a cheap budget PC build with every step
before I answer this actually when I
quickly announced what happened with the
Zion build we filmed all the portions of
the videos into the benchmarks and we
did the actual how to build video but
then Bob's PC got corrupted and we lost
all those files and so we just kind of
gave up on that video but to answer your
new question yes we're definitely gonna
be actually a budget bill that's coming
up soon and I will be talking about that
at the end of this video my good friend
Scottie asks will you expand and hire
others to help you grow tech source and
yes definitely definitely need help
there's just so much content right now
that one person just really can't manage
even if I do like one video a day I have
no I have essentially no life there's no
other personal time I have outside of
text source so definitely wanna bring a
few people over to help me out at least
with the editing or filming potions so
maybe like around the 200,000 subscriber
mark
definitely possible yes next question
comes from Tyler's tech and he asks what
is the best way to get your videos
noticed there's a lot of actual answers
for this one but to keep it short and
simple I would definitely say do
something unique I think the more unique
your video is the more people will enjoy
the content and they will need their
feedback they leave comments likes I'll
even share with their friends and if
they do that the engagement level is
high in the video and what YouTube does
is they start to feature that video on
the featured section on the right side
of the videos so when that happens
people stumble upon it they click on it
you see it and that's basically how your
videos get noticed that's how your
channel grows so I don't have to stick
with consistent content I would say at
least one video we could be good to we
can do it but content and being unique
is I would say to me personally is the
most important thing
all right so that is it for all the
questions you guys ask me I still get a
bunch of the same questions every day so
I figured that answer them right now
while I'm answering questions and that
is where do I get my wallpaper from and
I answer that a lot and Instagram even
on Twitter and even the comments section
on below but I still get a bunch of them
but I get him from facets da la and it's
this guy named Justin Muller he makes
amazing really badass wallpapers and
I'll leave a link in the description if
you guys want to check him out actually
a lot of people from the tech community
use his wallpaper so I'm surprised you
guys haven't found that out yet but
anyways that is it for the questions if
you guys have more questions ask me you
can drop them in the comment section
down below or you can hashtag ask Edgar
on Twitter and ask me there and I'll
feature in the next video all right so
moving on I'm gonna give you a quick
update on what kind of videos you guys
should be expecting in the next few
weeks but before that I should mention
that the office store is still happening
I know I promised you guys early 2015
but that is still on my list and it will
be done before June so don't don't give
up hope yet another cool announcement
for you guys is I'm gonna be building a
$700 gaming PC build and that's actually
maybe a giveaway and it's gonna be
sponsored by the unlock
company.com so I'm gonna be building
that some time around when I hit 100,000
subscribers and the unlocking company is
actually gonna be giving that away to
one lucky subscriber so make sure you
guys are on the lookout for that video
and there'll be a lot more details when
I do upload that video okay one last
thing before I go I just want to ask you
guys on a more personal note but what
type of videos would you like to see
more of on tech source I try and keep it
balanced as much as I can but if there's
a specific type of video you like to see
more of definitely let me know in the
comment section down below
we'd like to see more PC videos more
phone videos comparisons you want me to
do reviews on food I mean whatever it is
that you're interested in let me know in
the comment section down below I will be
reading every single comments but
anyways that is for the video thank you
so much for watching I know I don't
really say this as much but I really
want to thank you guys to all my
subscribers and one watch my videos who
left their feedback
I really really appreciate you guys so
much I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for
you guys and I also want to thank Dana
Logan for making all this possible you
guys are the best also if you guys want
to reach me you can do so easily through
Instagram and Twitter I am really easy
to talk to and I always respond to my
viewers so if you have any questions or
if you want to ask for advice or just
give me feedback you can easily do so
through Instagram or Twitter but other
than that thanks again so much for
