contestants we have Andrea's Ashley Ben
David and Dean congratulations for
making it on the show so starting off
the show we have Andrea's with a 24 inch
Acer between two Samsung 24-inch
monitors for the gaming gear we have the
OCAD ryos MK pro keyboard and a ro
cation mouse on top of the sense
mousepad the microphone that's hooked up
to the fox nove scissor boom arm is the
rode podcaster and we also have a pair
of wave master M x3 plus speakers cable
management looks great no wires on the
ground then it seems like everything is
grouped together and hook it up to the
roof of the desk a fine job in the the
PC powering the setup has a 4770k and a
single Asus GTX 970 Strix the only thing
that bothers my OCD is the middle
monitor since it's not the same size as
the other two but overall a very
straightforward setup Thank You Andrea's
or entering next up is Ashley with a
dual monitor setup so we have two
24-inch BenQ monitors on top of a
custom-made wall shelf and the desk is
actually made out of a kitchen worktop
would you look at that below the
monitors we have a Razer BlackWidow
chroma key board and a Death Adder
chroma Mouse on top of the extended
Swift gaming mouse pad everything is
nice and symmetrical with two Logitech Z
200 speakers on each side ps4 console on
the left and wireless router and modem
on the right the cable management game
is also strong here I really like how we
routed the speaker and modem wires
across the side of the shelf and
straight down to the floor also the
wires up top are tied together with zip
ties I mean even cable manage the mouse
wire excellent whoa whoa whoa whoa you
didn't even watch my perfect desk setup
episode one yet that's like the best
video on my channel how do you I'm just
kidding you're probably new to the
channel so I'll drop a link to the video
down below if you want to check that out
the PC that's powering the setup has a
6700
a an msi gtx 970 and also a +1 on
picking up a brainwaves headphone hanger
for your m 50 x's overall a very clean
setup and the cable management is just
excellent thank you so much for entering
and i'm a 3 we asked ban who was
featured in the ultimate edition of
setup wars it looks like he listened to
my advice and removed the brown box next
to his setup and he also moved his
headphone hangar to the left as well
which was something I recommended Thank
You Ben for listening to my
recommendations I really hope this new
layout suits you better as far as the
gear we have the same stuff 324 inch
dual monitors Corsair k70 RGB keyboard
Mad Catz rat 9 Mouse and you Razer
Nostromo gamepad on the left side
symmetry is at its finest once again we
have 2 coasters on each side the webcam
centered with the middle monitor and a
set of logitech g502 speakers spread out
beautifully once again cable line is
going to flawless and you also have 2
drawers that appears to be well
organized a much better setup than
before I'm glad you made those
improvements and Thank You Ben for
entering this next setup should look
somewhat familiar at least a PC should
David's PC was featured in PC wars
episode 3 with his 3d printed case since
then it appears that he has upgraded his
CPU from a 4790k
to a 5820k which is overclocked to 4.4
and he is still using the Asus GTX 970
strix graphics card definitely still one
of my favorite and unique builds that I
have seen but back to the setup so david
has a single 40 inch Philips 4k monitor
that's mounted on the wall with several
wall shelves that showcase some PC parts
assuming that these were from pcs he has
owned in the past on the desk key of the
2015 12 inch macbook CM storm TK stealth
keyboard MadCatz rat 5 mouse on top of
the HyperX extended mouse pad and we
also have a pair of DIY speakers which
are from an old iPhone dock we have a
pair of AKG k612 headphones resting on a
hanger underneath the desk right next to
an SD card reader which is also hooked
up on the roof cable management on the
other hand is immaculate the IKEA Signum
rack is doing majority of the work with
the help of some cable clips to keep the
wires from hanging down he also has a
few clips holding up some charging
cables behind the dead
for when he needs quick access to some
brilliant aside from drilling a hole in
the desk
throughout the keyboard and mouse cable
through David has also custom printed
the orange desk risers and threw in a
few LED strips to create a glow effect
which really looks nice you know it's
these types of setups that really
impressed me setups that are born from
creativity and attention to detail David
congratulations man I'm awarding you the
seventh set of Bors seal of approval
call the coordination symmetry
organization cable management and simply
being unique as always the winner of the
seal receives $100 custom-made plaque
which is signed by me upon request and
one tech source t-shirt go ahead and
toss an email to set up orders to claim
your prize' buddy congratulations last
but not least we have dean with a try
display setup we have two 21 inch LG
monitors sandwich King and LG 25 inch
ultra light in the middle and on the
desk we have another set of locat here
the SQ keyboard and cone xt d RGB mouse
the desk layout is similar to David's in
the sense that he too is using the IKEA
linman desk on top of to Alex chores
also on a desk with a pair of audio
engine 80 plus speakers and
interestingly enough we also have a set
of Logitech z5o 6 speakers around the 32
inch LG TV that's mounted against the
wall I also like the spot you chose to
hang your total Beach px 20 ones and
Razer Electra headphones now here is a
brilliant idea that I would have never
thought of Dean has managed to wrap his
audio interface in carbon fiber skins
I'm definitely jacking that idea just
saying I don't know how the cable
management is since the backboard seems
to be hiding them but I will give you a
point for using the wall cable covers
for both the TV and monitors and finally
the PC that's powering this setup has a
6600 and a gigabyte GTX 970
inside the h4 40 case I feel like the
only thing missing from this setup is
some more blue the PC case and GTO mega
chair kind of feel out of place since
majority of the colors are either black
or white a few ways to balance this and
add more blue to your setup would be to
either get some LEDs in the back of your
desk RGB lighting for the keyboard or
Mouse or even simply changing the
wallpaper is something that has blue in
them would make the colors more
consistent there's even a few amazing
mouse pads that I came across
Amazon that would really spice up your
setup but I'll drop a link to them down
below if you're interested
other than the inconsistency of the
theme and the uncentered TV up top this
is a pretty sweet triple monitor setup
Thank You Dean for entering praise the
Lord that is the end of the episode so
make sure you guys drop your comments
down below and vote on who you think has
the best desk setup as always I will
announce the winners on Sunday on my
Twitter and Instagram accounts so make
sure you're following me there if you
want to know who wins as always if you
