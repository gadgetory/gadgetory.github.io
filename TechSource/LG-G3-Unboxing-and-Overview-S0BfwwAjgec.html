calm cell cashew compares iPhone prices
on the internet and then gives you a
quick quote and the most cash for your
iPhone so what are you waiting for go
ahead and check them out it's simple
fast and secure can LG finally come out
of the shadow cast by Samsung and mark
its place as an Android manufacturer to
consider what is up you guys it's ad
from Texas and today we are going to be
taking a look at the LG g3 when talking
about the g3 you use the word first a
lot like the g3 is the first global
smartphone to feature a quad HD display
and it is also the first to use a laser
autofocus feature it is also the first
LG phone that I think really competes
head-on with other manufacturers like
HTC and Samsung with a powerful chipset
and three gigs of ram its specs are
definitely up to compete against the
other flagships out on the market right
now but the question is does it we
picked up a 32 gigabyte metallic black
model from t-mobile however there is a
16 gigabyte version if you decide to buy
an unlocked version instead the g3 is
also available in two other colors
including white and gold so in the box
they included the usual set-up guide and
warranty info followed by the charging
brick microUSB cable and the 3000
milliamp battery before we move onto the
close-ups let's take a look at the specs
the g3 has a 5.5 inch quad HD IPS
display running at a resolution of 2560
by 1440 powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon
801 quad-core processor clocked at 2.5
gigahertz it also has three gigs of ram
and you can expand that's 32 gigabyte
based memory up to a whopping 128
gigabytes of space with a micro SD card
the 2560 by 1440 display on the g3 is
probably the most compelling feature as
only a few other Chinese handsets
features such a high resolution panel
the question everyone is asking however
is if the substantial jump in pixel
density was really necessary although we
do like the technical achievement LG has
accomplished here we cannot point out
any advantages from the extra pixels
when holding this device next to an
that has a screen size of around 5.5
inches and a resolution of 1080p there
is no noticeable advantage when it comes
to sharpness though the sharpness might
not have been noticeably improved LG has
managed to fit this panel around that
almost bezel as chassis 76.4% of the g3
front is occupied by the display
allowing it to fit a larger panel into
the same dimension of the HTC One that
has a 5-inch panel but like always a
screen that big no matter how small the
bezels are is still difficult to use
it's not as easy to whip out the g3 and
take a picture as it is on my HTC one
even though the actual device is the
same size the larger screen requires a
little more effort to use looking at the
front of the phone we can see the 2.1
megapixel camera notification LED and
some sensors on the back of the device
is where the volume rockers are located
power button dual flash and a 13
megapixel camera with a laser autofocus
feature on the top of the phone you will
find the IR blaster and noise cancelling
mic while the bottom contains the
microUSB port microphone and headphone
jack so as you can tell there are no
buttons on the sides of the phone or
even on the front the g3 is also very
thin measuring at 8.9 millimeters at its
thickest point which is relatively the
same as the m8 so LG decided to go with
a plastic back most of you guys know
that I am NOT a fan of plastic but I can
understand why they went with one it
makes the overall phone lighter and the
battery is replaceable so I won't
complain about the plastic covers in
this video popping the cover open you
gain access to the SIM tray and the
expandable microSD slot also if you look
at the inside of the back cover you will
see where the NFC chip is located along
with the wireless charging contacts
LG's UI is more of flying this time
around and LG has done a great job of
improving their past interface true to
LG fashion this phone is the most
customizable Android phone out of the
box it settings many was filled with
various user tweaks that are
customizable to users liking there was
lag however present and some animation
and transitions but I'm sure it'll get
fixed and a software update at least I
hope it does things like being able to
move the cursor by swiping left or right
from the space bar make LG's UI really
cool also features like dual window and
being able to
apps make using the UI very Samsung like
but nevertheless are very convenient
especially when you need to have two
things open at the same time I won't get
too much into the UI but overall I find
it very customizable and there are
plenty of features that make using this
phone very different the LG is
definitely a top contender when it comes
to I enjoy flagships and a phone to
consider when going out to buy one my
initial impressions are really good it's
bezel free display light design and
interesting do I make this phone really
stand out from the rest and I cannot
wait to use it for a while longer to get
a better sense of how it performs for
everyday tasks I will say however that
the screen is not as bright as it should
be using it outside during a sunny day
will definitely be annoying the phone
also did seem to lag when there were a
lot of animations and transitions
occurring which hopefully gets fixed
with a later software update anyways
