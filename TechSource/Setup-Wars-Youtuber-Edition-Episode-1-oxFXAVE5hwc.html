and I'm proud to announce a new series
for the channel welcome to the very
first episode of setup wars youtuber
edition where YouTube channels with over
100 subscribers can enter and show off
their desk setup that powers their
channel this is a great way to not only
collab with some amazing YouTube
channels but also help them bring in new
audiences so if you're interested in
submitting your desk set up for the
youtuber edition of setup Wars make sure
to read the description section down
below on the instructions and
requirements I basically accept any
channel whether it's non tech related
vlogs or gaming except pranks
I don't like prank channels this will
either be a weekly or bi-weekly series
depending on how many submissions I get
so without seeing it over time let the
set up wars begin
so the first five youtubers to be
featured on the show are as follows the
victor from everything technology Joker
from Joker Productions
Anton from Anton alog I hope I said that
correctly Adam from a pause Vox and Eric
from blabber head as always their gear
for their setups will be listed down
below along with their YouTube channels
so be sure to check them out you guys so
with always thinking over time let's get
this started
hey guys binky here also learns
everything technology and this is my
setup as you can tell I have more of a
productivity type of setup due to the
fact that I'm constantly editing videos
on here beginning with my monitor I'm
rocking the Acer H 2 3 6 HL and beside
that is adele 4x3 monitor which I'm
using for multitasking asks for
peripherals my keyboard of choice is a
logitech k310 so is Logitech performance
MX and in terms of audio I'm using the
Logitech Z 506 surround sound speakers
and audio Technica's a THM 40 X 2
monitor audio while I'm editing now the
heart of my setup is my custom build PC
it's rocking a gtx 960 and intel pentium
g 32:58 which have overclocked to 4
gigahertz a gigabytes of ddr3 ram and a
120 gigabyte kingston SSD as well as a 1
terabyte Seagate hard drive anyway
that's gonna do it for my setup and
thank you ad for this opportunity
hey what's up guys Joker's here I run a
PC gaming and hardware review channel
here on YouTube called
joker productions and today i'm going to
be taking you on a tour through my brand
new setup for 2016 a huge part of this
remodel besides painting was setting up
the second linman desk from Ikea these
things look great and they're super
affordable at around $45 I do have a
Signum but the majority of my cable
management was handled through a pair of
cable channels that I have stuck to the
back side of my desk so that's helping
keep things nice and clean which gives
me an inviting space to work in and a
professional backdrop for all of my
videos the centerpiece of the set up is
a pair of fractal design define our 5s
which house my two primary use pcs as
for my day-to-day peripherals go I use a
Waze keyboard with Cherry MX brown
switches and Custer
joke reproductions keycaps my go to
massive choice for gaming and everyday
use is the my onyx castor although the
MX master from logitech does make an
appearance for video editing needs the
two headphones which I use mostly are
the California Silverados and the Fisher
fa0 one ones which I stored neatly on a
hook under my desk when I'm not using
them but that is my setup overview here
for 2016 thanks again to Ed for having
me on the show hey guys my name is Anton
and I also make technology videos on
YouTube just like edy but to make them
efficiently I need a clean and organized
setup so without any further ado let's
take a look at the setup that I have
behind me so the entire theme of my
setup is white and blue and I really
like these colors I also have a salt
lamp to give the setup a bit more Flair
when the lights are turned off anyways I
have a 3d printed phone stand a color
accurate 23 inch 1080p asus monitor a
dell 20 inch monitor and for peripherals
I'm using a Cherry MX brown mechanical
keyboard with a Razer Mamba chroma which
I have programmed to match my setups
theme and finally we have my editing rig
a two thousand dollar workstation it has
an i7 5820k 16 gigabytes but soon to be
32 gigabytes of RAM and a gtx 750ti to
tide me over until it videos Pascal
comes out so that's pretty much the
setup I used to make my own tech videos
on my youtube channel thanks for
watching and I'll see you over on my
channel so this is the lair of equals
box and yes it's messy because I
actively use it everyday unlike some of
these people it starts with a
custom-built gaming and mainly editing
workstation PC and Xbox one halo 5
edition ps3 and PS 2 some sound phone
that desperately needs hung back up a
behringer xenyx
x 183 2 USB mixer for all of my inputs
in mixing and mastering for my streaming
recording and tutorial recording
PlayStation 4 or Lexar Hub 3 monitors
one being a 4k the one on the left being
a 1440 IFPI PS and the one on the right
being a 1080p a security camera to make
sure nobody steals all of my awesome
stuff I've got a Wii U down there an
electro voice re 20 badass microphone
hooked up to a focusrite scarlett 2i2
interface with an hdmi switch in a2i for
that i'm currently reviewing
I've got a wasp code keyboard a desk mat
a Logitech MX master mouse a pair of
Bayer dynamic dt9 9600 ohm headphones
and then my fiance also has a gaming and
recording setup here as well why hello
there text source fans my name is Eric
from the channel called youtube.com
slash blabber head and my setup is made
for two reasons

dominate my life I have two Dell 24 inch
1080p monitors which I got for $100 each
on Black Friday on my desk I use the go
groove bass pulse 2.1 speakers my
peripherals are the Logitech performance

compatible with the MX Logitech unifying
reciever
