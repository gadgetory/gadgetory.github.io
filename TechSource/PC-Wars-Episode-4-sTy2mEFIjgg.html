hundred bucks if you guys are new to
this series and want to submit your
badass custom PC make sure to watch the
video linked down below but what all
that said I'm done
let the PC wars begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always you can find the part list -
everyone's PC in the description section
down below but with that said here are
your five contestants Gustav nester
Romeo Chris and try
gratulations for making it to PC Wars
Episode four first up is Gustav with a
silver and grey themed PC now here is
something we have never seen on the show
before we have an Intel G 32:58 CPU what
okay we're gonna tell G 32:58 CPU paired
with a gtx 760 16 gigabytes of Dominator
Platinum Ram at 1866 megahertz inside
the BitFenix pandora case keeping things
cool is the custom loop powered by Swift
tech water block and some bit power
fittings some custom mods on the PC are
the sleeved cables by ice mods a custom
PSU plate and the custom painted GPU
such a gorgeous build but man that's CPU
and graphics card is definitely time for
an upgrade no offense to you Gustav or
anyone out there but if you're going
with a custom loop at least put in
better parts even if you made the PC a
while back you can always upgrade
nonetheless thank you for entering
Nestor is next up with his red fury PC
build now this is what I'm talking about
we have a custom painted red and black
PC running a 50 20k overclock to 4.5
gigahertz at MSI GTX 970 with a
gigabytes of g.skill ripjaws at 2400
megahertz
keeping things cool is the courser H 100
I CPU cooler and the familiar Asus x99
deluxe motherboard the custom mods are
pretty obvious you have a custom painted
motherboard radiator CPU block mounting
screws
PSU backplate and even the i/o shield
job well done Nestor 4 benchmarks we got
a fire strike score of 11719 which takes
the lead for this episode but overall a
really sweet looking black and red build
Thank You Nestor for entering you want
to trade that for big red by any chance
Romeo is next up with the great white
project what an interesting name for
see so we have a custom loop inside of
course 760 t-white case and it's running
a 5820k overclock to 4.4 gigahertz a GTX
970 and 16 gigabyte of Corsair Vengeance
Ram at 26 66 megahertz we have some
custom white cables from cable mod that
it looks like the water cooling parts
are by ek and we have some radiators
from black ice fun fact that reservoir
was actually signed by Linus when he
went to the LMG meetup a while back for
benchmarks the great white project got a
ten thousand eight hundred twelve which
puts it in second place but overall a
very sexy black and white build indeed
Thank You Romeo for entering next up is
Chris with Devil's winter a black red
and white themed PC I guess it's running
a 4690 and two gtx 770 s in sli I swear
MD just does not get any love on these
episodes I swear I don't know what's
going on I noticed a bunch of guys out
there with some sick-ass AMD build so
get your damn pcs in PC Wars don't you
want to win on your bucks anyways back
to the episode we also have sixteen
gigabytes of Avex ram at 2400 megahertz
we also have some water cooling parts
from ek custom red cables from cable mod
and a modded LED light on the GPUs for
benchmarks that scored a 10,000 640
putting it to second place I don't know
how I feel about the color theme and
also the fan configuration is confusing
you have the air being pulled into the
case with two different exhausts I don't
get it
lastly we have tried with another
awesome black and red build we have a 59
30k overclock to 4.3 gigahertz paired
with two Titan X's in sli god damn we
also have 16 gigabytes of Corsair
Vengeance round by 26 66 megahertz and a
coarser h100 GTX to keep things cool
some custom mods include cable
extensions painted PC parts and a VGA
back plates for benchmarks that scored a
20,000 752 snagging first place for this
episode I will definitely paint the GPUs
and SLI bridge to better match your
build but other than that you have a
very powerful machine thank you for
