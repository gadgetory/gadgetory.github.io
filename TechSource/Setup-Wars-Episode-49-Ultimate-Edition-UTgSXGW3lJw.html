official set up Wars seal of approval
goes to was of guys it's at from tech
source and welcome to set up wars
episode 49 Ultimate Edition where I
featured the best of the best
setups right here in this episode it's
about to get real without wasting any
more time but the setup boys begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below so as
i mentioned in the intro of this video
this is called the ultimate edition
right basically put together the best
desk setups all in one episode and I'm
doing this because I realize it's just
not fair putting high-end setups with
decent or basic setups because they
always end up winning and it just
doesn't make any sense so hopefully with
this new change set up Wars will be more
balanced and more fair but anyways
everyone's gear for their setups along
with anything I recommend in this
episode will be linked below
but here are your 5 a setup masters for
this episode we have been email kyle
marcus and julius let the optical
orgasms begin starting off we have ben
and his black and blue triple monitor
setup we have three dell 24 inch
monitors hooked up to the Ergo tech
monitor stand and below that we have the
Razer Nostromo gamepad corsair k70 RGB
keyboard and the Mad Catz 9 Wireless
Gaming Mouse
and all that is resting on top of the
corsair extended mousepad i love how he
organized the logitech z5o speakers
around the desk it looks very clean and
symmetrical hell even the coasters are
symmetrical we have one on each side my
OCD thanks you I also love the fact that
you added a boom arm for your mic a very
clever decision and a very clever
placement right on the actual monitor
stand it keeps the mic off your desk and
you can retract it back and hide it
behind your monitors when you are not
using them sticking with the black and
blue theme we also have a GTO mega
racing chair and some blue LEDs in the
back of the mix desk cable management is
also on point we have everything wrapped
up and routed in the back of the desk
using some cable clips and zip ties I
mean if you can keep a drawer clean like
this then cable management shouldn't be
an issue at all the PC that's powering
the setup has an i7 38 20 and an AMD HD
7950 which he is planning on upgrading
to a 980 TI the only thing about a fan
of is that random box to the left of
your setup it kind of sticks out like a
sore thumb and I feel like there's no
real reason for it to be there I also
like that you hung your headphones on a
hanger
but I feel like it's a bit out of reach
being on the right side and all the way
down there I mean if you can reach it
with no problem then just ignore my
recommendation but what about placing it
on the left side of your desk using this
type of hanger I feel like it would be a
lot easier to reach but overall a very
clean setup think you've been very much
for entering email is next up with three
24-inch tale monitors mounted against
the wall god damn that looks beautiful
other desk we have the Corsair k70 RGB
keyboard and a curser m65 RGB mouse on
top of the cursor extended mousepad
sandwiching the monitors we have two
audio engine a 5 plus speakers and a
Belkin Lightning charging dock for the
iPhone on the right side cable
management is flawless it appears that
he drilled a hole for both the keyboard
and mouse and routed the cables on the
roof of the desk and behind the drawers
job well done but what the hell did you
do with the monitor wires
what sorcery is this no but seriously I
think that he routed them through the
wall because that's pretty much the only
way I see it being possible the PC is
probably the setup has a 4770k at an
EVGA GTX 760 inside the NZXT h4 40 case
excellent cable management in here as
well on the opposite side of the set up
we have a few posters of Bob Marley and
we also have a few shelves that are
holding up his gear like the blue
snowball mic a GoPro and a pair of and
50 X's overall a very clean setup
nothing I can really recommend thank you
email or m/l for entering a number 3 we
have Marcus and his this dude has a
dining table as his desk a dining table
what top so we have one 27-inch asus rog
swift monitor in the middle which is
sandwiched by two asus 27 inch 1080p
monitors and an LG 34 inch ultra wide up
top on the desk we have the corsair k70
RGB keyboard and the logitech g502 mouse
on top of an enormous mousepad from me
onyx we also have a pair of wave master
speakers on each side audio technica
m50x is on a transparent acrylic stand
and a black and white dxracer chair to
top everything off I don't even know
what the hell to say about the cable
management
I don't even know what he did with them
the keyboard and mouse wire is obviously
routed through the desk and the monitor
cables are drilled through the wall but
how the hell is the PC connected it's
almost as if he has a wireless PC what
what all right obviously it's all about
perspective and how he took the pictures
obviously the wires are being routed
behind the PC to the roof of the desk
where there is a power strip which is
then connected to a wall outlet all the
way off to the left side that's all I
got
very clever placement of the audio
interface on top of the speaker but
where is the mic that's connected to it
the PC that's powering the setup has a
60 700 K paired with a gtx 980ti
I'm not sure why the geforce logo isn't
lighting up but i would recommend
watching my GPU mod video to learn how
to scrape off that green paint and make
the logo appear white i think that will
look way better in that coarser 780 t
case and will also match your overall
setups team what can I say
this setup is flawless ladies and
gentlemen the fifth ever setup wars seal
of approval goes tomorrow
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa men are those
the artists headphones just chilling on
the desk so close this close Marcus to
get that seal maybe next time very sexy
setup Marcus a huge improvement from
episode 15 I've set up Wars no doubt
thank you for entering next up is Julian
back again with an updated setup
who can forget that view not only the
Julius win episode 31 upset a pores but
he ended up winning the set up of the
year for 2015 which I can clearly see
that you are showing off next to your
bed but the question is will you win
this year's we shall see so on the desk
we have two 21 inch asus monitors
sandwiching a 29 inch LG monitor with a
CM storm quick-fire keyboard and a
Logitech MX master right below cable
management is really clean it looks like
julian drilled a hole in the desk and
routed the keyboard wire through I also
see a power strip mounted against the
roof of the desk and the PC that's
powering this setup in a drawer off to
the right side it's curling rocking an
FX 8350 and Ajit
750 gravis car I will see a pair of em
50 X's with some D brand skins it's not
a sponsor I promise
Julien here is a pro photographer which
explains the wall of photos and the
display of classic cameras right next to
his pit on the other side of the bed we
have a little charging stand that's
holding up his iPhone and Apple watch
and a few Xbox controllers mounted on
the wall one of the coolest things about
this setup is the fact that he has a
projector that doubles as blinds you can
basically lower it down anytime you
wants to block out the Sun and start
gaming on an Xbox one I personally don't
think that monitors setup is effective
since those two outer monitors are a bit
far from the center of your view I feel
like three regular-sized monitors would
be much more efficient if you really
need three displays but overall I'm
really happy to have you back on the
show Julien still one of my personal
favorite setups thank you for entering
last but not least we have Kyle with a
purple green and white theme setup talk
about being unique so we have two
27-inch monitors the right one is an
Asus Swift featuring g-sync and a 144
Hertz refresh rate and the left being a
basic 60 Hertz 1080p monitor
on the desk we have the corsair k70 RGB
keyboard and logitech g502 mouse on top
of an extended mousepad from Corsair
Jesus coursers making Bank we will serve
the Focusrite audio interface in the
back with a road boom arm which is
hooked up to the audio technica 2035
microphone again a really smart choice
and placement with that boom arm look
how much cleaner looks without it being
on the desk cable management on the
other hand is flawless drilling a hole
in the desk and routing the keyboard and
mouse through seems to be a popular
thing and a lot of people are doing it I
can't blame them I mean it looks super
clean so why the hell not the PC guys
probably the setup has a 4770k and a GTX
970 packed inside the courser 600 T case
X number good cable management in that
PC as well not only a fan of the color
scheme since there's a lot of different
colors there's really no consistency but
overall a very dope set up nothing I can
really recommend Thank You Kyle for
