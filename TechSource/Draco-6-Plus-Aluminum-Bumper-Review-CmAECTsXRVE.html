awesome Ventura six case for the iphone
6 plus from Drago design since it picked
up lots of attention I decided to review
its brother the Drago six plus aluminum
bumper which is an entirely different
case but with some similarities keep in
mind that these types of cases are for
people who prefer aesthetics over
protection the bumper is made out of
pure aircraft grade aluminum and
features a gorgeous curvy design with
chamfered edges inside the case you will
find rubber pads on all four corners
that act as shock absorbers which will
offer some protection in the case that
the phone is dropped the case comes in
several other color options like silver
champagne and gray as well but I had to
go with the red one to match my color
scheme the Ventura six case which is on
the bottom has flat size for a better
grip and two separated volume buttons
whereas the dracco six case has a
chamfered edge and a single volume
button cover another difference between
the two was that the Drago six case has
a silver finish all around the case
whereas the event air six only has the
silver portion on the left and right
sides other than that the design itself
is fairly similar you have the same
style cutouts on the bottom for the
headphone charging port and speakers
both of the cases are stunning no doubt
the Panther 6 case on the left has a
more curvy design whereas it's more
subtle on the Drago 6 by the way I
picked up these awesome carbon fiber
skins from the brands that I'll go ahead
and leave a link down below if you guys
want to check them out another
difference between both cases is that
the Jaco 6 is slightly more raised than
the event air 6 which is more flush same
goes for the backside and one of the
things that bothered me on the event air
6 is that the approach shooting camera
was still an issue however since the
case is slightly raised on the Drago 6
that solves the issue completely the
bumpers do offer some protection it's
not all about aesthetics in fact I
dropped my phone once already from waist
height and it protected my phone to be
honest I was more concerned about
damaging the case than my actual phone
I'm not gonna lie though both cases are
pricey coming in a little under 100
bucks but in this case you are paying
for quality and it's a lot better than
premium case companies that's for sure
installation is easy just remove both of
the tiny screws located on the bottom of
the case and remove the bottom frame
then insert the vibrate switch in the
cutout and slide in the phone gently but
make sure that the phone is on vibrate
before you do this once the phone is all
the way in put the bottom frame in and
install both of the screws I'm not
entirely sure why you decided to go with
the chamfered edges since it doesn't
offer a good grip compared to a more
natural flat design it's still a lot
better than slippery curved sides on the
iPhone 6 in terms of comfort I think
that the Ventura six has a more natural
feel in the hand but I really like the
dracco six design more the volume
buttons are really responsive and
comfortable to press and the vibrate
switch is actually a lot easier to
switch on and off since it's sticking
out a little more the cutouts on the
other hand are big enough even for
third-party accessories which is a
relief since I use my beats earphones at
the gym along with other third-party
chargers after using both of these cases
for quite some time my new permanent
case is going to be the Drago 6 case I
just like the design a lot more than the
Ventura 6 and it solves the camera
protruding problem which is a big deal
to me since I lay my phone on flat
surfaces a lot so that's it for the
video I hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did let me know by leaving a like on the
video and if you didn't feel free to
dislike and let me know if this is
something you guys would drop a hundred
bucks on by leaving a comment down below
but anyways thanks again for watching
this is it from tech source I will see
you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
