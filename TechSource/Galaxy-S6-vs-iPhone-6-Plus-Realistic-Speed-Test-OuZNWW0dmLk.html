Texas and in this video I'm going to be
doing a realistic speed test between the
galaxy s6 and the iphone 6 plus now I've
actually done a speed test between these
phones before on my channel but that was
based on performance and the web browser
test was basically done on Wi-Fi which
wasn't really a fair test since it
wasn't using its actual data connection
well in this video I'm actually be doing
something a little different I'm going
to be running an app called an perf
which basically runs a controlled
browsing test screaming test and an
actual speed test on both of the phones
network and at the end I'll give an
overall score on which phone is
basically the fastest phone the app is
actually free and ali building down
below if you guys are interested in
downloading it and trying it on your
smart phones but let's go and start the
video and see what happens so before I
start the video I know some of you might
ask me in the comments section where I
got these badass skins from so I might
as well just mention it real quick so
these are both from the brand and I'm
rocking the carbon fiber ones on both of
my phones but they do have a bunch of
other types for other devices as well
and I'll leave a link right below if you
guys want to check them out but let's go
to move on to the actual specs of both
phones real quick before starting the
actual speed test so the s6 is rocking
on X 07 octa-core processor with three
gigs of RAM while the six plus features
apples a chipset and a dual core
processor with one gigs of RAM alright
so both phones are updated to its latest
software the 6 plus is running iOS 8.3
and the s6 is running 5.0 point2 as of
now these are the latest versions on
both devices Wi-Fi is disabled by tennis
is set to max and the background apps
have been removed as well to make it a
fair test alright so here we go starting
with the iphone 6 plus now I did run the
test three times on both devices and
pick the highest score to represent each
phone so the first test is the actual
speed test then we can see that the
iphone 6 plus gets an average of twelve
point three megabytes per second
download and for upload it gets an
average of 5.8 Meg's for Latin see it
scores an average of two hundred and
nine milliseconds with
minimum of 107 now it's moving down to
the browsing test it basically opens up
the following web pages one by one and
calculates the time it takes to load
them by the way I will bring the s6 in
here side by side so you guys can
compare all the results in the end
moving on to the final test which is the
streaming portion and it's basically
like the browsing test but for videos it
does the same video in 243 60 and lastly
720p and calculates the initial loading
time the buffering and the amount of
data used as you can tell the higher the
quality of the video the more data is
consumed notice that there are no
buffering times on any of the videos and
well you can thank the 4g network for
that so the iphone six-plus receive a
score of 10,000 332 for the full test
and you can see the performance waits
for the browsing and screaming right
below you can also compare the scores to
the other carriers across the states now
obviously the location is a huge factor
on the final score so make sure you keep
that into consideration now I won't let
you guys sit through the entire test
again on the s6 so I'm just going to put
them side-by-side and you guys can
compare the scores so for the speed test
the 6 plus got an average of twelve
point three megs down and 5.8 Meg's up
with a lancia average of 209 ms whereas
the s6 got slightly lower speeds for
download and up however it did manage to
get a lower lands the average at 133 ms
compared to the iphone 6 is 209 ms but
overall the 6 plus has faster data
transfer speeds moving on to the
browsing test that looks like the s6 was
faster at opening up Facebook and
Wikipedia only whereas the 6 plus was
faster for Google Yahoo and Amazon so
it's safe to assume that the 6 plus is
faster when it comes to browsing and
that's actually true if you saw my
previous feet test between both of the
phones the 6 + beat out the s6 when it
came to browsing the web and even scored
higher for the SunSpider JavaScript
benchmark lastly we have the streaming
test and once again the 6 plus was
overall the faster phone when it came to
loading times for all the videos and
notice that it even used less data than
the galaxy s6 so I'm sure at this point
you already know which phone has won the
6 + scored eight ten thousand 332
whereas the s6 scored a 5550
7 so based on the n perf test the 6 plus
is actually faster than the galaxy s6
but only in terms of data speeds
uploading and downloading files is
faster on the six plus browsing the webs
and loading web pages is faster on the 6
plus and even streaming videos his
faster on the 6 plus but when it comes
to actual performance of the phone the
galaxy s6 is still faster because it has
better specs anyways that's it for the
video if you guys enjoyed it please
leave a like and if you want to see me
do this type of speed test along with my
other speed test videos then let me know
by dropping a comment down below once
again the app is called n perf and for
those of you guys that want to download
it and try it on your smartphone I'll
leave a link down below for that but
anyways thanks again for watching this
is said and i'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
