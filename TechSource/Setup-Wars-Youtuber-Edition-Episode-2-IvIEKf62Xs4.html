congratulations for making it to set up
Wars Episode two of youtuber edition so
it's going to start off by taking a look
at Jonathan's setup take it away ma'am
what's going on guys Jonathan hey and I
run the YouTube channel youtube.com
slash the amazing tech man and this is
my setup now I ain't myself to be
extremely productive now what actually
runs my setup is a 2015 Apple MacBook
Pro it's really good for editing and
just normally use the mount that I used
is a 4k Samsung monitor that's 29 inches
and my secondary monitor is an Asus 23
inch IPS monitor which is really nice
for color grading that ones that I use
is he sound Pete's a14 just casual
listening or when it's time to get
extremely serious and stop editing audio
I use the 8 ehm 50 X's just like a lot
of other youtubers now the micro choice
that I use is a blue Yeti it's just 100
dollars and it's a great value
microphone it gives me extremely clear
audio that's what I'm using right now
this has been my setup on
thanks for add for hosting this really
innovative way to show people setups so
I guess that's good for me hi guys hey
what's up guys my name is michael and i
recently redid my setup
well holds the whole setup together is
an ikea Becket's table i enjoy the large
tabletop which gives me room to work on
schoolwork sitting on top of the shelf
to the left of the monitor is a fake
ikea plant which gives a splash of color
to my workspace along with the JBL
pebbles these rounded oval looking
speakers produce enjoyable audio when
listening to music also in the middle of
my set up sits the dell to 405 FP w
monitor which is outdated
as for peripherals I'm a bit of a
logitech fanboy I like to keep things
wireless and clean so I stick with the
stylish MX master along with the K 360
keyboard the ability to connect both of
these devices to one logitech unifying
receiver and my laptop is pretty slick
too in all this is the place where I
spend a lot of my hours when they get
home and I love it thanks for watching
this short video and I'll see you guys
later
what's up guys this is tech tech boom
and this is my productivity and gaming
setup so powering the whole setup is
this so this thing has an EVGA 980
superclocked and intel i7 3770k it is
also cooled by the NZXT kraken x61 so
moving on to a desk itself I'm going to
go with a simplistic vibe with some
added personality so on a desk
I have the coalsack a faulty RGB
keyboard it's not mechanical but I still
like it I actually use two months one of
them is this m65 RGB Mouse from Corsair
that I use purely for gaming and the
other is a Logitech MX master that I use
for productivity and right in front of
me are these two displays by HP these
are HP 23 X I and below them is just
mobile M table motorized ER and in the
darkness setup looks pretty cool
anyways that will be all for my setup
and thank you to Ed for this opportunity
what is up Texas fans this is Brian from
tech yes City and today we're just going
to take a look at my main setup here
starting from left to right we've got a
1080p Aysen monitor which is used for my
secondhand rigs as well as 1080p
benchmarking and a live tech gaming
weekly show besides that we have a 1440p
monitor which is used as a second
monitor and for productivity purposes to
the main monitor on the right here which
is an Acer 280 HK 4kg sync monitor this
is a TN panel although it is 10 it does
have great response times and low input
lag and now onto the main power plant
giving all the juices needed is the
arrow cool strike X hybrid case inside
that we have the X
99 asrock fatality motherboard and a
5820k cooled by an animagus t 40 we also
got 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory there
and a gigabyte GTX 970 g1 which is
temporary at the moment because my 980ti
graphics card has unfortunately died for
my speakers I've got some Sony desktop
speakers which I picked up with the junk
store for like three dollars and also
above that an ambient temp sensor
underneath my desk we've got some velcro
tape there as well as some standard tape
and white LEDs and some cable bags for
keeping all that disgusting stuff out of
sight when all said and done this setup
does everything I need it to all the way
from gaming to working to also producing
YouTube content it also serves to
impress the ladies when they come around
to watch Netflix lastly I'd like to
thank Eddy for being a baller oh yeah
and also having me on the show and I'll
catch you guys later hey guys my name is
Paul Bradford I have a youtube channel
called Paul and Tech and this is my
setup I'm not much of a gamer so this
setup is much more oriented towards
productivity and you'll also see that
while I don't have a huge budget to have
4k displays or a crazy powerful PC I try
to do the best with what I have so I
have two desks the one on the left is
normally used for doing homework and
then the one on the right is for using
my PC on that main desk I have dual 23.6
inch 1080p displays and having dual
displays really boost my productivity
I'm always needing extra USB ports so I
velcro to USB hub under my monitors and
my PC might not be the flashiest or most
powerful computer out there but it's
more than capable for things I need such
as editing 1080p video and occasionally
gaming and I don't mean to brag but my
cable management is pretty awesome oh
yeah and I also have LED lights running
all the way around the back of the desk
that makes the whole setup look even
cooler in the dark so that's pretty much
the basics of my setup if you want to
see the whole thing in detail check out
my channel thanks so that's it for this
week's episode of setup wars youtuber
edition you guys know what to do there

setup and I will do a best youtuber
