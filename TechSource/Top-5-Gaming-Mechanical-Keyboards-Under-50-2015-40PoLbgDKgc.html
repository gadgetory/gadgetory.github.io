this time we're looking at the best
gaming mechanical keyboards that you can
currently buy on their 50 bucks let's do
this a number one we have the red dragon
k5 53 keyboard with cherry green
switches it's constructed out of
aluminum and ABS materials with plate
mounted mechanical keys that will give
you excellent responsiveness and tactile
feedback the WASD and arrow keys can be
swapped out for custom key caps and the
keyboard features a Windows lock option
with red LEDs which can be adjusted from
the keyboard what I love about this
keyboard is the minimalistic design
there are no extra macro keys off to the
side that extends the width of the
keyboard you'll get the essential keys
that you need the small compact size of
this keyboard plus the fact that it's
under 50 bucks makes it a great Buy at
number 2 we have the Ariane rabu V 500
this one is a good looking keyboard with
MX black switches and the keyboards
chassis is made out of plastic so we
don't get any aluminum here but what you
get is a small compact solid gaming
keyboard with subtle backlighting the
keyboard also comes with its own
software program which you can use to
program each key and it does feature a
Windows lock key as well the only
downside is that it does not have any
LED color options so if you don't care
for those fancy options then this
keyboard will do just fine for you
there's also a white version of the
keyboard which looks pretty damn cool
this next keyboard is a very popular one
from Ezio and it's one of the best
budget mechanical keyboards available in
the market right now as of now there's
only one left in stock and it features
blue key switches with a gunmetal grey
aluminum faceplate with a detachable
wrist rest the keyboard also features
white LED backlight and the brightness
can be adjusted on the keyboard you get
the standard Windows lock key
anti-ghosting and full key rollover on
USB there's also a wheel on the top
right which is used to control the
volume honestly with all the features
this keyboard comes with including the
awesome aluminum build 50 bucks seems
like a steal right now and number four
we have the Roseville keyboard who would
have thought you can get a mechanical
gaming keyboard for only 30 bucks the
Roseville arcade 6000 features a LSP
blue switches it also has a plastic
chassis with rubber coated WASD
and arrow keys for a better grip the
only downside to this keyboard is the
fact that it doesn't have any
backlighting windows lock key or even a
wisp rest so I kind of wonder why it's
labeled as a gaming keyboard nonetheless
if you want to make the switch to a
mechanical keyboard or want to buy one
that's extremely affordable this is it
guys you get what you pay for next up is
the Ola wings of Liberty keyboard it
features blue switches and has a metal
chassis the keyboard also features 26
keys for anti-ghosting and a Windows
lock key with a small wrist rest the
keys also have a rubber anti-slip
coating with a silicone gel membrane
cover on every single switch making this
keyboard water spill and dust resistant
once again the keyboard doesn't have any
backlighting and the palm rest is way
too short especially for people larger
hands but if you're looking for an
all-white gaming keyboard to match your
setup then this is your best option so
onto the high rollers section of the
video and these two keyboards are for
people with a slightly larger budget at
number 6 we have the CM storm quick-fire
keyboard with cherry MX red switches
full and key rollover and USB mode full
LED backlit with three modes and five
bonus levels to choose from it also has
a full metal backplate a Windows lock
key and a detachable braided USB cable
all the good features you come to expect
my mechanical gaming keyboard last on my
list is the Logitech g7 10 keyboard with
cherry MX blue switches as well we get
six programmable G keys 110
anti-ghosting keys with a twenty six key
rollover feature the keyboard also has
white LED backlighting which is
adjustable and you get a USB
pass-through for connecting a headset or
other USB devices I definitely like to
include a detachable wrist rest and the
fact that it comes with a USB
pass-through so those are my top picks
for the best gaming mechanical keyboards
you can buy under 50 bucks let me know
if you guys enjoyed this series by
hitting a like and I will continue to do
these but let me know what I should
feature in my next top 5 video by
dropping a comment down below I'm
actually gathering a list together for
you guys anyways thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
