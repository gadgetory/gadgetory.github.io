about to unbox three of the brand new
iphone 6s models I have two of the
iphone 6s and 16 s plus model and
actually one more 6s plus on the way and
I'm actually going to be giving them
away so if you're interested in
participating then click on the card
which is located on the top right of
this video or the link in the
description section to watch that video
so with the new iphone 6s models you get
better specs better camera and a cool
new 3d touch feature the iphone 6s gets
a slightly smaller 17 15 million power
battery down from last year's 1810
whereas the 6s plus stays at the same
2915 milliamp hour battery so I did pick
up three space gray models along with
the new rose gold which kind of looks
more like a pale pink if you ask me so
inside these boxes you get the usual
warranty and setup guide along with the
Apple stickers under those you'll find
the power brick the lightning cable and
a pair of extremely uncomfortable apple
earphones which you should honestly just
throw away your ears will definitely
thank you aside from those upgrades the
design itself is practically the same
from last year's model however it's
slightly heavier due to the taptic
engine there will be a bunch of coverage
on the iphone success including camera
comparison speed test and scratch tests
so make sure you guys are subscribed to
the channel so you don't miss out thank
you for watching and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
