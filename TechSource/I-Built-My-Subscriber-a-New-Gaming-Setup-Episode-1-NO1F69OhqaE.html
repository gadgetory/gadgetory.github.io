of setup makeover is here
the show where I select a subscriber and
give his or her setup a makeover not a
subscriber I got selected lives in South
Carolina and this is the first time I'm
leaving California to do something like
this needless to say I was very anxious
and excited at the same time I mean what
can go wrong
hey guys so we're finally here in South
Carolina and the city of Shiraz I think
that's how you say it which is
practically in the middle of nowhere and
I know that because I've been trying to
find an uber or a lift for the past 45
minutes and there's nobody around to
pick us up so luckily Heath came in to
the rescue his that is actually on the
way to pick us up and take us to Heath
South so that we can give him a
brand-new set up
hey good how are you and nice to finally
meet you person I have not no this is
definitely a change for me
hi how are you today
nice to meet you pleasure to meet you
I think the first time I spoke to Heath
was back in June of 2018 I believe so
I've been planning this well over five
months now and we only had one shot to
do this there is no going back so if
anything are damaged during the flight
or if I left some parts back at home
then I was pretty much screwed and
there's nothing I could do about it
I was really just hoping everything went
according to plan
also quick note there were some parts of
the audio that are corrupted and I found
that about it after the shoot so if my
voice is really low in some parts that's
what happened alright it looks just like
the pictures well we got this from
Staples when they were going out of
business the original price on this was
like $500 yeah and we entered a pan like
100 bucks for what is it what's up up to
you the green tape if you look around
the ages had a dish and starting to feel
the part oh so you just covered it with
yeah the calls the way I see it I kind
of rest my elbow on a desk okay and it
was rubbing my elbow so just kinda
picked my elbow oh I see to cover up the
the rough edges over here yeah
interesting okay my first impressions of
heat setup was exactly the same as
before when I look at the pictures from
the submissions
it's definitely outdated and it could
definitely use some tweaking yeah I used
to have a standard set on a little wood
saying it came with a deer but I don't
know what happened to it I ended up is
this custom made or is it people know
it's a prebuilt from ordeal um it was
wandering a game edition pcs that came
out say it looks like you have
9650 gigs around ddr2 ddr2 yes okay um
why play a lot of World of Warcraft and
with all the updates over the years like
I used to get pretty decent frame rates
with it but now like especially in town
I mean my frame rates drop like down it
7 to 17 frames per second and stuff like
that yeah how do you do it eat well as
long as I'm away from town and
everything he didn't jump up for like 70
I've been in battles and yeah I can't
read it I used to read a lot but I can't
even war now because when you get 25
people together it does like 5 frame for
a second so I just I gave up it when I'm
at teeth in person I quickly realized
how amazing he is I mean this guy is the
most genuine and kind-hearted person
I've ever met in my life he's
intelligent he's funny and despite his
situation he's so positive and
optimistic about everything I can just
feel the energy radiating from him when
I started talking with him I'm 42 years
old I lived in South Carolina all my
life grew up just down the road from
where I lay back currently been living
here me and my wife have been married
for in June will be 17 years you want to
tell us about the accident I was 16
senior high school swimming I mean place
I swim at all my life and I'm just
having to dive in some shallow water
that day and it cracked my seat 5 and c6
rubbery left me paralyzed from really
about my own arms down so I can't use my
fingers and stuff like that still have
feelings and stuff like that throughout
my body but you know just can't move but
you know what I mean as mad as that may
seem I've met a lot of guys and girls to
who have similar accidents and it lifts
him off a lot worse
and a lot worse situation I mean I'm
really blessed because I'm had you know
pretty decent doctors and stuff like
that and I had family that care a lot of
people you meet nowadays they don't have
family that care
about him what happens to them and they
end up with a lot more health issues and
I had to go to a hospital a couple years
back and the nurses there were like
amazed like you know look you know we
get most people to come in here in your
situation they you know they have so
much more health issues and for the most
part I mean I'm healthy I don't have any
kind of you know I live my life just
like anybody else you know I mean I get
up I do two things I have to do you just
I just have to do it a different way
yeah so how does that affect you while
gaming or using a computer for example I
use since I can't use my fingers I use a
pencil and I stick it right here and I
can tack on a keyboard like that um you
learn to adapt I mean that's all it is
I mean I don't know how long have the
finger uses I can't do you know fine
precision and stuff you know I used to
play like if I were to play for tonight
or something like that you know all
those complicated moves I mean I can do
it somewhat but it's a little bit more
difficult for me so I try to set up
things or set up macros on keyboard or
stuff like that to be able to help me
move a little bit better so that I'm not
at such a disadvantage to playing and
things like that I see it what about the
mouse use Mouse use I laid my hand on
her mouth just like this right here palm
side up and I use my pinky
left click so man took my hand right
click and move Mouse and that works out
for you yep I've been doing it for
Bobbie used to it then yeah hey like I
say this you can learn to adapt in write
you know find ways to get around what
other people we know take for granted
right that's awesome
so you say you're streaming where's your
webcam I don't have one oh you're not
one okay just beam no no okay cool and I
started backing her the part you're
doing its own um but my pcs got where it
crashes a lot more so it's kind of hard
to stream now mm-hmm
because it crashes so much I've been a
Miller stream have just started 5
minutes streaming and it just crashes
that started
Wow that won't be an issue after I'm
done with this setup well I will say
this I appreciate you taking the time I
know this is a a big jump from your
normal routine and stuff but I
appreciate you doing this for me it
means a lot and like I said you you know
if somebody does something for you you
can't take it from you don't take it for
granted because and not just in this but
anything in life I mean you know yeah
you never know what one small thing that
you do for somebody how it can affect
somebody else happening in help it it
can improve their life you know
absolutely I appreciate that thank you
and you're more than welcome to eat
heath is truly a good person and I need
without a doubt looking to the final 10
applications that he was going to be the
chosen one for season 3 you know he's
someone who spends most of his day
indoors so if there is anything that I
can do even to make his day slightly
better than I'm all for it so we got to
work I mean my cousin started taking
apart his setup the desk was actually
the hardest thing to take apart all the
pieces were connected together and I
think it took us over an hour and a half
just to remove that from his room we
also got pretty hungry afterwards so he
thought us some pizza and we took a
quick break you know I learned not to
expect anything when you're in a
stranger's house but the fact that they
cared enough to get us some food really
says something about their character and
both me and Bob were very grateful to
Heath and his wife for the hospitality
