RhinoShield</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2016-06-10</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXSC-F1r8rI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">what's up guys it's ad from Texas and
what I have what's up guys is that from
Texas and what I have here is quite
possibly the most protective bumper case
that I have ever used I've dropped this
case from 6 feet 70 feet and even ran
over it with my car and it's still
managed to survive so this is the crash
guard from rhino shield and it goes for
around 25 bucks with a bunch of
different color options it's a pretty
straightforward bumper case you have the
cutouts for the speakers lightning cable
and a headphone jack which is large
enough to fit even third-party
accessories
it also has protruding tactile buttons
for both the volume rockers and the
power button which are surprisingly easy
to press and the matte texture of the
bumper gives a phone a really nice grip
a few things I don't like about this
case is the fact that the bumper doesn't
sit flush with the back of the phone and
because of that it doesn't feel natural
in the hand but I get it I mean it's a
bumper case and there's supposed to be a
small lip to protect the case from drops
another thing I don't like is how
difficult it is to remove the case
installing it though is fairly easy but
taking the case of is harder than
opening up a jar of pickles with greasy
fingers aesthetically I mean it doesn't
look very pleasing but what it's capable
of is very impressive the first test we
did was dropping the phone face first
from waist height as expected no damages
to the phone and light scuffs were found
around the bumper second test was
dropping it from six feet now keep in
mind I was six - so it was a little
higher again the phone is an immaculate
condition with additional minor scuffs
on the bumper the third test was a bit
extreme we decided it would be a great
idea dropping it from our rooftop which
was about 70 feet high
well surprisingly the phone did not
receive any cosmetic damage the screen
shield absorbed all of the impact as you
can see here it has a bunch of things
all over the front of the case but
peeling off the shield you can see that
the screen itself is not harmed in any
way I don't know what sorcery the screen
shield is using but it sure as hell
works sadly though the phone does not
turn on and most likely suffered
internal damage
then again what phone wouldn't from a
height like that after all this is only
a bumper case the next test we did was
running over it with my car now this is
a 2016 lexus 200 T and weighs 2583
pounds since the phone does not work
anymore we wanted to see if the bumper
would protect the phone from cosmetic
damage
other than some tire marks the screen is
still in pristine condition there is one
more test we did with the screen shield
and bumper though this is effing tech
source and this is iPhone 6s basketball
so as you can see the phone is pretty
beat up there are a lot of dings and
scuffs on a screen but once again
peeling it off we can see that the phone
did not experience any cosmetic damages
the entire time it stated that it will
protect the phone from impact from at
least 11 feet combined the bumper case
with the impact protection screen
protector and you have yourself a phone
that can compete with Nokia I'm going to
drop a link to both the bumper and the
screen shield down below it is available
for the iPhone and also a few Android
devices so make sure to check them out
if you guys are interested as when to
give huge thanks to rhino shield for
making this video possible by sending
out the iPhone 6 and the bumper cases to
do these insane tests that's basically a
thing guys so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
