gonna show you guys how to jailbreak
your Apple devices
evaders released their untethered
jailbreak a few days ago and it's
compatible with all iphones ipod touch
ipad and ipad mini models running iOS
7.0.3 7.0.4 first things first connect
your Apple device to your computer and
make sure you guys backup your device
before you start in case something goes
wrong I make sure to do mine via iTunes
you couldn't either use iCloud or iTunes
if you wish also make sure to move the
passcode for the jailbreaking process
and another important thing is to make
sure that you updated your phone via
iTunes instead of using over-the-air
otherwise your phone might have problems
already so once you have done that you
must have the jailbreak program
downloaded of course I have provided you
the link in the description below simply
open the folder and install the program
it will do most of the work for you but
watch out for some small prompts that
are needed to proceed with the
jailbreaking I will go over them
step-by-step just in case you guys have
any questions and to make the video
shorter I will fast forward all the
loading parts alright so once the phone
is connected simply click on the
jailbreak button and sit back for now
and wait for evaders to install the icon
on your device you will see the evasion
logo appear on your device just make
sure you don't press it just yet the
phone will also reboot a few times which
is completely normal
after the first initial reboot the
program will ask you to unlock your
device and click on the evasion logo if
it's not on your home page it should be
on the next so slow forward and find it
and press on the logo for it to continue
shortly after it will reboot once more
this time you'll boot up displaying the
vader's logo and after that it will
reboot for the last time taking you
straight to the home screen of your
device and if you scroll to the next
page you will see the Cydia app which
means you are done I hope this will sell
for some of you guys if you enjoy the
video please let me know in the comments
down below I will gladly do more of
these also for you jailbreak is out
there if you want a quick guide on the
best jailbreak sources and tweaks feel
free to let me know as well
comments down below and I will make a
video on that as well this is the text
source and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
