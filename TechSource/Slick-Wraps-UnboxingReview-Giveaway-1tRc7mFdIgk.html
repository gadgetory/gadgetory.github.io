gonna look at some new HTC One skins
from slick wraps okay so this company is
called slick wraps and they make skins
for electronic devices from smartphones
to laptops and even gaming controllers
which is awesome and you can find them
at slick wraps com okay so here I have
an HTC One and I'm going to show you how
the phone looks after installing this
amazing skin called teakwood I'm also
gonna go over installation process as
quick as I can and it will be a special
giveaway at the end of the video alright
so let's go ahead and unbox this real
quick and see what's inside the package
so the first thing we have here are the
skins for the front the back and the
size of the phone and I'm not sure if
you can tell but these cutouts are
spot-on
unlike other similar skins that I've
used in the past we can also see that
slick perhaps was kind enough to include
a screen shield in the package which a
lot of similar companies stopped doing
they also included a microfiber cloth to
help with installation process and last
but not least we have a squeegee to get
rid of any annoying bubbles on our
screen shield okay let's start off by
installing the backside skin to make
this easier you first peel off the
entire piece and place it back on the
paper like this with the camera hole
sticking out after that you gently mash
the cutouts of the camera and flash once
both holes are aligned correctly just
peel off the rest and use your fingers
to straighten it out okay next up we are
going to do the top and bottom sides at
the back really simple to install you
can start off on one side of the phone
if you wish here I started from the
center and work my way outwards making
sure it's nicely aligned with the
phone's curve okay so the same thing
goes to the bottom really easy to
install and you can really see how
precise these cutouts are if you just
look at the HTC logo and honestly I've
never seen such accurate cuts like this
from a company that those skins before
we install the screen shield make sure
to wipe off all the fingerprints and
dust from the screen okay so to install
the screen shield you need to peel off
the red tab about halfway through
make sure your finger does not touch the
inside of the screen shield because
that's the sticky part so once you've
done that you gently put the top half of
the screen shield against your phone
making sure you align it perfectly with
the phone screen as you can see we kind
of
once it's aligned perfectly you pull the
red tab all the way out from underneath
making sure you don't make contact with
the sticky side and white after that you
peel off the blue to have gently so that
the screen shield does not come off with
it wipe out any remainder dust and use
the squeegee to push out any unnecessary
bubbles okay now to install the front
sight best way to do this is to start at
the top and make sure the cutouts align
with the speakers and sensors before
continuing down once the top part is
finished grab the bottom and once again
make sure to cut out a line with the
speakers and the arrows on the bottom of
the phone next up we are doing the top
of the phone this one is really simple
all you have to do is have the phone
standing up and stretch the top skin
just a little to align with the power
button and the headphone jack moving on
to the right side there are two parts
that separate one on top of the volume
button and one on the bottom it's
self-explanatory to install them just
follow the path of the rail as you put
them on all right now for the other side
it's just one long piece that runs along
the phone make sure it's aligned
straight at the top and bottom before
pressing on it all right last but not
least we have the bottom of the phone it
would help if the phone is position
upright and once it is stretch both
sides of the skin slightly until the
cutouts are aligned with the charging
port okay so that's it for the unboxing
thank you so much for watching you guys
