and welcome back to another electronics
gift guide right here on tech source
Amazon azano he sponsored this video but
they also reached out and hand-picked me
for their holiday support so all the
products featured in this video were
handpicked by me
I chose these gifts because they would
make a great gift for any gamer out
there whether it's for your kids friends
or even relatives so with that said
let's kick off the video by looking at
the HTC vive I have been addicted to
virtual reality for the past few weeks
and instead of making youtube videos
I've been playing on this thing instead
the HTC vive is a VR system that fully
immerses you into a 3d world instead of
playing a typical game with a controller
or keyboard you essentially become a
part of the game with realistic movement
and actions from precise headset
tracking and directional audio it really
does feel like you're in a completely
different world the HTC vive is powered
by a PC or a gaming laptop that's played
through the steam app which is free to
download and the best part about the
vibe is that you can download free games
from Steam they have hundreds of games
in their library however you're gonna
have to pay a little bit to play some of
the best video games out there I
strongly recommend trying out sunshine
Arizona and Sirius Sam if you're just
getting into VR
the HTC vive package comes with the
headset and two controllers with a pair
of earbuds but I strongly recommend
buying the deluxe audio strap along with
it because they provide better audio and
they give you a 360-degree realistic
sound experience the ear cups are also
much more comfortable than these
standard earphones this is one of the
more pricier gifts on the list but I
assure you whoever you buy it for will
absolutely love it and most likely get
addicted to it so you are warned next up
on my list is the popular Corsair k70
luxe RGB keyboard with Cherry MX brown
switches so this is a full-size
mechanical gaming keyboard with a 10 key
that comes with a detachable wrist rest
it's built really well with the aluminum
frame and the matte coating on the keys
a mechanical keyboard is the preferred
choice for competitive gamers out there
because of the responsiveness
unlike membrane keys which register a
keystroke when fully pressed down a
mechanical key registers at a shorter
distance which means you get a much
quicker response time because the key
cap doesn't have to be fully pressed
down the K 70 luxe comes with a scroll
wheel for the volume followed by the
media controls underneath and it also
comes with a pass-through in case you
want to connect your mouse or headset
through the keyboard and into your PC
with the corsair q software you are able
to fully customize the RGB lights on the
keyboard and sync them with other
corsair peripherals that you might own
speaking of Corsair peripherals my next
pick in this gaming list is the coarser
void pearl gaming headset with dolby 7.1
surround sound the ear cups are made out
of both mesh and memory foam and they
are large enough to fit around the ear
they do a decent job when it comes to
noise isolation but don't expect it to
completely block out all outside noise
the headset has more of a relaxed and
comfortable fit so that gamers can wear
it during long sessions the microphone
isn't half bad either it's very flexible
and the sound quality is good I don't
recommend it for voiceovers but for
in-game communication it gets the job
done
the Void pros are compatible with the
ps4 Xbox one and PC and it also comes
with an optional USB adapter the Void
pros have always been one of my all-time
favorite gaming headsets out there and I
strongly recommend them for any gamer
out there last but not least we got one
of the most part
Gaming mice out there the Razer
DeathAdder elite this is an RGB optical
gaming mouse with a 16,000 dpi sensor
the simple ergonomic design and accuracy
is what makes this mouse a popular
choice for most gamers out there the
mouse wheel up top is very tactile and
below that are the two buttons to cycle
quickly through the DPI settings the two
side buttons are very easy to reach and
I think that Razer did an awesome job at
designing this mouse for comfort one of
the things I really like about this
mouse is the feedback you get when
pressing the buttons that reassures you
that you have actuated the switch
beneath it you can also use the Razer
software to change the colors of the
mouse wheel and the Razer logo which is
pretty cool if you're looking to upgrade
to a very comfortable gaming mice with
super fast response times and RGB
lighting then the Death Adder
elite is definitely something I
recommend putting on your list you guys

video on the Amazon gift guide which is
an awesome place for people to find
holiday picks for their loved ones the
