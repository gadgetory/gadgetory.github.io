welcome to episode 2 of the best desks
of 2016 now if you guys somehow missed
my first episode I'll drop a link to it
down below but before we continue I want
to give a huge thanks to the sponsor of
this episode dot tech as you guys know I
have actually two dot tech domains one
is Edgar Tech which will take you to my
youtube channel and my most recent one
is deal source tech which will take you
to my website not only does dot tech
give you a much cooler domain name but
it also ties in well with the theme of
my channel they're actually turning one
on the 5th of August and to celebrate
this awesome occasion with all of you
tech enthusiasts there's a special offer
from the dot tech squad you guys can now
get your very own dot tech domain for
$2.99 for a limited period what's more
is that they're actually giving away a
kick-ass drone to the person that has
the most creative website so if you guys
are interested in getting a new domain
name and want to enter to win a drone
make sure to visit Edgar get dot tech or
click on the link below alright so
starting off the episode we have the
market up from beyond the office store
now these are the guys behind the vertex
which is the desk I'm using for my main
setup so this is the new product that
comes in several lengths and two
different colors for the base either
silver or black this is an adjustable
desk so there's a switch on the right
side that allows you to bring the desk
up or down by pressing on the button
unfortunately it's not automated so you
do have to hold it down with your finger
to adjust the height it does come with
two cable raceways which is awesome and
helping with the cable management and
features a set of casters making it very
mobile but the most coolest feature and
my personal favorite is the fact that
this can be flipped up into a whiteboard
that's right guys this table doubles as
a whiteboard and it comes with a set of
markers and a dry eraser I do want to
emphasize that this is not ideal for
setups and instead is perfect for office
or professional use I for one I'm
excited to start using this in my office
next year it's gonna help me so much
when it comes to writing down schedules
for projects upcoming PC builds video
ideas and so much more I can use it as a
desk whenever I need one and simply pop
it into a whiteboard when I need to
write some stuff
down brilliant next up we have the IKEA
McKay desk this is a very stylish and
minimalistic desk that's perfect for
single monitor setups with a PC on the
side or a dual monitor setup with the PC
on the floor it only costs $80 depending
on where you live and they come in a
variety of colors there's even some with
different variations you can pick one up
with a drawer on either side or get one
without the standard version comes with
two drawers on the top and a drawer on
the bottom which you can use to store
your PC or other items and it also comes
to a rack underneath to help with the
cable management there's a pre-drilled
hole on the top that can be used to wrap
the wires honestly for the price and the
size of this desk it offers a lot of
nice features this is definitely one of
my favorites at number three we have the
ultra dakota that goes for around 120
dollars and it's available in a few
different variations and colors now this
is an l-shaped desk that offers lots of
surface area to work with there's a few
reasons why this type of desk is great
first off it's awesome for multi-monitor
setups as you can sit in the corner of
the desk and curve the monitors around
you second you have lots of extra space
for other devices like printers consoles
lamps or other things there is a hole in
the back for cable management as well as
a backboard which is nice since you can
pretty much hook up everything behind
they're using some 3m tape and lastly
there's a few shelves on the right side
to store books or other miscellaneous
items overall for the price this is a
very solid desk at number four we have
the very popular IKEA back hands desk
that has a few variations there's a
motorized version that cost about 650
bucks and a standard version for around
240 there's also a plethora of color
options to choose from what makes the
backhand desk very popular is the solid
construction and size with a surface
area of 63 by 43 inches you can not only
keep your PC on the desk but also have
room for a few monitors the legs are
also adjustable to satisfy your height
requirement and lastly it comes with a
net underneath that will aid you in
storing all of your cables last but not
least we have the monarch specialties
desk it's perfect for laptop or single
monitor setups or it can even be used as
decorative furniture it's definitely on
the pricey side but I wouldn't buy this
just for my setup instead I would buy it
because it will look
good with the rest of the furniture in
my room in this case you are paying more
for aesthetics than actual functionality
but damn does that look sleek for $100
more you can pick up a different
variation of the desk that comes with a
shelf add-on this is definitely the
perfect desk for anyone who loves the
modern look but that will do it for this
video if you guys enjoyed it and want to

in this video and thank you guys so much
