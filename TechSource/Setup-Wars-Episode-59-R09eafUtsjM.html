quickly guys before I start this episode
I have a serious question to ask you and

helped you improve your own setup if so
please click on the link below and vote
there's a strawpoll link I'm just
curious about what you guys have to say
so with that said you guys can find
everyone's gear for the setups along
with anything I recommend in this
episode a link below but ladies and
gentlemen here are five contestants for
this week we have Isaiah
Kiril Nigel Simon and Sundeep
congratulations for making it on the
show starting off the episode we have
Isaiah and his pretty dope looking black
and red setup so this dude has two
24-inch asu's monitors hooked up to a
monitor stand and below that we have a
Corsair K 65 RGB keyboard and a logitech
g502 Mouse on top of the VIP amaz
mousepad which is actually the one I'm
using for my own setup off the left side
we have the audio technica at2020 mic
hooked up to the newer boom arm and we
also have a pair of M 50 X's with custom
brain waves ear cups and deer and skins
definitely dig in your style I don't see
any cables so good job with cable
management
it looks like isaiah has drilled some
holes in the back of the desk and routed
the cables through and even hooked up a
power strip on the roof of the desk a
few other mods I noticed where the USB
hub attached on the left side of the
desk for easy access and a cable drop
that's holding up the micro USB cable
which I'm guessing is used to charge
your smartphone the PC that's powering
the setup has a 4790k and an EVGA GTX
970 inside the h4 40 case which
unfortunately is being blocked by the
monitors I would recommend moving the
boom arm and sliding the monitor over so
that it's slightly hanging out from the
desk if you want your case to be visible
I would then hook up the boom arm to the
actual monitor mounts and pick up a
headphone anchor for those headphones
and place it under the desk again these
are just my recommendations obviously
nobody has to do anything I say so this
setup works for you by all means don't
change a thing a very sweet setup Thank
You Isaiah for entering kirilus next up
with a very simple and clean setup very
unusual to have the PC on the left side
facing that way but for some reason it
just works we have a 27-inch Asus
monitor hooked up to the wall and below
that is the HP elite wireless keyboard
and a Logitech G 440 mouse all of which
are sitting on top of the IKEA lemon
table with the Olav legs which are
pretty much adjustable the cable
management makes me a very happy person
we have a Signum rack holding up pretty
much everything and then one single
cable running from the Parrish grip down
the legs and into the wall outlet we
also have an SD card reader USB hub and
a remote for the LED strips attached on
the roof of the desk and away from sight
I couldn't be more proud and finally the
PC pushing all these pixels has an i5
4460 which is paired with the EVGA GTX
970
I also notice that you at the front side
of the case and even the SSD in carbon
fiber very nice overall a very clean
black-and-red setup Thank You Carol for
entering nigel is next up with something
a little different so in the corner we
have a 25 inch LG monitor on top of a 24
inch BenQ and below that is the Razer
BlackWidow chroma on top of the courser
extended mouse pad off to the left side
we can see a Philips sound bar in an
unusual spot and on the opposite side is
Nigel's box collection which consists of
gear he has previously purchased who
needs paintings on their wall when you
can slap together a few boxes and hang
that instead cable management on the
other hand looks pretty good for the
most part I like the use of zip ties and
cable clips to keep everything organized
Nigel's PC is running on another 4790k
which is paired with an msi gtx 980ti
and it's also nicely modded the
motherboard heat sinks are painted along
with the RAM sticks and we also have a
custom made PSU shroud okay so the
acoustics I'm pretty sure they are there
for aesthetic reasons since you don't
have a mic set up for recording and use
a pair of g35 instead but I gotta be
honest it could definitely look a lot
better first off I would have used two
different colored acoustic foams black
and white to match your setup and second
I would have made some sort of a shape
or design with them I would also try and
change the location of the sound bar
because it just as an effective being
mounted on one side maybe figure out a
way to get that installed on top of the
LG mono
but other knows minor tweaks you have
been very unique setup Thank You Nigel
for entering Simon is next up with yet
another very clean set up we have a 27
inch li yama monitor next to a 22 inch
dell and on the desk you had the Philco
magic touch to keyboard me onyx cast
their mouse on top of the shark une
mousepad this is an interesting layout
in the sense that he didn't Center the
monitors to make room for the second
speaker he also opted to put the PC on
the ground which is something I strongly
go against a PC with a side panel should
never be on the ground let alone a
good-looking one like this but sometimes
you just don't have a choice so I
understand besides the other Edifier
speaker on the drawer we also have a
pair of super luxe HD 681 headphones on
top of a wooden holder
q-ball manager on the other hand is
flawless nothing I can really recommend
it looks like Simon is on top of his
game
Sigma rack up top and a spiral tube to
hide the rest of the cables running down
to the PC excellent job
I also like the custom made arcade
sticks he built using San Joaquin parts
but this is probably the coolest thing
in his room a fully working arcade bar
top running Nintendo Super Nintendo
Street Fighter and a bunch of other
arcade games very nice as far as the set
up if we're up to me I would do my best
to make room for the other speaker and
put the PC on the drawer instead but it
is what it is great set up Simon and
thank you for entering last but not
least we have Sundeep with another
productivity setup so we have 2 32 inch
Samsung 1080p TVs on top of the IKEA
Jonas desk which is basically a mom desk
but without the cable management rack
below those we have the Apple wireless
keyboard and mouse which are resting on
top of the IKEA Wisla desk mat and we
also have a pair of logitech z nano 6
speakers and in between those are the
iPhone Lightning doc and Apple watch
stand I can't really see the wires
because of the back board so I can't
judge the cable management but I'm sure
there aren't that many to begin with
since most of this stuff is Wireless
anyways
and finally the PC test powering the set
up is actually a 2015 MacBook but
overall a very clean and good-looking
productivity set up Thank You sandy
