peace
ray zaps it's time to move on to other
bills
protip if you're cleaning the thermal
compound of the processor and the CPU
cooler make sure you're using some
rubbing alcohol and some toilet paper or
soft tissue
nice and clean that is what remains of
raised ox in the ultimate PC for
November let's have a moment of silence
and remember how magnificent this PC was
that's enough oh yeah
here are the custom parts put them all
together after to find a place to put
these I'm just glad that this project is
over every time have to do a PC project
like this it takes a lot out of me so
I'm glad to finally move on and start on
my next PC project in case you guys
haven't noticed the pattern I do
ultimate PC and then I go to a budget
build and I do an ultimate PC back and
forth so to try and change things up and
of course I always try and add my layer
of spice to each of these builds instead
of just assembling parts together so
yeah that's it I'm really happy with the
way the build came along the video is
actually getting lots of feedback
Corsair side and video side NZXT
retweeted the post so yeah mission
accomplished
time to move on alright so raised hogs
is officially no more as you can see and
I took some time to clean up the place
so I think that a pretty damn good job
considering the fact that this place is
a complete chaos this past week or so
oh and I'm editing vlog number 2
rendering I keep saying editing
exporting aka rendering vlog number 2 we
look how clean the places compared to
before I think I did a pretty damn good
job I still want to do something about
these cables but honestly I don't think
there's anything I can do the table is
really thin there's really no place to
hide those unless I can somehow wrap
them up together and stick them on the
roof there but I don't know we'll see ok
so the next thing I want to work on is
this I'm gonna get these foams installed
somewhere on the
top there against a wall to absorb to
absorb some sound but yeah let's go
ahead and see what I can do
Oh
so far so good
that looks pretty sweet I'm not gonna
lie I they try and get it as straight as
possible but I don't think it's perfect
pretty damn close though wait where's
Tony what you going
he doesn't realize that she's in the
closet where she's knowing where she
where she huh where she she in there all
right so I did my best to align the
phones but unfortunately the eyeball is
not good enough so I'm gonna go to those
tomorrow I'll pick up a leveler so I can
make sure that these are even because
they are crooked I'm not you can tell
but they are not parallel to my desk or
to the monitor it's slightly crooked
it's gonna bother the living out of
me so I was order some more foams to
kind of fill up the top because I don't
know I kind of don't like that design
maybe I'll even fill the entire wall I
don't know we'll see
but so far looks pretty badass love the
color and I hope this is gonna help out
with the voiceovers there'll be a lot
less echo in the room for sure buddy
that's it I'm gonna wrap this vlog up
thank you guys again for why
Ching if you enjoy these vlogs let me
know by dropping a like on the video and
leave a comment down below I honestly
you look to your feedback to decide if I
should continue these or not but anyways
I hope you enjoyed it
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
