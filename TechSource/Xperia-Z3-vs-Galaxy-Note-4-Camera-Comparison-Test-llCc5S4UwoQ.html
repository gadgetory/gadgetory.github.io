welcome to another ultimate camera
comparison video this time we are facing
off the Xperia z3 against the Galaxy
Note 4 but before we get into the good
stuff let's take a quick look at their
camera specs the note 4 has a 16
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.0 some notable camera
features on the note 4 include autofocus
touch to focus digital and optical image
stabilization the camera can also shoot
in 4k resolution at 30fps
so the z3 has a twenty point seven
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.0 some notable camera
features include autofocus during
recording touch to focus slow motion at
120 fps and digital image stabilization
the camera can also record in 4k
resolution at 30fps and 1080p and 60fps
for front-facing cameras the z3 has a
two point two megapixel camera that can
shoot in 1080p and the note 4 is 3.7
megapixel camera can shoot in 1080p
anyways that is it for the camera specs
that sit back relax and take a look at
some samples I hope you guys enjoy the
video
what is it you guys it's at back again
from Texas and once again we are
comparing the cameras on both of the
phones that you see above it will be an
audio icon displayed on each video and
I'll basically tell you which bones
audio is being used at the time both of
the phones are strapped onto one device
and they are both secure so whatever you
are seeing right now on the footage is
basically very accurate in terms of
stability so in other words if one phone
shakes so does the other those of you
that are new to my channel I do these
types of videos all the time especially
for new phones and I compare them to the
other flagships so these are type of
videos that you're interested in then
you should consider subscribing because
there's definitely a lot more to come
when it comes to autofocusing the z3
does a decent job it's not the fastest
when it comes to focusing speeds but it
still gets the job done it's also really
accurate it doesn't have a problem
detecting the object that I'm trying to
focus on so overall that is a very solid
sensor
the no.4 on the other hand isn't much
different when it comes to focusing
speeds definitely not a competition to
the g3 and the iPhone 6 but it still
gets the job done however the accuracy
isn't as good as the z3 there will be
multiple times where the sensor just
wouldn't detect the object even though
it's right in front of the phone when it
comes to speed and accuracy the z3 takes
the point
when it comes to daytime pics I think
that both bones did a great job when it
comes to sharpness and just overall
quality the z3 has a wider angle lens
hence you can see a lot more however
when it comes to truer to life colors
the note board takes the point the green
on the dumpster of the note 4 is
actually the closest to real life indoor
shots the note 4 also does a lot better
the white balance on the z3 just doesn't
compare now when it comes to low-light
pictures with flash it's kind of hard to
pick a winner since both phones are
equally bad the flash on both cameras
over exposes the shot almost every time
especially when you take a picture of
something white but if I have to give a
point to one phone it would go to the z3
for daytime video the note 4 has a lot
more contrast than the z3 everything
looks a lot more plain and washed out in
the z3 video compared to the note 4 so
definitely a point here for the note 4
however the z3 also gets a point for
stability I mean look how steady the
video is when putting it side-by-side to
the note 4 for low-light video both
phones did a decent job but if I had to
pick one that I think that a better job
than the other then I would have to go
with the note 4 it just seems like the
video is much sharper in the note 4 and
you can see a lot more detail than the
z3 anyways that is it for the camera
comparison between the Xperia z3 and the
Galaxy Note 4 what do you guys think
about the test do you agree with me or
not drop a comment down below as I am
really interested in hearing your
thoughts
once again this is that from tech stores
and I will see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
