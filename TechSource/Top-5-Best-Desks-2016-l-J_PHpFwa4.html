welcome to another highly anticipated
video the top 5 best desks for gaming or
productivity if there's a desk that you
guys really think the Zips to be on this
list and I didn't feature it make sure
to drop a link to it down below because
I will be doing a part two and maybe
even a part 3 depending on how many
likes we can get on this video also
everything I mentioned in this video
will be listed down below so without
wasting any more time let's check these
out so starting off the show is the mom
desk which is an overall solid desk and
I used it for my perfect desk setup
episode one and I completely fell in
love with it it's 55 inches in length
and 25 inches in width nothing really
too big but large enough to fit a couple
monitors and even your PC the things I
like about the desk cable management is
extremely easy there's a rack that
allows you to dump your perish trip on
and keep majority of the cables in there
so that they are not hanging down it
also comes in black brown and white and
it has two drawers which can be used for
storage there is a perfect organizer
that fits the mom desk that will help
keep things separated if you do decide
to go with it I also like the
flexibility during installation IKEA
actually gives you the option to put the
drawer on the left side instead if
that's what you prefer things I don't
like about the desk most monitor mounts
won't work with the desk since the back
end of the table is blocked off with a
backboard which means the use of clamps
are impossible and since most modern
amounts use clamps you are pretty much
sll mounts like wall-e are pretty much
your only option since it just sits on
your desk like this without any drilling
or clamping also the price is pretty
steep but I assure you that you are
getting what you pay for just overall a
very solid and awesome desk I highly
recommend it next up you have the
extremely annoying yet popular linman
desk that we see so many of in setup
wars the reason why it's so popular
because it's simple it's cheap and it
gets the job done for only $30 you get a
solid table that will hold up your
minimalistic setup things I like super
small compact doesn't take up much space
in your room comes in a ton of colors to
choose from we got black blue white
brown and even the legs can be modified
in the color you want which is great
since
can match the color theme of your setup
and also the price it's only $30 not
including shipping things I don't like
to small and fragile it's not really
sturdy enough to hold up a heavy gaming
PC nor does it have enough space for a
multi-monitor setup this desk is perfect
for minimalistic and/or laptop set ups
number two is that there are no drawers
you're basically Sol when it comes to
keeping stuff off of the desk however I
do suggest picking up a pencil drawer
and installing it under the desk because
this way you have some storage space for
miscellaneous items no dedicated cable
management area however picking up an
Ikea Signum rack will surely remedy that
situation if this table is way too small
for you guys the Big Brother version is
only 15 dollars more and much wider
instead of 39 inches you get a 59 inch
surface so basically 20 inches wider
than before giving you much more room to
work with whether you have more monitors
or speakers whatever it is you got space
for it since there is no support in the
middle putting heavy things in the
center will make it Bend slightly so be
careful about that number three on the
list is my own desk and the reason why
I'm including this is because not only
have I had this for almost three years
but this is still my favorite desk even
till today for several reasons number
one it's motorized giving me the option
to lift and lower whenever I want and 2
which is the main reason the surface
area it's 72 inches in width making it
one of the few if not the only motorized
desk that wide even till today I haven't
come across another motorized desk that
comes close to 72 inches I love having
all that space since I have a bunch of
stuff on it and I feel like it doesn't
really limit my ability to add whatever
I want later in the future things I like
the enormous surface area 72 by 30
inches to be exact
ability to lift and lower the desk with
a press of a button extremely sturdy and
well built this table has been through
hell the past two and a half years and
it still works like new things I don't
like the price it's extremely expensive
ranging up to almost 900 bucks depending
on the configuration you get no
dedicated cable management trays or
drawers so you have to be creative when
it comes to cable management what I do
with mine was pick up a cable Raceway
and slap it on the roof
and routed the cables through it with
the help of cable clips 3m tape and
velcro straps you guys can check out my
cable management video for more info if
you must have a motorized desk my second
recommendation would be the stand desk
it's more affordable comes with a cable
management rack and drilled holes making
it a lot easier routing cables through
it's also smaller measuring at 56 by 26
inches back to Ikea we have the Halas
dad what IKEA has amazing desks this is
more of a modded desk since it requires
the hallstatt tabletop and to Alex
drawer units you basically use the
drawers as support and slap on the
tabletop I really like this top
specifically because it has an aluminum
brushed finish which looks really good
Aalto from set up wars episode 17 rocked
this exact table layout and it just
looks so damn good things I like very
large surface area this tabletop comes
in either 74 or 98 inches for its width
that's crazy long the premium feel and
look flexibility you don't have to buy
IKEA drawers you can actually place it
on top of two objects that have the same
height and finally the sturdy build even
with all that stuff in the middle it
still as straight as Mel Gibson things I
don't like it's over 100 bucks just for
a tabletop you don't get any legs or
space for cable management and finally
since it's just a tabletop there is a
possibility of it sliding or moving
around if enough force is applied to it
finding a way to secure it from moving
would be a great idea and finally for
people out there that prefer a glass
desk for god knows what reason
the crowley desk is one of the most
popular ones out there mainly because of
how simple and clean it looks the only
real problem with this type of desk is
the cable management there's really no
way of hiding it getting a rack and
putting all the cables on it will be
kind of pointless since you can still
see the cables through the glass table
the only other option I see is to pick
up a cable sleeve like this one and hide
all the cables in there and maybe even a
cable box to hide the power strip on the
ground the other problem is that glass
tables are expensive this one goes for a
little over 300 bucks for something this
small so basically you are just paying
for aesthetics as I mentioned before all
of the desks and cable management items
be linked below if anyone wants to check
them out and also link me a desk you
think deserves to be in this episode so
I can feature it in my next video leave
a like if you guys enjoy my top 5 videos
and as always I'll see you the next
