welcome to another day of 12 days of
tech I've already lost track what they
were on this episode we're gonna be
focusing on microphones and actually did
two videos on the best budget
microphones on the $50 so if you guys
want to hear some samples and stuff like
that make sure to watch those videos
I'll have moving below so starting off
the video we're gonna be taking a look
at some really budget microphones as
always we're gonna stop in the bottom
and make it to the top the first cut my
attention because of its rating this is
probably one of the best microphones
that cost around twelve dollars
it's a unidirectional dynamic microphone
that comes with a 3.5 millimeter plug a
desk stand as well as a 6.3 millimeter
adapter if you guys want to plug it into
an amplifier in addition to a one meter
cable that is permanently attached it
also has a power switch to turn it off
while not in use for this price you
can't really beat it
but again guys make sure to check out
some reviews before you pull the trigger
the Caddy 37 microphone is a really nice
mic that comes with a plethora of colors
that you can choose from it has a
cardioid pickup pattern that minimizes
background noise and isolates the main
sound source it also comes with a bass
reduction switch that reduces room noise
and it's fully compatible with both Mac
and Windows it also comes with a
detachable USB cable and a small stand
that can be adjusted to your desire next
up is possibly the most popular
microphone out there the blue snowball
ice it has a smaller minimalistic design
with a detachable USB cable and a
desktop stand as a custom condenser
capsule that offers crystal-clear audio
for things like Skype Facebook calls
discord and also YouTube videos as well
it doesn't need a software for either
Mac or Windows just plug in the
microphone and it automatically works
overall this is a really solid
microphone and I recommend it for
anybody who wants to do voiceovers or
start a new YouTube channel that's on a
budget the next one doesn't look like
your typical mic
so the Samson meteor microphone has an
exceptionally different design it comes
in three colors chrome brushed nickel
and titanium black the microphone does
come with a USB cable a headphone volume
a headphone jack so you can listen to
the sound you're recording an LED to
show when the mic is in use a mic mute
button and of course a built-in stand
for $100 there is simply no other mic
that can beat the blue yet
in terms of plug-and-play it has an
exceptional sound quality with a really
nice design and a lot of colors to
choose from it also comes with a stand
and a USB cable
it comes in cardioid bi-directional
omnidirectional and stereo recording
patterns you can select from its
multiple recording patterns whichever
one suits you the best
it also has gain control a mute button
and a zero latency headphone output for
this price you can't go wrong with this
microphone for anyone that has a little
bit more to spend the audio technica
at2020 enter microphone for smooth
natural sound and low noise also coming
with a free pop filter it also has a
custom shock mount to provide isolation
as a high SPL handling and a wider
dynamic range to provide unmatched
versatility and a cardioid pickup
pattern that reduces pickup sounds from
the side rear and of course improving
isolation altogether this mic does not
come with a USB cable so you will need
an audio interface to get started but if
you already have one or want to up your
sound recording game this is the
microphone to go for I've also linked
the Focusrite other interface that I use
for my videos down below in case anyone
is interested in checking that out and
finally for all my ballers out there
look no more the rode nt1-a anniversary
edition microphone is the mic for you
rode is well known for the exceptional
microphones and their sound quality and
design this mic is no exception this
package comes with a shock mount the
microphone itself a pop filter an XLR
cable and a 10 year warranty this mic is
the best microphone you can buy on this
list if price is a matter to you and you
are looking to buy the best look no
further then this is definitely for you
this mic made my list because it's one
of the best out there for voiceovers so
that is it for this episode of twelve
days of tech if there's a category you
guys want to see next make sure to let
me know in the comments below I know I'm
like a few days behind already I'm
trying to do as much as I can before
Christmas thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
