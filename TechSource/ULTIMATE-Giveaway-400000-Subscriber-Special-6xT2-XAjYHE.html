was gonna wait until I reached 400,000
subscribers but I didn't want to make
you guys wait until the end of this
month so I just said screw it let's do
the giveaway now I have lots of amazing
prizes to give away so make sure you
guys watch this entire video for the
important details but before we get into
the good stuff I have a few
announcements to make so first up my
wallpaper a lot of you guys have been
asking me where I get my wallpapers from
facets da la is the website and also my
good friend Phillip actually took the
wallpaper I'm using now and he custom
made different colors so if you guys
want to pick one up to match your setup
you can now do that by clicking on the
link down below and downloading them
huge things to you Phillip next
announcement is t-shirts after being
harassed many times many times by you
guys I finally managed to get off my ass
and make some t-shirts for you guys so I
have black and white t-shirts and many
different designs and reasons why have
so many is because I'm trying to figure
out which ones people are willing to buy
and which ones have the worst design so
I limited each t-shirt to like 50 so I
can determine which ones are more
popular than the others so yeah they are
in limited quantity so you won't see
most of them ever again and I'm actually
sorry if they do get sold out by the
time you are watching this video I will
bring back four or five of the most
popular designs early 2016 so you didn't
get a chance to pick one up then you
will in a few months I'll drop a link to
my t-shirt page down below for anyone
that's interested
alright so onto the giveaway portion of
the video the first prize we have is a
hoverboard but not just any hoverboard
we got the official text source of a
board that was featured in the cool tech
under 500 a few months back I've only
used this for like a week and there are
some scuffs here and there from falling
and nearly killing myself but then on
that it works 100% without many problems
even if you guys got a new one it will
take you five minutes to scratch the
crap out of it anyways I do have to say
that this is the only giveaway item
that's not international just because
it's going to cost me a fortune to have
this ship out of the country but
everything else you see in this video is
available for us and anywhere else in
the world next up we have the
ever-so-popular $1,000 titanium iPhone
6s case that I did a video on and the
best part about it is that you get a
brand new iPhone 6s case with your
choice of V brand skins
they were also custom engraved whatever
you want on your case next up we have a
console of your choice
either a ps4 or Xbox one brand new this
one is obviously mine but you guys get
to choose either a ps4 and Charlet
bundle or an Xbox one Gears of War
bundle and I also throw in some dban
skin so you can pimp out your console
last but not least we have the grand
prize a $1500 ultimate gaming PC with
gaming gear an FX 8320 processor NZXT X
61 CPU cooler an r9 390x graphics card
with the MSI 970 gaming motherboard he
also gets 16 gigabytes of RAM one
terabyte of storage space packed inside
be sexy and the XTS 340 razor Edition
case obviously I had to keep a theme
consistent we have msi parts so why not
go with MSI gaming gear we have the MSI
Interceptor Gaming Mouse GK 701
mechanical gaming keyboard and an MS
ideas 502 gaming headset also throw in
one free steam game of your choice so
you can start gaming immediately not
only am I going to build a PC myself but
I'm also going to install a fresh copy
of Windows and also install and update
all the drivers
and even overclock the CPU so whoever
wins will get the most performance out
of the PC so I will be doing the
time-lapse build on my channel but you
guys will find the gaming benchmarks on
my cousin's channel check it out and for
those of you who've been with me since
the beginning already know who he is his
name is Bob he's my cousin he's been
helping out text source and essentially
made text source what it is today
honestly if he never approached me two
and a half years ago and asked me to
create a YouTube channel I wouldn't be
here sitting right now talking to you
guys let alone even do this amazing
giveaway so I owe all of this to him but
yeah he will be doing his own thing
he'll be running the channel full-time
by himself
and about a month or two and I think
right now he only has a channel trailer
but there will be a lot of collabs
between me and him and also even host
some giveaways on his channel but if you
guys are feeling awesome it would mean a
lot to me if you were to subscribe to
his channel especially if you want to
see the gaming benchmarks video and
other really cool tech related content
by the way he doesn't even know I'm
doing this video so being pretty crazy
surprised once he checks his channel
alright so how do you enter to win these
amazing prizes well here are the
requirements so I teamed up with mobile
strike and spades plus to make this
happen both of these apps are available
for Android and iPhone mobile strike is
an MMO strategy game somewhat like clash
of clans but with a modern military
theme you can build and defend your base
and even go on the offense with your
army to steal and collect loops spades
on the other hand is a very popular and
simple card game each player gets a turn
to throw in a card and the person with
the highest number of the same color
suit wins each round there was one
exception though and it's that spades
are worth higher than any other card so
throwing in one with a mix of other
color suits will automatically win that
round so for my US viewers the
requirements are simple all you have to
do is download one of the two games by
using the referral link down below for
one entry if you want to increase for
the giveaway you can download both of
the games I did leave a link to the apps
in the description section all you have
to do is click on it and enter your
phone number and then you will get a
text message with a link to download the
app if you're downloading the app just
to enter for the giveaway unfortunately
it will not count
use the app for a few days and for a
mobile strike you have to actually reach
level 6 in order for it to count for one
entry so whichever game you guys
download make sure to use the referral
link down below so I can track you guys
for the giveaway entry so that's for my
US viewers for my international viewers
you guys also have chances to enter
twice one entry for commenting on the
Facebook post about this giveaway and
one more entry for sharing this video on
Twitter or Facebook I know that's a lot
of information so I'm gonna recap well
quickly for my US viewers you guys have
two chances to enter you get one entry
for each game you download by using the
link in the description section and
actually playing the games to qualify
mobile strike requires least level 6 to
get credit for my international viewers
one entry by commenting on the Facebook
post and a second entry by sharing this
video on Twitter or Facebook the final
requirement is to leave a like on this
video and drop a comments down below
voting on which two products you guys
want to enter for unfortunately you
can't enter for all of them you guys get
the options to choose from
two of them I know that there are a lot
of requirements and I'm really sorry for
that the only way I can afford this
giveaway is by teaming up with a few
apps I will announce the winners on the
15th of January on my Twitter and
Instagram accounts so be sure to follow
me there for all of the updates and
announcements believe it or not I've
actually had past winners who never
claimed their prizes within 24 hours so
I was actually forced to pick alternate
winners I want to let's giveaway by
saying thank you to everyone

have amazing subscribers like you guys
