source and today we're gonna be checking
out the Black Edition carry-on this is
the premium version of Blu smarts one
product it offers the same functionality
with a change of materials it also gets
smoother wheels which in turn blue smart
claims makes this one of the quietest
suitcases ever there are a few things
that make this a smart carry on a
digital scale remote locking and
unlocking capabilities a ten thousand
four hundred million power battery built
in any location tracker ok these do
sound pretty useful or at least that's
what I thought before my one week of
testing was concluded but more on my
final findings later on this is the
Black Edition as the name suggests it's
basically blacked out with dark gray
almost charcoal fabric and white accents
around the plastic shell the fabric is
waterproof thanks to the two layer PU
coating and when water touches the
surface it bubbles together and slides
right off to the compartments are made
of microfiber which is nice for laptops
phones tablets or whatever else you're
carrying that could scratch up it would
have however been better if blue smart
put in microfiber on both sides of these
components instead of just one I don't
think I would have cost a lot more and
with its price tag of $600 I was
surprised to see corners cut after about
three changes of clothing and an extra
pair of shoes this thing is pretty
packed and because of its rigid shell
you can't force pack any more than what
the dimensions allow for this is a major
negative for me because I always travel
with just a carry-on instead of multiple
suitcases so having this much room to
work with in the first place definitely
isn't good the lock located at the top
can be open with either the keys
included or if in Bluetooth range your
phone there's also a light that can be
triggered again when within Bluetooth
range via the app I guess this feature
could be useful if you're waiting in the
baggage claim looking at a sea of
strikingly similar suitcases and bags
that pass you by but then again I would
be using this as a carry-on so this
feature is pretty much useless to me the
other smart features are more or less a
bust
the locator can only be used with
confidence when within the bluetooth
range and once outside of that it
becomes unreliable and buggy true story
I actually left this bag in my trunk my
car got towed and I was freaking out
thinking it was stolen I
track down my car or at least that's
what I thought via the blue smart app to
an apartment complex to my surprise when
I called the cops they told me my car
had been in fact towed and that it was
located several miles away with the blue
Smart inside of it there's a few lessons
to be learned here first off read all
the street signs no matter how many cars
are parked on the same side and second
don't rely on this bags GPS capabilities
the built-in digital scale is also
inaccurate with this product using this
feature several times with the same item
inside would give me different results
and sometimes it would be so off that
the accuracy of this feature for me is
not reliable there is a critical feature
that I find very useful actually let's
say if you're leaving your suitcase
behind and walking away from it you will
get a notification on your phone letting
you know that you are walking away from
your suitcase very nice and that brings
us to the last feature the built in
battery it's cool I mean it allows for
easy charging without fumbling around
with external battery packs and it does
what it says it charges your devices but
with that said this feature alone is not
worth the price of this bag the only
other thing I see useful here is the app
enabled unlocking and locking feature if
the GPS was accurate they would have had
me sold but it's frankly not and because
of these reasons I can now recommend
this bag because of its price you can
find plenty of carry-ons with better
storage capacity for much less and just
by an external battery pack for your
power if you walk away from this video
wanting a blue smart product I would go
for the blue smart one and skip the
ridiculous $150 price difference between
these two but anyways that will do for
the video if you guys enjoyed it make
sure to leave a like and as always I'll
drop links down below to the blue smart
luggage if you guys want to check that
out I think I so much for watching and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
