budget gaming PC and only have 500 bucks
in your pocket well you came to the
right place at the time of making this
video this entire build cost four
hundred ninety seven dollars and 42
cents and it is the best budget gaming
PC that you can build for under $500
currently in fact I will be doing a
build guide for this exact same PC along
with a Windows installation guide and
actually if the video is done I will
link it down below along with all the
parts used in this PC build speaking of
parts I went with the i3 6100 skylake
processor even though it's labeled as a
dual core it kind of acts as a quad core
thanks to hyper threading if they try to
keep the cost down so I didn't pick up
an aftermarket cooler or a z170
motherboard I mean after all the CPU is
locked
anyways I picked up the AC Wi-Fi edition
of the asrock h1 TM n because for only
$60 this board comes with some pretty
nice features 32 gigabyte ddr4 support
mini ITX form factor onboard USB 3 4
front panel connections and most
importantly it has a built-in Wi-Fi
module so you can connect it to the
internet without buying any additional
adapters I did go with only one stick of
8 gigs of ram so that there is a room
for an extra eight gigs later down the
line you can also upgrade the CPU to an
i5 6465 or even a 6600 in the near
future for storage I decided to skip
hard drives altogether and put in a
single SSD from silicon power which is
one of the most affordable 240 gigabyte
SSDs you can buy for around 50 bucks it
just makes sense to use an SSD as your
main drive however there are three
additional setup ports on the
motherboard for three more storage
devices in my case I added a 1 terabyte
hard drive as well although it's not
included in the build price since I had
a budget of only $500 I had to pick the
best GPU for the money and after
countless research and looking at
benchmarks the asus strix RX 460 was the
obvious choice
and i was not disappointed with its
performance which you guys will see soon
enough housing all the parts is the
Thermaltake core v1 mini ITX tower once
again but this time i went with the
color black as i have used the white
version previously for Ice Cube which
was actually a 6
gaming PC finally powering up the build
is a 430 watt power supply from EVGA
which is enough to juice up this entire
configuration even if you managed to
upgrade a CPU to an i7 6700 with an RX
480
this PSU will still be plenty the PC is
also fairly cool in terms of temps which
is surprising since there is no
aftermarket cooler or any extra case
fans the CPU peaks at 62 degrees on full
load while the GPU maxes out at 66
degrees during overclock mode it's also
pretty quiet during full load and here's
what it sounds like while gaming for the
fire schwag benchmark it pretty much
ties with volt which is the $550 gaming
PC I did for April however it doesn't
stand a chance against Ice Cube which
was the $600 build rocking the r9 380
which performs much better than the rx
460 looking at rendering times it's no
surprise that it falls behind after all
it is a dual core processor and using
this PC for editing is not recommended
surprisingly it did better than to the
pcs on the chart so I guess it's not
that bad and finally here are the gaming
benchmarks please note that all these
benchmarks were done three times per
game and also the settings were set to
high and the resolution is 1080p I hope
you guys enjoy
so they have a guy some very impressive
numbers for dark cube who would have
thought you can game over 60 FPS at high
settings using a 6100 dual-core
processor as always there will be a
build guide for this exact same PC in
case you guys want a step-by-step guide
on how to build a dark cube for
yourselves this also included Windows
installation guide as well if the video
is ready I'll link it down below along
with all the parts I mentioned in this
video if you guys enjoy these monthly PC
bills be sure to leave a like it really
does help me and help out the channel I
ton thing guys so much for watching as
always and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
