and before I begin I have a few things I
want to say to you first of all I'm
sorry for sounding like this I got the
flu unfortunately but I've been sitting
down and thinking about this a lot and I
think I want to eventually knock down
setup wars from twice a week or sorry
once a week to once every two weeks and
I actually have two reasons for that
reason number one is I'm simply getting
burnt out I've been doing setup Wars
once a week since June 2015 guys that's
two and a half years of doing the show
without missing a single week and it
started to take a toll on me it feels
like every Monday is coming up faster
and faster and I just can't seem to
catch up so I feel like I really do need
a break again I don't know what I'm
gonna do this but I definitely thinking
about it and it might happen sometime in
2018 second reason is if you guys look
at my channel 50% of my content is set
up related I do set up words every
Monday and set up montages every
Saturday that's 8 episodes of setups per
month and I make 16 on average 16 videos
a month that's 50% of tech stores
basically just set up content and that's
not what tech source is about guys I'm
gonna focus more on the stuff that I
love to do which is PC build and
boxing's and reviews that's basically
why I start a tech source that's what I
originally started doing so as much as I
love doing setup wars I think I'm gonna
focus more on the other things as well
because that is what this channel is
about it's tech stores not set up source
I also want to focus on other types of
content start a new series and bring
back previous series that you guys
missed like the top 5 overpriced tech
the ultimate desk setup and stuff like
that so I'm gonna focus on that as well
for 2018 setup Wars will still be the
most popular show on my channel but I
gotta focus on other things otherwise
there's no point in growing so yeah I'm
sorry for dragging a central out guys I
wanted to plug it in this video instead
of making a separate one just for that
announcement but anyways welcome to
setup wars episode 137 where we submit
your desk setup if you guys want to
participate and want to submit your desk
setup make sure to watch the video
linked below I love the setup boards
begin
starting off the show we got Brian and a
very balanced gaming screaming and
editing setup featuring a 27-inch
monitor from Acer and a 23 inch one from
Lenovo up top both of them are hooked up
to a desk mount and speaking of the desk
he went with the beautiful egg back in
countertop from Ikea and to Alec jours
for support and storage everything is
neat and tidy on the surface he's
rocking the Logitech G a10 keyboard with
the g502 Mouse and a spot to route the
cables through very nice a few other
things he has on a desk car has skinned
ps4 console a charging station for the
controllers and a dock for an eight
terabyte hard drive and 500 gigs of SSD
for audio he's rocking a pair of
Logitech z3 13 speakers and two sets of
headphones the Sennheiser HD 558 and the
598 switch are hanging from the
brainwaves hangar away from sight and
also got a shure microphone that's
hooked up to his Berringer audio
interface definitely an interesting
place for the boom arm no doubt there's
a lot of people that prefer mounting it
in the front of the desk instead of the
back I guess it depends on their
preference instead of leaving the audio
interface on the desk Brian decided to
mount it underneath his desk using some
3m tape he also used a lot of cable
clips to keep all the wires from hanging
down I think overall either an excellent
job the PC power in the setup is
beautifully built inside the NZXT h 440
case and as packing the 4790k 16 gigs of
ram and the EVGA 1080 TI FTW 3 edition a
very clean build and a very clean setup
I think that the tabletop really brings
everything together so points on picking
that up instead of the regular boring
white or black tabletop I also really
like those hexagon shapes that you hung
on the wall definitely add some flavor
to this setup personally I think that
looks cooler than just having nothing on
the wall again a beautiful setup thank
you Brian for entering and starting off
the show Charlie is up next and this is
his setup for gaming editing and all
productivity work he's rocking three AOC
monitors the corsair k70 keyboard and
the g502 mouse
for a thirteen-year-old that's a hell of
a setup damn he's even got a bit
creative with the actual desk so he
picked up the Carl B countertop and a
few risers which he installed on the
Alex Shores hanging from under there are
the m50x headphones and a Signum rack
that's doing a pretty good job
now the boom arm in this setup is
actually in a place that I like off to
the right side slightly behind the
monitor and not in the way of anyone the
PC powering the setup which is kind of
hidden on the right side features the
7600 K and the EVGA 1080 superclocked I
mean it's not a hundred percent hidden
but I would have found the nightstand or
something higher so that the PC isn't
that low to the ground it's a shame you
can't really see that another thing you
can do to improve this set up slightly
is by moving your headphones to the
right side of your setup that way there
isn't a cable just hanging down from the
middle using one of these brainwaves
hangers that we saw in the previous
contestant would help clean up your
setup but whatever it is that you're
doing at just 13 years of age keep it up
man this is some good stuff and thank
you for entering CODIS up next from
North Carolina and his setup for gaming
and school work so he's got a 27-inch
dell gaming monitor on the right and a
27-inch one on the left in the vertical
orientation which leads me to believe
that he's some sort of a coder other
than the logitech speakers the only
things he has on his desk or the
keyboard and mouse which aren't tied
together using some velcro straps nicely
done he's also got a blue snowball ice
microphone hooked up to a boom arm the
cable management is very clean I can see
that he picked up a Raceway for the
wires and one thing I noticed about
Cody's setup is that he puts his headset
in his drawer instead of just hanging it
I don't know if he did that for the
video since he doesn't have a dedicated
place to put them and he knew I was
gonna call him out on it but I thought I
would point that out one thing I really
like in his room is the custom charging
station that he built next to his setup
it looks like he mounted a table against
the wall and attached a long power strip
which he uses to juice up his tech but
don't you think that's a little overkill
though I mean you're only using four out
of the nine ports and you have so much
extra space to work with wrapping up his
setup is the PC which is inside another
NZXT case and it's packed with the 7600
Kay
and a gtx 1060 I love that the setup is
clean but personally it's a bit bland
there isn't any flavor or personality I
mean you've got to have something in
there that makes this setup yours
otherwise it's just another generic
setup with monitors peripherals and a PC
either way it's a great start
just work on personalizing it from time
to time Thank You Cody for entering
speaking of personalizing a setup we got
Dennis and his setup that he uses for
gaming and coding I mean technically the
only thing he asked for personalization
is that skull which he uses as a
headphone hangar but it's still better
than just having a plain set up he
mounted the 34 inch ultra wide gaming
monitor from LG on the wall and below
that he's got the strike battle spectra
keyboard and he razer naga hex mouse
with a pair of cambridge sound works
speakers things are nice and tidy
underneath looks like his desk comes
with a dedicated place to store the
power strip and cables which is nice and
he even added a wall raceway to cover
the monitor wires very nice the PC power
in the setup feature is the 7700 KMA GTX
1080 from MSI with those sexy sleeves
cables not a bad setup I don't really
have any recommendations Thank You
Dennis four and three last but not least
we got Jordan and his gaming setup and I
gotta give points right off the bat for
presentation that's a nice set up to
look at with those three ultra lights
from LG and the height is actually
perfect it's not blocking out the
speakers like I see in other setups he's
also using the g4 10 keyboard and he
Death Adder Elite Mouse at this point
it's obvious he's going with a black and
red color scheme and for the most part I
think he did a great job sticking with
it with the exception of his black and
white soul headphones I also like how
you built those wall shelves for
additional storage and you even used one
of them to hold your PC up there that's
actually a really great idea as opposed
to just putting it on the ground if you
guys are watching this video and you're
beautiful pcs on the ground because you
don't have space on your desk or next to
you because let's say there's a bed or
something then you should consider
installing a wall shelf like Jordan
obviously I would do some research and
make sure it's sturdy enough to support
your PC but it's definitely a very nice
alternative compared to having it on the
ground
course no complaints to the cable
management looks like you knew what you
were doing and somehow the PC powering
your monitors has an i3 6100 and a GTX
1060 that's actually impressive if
you're managing to push all those pixels
without any lag I also get this feeling
that Jordan is obsessed with RGB lights
I mean if your door is wrapped in LED
lights then I think there's something
going on here I'm surprised you don't
have any LED lights in the corners of
your ceiling but anyways you got a
pretty sweet gaming setup Thank You
Jordan for entering so that is it for
this episode of setup words I hope you
guys enjoy the video make sure you guys
drop your comments below and vote on who
you think has the best desk setup hope
you guys are having an awesome new year
and I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
