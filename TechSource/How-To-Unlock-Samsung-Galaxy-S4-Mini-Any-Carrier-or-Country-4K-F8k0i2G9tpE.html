and today I'm going to guide you in the
process of unlocking your Samsung Galaxy
s4 mini smartphone for this
demonstration I'm going to use a lock 18
t galaxy s4 mini and unlock it so I can
use it on my t-mobile network so first
off we need to get the unlock code for
the phone before we proceed with the
unlocking procedure one of the best
unlocking companies that are currently
available is the unlocking company comm
and I use them for all my smart phones
just because they have the lowest prices
and the fastest delivery times so head
on over to the unlocking company comm
once you're there you'll be selecting
your phone manufacturer and the phone
model from the drop-down list now once
you do that select get unlocking code
and that will take you to the next step
which is to select what country you
purchase the phone from as well as the
carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it from the United States and
the carrier is AT&amp;amp;T you will need the
phone's IMEI number to continue and I'm
going to show you how to look it up on
your phone open up your dial pad and
enter and star pound zero six pound and
the number will immediately show up and
you will need to enter that on the
website to continue make sure you select
the correct currency for your country
before moving on once you select get a
locking code and checkout securely with
PayPal they will email you the code the
price and time vary depending on the
phone but don't worry because you are
getting the best possible price with the
fastest delivery times so once you do
receive your code of your email it's
time to unlock your phone so before we
continue make sure that the phone is
powered off go ahead and remove the
backplate of the phone and the battery
as well so you can gain access to the
SIM tray and this is where you insert
the SIM card that you wish to use with
the phone if your SIM card is a
different size and you have to adjust it
in order for it to fit I provided you
guys with a link in the description
section to show you have thats done
after you insert the SIM card in the
tray go ahead and put back the battery
and the back case and power it back on
your phone now once it powers up go
ahead and leave your lockscreen once you
do that a prompt will appear asking you
to enter in a lock code when this
happens go ahead and enter the code that
you received in the email after you are
done entering in the lock code it will
take you straight to the home screen
like it did here and the phone is now
unlocked and you can begin using it
right away as you can see here I am
using an
80s for many on my t-mobile network so
that is how you unlock your samsung
galaxy s4 mini smartphone if this video
helped you guys out feel free to leave a
like and you have any questions at all
then you can leave them in the comment
section down below and I will make sure
to answer them as soon as possible
