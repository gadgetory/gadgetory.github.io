again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below also
guys is that from Texas and welcome to
PC wars episode 17 when you submit your
custom PC to get featured on the channel
so because are interested in being part
of the show make sure to watch the video
linked below but you are your five
contestants for this week we have Gary
mat a second Matt Sebastian and saw Luke
I hope I didn't put you in your name so
starting up the show we have Gary and
his balls the PC obviously it's rocking
a 59 30 K and 2 GTX 980 s and SLI and
also has 32 gigs of course sir Dominator
Platinum's a 400 gigabyte intel 750 PCIe
SSD and a 256 gigabyte Samsung m2 along
with a few other storage devices so this
is an inverted PC with an upside-down
motherboard and a few mods we do have
some custom painted parts including the
case exterior and interior along with
the sli bridge and a bottle that has a
chrome tube passing through it with some
LED lights and for benchmarks we got a
score of nineteen thousand seven hundred
forty one to start things off strong the
only thing I would have done was painted
the 750 series SSD either in black or
blue to stay consistent with the overall
theme but nonetheless a very badass PC
thank you Gary for entering my number 2
is Matt and Leviathan a PC with another
59 30k overclocked to 4.5 and to ZOTAC 9
ATT is the build also features 32 gigs
of g.skill ram and a samsung 950 pro m2
SSD for benchmarks is scored a 23,000
2:43 securing the number one spot for
this episode to be honest I kind of like
the stealthy look of this bill there
isn't any bright color sticking out and
it kind of has a dark theme to it a very
sick build indeed thank you Matt for
entering now here is an interesting
build from the other matte
kind of looks like a Thermaltake core p5
case but without the glass so this is
rocking the 6700 in a single GTX 970 it
also appears to be wall mounted on a
carbon fiber base which looks pretty
sick I also love the red LEDs that glow
from underneath the parts although it
didn't score that high and fire strike
it's definitely a very good-looking and
unique build thank you Matt for entering
this next build is out of this world
ladies and gentlemen this is project
three leaves from sebastian who is 19
years old and lives in sweden
holy hell i don't even know where to
begin so this thing is walking a 50 20 k
at a single EVGA gtx 980ti
inside the deep cool try stellar case
according to sebastian this took more
than 300 hours over seven months to
complete this build and this is his
first ever computer what the hell my
first computer I built looked something
like this
I definitely love the attention to
detail everywhere on this case he
mounted the reservoirs outside drilled
some holes to run the tubes through
painted the screws and a bunch of other
parts and even added some pretty cool
decals I want to see impress that you
were able to do all this and maintain
perfect symmetry for benchmarks is
called a 15000 633 which isn't enough to
take first place but damn is this a
gorgeous build Thank You Sebastian for
blessing my eyeballs with this last but
not least we have project alpha from Sol
ruk a very nice black and white build
inside the courser 780 T case I just
noticed we have a ton of x99 built in
this episode for some reason and project
alpha is no different we have another
5820k at 4.5 gigahertz and two gtx 980ti
s in sli excellent work on a paint job
for the sli bridge and RAM sticks and I
gotta say the black and white colours
are nicely balanced and finally four
benchmarks in scoring 26,000 205 taking
first place for this episode so that is
it for this episode of PC Wars as always
