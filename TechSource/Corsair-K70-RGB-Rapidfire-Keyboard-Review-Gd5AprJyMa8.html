there are always new deals getting added
every day I'll drop a link to the
website down below what's up guys is
that from tech Soares and today we're
going to take a look at course there's
new lineup of rapid-fire keyboards with
cherry MX speed switches essentially
these keyboards are aimed at competitive
gamers where every second counts
the mxp switches have 45 grams of
actuation force and a 1.2 millimeter
actuation distance compared to the
average 2 millimeter making them 40%
faster than MX Reds it may not seem like
a big difference on paper but when
you're in a tournament and the stakes
are high you definitely want to have the
advantage against your opponent
especially in games where every
millisecond counts like black ops 3 or
even csgo
the rapid-fire lineup is currently
available on the K 65 RGB and both
versions of the k70 RGB and standard the
keyboard I have in this video is the k70
RGB and it retails for one hundred and
seventy dollars whereas the other models
cost slightly less aesthetically there's
nothing really different than their
previous keyboards course they are still
using the best quality materials that
separates them from the competition an
aluminum chassis is that has a brushed
look on the surface media controls on
the top right corner that include a
windows lucky a three step brightness
control and a volume wheel
they've also stuck with their detachable
wrist rest which is extremely
comfortable the extra was the key caps
are textured along with the spacebar
just like before
however the font is slightly wider this
time around in the back is a USB
pass-through which is very nice to see
next to that is a polling weight switch
and underneath the keyboard is a set of
height adjustable legs now that we got
all of that out of the way let's take a
closer look at these switches so these
are linear switches meaning it has
smooth travel from top to bottom which
means that there is no tactile bump or
clicky sound present much like the
cherry blacks or reds however this time
around the keys have a much shorter
distance to actuate 1.2 millimeter
compared to 2 millimeter from MX browns
keep in mind that because the actuation
distance is shorter it
the key to reset faster and ready to
press again resulting in more keystrokes
over a period of time now although the
keyboard doesn't come with a white
backplate like my cursor shape does
which helps reflect off the RGB lighting
it does have its own advantages first
off the clear switch housings allow the
RGB lights to shine through which is
more visible from the sides and second
it's a lot easier to clean since there
is no caved backplate however with the
absence of the white backplate the
colors do appear more dark and less
vibrant I also noticed this green and
red color effect that illuminated from
the clear switch housing it's especially
noticeable with white LEDs so how does
the rapid-fire keyboard do in gaming to
be honest I'm not sure I'm not a
competitive gamer so I really couldn't
tell the difference I tried playing csgo
in black ops 3 and I have learned one
thing and one thing only
I was terrible at both games before and
still terrible even after using the
keyboard but no matter how you look at
it and what game you are playing or what
you're typing the rapid-fire keyboard
with cherry MX speed switches will
register faster than other regular
switches so if you want the fastest
keyboard out there regardless of how
much of a difference it really provides
then the rapid-fire lineup from Corsair
is something you should definitely pick
up the build quality and features alone
make this a great Buy I for one I'm
happy with my cursor strafe keyboard and
see no real reason to switch since I'm
mostly editing videos and only game
casually but I'll do for this video
thing you guys so much for watching if
you enjoyed it make sure to hit that
like button and I'll drop a link to the
keyboard down below if you guys want to
check that out thanks again for watching
and I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
