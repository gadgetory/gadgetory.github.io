welcome to another episode of the best
tech deals of the week it's actually
going to be a very short episode because
we don't have that many deals this time
around but guys we have some exciting
news to share with you the all sorts
that tech now officially has germany
deals so yeah if you guys are from
Germany make sure to bookmark the
website check back and if there's a
specific source that you guys find deals
from for Germany let me know in the
comments section because we definitely
are trying to find websites or sources
to add more deals because it is a new
country for us we will be expanding in
2017 as well we're gonna be adding more
countries as time goes by so there's a
specific country you guys want to see on
the website let me know in the comments
below also we have a category section
yes we basically moved out over from
black friday because a lot of you guys
enjoyed it you can now basically filter
the tech in whatever category you want
whether it's displays or gaming pc parts
and stuff like that so we are always
improving website so thank you guys so
much for your feedback let's start the
show so starting up the episode we have
an insane deal on the sennheiser HD 598
seas that are going for only one hundred
and twenty dollars now these are some
premium audiophile grade headphones just
like the original 598 however these are
the closed back version perfect for
audio monitoring listening to music and
even competitive gaming since you can
hear every detail in the game if you
didn't get a chance to grab one of the
blue Yeti microphones from black friday
well here's another chance at them but
this time you guys get a free copy of
watchdogs two for the pc the wireless
razor mama chroma mouse is currently out
of stock but if you don't mind waiting a
few days you can pick it up for fifty
dollars less speaking of mice we have a
few other options the logitech g602 is
still going for forty dollars which is
an incredible price and then we got the
courser m65 pros also for forty dollars
and finally the steelseries viral 700
for 70 bucks this is something i
purchased last year and still use even
till today for vlogging and close-up
shots and most of my videos in fact i
use this exact same tripod for my
water-cooled build videos and it's
actually helping me a ton to get those
really close shots of me putting on the
pc parts and stuff about this for
twenty-five dollars last year so it's
about
dollars off right now which is nothing
too crazy but if you shoot videos this
is definitely a nice and handy tripod to
have in your gear list I did do a video
on a very solid ultra-wide gaming
monitor from LG last week on the channel
that's going for 700 bucks but check
this one out guys this is also seven
hundred dollars but you get a much
higher resolution at 30 for 40 x 1440 p
and the only difference is that you only
get a hundred hertz instead of 144 hurts
and an eight millisecond response time
instead of one from LG it's also from an
unknown korean brand which is why the
price is so cheap and it's actually
currently discounted because this
normally goes for a little over a
thousand bucks but if you guys want on a
gaming monitor with a high resolution
for a long time it then now's your
chance also on ebay i found this xbox
one slim battlefield one bundle going
for 315 dollars which is a perfect gift
for the holidays and finally a new egg
we have a pretty decent deal on an RX
488 gigabyte variant going for two
hundred twenty dollars with a male and
rebate but that is a for all the deals
for this week as always make sure you
guys check back at deal source tech
because we upload bunch of deals
constantly every single day for UK US
Canada and now Germany then guys so much
for watching and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
