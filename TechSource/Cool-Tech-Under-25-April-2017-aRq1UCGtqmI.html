and welcome to another episode of cool
tech this time we're gonna look at tech
under $25 and just like last month's
episode I'm gonna be giving away
everything you see in this video and all
you have to do is leave a like and
comment down below which product you
guys want to take home by the way
congratulations to these winners from
last episode but with that said let's
dive right in and by the way all the
products featured in this video will be
linked down below as always so let's
jump right in and starting off the show
we got the Power Core fusion from Ankur
it's rated at 5000 million hour and it
comes in at $25 right on a dot now you
guys might be wondering why is it this
big with only 5,000 milliamp hour there
are plenty of other power banks with
more juice well what makes this product
unique is that it's a two and one this
doubles as a wall charger and if you're
not charging your phone it will charge
the built-in battery automatically it's
got LEDs to indicate the power level as
well as a microUSB port to charge up the
power brick if you don't have access to
a wall outlet I actually just started
using this a lot more than my previous
power banks because of how easy it is to
charge I don't need to use any cables
just slap it into a wall outlet and I'm
good
next we've got the logo keyring
headphone splitter now for me this one
isn't actually going to be used every
day but its small enough to hang on your
keychain and forget about it until it's
time to use it
it's pretty straightforward it splits
audio from a 3.5 millimeter headphone
port into two headphone jacks it comes
with this robust wire keyring and it's
actually encased in a heavy-duty impact
resistant plastic material the only
complaint I have with the design is the
cover for the headphone jack which can
be lost easily if the Lagos is watching
I suggest that they somehow attach this
to the splitter itself so that way it
doesn't get lost easily if you find
yourself sitting next to your buddy on a
long road trip or flights off then then
this is definitely a great solution it
only cost nine dollars and it comes in
four colors the in over a mobile CPU
stand at first didn't really make the
cut to be in the video because well it's
not really tech but I thought about it
for a bit and a lot of you guys actually
have pcs or into PC content so I thought
that this would be pretty interesting
for my viewers this is
especially perfect for my viewers out
there that have their pcs on the floor I
know how much of a pain it can be
reaching behind your PC and plugging and
unplugging cables it definitely is a
pain in the ass it's made completely
from metal and feels very sturdy the
wheels also lock to keep your computer
in place until you are ready to move it
again and it also comes with rubber
strips that install on the inside to
protect your case from getting scratched
the opening is adjustable and supports
cases about 6 to 11 inches and widths it
costs only 16 dollars and if you require
access to the back of your computer
often or just want to keep your computer
off the ground to prevent dust from
entering from the bottom of the case
then you should definitely check this
out also why the hell is it called a CPU
stand don't they know what a CPU stands
for children called a power or a case
stand instead moving on we got this
amazing laptop bag that I recently
picked up for my lg gram 15 for only $13
this bag is amazing not only is the
water resistant but also has soft lining
and padding inside to protect your
laptop from scratches this particular
model can fit a laptop between fifteen
and fifteen and a half inches however
they do have a version that fits eleven
to twelve and a half inches as well and
I'll drop a link to both of them down
below I love everything about this bag
the design how light it is the build
quality and most importantly it has a
handle near the top which makes it very
convenient carrying it around it also
has a side pocket where you can store
some accessories like a power bank
charging cable or even another tablet
and finally we got the Black Horse
gaming headset stand it comes in at 13
dollars and is a simple solution to
clearing up your desk from headphones
and accompanying wires the stand is made
from high quality light weight acrylic
material and has a spots to place the
smartphone as well it was easy to put
together and even comes with a screw
driver for assembly which is a nice
touch the arms on the back made cable
management very easy especially with
long cables but my only criticism would
be that its height is not tall enough my
m50x is cover my phone screen when they
are both on the stand something else I
want to note is that you can't charge
your phone when it's docked here which
would have been a very nice solution but
I guess the point of this was that it
would fit any type of smartphone but
then again you can actually moderate by
drilling a hole on the bottom and
fitting through your charging cable
dollarz honestly you won't find a
sleeker looking to and one headphone
stand that is it for this episode as
always if you want to win something let
me know in the comments section which
product you want to take home and also
leave a like if you enjoy the video
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
