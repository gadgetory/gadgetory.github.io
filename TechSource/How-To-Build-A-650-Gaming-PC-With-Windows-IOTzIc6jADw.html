and welcome to the build guide of Z on
the $650 gaming and productivity PC if
you guys missed the original video where
I go over the editing and gaming
benchmarks now I'll go to and leave a
link to the video down below for you so
in this video I will show you
step-by-step on how to build yourself a
badass PC with a fresh installation of
Windows all you're going to need for
this build is a screwdriver and I
recommend picking up some petri dishes
so it helps you with organizing your
screws so you don't lose them I'll go to
link a few options down below for you
one thing to keep in mind when building
your PC is to constantly touch the metal
part of your case so you can ground
yourself and not build static which can
potentially damage the parts alright so
step one is to lay your PC sideways with
a side panel off and open up your
motherboard box and remove the
motherboard IO shield and SATA cables
first thing we're going to install is
the CPU so go ahead and remove that from
the box and go ahead and pop open the
socket cover on the motherboard by
pressing down on the lever and pulling
it away from the hook whatever you do do
not touch the center of the CPU and
instead grab it from the sides carefully
make sure to match the gold triangle of
the CPU to the triangle located on the
socket cover and gently rest the CPU
down it should easily fall in place do
not force the CPU down no matter what
you do make sure that the hinges on both
sides of the socket align correctly with
the CPU next you are ready to close the
hatch so gently lower the cover and
press down on the lever and tuck it
under the hook if you do it correctly
the back cover will snap off which is
perfectly normal do not freak out don't
worry if you remove the cover before it
doesn't really make a difference now
we're going to install the RAM sticks
pull out the tabs on all sides and make
sure to align the notches of the RAM
with the motherboard before you slide
them in once you insert them in make
sure to apply pressure using both of
your hands equally on each side so that
the RAM sticks snap in place evenly if
you did this correctly the tabs on both
sides of the RAM slots should be tucked
inside the notches of the RAM sticks do
the same exact thing for the second Ram
stick next we are ready to install the
i/o shield and the screws in the case
but before we do that remove all the
plastic
and paperwork from the case and also
removed the cables away from these
centers so they don't interfere with the
motherboard so grab the i/o shield which
should have been in the motherboard box
and position it upright so that the
three tiny circles are located on the
bottom and install it against the
rectangular hole and the back of the
case you may need to mess around a bit
here to get it in but an easy way to
install the cover is by applying force
one at a time on each corner keep
applying pressure on the corners until
the shield snaps in place and you can
tell if you did it right if all four
corners are sticking out next up you
will need to grab six of these standoffs
screws and this is what they look like
you will also need this thumb screw to
help install the standoffs depending on
the motherboard or case you are using
you will need to install the standoffs
in the correct slots now if you're using
the same exact parts in this video and
these are the locations of the standoffs
a total of six next up we are installing
the CPU cooler now there are two options
here if you didn't buy the optional
cooler like I did and instead want to
use the stock CPU cooler that came with
the processor then here's what you need
to do you'll need to match the four legs
of the cooler with the four holes on the
motherboard
you don't need thermal paste since the
cooler already comes pre applied with
some once you identify the four holes
gently lay the cooler down and once it
comes in contact with the CPU you'll
need to apply pressure on the four
stands and press them down one by one
until they snap in place try not to move
the cooler while you are doing this
afterwards just connect the fan with the
header on the motherboard which should
be right next to it now if you picked up
the Evo cooler this is how you install
it you have four of these giant screws
that came in with the cooler and laid
them aside because you're going to be
using them soon
flip the motherboard gently over and
place the backplate of the CPU cooler on
the back of the motherboard by matching
the two holes with the two screws up top
now here's a tricky part use one of your
hands to hold a backplate while at the
same time lifting up the motherboard use
your other hand to install the big screw
I mentioned earlier and you will need to
wiggle the screw and the motherboard
around a bit for it to slide through the
bracket now it won't be a smooth process
once it slaps in place quickly grab a
nut and tighten it so it doesn't fall
out repeat the same process three more
times for the other holes
once all four nuts have been installed
pick up the night tightener or whatever
it's called and tighten each one of them
up it came with a CPU and it should be
in the plastic tray next to the other
screw
now what so for the screws are nicely
timed you can flip over the motherboard
back over next step is to install the
cooler but before we do that you will
need to remove the fan off of it for now
we also have to apply thermal paste to
the CPU so grab the thermal compound
that came with the cooler and apply a
very small amount in the center I
accidentally deleted my footage of the
process so I'm demonstrating again on
another CPU as always remember that less
is more when it comes to thermal paste
then go ahead and grab the bracket that
looks like an X and place it between the
cooler and the heat pipes once it's
inside expand the bracket and make sure
that the nob on the bracket sits inside
a hole on the cooler it should easily
fall in place once it's in gently
lowered cooler and rest it on top of the
CPU try not to move it around once it's
resting on the CPU if you must align the
screws with the holes then it's fine to
move it slightly so once it's all
aligned go ahead and start screwing each
corner one at a time try to go with a
crisscross pattern and secure each one
of them once you are done tug on the
cooler a little bit to make sure it
doesn't move around now we are ready to
install the fan back on the cooler make
sure you install the fan on the side
where the RAM sticks are located for
better air flow next up we are ready to
hook up the CPU fan so grab the three
pin cable from the cooler and insert it
into the CPU fan header on the
motherboard once you do that the entire
piece is ready to be installed in the
case so grab one side of the motherboard
and gently lay it down inside the case
matching the holes on the motherboard to
the standoffs in the case also make sure
the ports are aligned with the i/o
shield on the side before you continue
now we are ready to screw in the
motherboard and as always go with a
crisscross pattern for example install
one on the top right then on the bottom
left and then on the top left and on the
bottom right and so on and so forth once
all the screws are tightened you can put
the case on its side because we're going
to install the power supply next we move
the sticker from the power supply and
put it inside the case with the fan
facing downwards go ahead and grab four
of the power supply fan screws and start
screwing them in from the back and make
sure that they are all tight before
moving on next it's time to install the
hard drive so grab four of the hard
drive screws and insert the hard drive
in any slot you want with the connection
ports facing outwards and the exposed
part facing downwards once you slide it
in make sure to align the holes before
you screw them in now there are two on
each side and
although you really only need one on
each side it's always good to secure it
with all four last part we are
installing is the GPU but first we need
to remove the top two PCIe brackets if
you're installing two GPUs you need to
remove the top four instead grabbing the
GPU from inside make sure to align the
notches on the slots with the notches on
the card before you insert it in make
sure to apply some force to snap it in
place after it's fully seated grab one
of the screws you removed from the PCIe
bracket and install it back on the
second row to secure the GPU in place
all right so if you did everything
correctly this is what your pc should
look like so far now it's the fun part
connecting the cables to the motherboard
so pay attention closely the first cable
we are connecting is the 24 pin cable
now you can route it any way you like
and hook it up to the motherboard the
slot will be located near the right edge
of the motherboard and make sure that
the white letters and the numbers are
facing towards the right make sure the
cable is completely inside and that
there are no gaps between them the hook
should be fully seated
next we are going to connect the hard
drive so grab the cable from the power
supply that looks something like this
pick any one of those three connectors
and install it in the back of the hard
drive next you have to connect the SATA
cable so grab the black SATA cable that
came with the motherboard and connect
one end with the metal clip facing up in
the back of the hard drive until it
clicks in place the other end connects
to the motherboard right under the 24
pin I connected it to the number 1 slot
but you can put it in either one of the
4 if you're installing an SSD instead or
adding an SSD then the process is
exactly the same just repeat the process
for the SSD the connections are
identical now we're going to install the
CPU cable so grab the cable that looks
like this and it should say CPU on both
the 4 pin connectors we're only going to
use one and this is really annoying to
reach so you may need to have a lot of
patience locate the 4 pin slot near the
top of the motherboard right above the
CPU cooler
yep that's basically where you have to
hook it up to now it would have been
easier to connect that first before you
install the motherboard in the case but
if you're already here then you're just
gonna have to deal with it make sure
that the clip is facing upwards and that
it's completely inside by applying lots
and lots of force now we are ready to
hook up the PCI cable to power the
graphics card so grab the cable that has
the words PCI printed on it and insert
it to the side of the GPU with the
letters facing upward
these next set of cables are connected
to the case so grab the cable that has
the words HD audio on it and locate the
same words on the motherboard it should
be located way on the left side of the
motherboard so go ahead and match the
holes of the connector with the pins on
the motherboard and slide it in next
cable you grab should say the words USB
on its o locate the words usb on the
board and do the same thing just make
sure to match the pins and slide it in
flip the case to the back and you should
find a molex connector hanging from the
back and that's for the rear fan of the
case and we need to supply power to it
so grab a male molex cable from the
power supply and connect it together if
you guys have an extra fan and want to
install it into your case just simply
screw it in wherever you want
and connect the cable from the fan into
any fan header on the motherboard they
should be labeled either jassi's fan or
power fan and any one of those will work
last but not least we need to connect
the power cable and reset button so grab
the set of cables that look like these
on the back of the 2 pin connectors you
will see a tiny triangle and that means
that it connects to the positive or plus
sign on the motherboard so keep that in
mind first up is the single positive P
LED connector doesn't matter which way
you insert this one but it does go when
the very first pin located on the top
left next up is the negative P LED and
this goes right next to the positive one
we just plugged in next up is the power
switch for the power button and the HDD
led the power switch goes into the third
slot the HDD goes directly under the P
LED switch and the reset switch goes
right next to that notice that both of
the letters are facing downwards so
that's a guys congratulations you put
together a gaming PC see there's really
nothing to it take this time to work on
your cable management since you know
where everything connects to you can
simply plug them out and route them any
way you want to clean the inside of the
PC zip ties are your friend so make sure
to use them all right now it's time to
install the software we are going to
install a fresh copy of Windows 8.1 and
you guys can upgrade to Windows 10 for
free later on so don't worry about that
if you want to use your current hard
drive or SSD and you don't need this
setup just simply plug it in like we did
in the video and you are good to go for
everyone else here's what you need to do
grab a flash drive with at least 16
gigabyte of space and plug it into your
computer then you need to download the
installation media from the Microsoft
site I did leave a link to it down below
for you once you are here click on the
great media and it will begin
downloading once it completes the
download process open up the folder and
run the program go ahead and pick your
language the Edition and architecture
everything should match with mine unless
you have a different language make sure
that you selected the windows 8.1 pro
Edition click Next and choose your USB
Drive now in case your USB isn't labeled
you can open up my computer to double
check the label mine says USB II so I
know that it's correct click on next to
move on and a prompt should appear
stating that the files will be deleted
make sure you don't have anything
important in them before you continue
click on OK to proceed now this process
should take some time to download
depending on the speed but once it's
complete it will automatically install
the operating system to the USB Drive
this can take anywhere from 15 minutes
to an hour so please be patient once
it's complete you will get this message
stating that the USB Drive is ready but
double-check that the correct files are
installed by opening up the USB Drive
you should have a setup
Exe file if you do then you are ready to
go you guys will need a Windows 8.1 CD
key to continue now you can get one on
your own or you can get it for much
cheaper using the reddit CD key swapper
but I'll go and drop a link in the
description section for that thread
right now they go for like 25 bucks
which is dirt cheap and drive many ways
to pay for it but wherever you guys pick
one up make sure to buy the 8.1 pro
Edition and not that standard since
that's the version we installed on the
flash drive once you have a CD key we
are ready to install windows on the PC
so go ahead and insert the USB Drive in
the front of the PC and go ahead and
boot it up it will detect the USB Drive
and it will take you to the setup screen
now if you boot up the PC and you get
this screen that means that the PC did
not detect your flash drive so go ahead
and hit control-alt-delete to restart
your PC and hit the Delete key
continuously until you get to the BIOS
screen once you are here navigate to the
boot menu and check out your boot
options if you only see one boot option
and it's not labeled USB then that means
your PC did not detect the USB Drive so
you may need to check your connections
on the motherboard or try a different
USB port on the PC for example leap back
once you swap ports restart the PC and
hit the Delete key once again to go back
into the BIOS then go ahead and navigate
to the boot menu once again and you
should see USB on the boot options if
that's the case the new connections are
incorrect for the front panel and make
sure that your USB connector
inserted correctly in the motherboard
exit out of BIOS and let the PC restart
again until you reach the setup menu
follow the instructions until you reach
the screen that asks for the CD key so
go ahead and enter the CD key that you
purchased here and then click Next when
you get to the screen click on custom
and select the partition you want to
install windows on if you have two of
them otherwise leave it on default if
you have only one and click on next let
windows install the files onto your PC
once it's complete you will get this
message remove the flash drive and click
on OK to restart the PC once windows
finishes the installation process you
will reach the screen and then you can
go ahead and follow the prompts and
finish filling out your info once you
reach the desktop it's time to download
the driver is now if you guys are
connecting your PC via ethernet cable
then you don't need a wireless adapter
but if you want to connect your PC via
Wi-Fi then you need to purchase this
wireless adapter this one cost only 10
bucks and I'll drop a link down below
for you just simply insert it inside the
USB port and will automatically give you
a PC internet access via Wi-Fi next you
will need to visit the ass rock website
and download the motherboard chipset
drivers and I'll go to leave a link to
it down below so you will need to
download the audio driver Intel driver
and the LAN driver
once they are downloaded make sure to
install them the next drivers for the
graphics card so click on the other link
down below and download the GeForce
experience which will keep your drivers
updated once the download is complete go
ahead and install it once you have all
your drivers installed you are finished
you have a fully functioning gaming and
productivity PC if you guys enjoyed this
video or if it was very helpful please
hit that like button and I will continue
to do these builds for all of my budget
gaming PC's each month because have any
questions drop a comment down below and
I'll get back to you as soon as possible
but thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next video
