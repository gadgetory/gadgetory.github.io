tech stores and I'm here to give you
some info on a campaign that LG is
hosting it's called the ultra white
Festival 2015
dream setup where 30 lucky individuals
will win a 34-inch ultra white curved
monitor and three out of that thirty
will receive $10,000 worth of products
towards their dreams setup so what do
you have to do to enter well it's
actually pretty simple you'll have to
take pictures or videos of your current
setup covering your entire gear once you
have your video file or pictures upload
them on one of your social media
accounts whether it's YouTube Instagram
Twitter or Facebook
step two is that you have to go to the
official website ultra white festival
calm step three is that you have to
submit your application by posting the
URL which is the website link to your
setup and then write down your ideas and
what you want your dream setup to be
please note that the application period
is from September 7th through September
25th 2015 that's all you have to do to
be a part of this amazing opportunity so
out of all the contestants 30 people
will be selected and be awarded a 34
inch ultra wide curb the monitor and out
of that 33 people will be chosen and
basically get awarded $10,000 worth of
products to create their very own dream
setup so after the three winners create
their dream set up they get to have an
offline ceremony and celebrate with the
YouTube stars so that's pretty cool but
