and this here is the viewsonic XG to 402
u sonic has not only sponsored this
video but they sent us out for me to
review and here is what I think about it
it's a 24 inch gaming monitor but you
can probably tell already from the red
accents and the XG logo is decently
spectat 1080p with a response time of 1
milliseconds and a refresh rate of 144
Hertz currently you can pick this up for
$220 and Amazon making it accessible to
people with lower budgets but let's see
what compromises viewsonic had to make
to keep the price so low and if it's
worth buying it taking a look around we
can see that the stand is mostly made
out of plastic which is expected at this
price range however it's built very
sturdy with there being very little play
when you rage and hit your desk as far
as adjustability it has a good amount of
pivot and swivel you can also tilt the
display forward and back and it has a
good amount of height adjustability so
the stand touches to the center without
any tools and it's easily removable by
pressing on this plastic piece under
here you'll find the VESA mount if you
would like to use an alternative stand
or a mounting system from the front the
monitor does look kind of plain in my
opinion there isn't any alien like
geometric legs or a logo being projected
onto the desk like you see with higher
priced monitors instead there is a
single red stripe going down the middle
of the stand which is a bit tacky also
if I'm being honest the bezels are kind
of thick on the monitor and they look to
be a little outdated compared to other
gaming monitors on the market from the
side that does have an aggressive sleek
appearance you can see the red accent
which breaks up the black and also from
here you can see the red cable
management clip the back looks pretty
cool I think it has a matte black
plastic with red accents there's also
some designs and a glossy finish on both
sides so all the ports are located on
the back here as well we got two USB 3.0
ports which can be used with the
provided pass-through cable we got a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack 2 HDMI 1.4
ports and a DisplayPort freesync is also
supported through the hdmi and
displayport switch is good news for
people that are rocking an AMD GPU
something I didn't expect on this
monitor was the headphone holder which
is a nice
touch there are also 2 2 watt speakers
but honestly if you care about sound at
all I wouldn't use these for anything
other than Windows notifications they
don't get loud at all and there is no
detail to the sound in my opinion they
just sound very tinny so I do recommend
using either some really good speakers
or a pair of headphones
unfortunately the TN panel is a lot like
the speaker's your refresh weight and
the response time on the monitor make it
great for gaming however there's one
thing that the monitor is lacking
that's contrast the scenes blend
together and there is no depth to the
image making the panel look washed out
but this is an exclusive on just this
monitor it's actually very common on
most TN panels out there being a TN
panel there's also viewing angle
restrictions even what are you looking
at the monitor straight on you'll see a
weak color consistency throughout the
panel as you can see here the top of the
display appears to be darker while the
bottom is more washed out this color
shift is more noticeable when I move the
camera around again for competitive
gaming it's great actually the specs are
on par with more expensive panels out
there but the image quality might make
it less attractive to some gamers out
there as far as ghosting there isn't
much if you use the ultra fast mode in
the OSD it's the second fastest node but
I found it to be this sweet spot
speaking about the OSD it's a little bit
clunky for my taste but it is packed
with a lot of options and control you
can set up a custom profile you can set
the monitor Hertz cap which I don't know
why you would in the first place you can
also turn on rampage X which illuminates
the red plastic on the back and change
several aspects about the image the
viewsonic XG offers reasonable color
reproduction but the contrast of this
monitor is its biggest weakness I would
say and then there's the whole thing
about the color consistency which is
common across TN panels out there
however with that said I can now
recommend this for professionals who
will use this monitor for color
sensitive work let's be realistic here
what you're really getting for only $220
is 144 Hertz refresh rate one
millisecond response time free sync on a
well-built monitor I personally think
it's reasonably priced and it's a great
gaming monitor for anyone who prefers
responsiveness over image quality but
yeah that's pretty much it for my review
I hope you guys enjoyed it I'll drop a
