tech source and in this video I'm going
to be going over five of the best gaming
keyboards that you can currently buy
under 50 bucks so without wasting any
more time let's go and start the video
so the reason why it took me a while to
upload this video is because I've been
testing each keyboard so I spent a
couple of days with each one to give my
honest opinion when it comes to gaming
and getting work done at the same time
so I'll be giving my top three picks and
my least favorite keyboard out of the
five as well at the end of the video so
starting off the list is the Logitech G
105 gaming keyboard with blue
backlighting it features six
programmable G keys which you can
configure up to 18 unique functions per
game including single key presses and
complex macros
it also features ghosting so you can
press multiple keys at the same time
without interference and it also has a
Windows disabled key which is great for
gaming as far as the build is concerned
it's made out of plastic with a matte
finish for the keys which is great sense
of won't attract finger prints and skin
oil it features custom key caps for the
WASD and directional keys which is a
pretty cool addition so the top portion
is black while the bottom half of the
keyboard is red which is weird since the
keyboard has a blue backlighting so I'm
not really sure what Logitech was
thinking when they decided to do this
here's a quick example of me typing on
the keyboard on the back it features two
rubber stands near the front of the
keyboard and extended legs which will
give you an inch raise as I mentioned
before it does feature blue backlighting
and comes with two brightness levels
however they aren't as bright as I would
have liked the room has to be pretty
dark for you to be able to see the
backlighting clearly overall this is a
very solid gaming keyboard and the fact
that it's made by Logitech means that
you can rely on the quality I just wish
it came with a wrist rest next on the
list is the eraser Deathstalker keyboard
now this is the essential Edition which
means that it doesn't come with any
backlighting so that might be a
deal-breaker for a lot of people however
you can pick up the expert version that
comes with green backlighting for only
about 15 dollars more if that is a
must-have for you so this keyboard has a
flat design I'm talking super slim it
features fully
loke cap chiclet keys and anti-ghosting
as well it also has a gaming mode which
basically disables the windows key so we
don't accidentally press it while gaming
the reason why the keys are super low is
to minimize the key press time since
it's not a mechanical keyboard all these
keyboards are plastic so I'm just going
to stop mentioning it on every single
one of these but the keys itself are
plastic as well with a matte coating and
here's a quick typing sample on the back
we have rubber stands near the front and
the sides along with two retractable
legs which will give you about an inch
of raise I also love the fact that the
Deathstalker comes with a wrist rest no
doubt razer makes one of the best gaming
keyboards and the Deathstalker is no
exception given that you don't care
about LED backlighting at number three
we have the a gol 70 keyboard
it features blue backlighting with an on
and off switch ghosting and a windows
lock key for gaming the keys have a mix
of matte and gloss finish which doesn't
attract fingerprints and it is a quick
typing demo the keyboard also comes with
a detachable wrist rest which is awesome
and gives you the flexibility to choose
whether or not to use it on the back we
have some rubber mounts on all four
corners and two legs that gives you a
good inch of adjustment the design on
the keyboard is really nice it has a
knob on the top right which gives you
quick control at adjusting the levels of
your volume it also has LED windows on
both sides which adds to the overall
look of the keyboard I just wish they
offer other colors than blue at number
four we have the red dragon kirua it
features seven backlight colours
anti-ghosting a windows lock key and
interchangeable WASD and directional
keys the design is very similar to the
Razer Deathstalker however the keys have
a rubbery feel with a matte finish this
is by far the quietest keyboard out of
the five and here's a quick demo
I love the fact that the keyboard comes
with a wrist rest and it's super quiet
for typing on the back we have rubber
stands near the front and corners and as
always you get one inch of adjustment
not only do you get seven different
colors of backlighting but you also get
four levels of brightness that you can
control on top of a pulsating effect
that cycles through all the colors with
two settings to control the speed for
only 25 bucks this keyboard is a
definite steal especially for gaming the
last keyboard on the list is actually a
bundle that comes with a mouse this is
the cooler master storm devastated
keyboard and mouse bundle it doesn't
feature anti-ghosting but I've been
playing smite and counter-strike without
any problem so you can definitely hit
multiple keys without any issues other
than that there is no windows lock key
and the keys itself have a grippy matte
coating that isn't pleasant for me to
type on at all but here's a quick demo
also the brightness control is tied to
the scroll lock button so you are forced
to activate both the scroll lock and
LEDs every time and vice versa the mouse
itself is really comfortable to use it's
a 2000 dpi mouse that has to be preset
levels that include 1000 and 1600 as
well it features two buttons on the side
for forward and back while browsing as
well as a dedicated button for adjusting
the DPI on-the-fly hey that rhymes it
also has a symmetrical design which
makes it great for both left and
right-handed users honestly for just
around 25 bucks this is the best deal
you can currently get for a keyboard and
mouse combo especially if you're on a
tight budget if you guys have an extra
$20 to spend I strongly recommend
picking up the octane version not only
do you get 19 keys of anti-ghosting and
7 backlight colors that you can choose
from but you also get a Windows disabled
key and a much cooler mouse and keyboard
combo since we're on the topic of
keyboards there is one more I do want to
mention on this list it isn't a gaming
keyboard instead it's a foldable
wireless keyboard that I've been using
for this past few months this is the EC
technology foldable keyboard that's
practically the same size as my hand
it's super thin and lightweight making
it one of the best travel keyboards that
you can currently buy it's compatible
with iOS Android Windows and practically
everything else that's Bluetooth
compatible a single charge can get you
up to 60 hours of use and there's
virtually no lag while typing on it
which is amazing
the keys are nicely spaced and offers a
very comfortable typing experience
whether you are connecting it to your TV
smart phone or even laptop you also sell
a dedicated hard case cover for it that
you guys can use as they stand for your
smartphone tablet or whatever it is that
you are connected to but you guys can
find the links to all that down below so
my top three gaming keyboards in order
are the red dragon SEO and lastly the
Logitech G 105 my least favorite is the
cooler master keyboard and mouse combo
simply because it doesn't offer a wrist
rest and the keys have a rough grippy
coating on them that isn't comfortable
for me to type on the red dragon is by
far my favorite because it has a dope
design features multiple backlighting
it's super quiet to type on and most
importantly features a comfortable wrist
rest the other two keyboards come in a
very close second so that's it for the
video if you guys enjoyed it and want me
to continue doing these top five videos
let me know by leaving a like on the
video also let me know what I should
feature for my next top 5 video by
leaving a comment down below and I'll go
too and add that to my list but that's
basically it thank you guys so much for
watching and as always I will see you in
the next video
thank God</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
