tech stores and I've been getting lots
of requests to do a video on the top
gaming monitor so here it is the top 5
gaming monitors that you can buy for
2015 that's under 150 bucks I hope you
guys enjoy as always when it comes to my
top 5 list I will be sharing my personal
favorite as well as my least favorite at
the end of the video so with that said
let's start off with number one the asus
ve 228 H and this is a 21.5 inch 1080p
LED monitor that has integrated speakers
it features five millisecond response
time with a 60 Hertz refresh rate which
is great for gaming it doesn't have the
thinnest bezels but nonetheless this is
a solid gaming monitor for only 130
bucks and if you're Prime member you get
free shipping which is always nice for
ports we have one of each a DVI VGA and
an HDMI it does come with the VESA mount
option as well which is great if you
want to mount it on your desk or even
the wall or whatever you guys mount
monitors on these days the only downside
to this monitor are the thick bezels and
that you can adjust the height there is
only a tilt option at number 2 we have
the AOC 23 inch frameless LED monitor
this bad boy has a 5 ms response time a
60 Hertz refresh rate and comes equipped
with an IPS display which means that you
get beautiful vivid colors with amazing
viewing angles then I mentioned that
it's frameless as well well technically
it does have vessels but look how thin
they are three of these bad boys will
make an awesome triple monitor setup no
doubt for ports that has a single VGA to
HDMI and your headphone and microphone
jacks unfortunately it doesn't have a
VESA mount option by default however
they do sell an adapter that you can use
to make it possible and I'll have that
link down below for you guys you can
tilt the monitor only about 2 inches
however it doesn't come with height
adjustability the only downside to this
monitor is that it doesn't come with a
VESA mount option which means that you
have to pay an extra 20 bucks per
monitor if you want it mounted other
than that slight negative this is a
beautiful monitor for both gaming and
productivity at number three we have the
Acer h23 6 HL 23 inch monitor 5 ms
response times 60 hertz refresh rate
just like the other monitors and an IPS
LCD display which is why this monitor
makes my list for the top 5 gaming
monitors it comes with a single VGA DVI
I hdmi port along with your usual audio
jacks for headphones and mic the monitor
unfortunately doesn't come with a VESA
mount but hey look more adapters
although this adapter is slightly more
expensive it's definitely an alternative
for those that must have one the display
itself is a glossy with a matte finish
so there will be some glare if you sit
by a window and have the sun shining at
your face but it shouldn't be that
distracting as far as the disability is
concerned you can only tilt it just like
every monitor on this list at number 4
we have the ace vs 228 HP quite possibly
the most popular gaming monitor that I
keep seeing on my setup wars videos this
is a 21.5 inch LED monitor with a 5 ms
response time and a refresh rate of 60
Hertz
you get a matte display which means that
there will be no glare however at the
same time the colors won't be as vibrant
as you would get from an IPS display not
to mention very bad viewing angles for
ports we have an HDMI DVI VGA and your
usual audio jacks for headphone and
microphone the Asus monitor also comes
with a VESA mount option and honestly
for this price it's no wonder that this
is very popular for gaming last but not
least we have another affordable gaming
monitor on the list coming in at just
under 100 bucks this is the Acer 21.5
inch LCD monitor it has a 5 ms response
time with usual 60 Hertz refresh rate it
does have a TN panel which means that
the viewing angles aren't that great but
if you're sitting next to a window then
this will definitely benefit you since
there will be no reflections as far as
ports we have a VGA and DVI only
unfortunately there are no HDMI nor
audio ports and since we're on the topic
of knows there is no VESA mount option
as well however as I mentioned before
there is an adapter for a CMM monitors
that you can pick up if it's a must you
can adjust the tilt angle however you
can't adjust the height just like all of
the other monitors on this list and
honestly for only 100 bucks this is
definitely a great buy if you're
especially on a budget so out of these 5
my absolute favorite monitor is the AUC
23 inch monitor without question sure
it's a bit pricey compared to the others
but you get a fantastic IPS display
built-in speakers and the thinnest
bezels you can find at any budget gaming
monitor that alone is worth spending the
extra money on at least for me it is my
least favorite goes to the a320 1.5 inch
display one of the biggest negatives for
me was the fact that it doesn't come
with an HDMI port I mean this is 2015
every monitor should come with one on
top of that it doesn't feature built-in
speakers nor does it come with any VESA
mount option which means you have to
spend more for an adapter that kind of
defeats the purpose of it being
affordable by the way I will leave links
down below to some desk mounts for those
of you that are looking to do a multiple
monitor setup also here's a quick pros
and cons list that I made to help you
guys out and if you need more time feel
free to pause the video anyways that's
it for the video and if you guys enjoyed
it and want me to continue doing these
top five videos then let me know by
leaving a like on the video also because
of any suggestions on my next top 5
video be sure to let me know in the

not that's actually where I get these
ideas from again from you guys so it's
