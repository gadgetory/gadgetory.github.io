the QA I have something really important
to tell you guys that's gonna be
affecting the channel people that don't
watch this video are gonna be really
confused on what's happening in the next
few weeks so if you guys have a few
minutes to spare please at least watch
this portion of the video before you
skip to the Q&amp;amp;A I'm gonna try and make
this as fast as possible so when I
started making YouTube videos back in
2012 I was working with the unlocking
company
you guys probably remember that I was
doing a bunch of unlocking tutorials for
smartphones and if it wasn't for them I
wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't
for the alarm company tech source
wouldn't be what it is today I was able
to because of them I was able to quit my
job and also get an office and produce a
lot of content and because of that the
channel blew up so honestly I owe
everything to be locking company so
about a month ago I got an email from
YouTube saying that they took down one
of my locking videos because it violated
the Community Guidelines and then I got
a strike on the channel I freaked out I
got paranoid and of course what did i do
I went and deleted every single locking
videos because I thought maybe they're
gonna take down the other videos and if
I got two more strikes this channel is
pretty much gone and I'm done I'm done
making videos and there goes my entire
life that goes my career so me being
impulsive instead of making those videos
private I went ahead and deleted them
just to be on the safe side
so obviously that made some people upset
I believed it over a hundred unlocking
videos that was already paid for that
was supposed to stay up on the channel
indefinitely
apparently that strike was only for that
specific type of the video but how was I
to know you know I was just looking at
for myself and the channel so I thought
they were gonna go after the other
unlocking video so I panicked and I
deleted so I want to make things right
with the unlocking company so I agreed
to upload 25 of those hundreds of videos
I think was like 200 videos or something
so I'm gonna upload five videos every
Sunday night for the next five weeks so
if you guys see videos like that pop up
on your sub box every Sunday night don't
freak out my channels not hacked it's
only temporary and it's gonna be like
that for the next five weeks only I know
people don't like their sub box being
spammed especially this content they
don't enjoy so that's why I'm letting
you guys know
in advance but if you guys do see those
videos and you want to help support the
channel feel free to drop by leave a
simple like or a comment whatever you
guys do will be greatly appreciated of
course you guys don't have to watch any
of it you can skip all five of the
videos every Sunday night and just wait
for the regular content from my channel
but anyways that's all I wanted to say
I'm thing guys so much for understanding
now let's get into some questions what's
your opinion about Apple's cheesegrater
Mac Pro is it good and as it worth it
obviously if you're asking this question
it's probably not made for you these
products are made for professionals who
take advantage of the software and the
hardware inside of these so I'm not
gonna sit here and say that these
products are overpriced or if it's worth
it in my opinion it's worth it to
whoever thinks it's worth it what's the
biggest mistake you've made while
building a PC the biggest and probably
the dumbest mistake I've done was while
I was building titanium the black and
green Christmas themed PC I don't know
when it was I forgot to peel off the the
paper or the plastic sleeve underneath
the CPU cooler and I installed it like
that and I was wondering why the temps
were so high and I almost fried my CPU
so that was um that was fun that was fun
one of the next building with a
subscriber episode coming out are you
continuing the series or not I've
actually filmed episode 3 I think two
months ago or something but I didn't
upload the video because I wasn't happy
with the quality I was only using a
single camera so I only had one angle
and I thought I was gonna be very boring
for you guys so that's why I scratched
the video but at least I spent the whole
day helping a fan build a PC which
didn't work the GPU was defective but it
looked pretty cool was the next ultimate
setup video coming out hopefully in July
I've already announced that I'm doing an
all-white gaming setup with an all-white
gaming PC it's gonna be sick
stick around Sean asks are you gonna
revive a memorable setup backdrop that
you've been known for
are you happy hosting between
it's about time somebody noticed that
yes it was inspired by Zach gallon a
fact if a gallon effect galliston Galef
and Sackett I'm definitely not going
back to the acoustic foams I personally
think that's just very dull and boring
it's just black and red acoustic foams
in the back it's there's no there's no
lighting and doesn't look cool so that's
why I decided to go with between two
ferns and some RGB lighting because it's
2019 when did you start building
computers my first PC I ever built was
senior year of high school 2005 and ever
since yeah Here I am in the video you
said that you switched to Adobe Premiere
was it true yes it was true I was
actually trying desperately to learn
Adobe Premiere for three weeks straight
and then I gave up because what games
have you spent the most time playing
honestly guys I've been chucked apex
legend so many times that it got me
addicted to the game so that's the only
game I play now if I have any extra time
add me on Origin if you guys want to
play with a new what's your favorite PC
you've built ever that's an easy one the
PC I just built for myself big red
version 3 when is the next subscriber
setup remodel I'm guessing you're
talking about setup makeover and I'll
just announce it now get it over with
the first country I'm visiting for setup
makeover is gonna be in Armenia that is
my home country and I don't know if I'm
gonna do that later this year or early
next year but that is 100% happening but
in the meantime I do want to put up one
more episode this year hopefully before
Christmas somewhere in LA maybe like two
hours radius in LA I'll be making a
video taking submissions hopefully in
the next few months so stick around
why don't you do reviews I don't know
how long you've been subscribed to the
channel but that's kind of how texts are
started by doing reviews so my last
review was actually last week it was on
an Avon gaming laptop so it may not be
as frequent but I still do reviews you
just have to watch it sérgio asks are
you married our baby's something that
may be coming soon not sure on the
baby's part but yes I am married and
it's surprising a lot of people don't
know that even though I wear a ring in
most of the videos but yeah instead of
just talking about it I'm gonna let
or introduce yourself to you guys and
look at the lens
your name is Suroosh where are you from
we're in Armenia oh how long have we
been married eight months since
September of 2018
yeah so kind of new at this but yeah
here she is
in the flesh you can go now how do you
deal with situations of slow channel
growth and producing high effort content
that gets lackluster viewing performance
results that's a good question do you
think we will live to see an eventual
robot takeover happen I definitely don't
think we will live to see that happen
but I don't doubt that it will happen in
the future I don't know when but I'm
pretty sure it will happen eventually in
terms of high effort content that gets
lackluster viewing performance results
believe me I've been there multiple
times and it's very this motivating is
that even a word it definitely gets you
upset and it doesn't motivate you enough
to continue doing it for example my last
set of makeover season didn't crack a
million views and I spent five or six
months planning and shooting the video
and editing and it took a lot of time to
make that happen and then I see other
videos on YouTube for example a simple
PC give away to a relative you know and
all the parts are paid for by sponsor
and that video would be like a million
views within a few months so it's kind
of like that didn't take as much effort
as the set up make over you know flying
over someone's house and completely
rebuilding their setup so yeah it's kind
of disappointing to see that but you
can't let that get to you just pretty
much focus on you and continue making
content that you love and that your
viewers love watching I pretty much made
a habit to not care about views anymore
or how many subscribers you have I'm
just going to continue making content
that I have a passion for and that's
what's the brands name of the t-shirt
and the pant in this photo the pant is
from gas actually everything is from
guests the t-shirt the pants and even
the shoes as a bizarre question to ask
me a very random question to ask me I
don't know if guess still makes that
t-shirt but check it out on the website
plans on ma tu model X anytime soon
absolutely not
I love Elsa the way she is I am not
touching any part of her body can you do
a potato build guide I've actually
haven't done one in a while but I'm
waiting for the new rising ships to
arrive before I do some budget build so
stick around how come you've been late
in reviewing our TX cards and all the
AIB model cards you did it back then
when GTX series was out and what reveal
at e3 has got you most extent for like I
said III was kind of a letdown for me
but the game I'm excited about is
cyberpunk mostly because Keanu Reeves in
it and I don't review GPUs any more on
the channel because it's not interesting
to me anymore I find it very very
tedious and boring and plus there's a
lot of channels out there that do it way
better for me I'd rather use the GPUs
and a build and then show you guys the
actual gaming performance so yeah what
are your thoughts about eks new lineup
of fully wood design I saw that I did
I'm not a fan of would I get wood in the
mornings but I'm not a fan of wood
blocks how do you feel knowing you're
inspiring others like me to get into
tech it's always an awesome feeling to
read stuff like this or even meet fans
in real life telling me that they're
inspired to build a PC or start a
channel or even just tech in general and
inspiration is everywhere
you know I when I was young when I
started a channel I was inspired by big
techie tubers and honestly I feel like
it's an endless cycle you know you get
inspired by others you make content and
then you inspire others so that's
awesome favorite piece of tech you have
right now that is hands-down have to be
the oculus rift s that is the new view
are from oculus I've been playing that
thing constantly every single day and I
made an embossing video once they proved
the video I can launch it to you guys
next week but favorite piece of tech
hands-down and you'll see why are you
excited for Rison and any
plan builds app so freakin lutely as
soon as I get my hands on a third
generation rice and chips I'm going to
be doing a lot of builds some budget
ones some mid-range and of course some
high-end builds coming up so very
excited and the last question is when
you were a child what was your dream
other than owning a Lambo which I feel
like was everyone's dream when they were
a child my dream was to find a job or
have a job that I have a passion for
that I love going into that makes me
happy that doesn't make me wake up every
single day saying I hate my job
that was my main dream up until my early
20s and now I can safely say that I'm
living that dream for anybody out there
who hates their current job or hates
going to school or just doesn't happy
with their current life if you're not
happy where you are right now life I
have one very corny but very true advice
to give you and that is things will get
better but here's the kicker you got to
do something about it
you got to go out there you got to put
in the time and effort just like
everybody else
you can't just sit on the couch and have
your dream job just fall right on your
lap right it doesn't work that way it
may take some time I'm not gonna lie it
may take a very long time but at least
you're fighting for something that you
believe in
don't settle for what you have right now
life if that's not what you want for the
rest of your life it literally just made
that up I'm putting that as my Instagram
headliner
don't settle for what you have right now
if that's not what you want for the rest
of your life anyways that's it for me
thank you guys so much for watching as
always I will see you guys in the next
one
I was gonna let her introduce herself
she has
I'm just gonna let her introduce herself
to you guys okay what else
introduce yourself what is your name
well you're looking at me look at the
camera we're in I mean you don't look at
me look at the lens how long have you
been here in the States
