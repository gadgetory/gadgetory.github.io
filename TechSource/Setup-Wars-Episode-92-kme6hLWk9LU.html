the episode if you're watching this on
YouTube episode 93 of setup Wars is
already uploaded on the nice app and a
link to that is down below as well let's
begin the show starting up the show we
got a pretty clean set up from Justin
that features two Asus 27-inch monitors
and a 43 inch high sense 4k TV up top
he's also rocking a Corsair strafe RGB
keyboard m65 Pro Mouse and a pair of
audio engine 85 plus speakers although
he does have a logitech g930 gaming
headset as well so all of that is one
set up and then we got another one
adjacent to this where he is using two
more 27-inch Asus monitors and a
wireless keyboard and mouse that's
hooked up to a laptop while his main
setup is being powered by an asus strix
1080 and a 6700 K by the way SiC custom
back plates and fan grills from the guys
at v1 tech huge fan of their work
there's only one share here so I'm
assuming that both of these setups are
his but the question is why cable
management Daniel look at that beauty
wonderfully wrapped together using cable
sleeves then rather through some sort of
a metal waste way music to my ears and
incredibly clean setup I mean this dudes
carpet looks like it's just been washed
seriously an amazing setup Thank You
Justin for starting off this episode
strong may the force be with you
speaking of clean setups take a look at
this one from Christian
we got three 24-inch philips monitors so
steps to wall-e
and below them we got the CM storm
quickfire ultimate keyboard and in
logitech g502 mouse i love how he routed
the keyboard wire around the base of the
monitor stand is trying to be all slick
ICU for audio he's using the logitech
g502 speakers but he also has the
SteelSeries Siberia v3 headset as well
which is hanging underneath the desk
when not in use and while we're down
here let's take a look at the cable
management it's not the best but at
least all the wires are off the ground
and on the ICS Signum rack I was
probably tidy up the cables behind the
PC as well and is that
let a food menu tape to the side of your
case so yeah the PC is running on a 46
70 K and a GTX 770 I don't know where
you got that poster from but I like it
videogames don't make me want to kill
people real life makes me want to kill
people in video games
nice what can I say you put it up set up
with some personality Thank You
Christian for entering Maron is up next
with a nature themed set up he's being a
34-inch dell ultra wide Corsair
Vengeance k70 keyboard and an m65 trail
mouse but an interesting cable
management sleeve that i've never seen
before
also on the desk you got a pair of
logitech speakers and Sennheiser
urbanite XL headphones resting on some
mannequins head the two plants combined
with the LEDs and wallpaper really give
off a nature vibes and I like that I
don't think I've seen a nature themed
set up since Val from episode 13 and
that was a very long time ago there's
also a laptop on the table and his phone
stand that it looks like all the cables
are neatly tucked underneath the desk he
even has a custom-made clear box of some
sort that he is using to keep some
cables and very clever a pretty
straightforward setup thank you Maron
for entering and number four we have
spiked and a very badass setup indeed I
just love how the LEDs in the background
blend in with the wallpaper speaking of
the background those red dots are places
that he visited before which i think is
an awesome integration to his wallpaper
even before we take a look at the gear
let's drool over his badass PC that he
built inside the Aero cool Strike X air
which essentially is a testbed so this
thing is rocking a 4770k and an msi gtx
980ti
in a custom loop very very badass i so
back to the setup using a 34 inch dell
ultra wide that's in between two more 19
and still monitors now i'm not sure if
they are just for decoration or he's
actually using them since they are
pretty spread out he's also using the
corsair k70 keyboard and another m65
mouse Jesus I think that's like the
third one in this episode also the desk
we have is focus right audio interface
which he uses with his Sennheiser HD 550
headphone and the audio technica at2020
microphone with also for audio he has a
set of Edifier are 27s on both edges of
the dead
I can't really see any cables in the
shot since everything is tucked away
behind the backboard and you also
managed to hide quite a few things
behind the monitor itself if you look at
the opposite side of the setup we can
see a massive 60-inch Samsung TV that's
hooked up to the wall along with the
onkyo 5.1 speaker right below that and a
fully-stocked mini-fridge nearby if you
look closely you can see is ps4 right on
top which is what I'm assuming the TV is
used for also I don't know if it's me
but this guy looks like he's living in a
skyscraper or something just look at
that view
Wow an excellent setup and an even
better gaming room thank you spike for
entering last at least we got tins dual
display setup white and black with some
pink accents is what we're looking at
here folks
tin is using 2 23 inch asu's monitors
that's so step to the wall amount and
below that we got the corsair k70 RGB
lux with white pbbt caps and holy
another m65 mouse what the hell is going
on that Mouse isn't even that great is
it I mean I don't know I've never been a
fan of the mouse it looks like he's also
using the cursor Polaris RGB mouse pad
and a blue Yeti microphone for audio
we've got a few options because they're
void wireless RGB headset and the HyperX
cloud twos there's also a JBL bluetooth
speaker under both of the monitors he
does have a MacBook Air but the PC
that's actually powering this setup is
inside the Sensex evolved ATX case
that's equipped with the 6700 K and an
asus strix 1070 and finally the cable
management nicely done hiding it behind
the desk and wrapping the power strip
against one of the legs a very clean and
impressive setup no doubt thank you 10
