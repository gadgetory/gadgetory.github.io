intro anymore I feel like I'm just
talking to myself at the beginning of
every episode I feel like most of you
guys just skip straight to the setups
but yeah let me know if you guys always
sit through the intro because I feel
like it's always the same intro every
single time so I guess it would make
sense to skip it but anyways welcome to
setup or its episode 1 I forgot the
number already crap episode 168 where
you submit your desks I have to get
featured on the channel if you guys want
to participate make sure watch the video
link down below but with that said
welcome to my god messing up already
let the setup wars begin don't pay full
price for cd-keys guys you can pick up a
Windows 10 key for just $15 using your
CD keys calm and if you use my code TSS
2 you will get an extra 10% off click
the link below to learn more kicking off
the episode is Alex from Romania and a
fairly minimalistic setup featuring
three curved monitors that are mounted
on the custom-made desk that he made
himself
now right off the bat I would try and
cover up the side of the desk that has
the wood exposed
now since the desk is mostly black I
would use electrical tape or a black
vinyl wrap that you can find on Amazon
some things on the desk are his HyperX
alloy keyboard with cherry red switches
we also got the HyperX pulsefire FPS
mouse and his audio mixer speaking of
audio he's got some cheap Chinese
speakers however he does use his
headphones mostly which are hanging
underneath his desk no cables in sight
thanks to the backboard and the rest of
the cables are managed nicely behind the
monitor mount although I would try and
secure that power brick somehow in case
it falls down I also love that he
mounted the boom arm on the actual
monitor mount instead of the desk doing
it this way allows you to extend the arm
further to get that perfect angle and
plus it looks much cleaner this way the
PC powering the setup is far too big to
fit on the desk so we did keep it on the
ground and it's got the rising 7 2,700 x
with a gtx 1060 from
no.3 d if there is another
recommendation I would give for this
setup it has to do with the wall art I
feel like the two helmets and the red
acoustic foams don't really contribute
to the setup in any
I mean the helmets are fine but maybe
change up the acoustic films by adding
another color for contrast or maybe
adding a few more and create a cool
design with them it's still a pretty
good setup but it needs some minor
tweaks thank you Alex for entering now
here's a clean set up by Chris from
California it's so aesthetically
pleasing and his purpose is for gaming
productivity and watching YouTube videos
so we got a 32 inch 4k monitor mounted
on the wall along with his Nintendo
switch I absolutely love the way he
routed the cables from the monitor
banana leaf panels and the switch using
black raceways and he kept it nice and
symmetrical as well all the cables run
down the wall onto the rack that he
installed underneath the desk he even
drilled a hole for the keyboard and
mouse Bravo on the left of the setup we
have a caddy with wheels and he's taken
advantage of all the extra space to
store his controllers and switch games
up top we got the PC which is equipped
with the horizon 5 2606 core processor
and we got the GTX 1060 I do appreciate
the attention to detail that Chris has
put into the setup as well as sticking
with the white and black color scheme
over there in the right corner as a pick
aid that he built using the Raspberry Pi
and it's being held up by a wall mount
which is pretty cool although it's in an
interesting location I don't see how
that gaming chair would fit in that
corner or how it can be comfortable
gaming there but regardless this is a
super clean setup thank you Chris for
sharing it with us holy guacamole check
this insane setup by Ian from Canada a
sick white and red themed gaming setup
be churning ultra wide and a 4k 50-inch
TV up top for watching movies the desk
he's using is the popular Mickey desk
with a corner add-on which works
perfectly with the setup since he has
the extra space to support his PC he's
got a nice set of peripherals also looks
like he's sticking with Asus he's got
the Claymore with the e element pbt
silver metal key caps Andy Fujio or
Puccio I don't know how you say that
Mouse which is his main Mouse for gaming
however he does have an asus path that
he uses with his laptop or when he needs
to go wireless
varada he's got a pair of bookshelf
speakers and the asus strix wireless
headset now personally I would have gone
with the Kanto yu6
to better match the color scheme and
there are really nice pair of speakers
I've actually used the whyyou Phibes for
a solid year back then when I built a
cell setup and I was a fan of the sound
quality cables are managed beautifully
the wires from the displays are routed
through a wall Raceway and into the
built-in rack underneath the desk but
even and just dump them in there you
actually spent some time organizing it
using 3m tape a Velcro zip ties and some
cable sleeves I couldn't be more proud
and finally we got the massive semi
water-cooled PC on the right side this
beast has the 8700 k with 16 gigs that
be tried in Zr GB RAM sticks and nice
tricks GTX 1080 I mean of course that I
VDACS right everything is practically
Asus in this setup it also looks like he
synced all the RGB lighting together
with his music which is pretty badass
I'm a fan what can I say I may be a
little biased because of the color
scheme but it's a hell of a setup
presentation is awesome organization and
cable management is on point and it just
screams personality I love it awesome
setup Thank You Ian for blessing our
eyeballs with this masterpiece coming in
at number four is Ludwig van Beethoven
and quite possibly the first set up I've
seen on the show to have a PC mounted on
a desk
sideways fascinating so the desk is
custom built by himself with a glass top
and there's an actual cutout where you
can see inside the PC which is pretty
clever until I figured out that there is
no easy way of getting inside the PC I
mean what if you need to upgrade or
replace parts it just seems very
inconvenient doing it this way I mean
you had plenty of space on the right
side of your desk for the PC but I
digress
so we have a TV mounted on the wall with
a 22 inch monitor underneath that with a
leash keyboard and a trust gaming mouse
I mean what kind of keyboard company
calls themselves Lesch seriously he did
mount a boom arm holding his newer
microphone and a pair of Beats solo
headphones hanging from it and we also
have a wall mounted ps4 with some custom
skins cable management could be better
if he grouped up all the cables together
and a cable box to hide the power snip
underneath the desk an interesting setup
to say the least with some questionable
choices either way Thank You Ludwig for
entering grabbing up the episode with
his Vince and a super compact
blacked-out setup that he was just from
gaming photo and video editing and
screaming the desk is so small yeah he's
able to fit his giant PC on there along
with two monitors the determination is
definitely there so basically what he
did to get that extra space was he added
a Lindman tabletop on top of his already
tiny Walmart desk and he used a
refrigerator and a couple cubes as
support I mean that's one way to Mickey
Mouse said instead of buying a new desk
I do like that he used a monitor riser
to make space underneath it to store his
speaker and a macbook pro while the
other monitor is mounted to the desk
he's using the courser k95 RGB Platinum
keyboard with the g502 proteus mouse and
a few headsets which are hanging
underneath the pullout drawer and of
course we can't forget about the
elephant in the room and all black PC
build inside the Cougar Panzer evo RGB
case I love the carbon-fiber accents
around the case and even the RGB fans
have them which looks pretty damn cool
also extra points for that black suit
Superman and can we please take a moment
to appreciate this cable management
behind the PC wow I can seriously stare
at this all day I don't know if I
approve the jerry-rigged desk setup but
hey if it works it works I mean Who am I
to say otherwise it's nice to see a
blacked-out setup on the show Thank You
Vince for entering and that does it for
this episode I've set up Ward's as
always make sure you guys boat in the
comment section down below on who has
the best desk set up and announce the
winners on my Instagram account

always I love your cheekbones and I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
