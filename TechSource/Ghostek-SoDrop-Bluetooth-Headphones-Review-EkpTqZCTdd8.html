and in this video I'm going to be
checking out one of my personal favorite
Bluetooth headphones that I've been
using these past few weeks this is the
ghost tech so dropped wireless
headphones a pair of really high quality
Bluetooth headphones with a built-in mic
on a full charge it will get you up to
14 hours of talktime 540 hours of
standby and 14 hours of music
playtime it features a PTX audio
technology and can actually connect up
to two phone devices at the same time
which is pretty interesting these
headphones are actually part of my desk
setup and in case you guys missed the
video I'll go ahead and leave a link to
it down below so the box has a magnetic
flap it's really similar to the beats
box but moving on and opening it up we
are greeted by the hardcase cover and
opening that up we can find the
headphones folded neatly inside there's
also a user manual a 3.5 millimeter
audio and micro USB cable to charge the
headset the case has a solid hard cover
which will definitely protect the
headphones but I do want to mention
something else that I noticed so the net
here also has a piece of velcro attached
which ensures that the cables inside
won't get loose and roll around it's the
little things like this that really make
a difference to me the headphones itself
are made with very lightweight brushed
aluminum materials and extremely soft
leather on the bottom you will find the
micro USB port built-in mic and the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack in case you
want to plug your phone in and on the
right ear cup you'll find the power
button and volume controls the headset
is really easy to adjust due to the
aluminum sliders and it's extremely
flexible the cushions are also really
comfortable for both the ear cups and
the headband now because it's extremely
light I can barely feel it on my head
and comparing them to the 80 hm 50 X's I
would say that these are way more
comfortable and that I can wear these
much longer now because of the strange
rectangular ear cup design these won't
go around your ear and instead sit
gently on them so don't expect any noise
isolation I also find that the noise
leak to be extremely more noticeable
than other Bluetooth headphones once you
put them on and bump the volume pad 75%
so if you're planning on listening to
some dubstep in the library you might
want to reconsider sound-wise I was
pretty impressed
so the headphones used this aptX
Bluetooth 4.0 technology that's supposed
to provide rich high def crystal-clear
sound with an amazing bass and it does
just that you get clear highs deep lows
and good mids overall this is a very
solid pair of headphones it's
lightweight foldable and comfortable to
wear making it perfect for hitting the
gym running or just chilling at your
home listening to music or watching
videos my only concerns with these
headphones are the noise isolation and
sound leaks I would also have loved to
see different color options and set up
the silver I mean I do use them everyday
and I don't regret buying them but I'll
go ahead and drop a link down below for
anyone that is interested if you guys
enjoy the video feel free to hit that
like button and if there's a specific
pair of headphones you want to see
covered next let me know by leaving a
comment down below thanks again so much
for watching and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
