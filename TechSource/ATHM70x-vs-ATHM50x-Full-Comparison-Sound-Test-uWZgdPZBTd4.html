this video I will be doing a hands-on
comparison between the audio technica
m70x and the m50x as well as a sound
test at the end of the video so you can
hear a difference between both
headphones so if you're deciding to pick
one of these up you're in the right
place
so the m50x is priced at 155 whereas the
m70x is priced at 300 by the way I will
leave links to both headphones in the
description section if you guys want to
check them out so before we get into the
good stuff let's take a quick look at
the packaging of both headphones so on
the outside both boxes are identical
taking a look inside is where you will
see the difference both at phones come
with three separate cables a single 1.2
meter straight cable and 2 3 meter
cables with one of them being coiled and
they also both come with a 6.3
millimeter steel your plug adapter now
the difference is that the m50x comes
with a bag whereas the m70x comes with
an actual hardcover case I mean this
comes down to personal preference really
the carrying bag is perfect for people
that want something quick and portable
to carry around that doesn't take up
much space the hardcover carrying case
however offers more protection but also
takes up more space in terms of build
quality I'm actually disappointed that
the m70x isn't made out of premium
materials like the m50x was instead you
get hardened plastic with a matte finish
instead of a glossy plastic I mean the
attention to detail is definitely there
on both headphones but I feel like the
m70x is lacking overall in the premium
department especially for that price tag
even the slider section is pure plastic
on the m70x at least on the m50x there
is some aluminum flexibility is also
majorly lacking on the m70x s these are
by far the stiffest headphones that I
have ever used
the ear cups only rotates slightly above
90 degrees and not only do the ear cups
on the m50x rotate 180 degrees but they
also flip completely to the back on the
m70x is not so much the hinges also fold
on the m50x is hence the reason it comes
with a carrying bag but on the m70x
there is no folding you guys get what
I'm trying to say right the m70x just
isn't as flexible as the m50x
and that's fine honestly I doubt
anyone's head is shaped like a strange
polygon so even with the limited
flexibility he can still be comfortable
wearing these speaking of flexibility
both headbands actually stretch pretty
far so it will accommodate the biggest
of heads out there so if you have one of
those giant heads a key
talking about in my videos then hit that
like button there is nothing to be
ashamed about
so audio-technica decided to ditch the
white headband and go with a slimmer one
with an embedded logo instead also the
cushions on the headband don't reach all
the way down to the hinges like they do
on the m50x which is fine since the
sides of the headphones don't really
touch your head anyways now the cushions
are very soft Audio Technica does these
very well and you can always expect the
comfort level to be there when
purchasing Audio Technica headphones
these also do a very good job isolating
outside noise if you set the volume to
at least 50% the outside world becomes
mute sound wise the m50x has very rich
deep lows with balanced mids and
detailed highs they also have noticeably
more bass than the m70x --is if you
enjoy watching movies listening to music
or playing games like me then the m50
x's are definitely for you the m70x has
a flat natural sound and they provide
more clarity so you can hear the notes
at its purest so if you're mixing music
then I can recommend these to you so
what all that said here is the sound
test between both of the headphones
recorded under the same controlled
environment the purpose of this test is
to hear the difference between both
headphones since you can actually tell
the sound quality of each in this video
as the song goes
you
all right so I'm sure you guys heard the
difference in bass and clarity between
the two but my honest conclusion if you
have the em 50s or even the m50 X's
don't waste your money what you have now
is just fine if you're an audiophile or
mix music I think the $300 price tag is
fair for what you are getting a high-end
popular brand studio monitoring
headphones it's as simple as that
otherwise don't make the jump save your
money and buy a ps4 or even the m50 X's
if you don't own one yet as I said
before I have them both linked in the
description section down below if you
want to check them out I also want to
hear your opinions do you guys agree
with everything I said let me know
what's in your brain by dropping a
comment down below once again thanks so
much for watching this is that from tech
source and I'll see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
