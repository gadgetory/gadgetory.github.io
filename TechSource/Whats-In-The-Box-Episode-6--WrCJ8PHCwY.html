welcome to a special episode of what's
in the box as you can see there's only
one box on the table a massive box I
should say on the table from
ibuypower now unless they started
recently making toasters or ovens I'm
pretty sure there's a PC inside here now
I don't know what PC they're sending me
and I don't know the specs so without
wasting any more time I'm very excited
let's go ahead and tear this bad boy
open I just realized this upside down
lots of foam in this box oh my god oh my
god no way no am I gonna get this out of
here
are you guys ready to see this so it
looks like they sent me their element
guys oh my god this is basically a
modded s340 case and with a black and
red theme so I'm so freakin excited to
see what kind of parts are in here I
held my life go alright so we got a bag
from EVGA a packet of accessories
manuals and some cables I swear this is
like Christmas morning to me tempered
glass side panel guys this is very very
impressive it's actually way better
looking case than the actual last 340 oh
it's even got glass in the front holy
crap moment of truth let's check out the
part inside
all holy grab is that a super clock guy
so this is the EVGA GTX 1080 super clock
card holy crap I'm so relieved that it's
not the founders edition because the
green text on the logo definitely would
not go with this build and I'm so
frickin ecstatic that they went with a
black and red build looks like they know
me very well I wonder if I can see the
specs somewhere oh I get a 950 pro SSD
holy crap I didn't notice that well I
can't find the specs but I'll do some
digging around and I will list the specs
down below in case you guys are
interested but from what I can see it
looks like I have an MSI motherboard an
EVGA GTX 1080 super clock graphics card
and I'm dots to samsung 950 SSD some
Ripjaws Ram I think it's 16 gigs and for
the motherboard we have an msi x99s li+
so a very good-looking black and red
build so yeah I'm very excited to test
this baby out there will be a video on
this in a few weeks so make sure you
guys stick around for that huge things
to iBUYPOWER
for setting these out as well as EVGA
for sending out the GTX 1080 as well as
their power supply you guys Rock um I
think that's pretty much it let me know
what you get actually you know what
let me boot this thing up for you guys
oh they're custom LEDs in the bottom I
did not even notice that that is sick
well there you have it guys let me put
the glass side panel back on well there

is but let me know if you guys think
