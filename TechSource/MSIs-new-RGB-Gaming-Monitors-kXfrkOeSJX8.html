possible by deep cool and MSI right now
there's an awesome giveaway on the new
msi optics curved gaming monitor and all
you have to do to enter is drop a like
and leave a comment down below on what
you enjoyed about today's video you can
increase your chances of winning by
leaving a like and comment on every
single CES video throughout this week on
tech source msi has expanded their
monitor line up with their new mpg
curved gaming monitors the new optics
mpg series will consist of 227 inch
displays the 27 C and the 27 C q both
models will feature 844 Hertz refresh
rate and a 1 millisecond response time
the C Q which is their higher-end model
will have a 1440p resolution and the 27
C will happy 1080p screen the mpg series
are also the first gaming monitors with
SteelSeries game sense built in you can
basically sing up the lights from
SteelSeries keyboards and mouse with the
RGB lights on the monitor and you can do
all this easily within their app using
the five RGB zones on the front of the
monitor gamers can easily program
lighting effects within the app to
notify them of in-game timers or
cooldowns you can even receive discord
notifications or other important
information at a glance for example one
of the games is compatible with is csgo
within the game sense application I was
able to set the first two zones as the
health bar and one of the lights as the
ammo so when you start shooting the
light will reflect how much ammo is left
in your gun you can even set counters to
keep track of kills or headshots for
example and at first glance honestly I
thought this was a really cool feature
but the more I played with it the more I
felt like it was a gimmick I would think
that the lights under the monitor would
be a distraction in competitive games
especially csgo
I would assume competitive gamers would
be paying attention to the in-game hub
more rather than glancing down at the
bottom of the monitors now this isn't to
say it's pointless to have I'm sure
there are other games more on the casual
side that this can be utilized more the
monitors do have RGB lighting on the
back as well and I'm assuming it's for
giving off a glow effect in the night
kind of like RGB strips but it's
actually built in the
as far as specs both models will feature
anti-glare VA panels with 115 percent
srgb spectrum coverage and they will
have two HDMI 2.0 ports a single 1.2
display port and a USB type B with two
USB type a ports if you guys want to
check out the monitors I'll drop a link
down below but that pretty much wraps up
the video and my CES coverage for 2018
thing guys so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
