finally got my hands on Intel's newest
and most powerful desktop CPU the i7 69
50 x10 core processor this thing is not
cheap retailing for around 1,700 bucks
it will seriously dent your wallet so I
ran some benchmarks on it and for
comparison reasons I ran the same batch
marks on the 59 30k using the same test
bed which has an Asus x99 gigabytes of
RAM from g.skill and EVGA gtx 1080
founders edition and a dark rock pro 3
CPU cooler unfortunately I didn't have a
59 60 X on hand to use for the
comparison so I will be using an
overclocked 59 30 K instead I managed to
get it to 4.6 at one point 3 9 volts but
it was hitting temps of 94 degrees
Celsius on full load which is
dangerously hot so I bumped it back down
to 4.5 at 1.3 volts the 69 50 X on the
other hand was tested on stock frequency
and 4.2 gigahertz so Before we jump into
the benchmarks let's take a quick look
at these specs so the 69 50 X is a 10
Core 20 thread processor with a base
clock of 3.0 running with a TDP of 140
watts as do the rest of the new lineup
of Intel's Broadwell ECP use you also
get a massive 25 megabyte catch and 40
lanes of PCI 3.0 from the 68 50k and
above whereas you only get 20 lanes on a
6800 K for temps the 69 50 X stayed
fairly cool during idle at 32 degrees
Celsius and still managed to stay cool
even when overclocked compared to the 59
30k which hovered around 44 degrees and
finally during full load both of the
overclocked CPUs got to 78 degrees
whereas the stock 69 50 X stuck to the
low 60s
so overall the 69 50 X runs at much
lower temps the first benchmark test I
ran was Cinebench r15 and we can see
that there was almost a 25 percent boost
between the stock and overclocked 69 50
X comparing it to the 59 30k there was a
40% increase in CPU score and only a 5
percent increase for fps moving the geek
bench we can see a 15% boost and
multi-threaded performance between stock
and overclocked 69 50
sex and a 35% increase from the 59 30 K
but when we look at single core
performance the 59 30 K outshines V 69
50 X as expected since it does have a
higher clock per core now let's take a
look at some rendering tests so first up
we have Sony Vegas Pro 13 which is an
editing software that I use to edit my
own videos and for the test I actually
rendered out a 60 second raw 4k file
that I shot using my gh4 for short
renders there was only a marginal
difference between the stock 69 50 X and
the overclocked however it was twice as
fast compared to the 59 30 K exporting
the video in a minute and 26 seconds
versus almost three minutes then I used
a more CPU intensive program called
blender which is very similar to AutoCAD
3ds and Maya that's used for 3d modeling
rendering a simple frame of the
animation took 17 minutes and 55 seconds
on the stock 69 50 X and 25 minutes on
the 59 30 K you can definitely see that
CPUs with better multi-core performance
tend to do better similar results were
found on the second templates that I
rendered with the overclocked 69 50x
finishing up in just over 7 minutes
compared to almost 11 from the 59 30 K
and finally let's take a look at some
benchmarks from GTA 5 which is a CPU
intensive game we can clearly see that
there was only a 5 percent performance
increase from the 59 30 K and the
overclocked 69 50 X in 1080p and the
difference becomes miniscule as we bump
up the resolution
so in conclusion should you buy the CPU
for gaming the answer is no even in CPU
intensive games you're only getting a 5%
increase in fps and that's if you're
playing in 1080p high resolutions will
get you nothing more however if you're
swimming in a lot of money and also do a
lot of 3d modeling and editing then I
would say why not but to the average
enthusiast and gamer the CPU just isn't
worth it I mean after all the CPU wasn't
created for gamers but more for on the
productivity side that's basically for
the video I hope you guys enjoyed it or
if this was helpful make sure to leave a
like to show your support and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
