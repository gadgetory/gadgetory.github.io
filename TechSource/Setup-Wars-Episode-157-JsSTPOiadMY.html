welcome back to setup wars episode 157
where you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel if you guys want
to participate make sure to watch the
video linked down below with that said
let the setup boys begin kicking off the
episode is that win and his upgraded
setup since episode 127 he actually went
from a triple pyramid stacked layout to
a dual monitor setup and uses this for
gaming video editing and other work
related tasks including music recordings
with his drumming gear in case you guys
haven't noticed this setup is powered by
a laptop the dell inspiron 7:59 which is
dot on a station by the way real quickly
if you guys want to see a laptop edition
of setup wars where i feature the best
laptop setups i've seen on the show let
me know in the comment section how about
in symmetry there's a few other things I
really like about this setup first of
all the desk he's using is the IKEA Hal
Assad countertop with the aluminum
borders and that's being supported by
some capital eggs and the Alex drawers I
like that he went with grey Alex drawers
instead of the white ones to give it
more of a contrast with a desk another
thing I like about the setup are the
speaker placements so he mounted two
IKEA lack shelves on the wall and he
mounted the speaker's right underneath
it which not only looks cooler in my
opinion but also allows him to use the
top of the shelf to put stuff on the
aluminum border he added on the wall
shelves are actually very clever and it
blends in nicely with the countertop
accents a lot of benefit of mounting the
speaker's like this is that cable
management is a lot easier all you had
to do was route the cable straight down
using some wall raceways so all the
cables run straight down and into the
channel raceway which then lead to the
laptop I personally don't think the
middle leg is necessary for support
since he doesn't have that much stuff in
the middle and he's only running dual
monitors the counter tops from Ikea are
very sturdy so he wouldn't be
experiencing any bowing and I'm speaking
from personal experience I also feel
like the support really bothers your
legs judging by how close it is to the
front it really bothers you and you
don't want to remove it I do suggest
pushing it towards the back a little bit
that way gives your legs some extra
space I like what he did with the
position of the RGB mousepad and routing
both cables underneath the keyboard and
through the desk looks really
clean he does have a drum set behind his
setup and he uses the v-moda crossfade
headphones for that and the Audio
Technica m40 axes for his actual setup I
was a like where he mounted his blue
snowball ice microphone the actual boom
arm is hooked up on the monitor arm
itself and not on the desk and that's
why he's able to extend a microphone
that far out behind the monitors for
laptop setup this is actually very
impressive v1 stayed in the notes that
he's constantly on the road hence why he
prefers this type of setup but he is
planning on purchasing a desktop PC
later this year
thank you that one for entering John is
up next from Austria and his beast
triple monitor gaming setup so he's
rocking three quad HD 165 Hertz gaming
monitors from Asus that are mounted on
the wall and below that we got some
Razer gear he Black Widow X chroma key
board and he lands her tournament
Edition Mouse now for audio he's got the
Razer Leviathan Bluetooth speaker and
the black shark gaming headset he's also
using the assayer and microphone and he
mounted it an interesting location right
above his calendar on the left side of
his setup in the notes he stated that he
was going with a black in green color
scheme with some red accents which we
can see across the setup and also inside
the pc by the way props we're using the
PC tower as a nightstand so it looks
like it's running on two separate loops
and it's packing the 6800 carry 16 gigs
of ram and qac Strix 980 T is an SLI
cable management isn't bad however I
would find a way to wrap the cables from
the monitors maybe using a white sleeve
like this from Amazon will help keep the
cables hidden while the same time
blending in with the wall it's not a bad
setup but it could use some more work to
improve mostly on the cables thanks Jen
for entering at number 3 is John all the
way from Germany and it's very clean
dual monitor gaming and productivity
setup looks like he's rocking to BenQ
monitors that are mounted on the desk I
don't know why but I'm kind of digging
those black out key caps on the master
keys Pro s keyboard it kind of gives off
this cool stealthy look the speakers
he's using are the popular Mackie CR 4s
which are being held up with the IKEA
shelves and the cables are neatly hidden
using wall raceways nicely done
he does have some headphones as well we
got the Sennheiser HD 598 C
headphones that's resting on the mov
headphone stand and for audio input he's
using the rode anti microphone which he
tucked behind his monitor when not in
use the PC powering the setup is inside
the tiny end case m1 and it's packing
the 4790k we had 16 gigs of ram in the
EVGA GTX 1080 by the way the tempered
glass panel was custom made by him and
so was the 5 inch screen inside the PC
that displays the stats and the
temperature of the PC not bad I may not
agree with the loose wires on top of the
desk but the cables under the desk are
managed well thanks to the Signum rack
and the help of some raceways I think
it's a pretty clean and straightforward
setup thank you John for entering
next up is Matthew from New York and
this interesting setup with a scary
theme to it so math it was actually been
a longtime subscriber the channel and
you set up words to gain inspiration and
improving his setup over the years this
is what he currently has a dual stack
monitor setup that he uses for gaming
music production and recording videos
for his YouTube channel both monitors
are mounted on the massive 98 inch
hollow stat countertop from Ikea and
that's being held up by some Capitol
eggs and the Alex your units all right
now 98 inches is pretty wide and since
there is no support in the middle you
can start to see some bowing due to the
weight of both monitors in this
particular setup I would recommend
adding a leg in the center as support
but I would keep it towards the back
where the monitor stands attaches to the
desk it's not a huge deal but it will
prevent the desk from blowing more in
the future so one of the squee got the
razor sino so chroma keyboard with the
Razer DeathAdder Mouse I'm actually glad
he grouped up both wires together
instead of leaving them alone it looks
much cleaner this way since Matthew uses
this setup for music production he does
have a lot of audio gear we got preamps
audio interfaces and a mixer all within
reach and he also has a few headphones
as well the PlayStation Gold wireless
headset and the Air Force X 42 is for
gaming while he uses the beats solo
wireless headphones and the krk studio
headset for music I'm actually surprised
to find out he's using a Logitech z6 23
speakers instead of a pair of really
high-quality bookshelf speakers but he's
a professional here or not me
cables are managed very well for the
most part I can tell that he got
inspiration from setup wars because this
is cable management 101 that I always
talk about in my videos we got channel
raceways to route the cables we got 3m
tapes for the power strips and the power
bricks and cable clips to keep the wires
organized nicely done the PC powering
this setup is tucked away in the corner
and it's equipped with these 7700 K we
got a GTX 1080 from Asus and 16 gigs of
ram if he's not gaming on the PC he's
obviously on the ps4 or Xbox one aside
from the weird masks and costumes you
have scattered everywhere I think this
is a dope setup and you did a great job
putting it together especially coming
from your original
setup a few years back thank you Matt
for entering last round least we got
Nicolas who was a student and he uses
this setup for gaming and editing
highlights for his YouTube channel it's
a black and blue team set up using two
monitors that are mounted on his
motorized desk which makes sense why
he's using a cable sleeve to cover the
cables on there here there has to be
some sort of slack available so that it
can expand and retract along with the
desk for peripherals he's using the
coarser K 65 luxe keyboard and the g43
wireless mouse the only audio source he
has are the HyperX cloud wireless
headset which is hanging from the NZXT
puck and I really like what he did with
the cables over here he used a clip to
hold it in place he does have a
microphone as well the blue Yeti that's
mounted on the desk using a boom arm and
finally the PC that's powering
everything which has a 7600 K 16 gigs of
ram in the asus strix 1080 the cables
are organized very well underneath the
desk looks like he mounted pretty much
everything under here we got the power
strip we got some power brakes from the
monitors and the clips and tape to hold
everything in place
there are a few things I would recommend
to improve your setup firstly adding a
tiny pencil drawer like this one
underneath your desk will give you easy
access to store things like your RGB
remote and whatever that hardshell case
is secondly I will route the cables
behind your TV towards the right so that
way you can just run the channel raceway
straight down because it doesn't look
good going diagonally lastly I feel like
the mic can be positioned in a better
place either move your PC to the right a
little bit so that you can squeeze the
mic between a second monitor and the PC
from the back or try mounting the entire
boom arm on the monitor mount which will
give you much longer reach I don't know
if either methods will work out but it's
worth trying it out if you're not happy
with your current setup but that's
pretty much all I got is a solid gaming
setup for a 15 year old Thank You
