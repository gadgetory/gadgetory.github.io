Edea from Texas and today I'm going to
show you how to unlock your Nokia Lumia
925 smart phone for all countries
regardless of what carrier you have
unlocking your phone allows you to use
your phone with other networks and the
process is completely safe and does not
harm your phone in any way so first off
we need to get the unlock code for the
phone before we proceed with the
unlocking procedure I personally use the
unlocking company for all my devices
because not only are they the largest
unlocking company to date but they also
unlocked almost every GSM model ever
made and on top of all that they have
the lowest prices available in the
market with 24/7 customer support so to
demonstrate the process I'm going to use
the AT&amp;amp;T version and unlock it so I can
use it on my t-mobile network and like I
said earlier it's the same exact steps
for all countries and carriers worldwide
so head on over to the unlocking company
comm and once you're there going to be
selecting your manufacturer and phone
model from the drop-down list
nokia is the manufacturer and the model
is the Lumia 925 once you do that select
get unlocking code which takes you to
your next step which is to select what
country you purchase the phone from as
well as the carrier of the phone this is
the carrier that the phone is originally
purchased from in my case it's AT&amp;amp;T you
will need the phone's IMEI number to
continue and I'm going to show you how
to look it up on your phone so you
basically go to your dial pad and you
enter in star pound zero six pound and
the code will immediately show up and
you will need to enter that on a website
to continue make sure you select the
correct currency for your country before
moving on once you select get a locking
code and purchase it securely with
PayPal they will email you the code the
price and time vary depending on the
phone but they do guarantee that you are
getting the lowest price and the fastest
delivery times once you receive your
code via email it's time to unlock your
device go ahead and remove the SIM tray
which should be located on the top and
you can use either a paperclip or
something else with a sharp end to do
this once the tray is removed insert
your SIM card in the tray however please
note that if your SIM card is too big or
too small to fit in the tray then you
are going to need to adjust the size
accordingly for it to fit properly I
provided you with a link in the
description of where you can buy the sim
adapter or cutting tool as well
as an instructional video on how to use
them unless you know how to do it
yourself insert the sim tray back into
your phone and it will automatically
restart once it boots up it will ask you
to enter the pin number to unlock the
phone and this is where you input the
unlock code that was sent to you via
email once accepted your phone is
unlocked and you can begin using it
immediately so that's basically how to
unlock your Lumia 925 if you found this
video helpful feel free to leave a like

concerns you can leave a comment down
