and I have something really special to
share with you guys today this year is
our new and official unboxing desk at
our office and it is far from an
ordinary desk because it is motorized
this is called the birth desk and you
can control the height with a touch of a
button I am really excited to have this
in the office as it is perfect for what
we do it works so well as an unboxing
table I want to give you huge thanks to
vortex for sending this to us now I know
a lot of people including myself having
regular desk and are used to sitting
down for hours at a time and that is
really unhealthy and can even be bad for
your back after a long period of time
well what the birth desk you have the
flexibility to change positions whenever
you want so when you do get tired of
sitting you can stand up and vice versa
the vertex is also really sturdy and the
left supports up to 250 pounds which
means that it can handle all of your PC
equipment and more they do have
different sizes and colors when it comes
to the tabletop however I went with the
white 3572 option which is their largest
size I will leave a link in a
description section so you guys can
check them out and you should definitely
tell your friends about this because
this is the coolest desk ever they also
offer height options as well you can
pick either the standard height or the
extra tall option ranging anywhere from
28 inches to 49 inches and I gotta say I
love this desk so much that I'm going to
get another one just to replace my work
desk there is no question there but
anyways that is it for the video I hope
you guys enjoyed it if you did please
leave a like and if you didn't you can
leave a dislike and let me know what you
guys think about the desk in the comment
section down below I got a bunch of cool
videos coming your way including an
ultimate PC build that's going to knock
you guys off your chair so make sure to
stick around for that this is that foam
tech source and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
