requirements for setup wars my god works
every time and jump right into it okay
so I will need at least 15 pictures of
your setup picture one should be a
direct shot of your setup showing
everything from top to bottom and left
to right everything must be in the same
frame picture two should be the same
shot but at a 45 degree angle either on
the left or right it doesn't really
matter but make sure you guys get your
chair in the same picture picture three
should be the exact same picture as
number two but this time without the
chair inside the shot picture number
four should be showing the bottom
portion of your desk at eye level guys
basically make sure that the roof of
your desk is not visible I just want to
see everything underneath it picture
five is where I want you to take a
picture of the roof of your desk so that
I can see how you did your cable
management so please make sure to use
flash if it's too dark picture six
should be an overhead shot of the
keyboard and mouse all in one frame and
then picture seven to twelve should be
close-up shots of all the tech on your
desk whether it's the monitor speakers
microphones mouse keyboard just don't
get too close to them make sure you are
shooting them from a distance and that
the entire object fits inside the frame
I don't want any fancy macro shots of
your stuff pictures 13 to 15 should be
of your PC just make sure to take a pic
of the computer from a distance and then
one more close up of all the components
inside 15 pictures are minimum but
please feel free to send in any extra
ones the more the better
pictures must be in the best possible
quality which means great lighting
stable hands and no shaking while taking
pics as well as no blurry photos all
photos have to be in landscape mode so
if you guys send in vertical pics you
will be disqualified and also make sure
your PC is on that way you actually have
something displayed on your monitor
don't just leave it off for the entire
shoot as a bonus you guys can send in a
60 second video file as well if you want
that is optional 60 seconds is the max
and please guys shoot it in landscape
mode not vertical otherwise I won't
accept it maybe you guys want to show
off the RGB lights on your setup or
maybe there's something that opens up in
a coup
wäôre closes in a cool way you want to
get that on video as well stuff like
that I'm okay with to send the files you
will need to go to we transfer comm and
add all your pics and in the message box
I need you guys to list the following in
order your first name on the top
followed by the age and country or state
that you live in as a bonus you can list
your occupation as well if you're
comfortable whether you are a retired
veteran a student going to school or a
full-time cashier at Taco Bell
if you don't feel comfortable listening
your occupation then don't it's
completely fine you will also need to
tell me what you use your setup for is
it for gaming music production graphic
design whatever it's used for make sure
to list it over here then you will need
to list all the tech that's in your
setup starting with the name of the desk
and the monitor keyboard and mouse make
sure to list any headphones or headsets

case it's using the CPU GPU power supply
and any type of mods that you have done
to it once you have all your info and
the files attached email everything to
setup Wars at gmail.com if you guys are
too lazy to type stuff and you can
actually go to kit comm and create an
entire kit with all of your gear on it

what I'm really looking for and these
submissions aside from the quality of
the pictures are the setup itself you

everyone else that are submitting their
setups how unique it is how cool it is
