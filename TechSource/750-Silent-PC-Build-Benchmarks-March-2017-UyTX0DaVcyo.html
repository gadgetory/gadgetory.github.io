that's rockin the i-5 7400 and an EVGA
GTX 1060 superclocked speaking of the
gtx 1060 superclocked i'll actually be
giving this away to two lucky
subscribers with a very interesting
twist at the end of this video so make
sure you guys stick around for that so
there's going to be a silence build
without using silence parts and who
better to supply them then be quite
themselves it was the leading brand when
it comes to silence I mean it's
practically in their brand name be quiet
I've used their parts before many builds
on a channel and I reached out to see if
they can send me a few things for this
PC since we have a locked processor I
picked up a gigabyte B 250m motherboard
since we are not going to be
overclocking and also save some money in
the processor as well as eight gigs of
RAM and the pure rock CPU cooler after
all this is a silent build so sticking
with the stock heatsink
defeats the purpose most people overlook
the power supply when choosing parts for
a silent build and don't realize that
some of the noise comes from the fan the
pure power 10 does cost more than the
average 500 watt power supply and it's
not fully modular but if a silent build
is what you're after and this is
something worth checking out
for storage we're sticking with the
usual 1 terabyte hard drive from WD and
everything is packed inside the pure
bass 600 window case which i think is a
bit overkill for this build because of
all the extra unused space it's a metal
chassis that features a fan controller
in the front near the two USB 3.0 ports
there's a lot of space in here you can
fit up to a dinner 60 millimeter
radiator on the top and front of the
case and obviously it's sound insulated
with dampening materials on the top
sides and front unless you pick up a
window version like I have in a video
where instead of a sound dampening side
panel you get a tempered glass panel on
stet which looks really cool but even
with the glass panel the PC is quiet and
here's a quick demonstration of how
quiet it really is doing full load and
just for fun I'm gonna keep the side
panel off
so yeah I wasn't kidding when I said
this was a silent build I also want to
quickly mention that the cable
management areas are awesome in this
tower I mean I would have loved to see
more high areas near the top but I
managed to work with what was available
for a very clean job there's a lot of
cable grommets and cutouts that made the
cable management extremely easy and if
you ever need more space in here you can
always remove the hard drive changes
really easily from the back for five
stretch marks
silenzio scored 97 15 putting it way up
there above my previous budget build and
pretty close to the next which was using
an i5 6500 and a gtx 1066 good byte
Gravette card and look at our render
times it actually didn't do bad compared
to other pcs except titania I mean
that's obviously an exception since that
had a 69 100k but again I need to
emphasize that this isn't an editing PC
although you can use it for content
creation and gaming it's just not going
to be as effective compared to a six or
eight core processor so if you
constantly use multi-threaded
applications then this PC is not for you
anyways your other gaming benchmarks
done in 1080p
so there you have it a beast silent
gaming PC that will get you over 60fps
and high or max settings in 1080p as
always all the parts are linked down
below if you want to check it out
