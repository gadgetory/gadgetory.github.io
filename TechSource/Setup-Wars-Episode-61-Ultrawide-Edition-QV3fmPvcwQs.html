from Texas and welcome to setup wars

wear pretty much you got the idea if you
guys have a pretty sweet setup and want
to participate in setup wars make sure
to watch the video linked below but
ladies and gentlemen without wasting any
more time let the setup Wars begin never

find the links to everyones gear for
their setups linked down below along
with anything I recommend in this
episode so here are your 5 lucky
contestants for this week we have Carson
David Doug Janek and mark
congratulations for making it on the
show so starting off the episode is
Carson and his stormtrooper themed setup
we have a 34 inch LG monitor a razer
blackwidow tournament keyboard and a
razer mamba sporting white LEDs to match
the black and white color scheme also on
the desk we have a stormtrooper resting
on top of the clips docking station and
right next to that we have is PC which
has a 4690k and an AMD r9 fury x great
choice on a pc case as well you've done
a great job keeping the color scheme
very consistent hanging from the
brainwaves trust we have his Razer 7.1
chroma headset and this entire desk is
wall-mounted which kind of sucks for
cable management speaking of which I
don't really see any wires under your
desk so I can't give you any
recommendations where are you hiding
them exactly a very clean and well
coordinated setup Thank You Carson for
entering david is next up with a fairly
clean set up so we have a 34 inch Acer
predator and a look more razor gear you
have a BlackWidow chroma key board and a
Razer Ouroboros mouse on top of the
Razer Firefly mousepad I think that this
is also the first setup that has a
left-handed user interesting also on the
desk we have a brainwaves gypsum or give
some headphones
stand holding up the sennheiser HD 650
headphones which also has an antlion mod
mic attachment now that's a pretty sweet
headphone setup and on the opposite side
of the desk we have the creative
soundblaster x7 USB DAC and am I gotta
say you know audio game is definitely
strong excellent choices on the gear
cable management on the other hand looks
clean you have the usual Signum rack
holding up most of the wires and it
looks like you use some velcro straps to
wrap the PC cables together with the
desk legs very good job it's a shame
that you have to put your PC on the
ground this is a very good-looking build
rocking a 6700 K and an Asus Titan X
graphics card for the most part this is
a very clean setup with minor stuff on
the desk and for that I would recommend
a pencil drawer that you can install
under the desk
to keep your pen notebook and coasters
when you're not using them but overall a
very organized and clean setup thank you
David for entering onto our third ultra
white setup from Doug he's rocking a 29
inch from Samsung and below that we have
the Razer chroma keyboard and Logitech
MX master mouse on top of the reflex lab
extended mouse pad for the desk he's
using the IKEA linman glossy tabletop
and to Alex your units as the legs I
definitely like the black and white
contrast sandwiching the monitors are a
pair of bose companion 2 speakers and
the right side is this pc with another
s340 case so inside here we have a 44 60
paired with a gtx 760 cable management
on the other hand looks good
I mean the wires appear to be wrapped
together using some velcro and
everything is pushed off to the right
and away from sight we also have a power
strip that hooked up on the roof of the
desk so overall I think you did a pretty
decent job now here's the thing since
the cables are behind the drawer and
away from sight you really didn't need
to use 3m tape and keep it off the
ground it would have been a lot easier
to just buy a cable box and put
everything inside and leave it down on
the ground you won't be able to see it
from the front anyways regardless this
is a very clean and simple setup thank
you Doug for entering a number four we
have Janek and his white and green set
up so we have a pair of Mackie CR 4
speakers sandwiching the 34 inch LG
martyr which is resting on top of the
Alex add-on unit on the desk we have the
SteelSeries apex keyboard and rival
mouse combo on top of the course our
extended mousepad and apart from the
bear that are a custom one Pro
headphones as
really not much else on here well except
for a wireless keyboard under the riser
cable management though is very clean I
do like the fact that you use several
cable sleeves to hide the cables in
especially the PC wires
speaking of which he has an FX 6300 and
an r9 280x powering the setup the only
thing I would change about this setup is
the lighting maybe add one more Philips
hue bulb on the left side to balance the
lighting because right now the entire
right side is too bright
other than that minor tweak this is a
pretty sweet setup Thank You Janek for
entering last but not least we have mark
and his DOOL 29 inch LG ultra white
setup because a single ultra light is
too mainstream the displays are hooked
up to a monitor arm and below that we
have the Logitech g7 10 keyboard and
logitech g502 Mouse also on a desk we
have the Logitech G 6:33 headset a Bose
Soundlink mini speaker and a wireless
charger from Samsung keeping the black
and red theme consistent we have red
LEDs in the back as well as some black
and red acoustic foams much like my
setup the PC is powering the setup has
an FX 8350 and an r9 390x inside the
NZXT noctus 450 case I haven't seen this
many AMD parts in a single episode of
setup Wars ever I sense that AMD is
making a comeback cable management on
the other hand is very clean you managed
to wrap everything together and keep it
off the ground all without using a
Signum rack job well done
the only minor changes I recommend are
getting a headphone hangar for your
headset and height adjustment for the
right monitor since it's slightly higher
than the left also a quick tip for
everyone that's submitting their setup
please
show off your desktop wallpaper and only
your wallpaper nobody wants to see your
browser open look how much better your
setup looks with matching wallpapers
other than those minor tweaks this is a
very fine black and red setup thank you
