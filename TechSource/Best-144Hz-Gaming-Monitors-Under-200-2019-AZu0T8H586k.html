Hertz gaming monitor then you click on

that cost $200 or less let's begin I

so all these monitors have really high
ratings on Amazon and some of them are
very popular in the gaming markets if
there's a specific monitor that you guys
like and that's not featured in here
then that either means that it wasn't
under $200 at the time of making this
video or it is discontinued I'm not
doing this continued or use monitors
only brand new monitors that they are
still selling online also at the end of
this video I'll be doing a full recap of
all the monitors featured in this video
I'll be going over my top picks the
worst monitor from the list and I'll
give you guys a full
of the monitors and its pros and cons to
kind of give you all the information you
need to make a purchase decision so
let's begin first monitor we're taking a
look at is the MSI g24 see it has a 24
inch curved VA panel with freesync that
goes for 190 it's a decent looking
monitor with slightly thicker bezels
then I prefer but it's built really well
with a nice stand that doesn't take up
much space on the desk however you can
only tilt using a stand and it doesn't
support vasa mounting viewing angles are
really great because it's a VA panel
however it doesn't get that bright
maxing out at only to 25 minutes at peak
brightness it does however have accurate
color reproduction with srgb coverage at
100% so it can be used for gaming and
color sensitive work in fact this is the
only monitor on this list that achieves
this high of rating so this next few
test unfortunately I can't capture
exactly what I'm seeing with my eyes
because my camera shoots in 25 P and it
just doesn't do it justice hence why you
guys are gonna have to rely on the
rating system the first test is ghosting
the faster the response times the less
ghosting you'll see the MSI monitor has
a considerable amount of ghosting from
this test so unfortunately does not have
a 1 millisecond response time as
advertised I will be ranking the
response time is based on the ghosting
test so 3 means no ghosting present 2
means average and 1 means a lot of
ghosting present black levels are also
really bad looking dead in the center
squares 1 2 3 are not distinguishable
whatsoever I am happy to report that the
monitor doesn't have any noticeable
backlight bleed so for that I'm giving
it a 3 accessing the menu isn't too
terrible
the buttons are at least labeled so you
know what you're pressing and it's
easier to find certain settings like
enabling overdrive and free sync and
finally for ports the monitor does have
a display HDMI and a DVI port by the way
I'll be giving a rating on each monitor
for each category 1 means poor 2 means
good or average and 3 means great due to
the slight curve the monitor does offer
a slight immersive experience compared
to the other monitors on the list and
because of that I would say it was more
fun to play on
I don't know how BenQ continues to make
some of the ugliest monitors out there
the Zoe Excel is no exception with a
bulky stand and thick bezels is
definitely not that pleasing to look at
but in exchange it's built really well
the stand is really sturdy and offers a
lot of adjustment points aside from the
usual tilt you can also raise and lower
the monitor and rotate it up to 180
degrees to its side this is also the
only monitor on the list that can swivel
from one side to the other but if you
don't want to use the stand then you can
mount it because it is basic compatible
so the stand has this tiny clip in the
back which is a nice plus for cable
management and the way you raise the
stand is by pressing down on the tab and
lifting the monitor also locks in place
when you lower it all the way down which
I find very useful when you need to move
the monitor around this is a TN panel so
don't expect amazing viewing angles
however I was surprised to see
noticeably less color shifting compared
to the other TN panels on this list the
BenQ monitor does really great in terms
of color performance with an sRGB rating
of 98% and peak brightness of 355 nits
making this a pretty good choice for
professionals on a budget response times
are pretty fast on this monitor I
experienced very little ghosting black
levels are really good too the only box
I can't distinguish is number one while
the rest are clearly visible and I
didn't notice any backlight bleed from
my testing the menu buttons are kind of
annoying since they are not labeled and
the OSD menu might take some getting
used to
in order to figure out which icon does
what reports the BenQ does come with a
single display HDMI and an audio port
off to the side the BenQ Zoe gets a 2.57
out of three making it the highest
weighted monitor from this video and for
good reason it pretty much checks all
the boxes for a solid gaming monitor if
you can look past aesthetics this model
will meet both your gaming and
productive needs the biotech is one of
the largest 144 Hertz monitors on this
list it's a 27 inch display that uses a
Samsung VA panel it's a really good
looking monitor actually super thin
bezels and a nice looking stand although
I wish it wasn't in red that might be a
turn-off for some people who have a very
specific color scheme in there
the build quality is very disappointing
this is probably the most flimsy stand I
have seen on any monitor it wobbles way
too much because of the type of stand
it's one of those snap-on stands but
it's executed badly they should have
just stuck with screws
it also doesn't offer much tilt but
luckily you can mount it if you want you
just have to remove the stand and
replace the existing screws with longer
screws and washers the viewing angles
however are great since it is a VA panel
I didn't notice any major color shifts
also the panel isn't super accurate but
it does get pretty bright over 300 nits
when it comes to ghosting there is a
significant amount present so you're
definitely not getting that one
millisecond response time as advertised
however the black levels are great I can
just barely see the first square looking
directly at the center of the screen the
monitor does have very slight bleeding
on the corners but it's nothing to
complain about what you should complain
about is the speaker's very low output
on max volume and they sound very tinny
definitely not usable in any scenario
accessing the menu is fairly easy at
least the buttons are labeled however
there is a blue LED that illuminates
straight down and it's kind of annoying
especially if you use your PC at night
it might bother you in the back you'll
find two HDMI and one DisplayPort along
with a back cover which is pretty hard
to take off so you might as well just
leave it off it's not a terrible monitor
for the price there aren't that many
27-inch gaming monitors out there with
these specs next up we have the AOC g20
590 FX a 25 inch frameless monitor with
G sync support I don't know why
manufacturers insist on adding color
especially red on gaming peripherals
which can easily be a turn-off for
people who are anal about sticking to a
specific color scheme like me for
example other than the unnecessary red
accent color on the chin I would say the
monitor looks gorgeous really thin
bezels and an unobtrusive mount which
only offers tilt I do like to cut out in
the stand allowing for cables to pass
through for a cleaner cable management
however it's not as sturdy as I would
have liked it's one of those snap-on
stands the viewing angles are really bad
on this display even when you're looking
directly at the center you will see lots
of color shifting towards the top and
bottom and even
on the sides color performance is also
lacking on this monitor the advertised
96% srgb on Amazon when in reality it's
only 94% either way it's not accurate
enough for color sensitive work but the
panel does get really bright at 393 nits
where the monitor lacks it makes up in
speed very impressive results no
ghosting present which means it
definitely has less than a three
millisecond response time black levels
however are really bad on this monitor
if you're looking at a dead center
you're not able to see squares one two
three unless you look down on the
monitor which is when color-shifting
takes place and revealing the other
squares the monitor does experience very
subtle backlight bleed from the bottom
center of the display but I'm not gonna
take off any points like usual since
it's not that noticeable accessing the
menu is by far the best experience
compared to the rest simply because they
included a joystick making it a lot
easier to navigate around I feel like
every manufacturer needs to dish the
button method and go with a single
joystick to make lives easier and
finally reports you get to HDMI a single
display and AD sub port next to an audio
jack with a low score of 1.86 it puts
this monitor and last place compared to
the rest and with this $200 price tag
it's gonna be really hard for me to
recommend when there are other better
options available the Acer xfa 240 is
the only other monitor on the list to
have G sync support for $200 it might
not be the best looking monitor with
those ugly thick bezels but damn it is
built like a tank a very sturdy mount
and quite versatile too it offers a good
amount of tilt and you can also raise or
lower the monitor from 2 inches off the
table all the way up to 8 inches you can
also rotate the display a full 180
degrees making it a really great choice
for programmers or engineers who like
the game the stand has an opening in the
center to help route cables for a
cleaner look however you can completely
ditch the stand altogether and mount it
since it is basic imperil as well it is
a TN panel so viewing angles aren't the
best but it's not as bad compared to
other TN panels on this list looking
directly in the center of the monitor
you will clearly see color shifting from
the top corners one of the pros of this
monitor is the peak brightness
I measured 418 nits which is really high
for TN panel response times are fast
enough that ghosting is not present
however the black levels suffer because
of the color shift backlight bleed isn't
too noticeable
unless you are really looking for it but
there is slight bleeding near the top
once again nothing serious to complain
about speakers are terrible as always
however the many buttons aren't that bad
even though there are no icons it's
fairly easy to navigate
since the buttons are located on the
front in terms of ports you get a DVI n
HDMI and DisplayPort along with audio
and for your headset and mic the Acer
monitor checks a lot of boxes when it
comes to peer gaming Calvin for the
price it's hard to recommend considering
there are other monitors on this list
that offers the same or better quality
but for less this next marker is the
cheapest Marlar on the list that has a
24 inch curved VA panel with free sync
it's a good looking monitor with super
thin bezels and a very thin panel near
the top but it's very light and flimsy
the stand let's give you the option to
tilt but not as much compared to other
monitors which is why I strongly
recommend mounting this to get a better
angle since it has a VA panel the
viewing angles are great with very
minimal to no color shifting the colors
are not that accurate out of the box
with the necessary GB rating of 94% and
it doesn't get that bright either with a
peak brightness of 271 nits response
time on this monitor is pretty slow
there's a good amount of ghosting
presence definitely nowhere near the 1
millisecond response time as advertised
the black levels however are great I can
see all the squares clearly without any
issues and by the way keep in mind that
all this testing is done with default
settings I'm also going to give it a 3
for the backlight bleed test because I
didn't see any noticeable bleeding
anywhere accessing the menu is one of
the worst I have experienced not only
are they positioned vertically behind
the monitor but there are no icons
that'll definitely take some time
getting used to in the back you'll find
two HDMI one DisplayPort and an audio
jack and I do love the convenience of a
horizontal plugin instead of a vertical
plug-in like the rest of the monitors
the stuff there does come with built-in
speakers but the audio is so terrible
it's very quiet at max volume and it
sounds extremely tinny please wear
headphones with this monitor for the
price of $160 I really feel like you're
getting what you pay for
following that is another septum monitor
however this one has a 24 and a half
inch TN panel with a hundred sixty-five
Hertz and the crazy part is that it goes
for only $155 after the coupon code
which saves you an extra 10 bucks the
build quality on this monitor is a lot
better than the previous one its slim
and it has a sturdy enough stand that
offers decent tilt angles and having a
best amount is a nice plus super thin
bezels all around and pretty good
viewing angles from the sides despite it
being a TN panel however you will notice
some vertical color shifting 96% of srgb
coverage is pretty good for a TN panel
and it does get pretty bright as well
over 300 nits
beautiful fluid motion on the 165 Hertz
panel with no ghosting but it does fall
short on the black levels this monitor
actually has the worst black levels
compared to the rest I'm not able to see
any of the squares from 1 to 5 looking
dead center no noticeable backlight
bleed and just like the last monitor the
speakers are terrible I honestly don't
know why they even bother putting
speakers on a budget monitor if they're
gonna sound like crap the button layout
is also the same and back here you'll
find the same ports two HDMI one display
and an audio jack I gotta say though
gaming on this martyr was the most fun
out of the rest simply because of the
high refresh rate and I know the
difference between 144 and 165 Hertz
isn't as noticeable coming from 60 to
144 but if you're an active gamer you
can tell the difference there's a reason
why professional gamers often go for the
highest refresh rate possible because
every little bit adds up the ld27 19 is
one of the more popular gaming monitors
in the market the build quality is
really great and personally I think it's
a good looking monitor with really thin
bezels The Stand doesn't offer much
flexibility other than tilt but it's
really sturdy with little to no wobbling
and just like most monitors on its list
it's basic compatible there is
noticeable color shifting from top to
bottom looking dead center of the screen
but not as much from side to side the
wear fall short is color reproduction
the Dell monitor does the worst in this
category but it does get really bright
at 395
the response time is pretty fast however
there is slight ghosting present if you
really look for it the black levels
really suffer on this display as well
boxers one two three aren't visible from
the center backlight bleed is also
present on the bottom corners slightly
more noticeable than previous monitors
what surprised me on this monitor are
the speakers he actually sound pretty
good they do get pretty loud and the
audio doesn't get distorted at max
volume the highs are crisp and clear but
it's definitely lacking in the bass
Department the menu is really easy to
access
since the buttons are located underneath
the display and all of them are labeled
this monitor is also the only one on the
list that has a pass-through with two
USB ports the LD 2719 might have the
lowest score compared to the rest but
don't let that fool you because this is
still a solid gaming monitor for the
price in the 27-inch category so here is
a full list of the monitors and their
ratings the BenQ came up top with a 2.57
out of three it's a well-built monitor
that offers a lot for the money a
flexible stand great color reproduction
and better viewing angles
compared to other TN panels on the list
I would recommend this monitor to any
gamer out there who also does
professional work the sceptre e to 55 be
surprised me the most simply because of
what you get for a hundred and fifty
five dollars really fast response times
with no ghosting that combined that the
165 Hertz refresh rate gave me a really
smooth gaming experience if you're
simply looking for the highest refresh
rate with the fastest response time
under $200 then this monitor is the one
you're looking for now if you're looking
for something bigger like a 27-inch
display then I recommend the Dell
monitor over the vo-tech even though got
a lower score it's built way better it
has a much better stand better speakers
and a faster response time the worst
monitor is the vo-tech it has a very
flimsy stand bad color reproduction and
one of the slowest response times from
this list
I really hope this video was somewhat
helpful to you guys I took me over 70
hours to review and put this video
together so any type of support would be
greatly appreciated
I'll drop a link to all the monitors
featured in this video and also if you
guys use any of these monitors feel free
to let everyone know your experiences

below thanks again so much for watching
as always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
