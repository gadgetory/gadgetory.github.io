welcome to the very first episode of
setup wars will you submit your desk
setup to get featured on my channel any
chance to win 25 bucks I host these
every Monday on my channel and I pick
five submissions and you guys get to
vote on who has the best desk set up the
voting will end on the same week on
Saturdays and I choose a winner based on
the votes on Sunday on my social media
accounts if you guys want to submit your
desk setup make sure you watch the
original video where I go over all the
requirements and instructions needed to
apply and also leave a link below in the
description section guys when I check it
out but yeah let's go ahead and uh start
the show
alright so the five contestants for this
week are Andre chunky rabbit expert
Basel and J so basically how this works
is I'm just going to go through these
setups that you guys submitted and I'm
just gonna basically comment on them
I'll give you guys some compliments
maybe some criticisms things I like
things I don't like things that I
probably recommend it's just stuff like
that but basically my vote doesn't count
you guys get to choose on who wins so
I'm gonna start off with Andres setup
alright so checking out the front setup
let's see what you've got so you have an
Asus hook sucky 28 inch monitor this is
actually the one bob was using for his
ultimate Yeti build so that's pretty
that's a really nice monitor I see you
have a stand for that that's really neat
cleans up the whole desk I think that's
cute you got a little root there right
next to the eye things an audio
interface you got the MX master mouse
huge props there and a plus one on the H
440 case Razer Edition that is a really
nice case I use that for the big red and
of course Bob use that phone is Yeti
build so overall really solid choice for
the PC case but yeah an overall really
nice very clean setup that you got going
you got the blue Yeti in the back
speakers on the desk that's pretty cool
I'm not sure about your keyboard choice
but I mean hey I'm out rockin a
mechanical keyboard either and I get a
lot of hate for that so if that works
for you a man go for it and it looks
like you have a phone under can we tell
what it is maybe a Nexus 6 wireless
charging perhaps but yeah I mean overall
solid setup you got there let's take a
look underneath your table okay not much
actually down here it's really for the
most part it's a pretty clean wiring job
you did that big board on the back is
actually covering mostly wires so it's
probably why it looks good but yeah an
overall very solid setup from Andre
thank you for submitting your setup man
I appreciate it
also of you guys have a youtube account
or
a website or a Twitter stuff like that
make sure you send out to me too so I
can give you a shout-out in the video I
fail to mention that in the actual
requirements video but yeah overall very
solid set up and rain pretty impressed
let's move on to the next step
alright so let's check out chunky rabbit
setup let's start off by the front view
okay Wow looks like there's a bunch of
stuff on on the desk so I noticed first
thing is the alignment of the burners
I'm very picky I like things to be
symmetrical I like things to be very
even I guess you can call it and they're
also from two different companies so
that kind of bothers me and I'm not sure
how I feel about the drawings on the
wall I'm sure there's a reason for that
but that's something I was pretty I just
popped out you also got a Vizio TV looks
like mounted on the wall and then you
have the Canon printer underneath and
never microphone next to it so yeah
there's a lot of stuff on your desk and
they're all in reach and I guess that's
kind of what you were going for but I
prefer a more clean desk I like very few
things on my desk but you know if this
setup works for you by all means go for
it I also notice you have lighting in
the background that's pretty cool I'm
not sure that's from Philip use or not
but I actually picked up some for my
setup as well so I know how badass that
is and actually changes color as time
goes by so that is definitely nice plus
to your setup let's going to check out
what you have underneath so yeah there's
a bunch of cables down here and that's I
mean that's expected you have a bunch of
stuff on your desk so cable management
is going to be very difficult and looks
like a tow rack here for consoles Wow we
got a ps4 Xbox 360 a Wii U bunch of
games and that kind of explains also the
amount of cables you have so how am I
gonna give you too much crap about that
but way other than the two different
monitors and the posters on the wall
it's a pretty decent setup you got
but yeah thank you chunky rabbit for
submitting your desk setup now let's
move on to expert eye it's opening up
expert just set up let's see what you
have to show us Wow
you have a triple a sous monitor setup
and the first thing I noticed is that it
is you have a black and red combo so
already because of that I'm just going
to give you a plus one I believe they
can be colored in you have some really
good taste so you went with the matte
black asus monitors instead of the
silver ones very solid choice there
obviously to match your theme looks like
you have the k t70 keyboard and a razer
mouse produce all the choices for
peripherals and you have a SteelSeries
gaming pad I'm guessing your gamer from
all the setup you have here along with
the PSP and your 3ds on the desk but
overall very solid very clean set up I'm
definitely digging the theme you have
here for sure one thing that I also
notice is one of your mothers is kind of
crooked and that kind of bothers me but
I hope that was a mistake and hopefully
fix it after this video but other than
that looks like a very solid setup you
have a GTA 5 poster and your fractal
design case I think the back of design
case in the back but yeah very clean
very very cool setup but let's go ahead
and check out your kegels alright so
looking at the cable management and Wow
looks like wow you did a fantastic job
on the cable management there's
virtually there are virtually no cables
in view so and now that I'm looking at
it from underneath you have a pretty
cool desk design too so and it works
really well with your setup but your add
nothing bad to say honestly you did a
fantastic job on your setup you got a
pretty badass team it's very clean as on
many things on your desk really solid
choices on the keyboard and mouse and
the monitors so therefore a huge plus
the only thing I would say you just fix
that monitor after after you've done
watching this video if you're watching
this video because it is kind of
bothering me but other than that very
solid setup and thank you for submitting
it so let's go to move on to the next
alright who do you got next we have
Faisal or Faisal I hope I pronounced
that correctly but let's go ahead and
open up your front view see what you
all right so looking at your setup looks
like you have a dual monitor setup from
Philips so a plus one that is they're
from the same company and they're
actually aligned so I'll give you a
point for that as well
it kind of looks like your desk is bent
towards the middle I'm guessing that's
from the weight of the monitors but
there's really not much you can do there
you have a gaming rig on your table and
you have the m50x headphones very solid
choice there and looks like you have the
ultra wide mousepad from Corsair which I
do too this is a phenomenal mousepad
so there's many really nice solid
choices for those looks like you also
got that you wrap their Mouse from
Corsair so very nice gaming here you got
there it also looks like giving red and
black themed PC build so I'm definitely
digging the color combination a so plus
one there I can't really tell what kind
of parts you have in there but it looks
like a pretty killer gaming rig but yeah
let's go ahead and check out your wiring
and another awesome job on wiring this
is a very you get a really good job no
complaints here there's virtually no
wires visible looks like you added them
on the top there and underneath your
drawers so or in the back of the drawers
so plus one on the wiring man good job
thank you Faizal for submitting your
setup and let's move on to the next
person all right last but not least we
have Jay Jay let's check out your
setting let's start from the front
alright so the first thing I noticed is
that there are a lot of displays on your
desk I'm not sure if you actually use
all these looks like you have your
gaming setup on the right side then you
have a laptop and then you have a
humongous monitor or TV on the left side
connected to your laptop and also click
you have a huge-ass projector in your
room I think that's a projector and my
question would be is why why do you need
a projector in the room if you have so
many displays but it looks like overall
very clean setup I gotta say you have
the lighting in the back that changes
colors I'm not sure about the little
stuff you have on the desk there right
next to your phone I might rip those are
earphones and that's your wallet or not
but I'm pretty sure he is you can keep
that somewhere else maybe no drawer or
something to keep it less clutter
we are overall very solid setup on the
top let's go ahead and take a closer
look on the bottom a great job on the
cable management and you got some
drawers to keep some stuff in there but
yeah J overall a very solid setup
definitely digging your theme over here
the only minor thing I would say is
maybe just put the earphones and
whatever those small things are like
maybe to the side to give a desk a more
cleaner look but also let me know in the
comments section who the projector is
for because I got a feeling you use that
for your console gaming and if that's so
that is pretty badass but yeah overall
very very solid setup and thank you for
submitting it so that's it for this
