Texas what's up guys Devin Texas and
today we're gonna be taking a look at
something very very unique this is the
43 u d 79 B which is a 4k lg monitor
that's 43 inches now this isn't your
regular 43 inch monitor in fact I'm not
gonna even look at this as a huge
monitor instead I'm gonna look at it as
a small TV I mean come on this thing
even comes with a remote so you might be
asking yourself a few questions like
what makes it any different from any
other 43 inch TV out there well firstly
the price as you can find 43 inch 4k TVs
for half the retail price of this thing
which by the way is $700 but in this
defense it does come with some built-in
features and hardware that make it more
convenient than just using a flat out TV
for a monitor which probably why it cost
more I do want to take this time to
thank tunnel bear for sponsoring this
video

Donnell by calm slash tech source or
click on the link below alright so who
exactly needs or even wants something
this big as a computer monitor well it
turns out a lot of people there's
actually a growing demand for these
large monitors and a lot of companies
are coming out with their own variants
but they all seem to be marketed towards
the professionals and the people who use
their systems for productivity when this
first arrived at our office we
immediately threw it off as another fad
a product not really meant to sell but
just to have in the company catalog but
as time went by and the more we actually
used it the more we found its size
beneficial ok so the idea here is
productivity right I mean with its
factory calibrated panel
and the large real estate this is
actually the monitor for content
creators stock traders or even
professionals out there that use
multiple programs at once that can
actually benefit from it and it really
does work great for that in Premiere Pro
my editors workflow improved just by
having everything uncompressed he found
that a lot easier to find tabs scrub
through the timeline or just spot
imperfections and scenes that normally
he wouldn't catch in fact my editor has
become so accustomed to the size while
testing the monitor that he's already
switched from his old tried adding to
all of these we got some convenient
ports in the back we got two USB 3 s as
well as a single USBC port this is gonna
be great for charging laptops or daisy
chaining to other monitors also back
here we'll find a display port and also
four HDMI ports two of which will run at
60 Hertz and the other two that run at
30 but why for well just giving you four
because you can actually connect up to
four sources at once through their
software you can plug in your
playstation computer laptop or whatever
else has an HDMI port with a display and
you essentially have four 21.5 inch
displays that's pretty crazy the build
quality is top-notch
there are bezels but they're fairly thin
and the stand is very robust but
unfortunately it only gives us about 5
degrees for tilt around the center we do
recommend having a bigger desk with this
monitor however preferably deeper so
that you can place it further away from
you otherwise it's gonna be right in
your face
my editor actually had to install a
keyboard tray to accommodate for the
larger size the panel itself is good the
uniformity across the display is great
with no dead pixels or signs of
artifacting it's also coated matte which
I prefer over a glossy surface it
doesn't have too much backlight bleed in
fact you won't even notice it unless
you've extremely dark environments the
colors are great and I found it accurate
enough to use for video production but
it's also great for consuming media as
well especially when you're using the
210 watt speakers you won't be able to
hear how good they are through this
video but you're gonna have to trust me
when I say that they're exceptional
coming from a monitor the sound profile
is balanced with very clear highs and a
strong base but it's not too over
powering
obviously it's not a hardcore gaming
monitor because it's capped at 60 Hertz
refresh rate and a 5 millisecond
response time but for the casual gamer
it will get the job done just fine
actually it's like the IMAX of gaming
and provides a very immersive experience
in games that revolve around the
exploration of environments for example
playing Dark Souls was great but it
wasn't so great when I loaded up over
watch the larger display didn't give me
any added benefit if anything it
actually took away from the experience
as I had to look around the massive
display just to spot enemies and because
of that extra screen real estate the
responsiveness you get when shooting
enemies is greatly delayed honestly the
only types of games I would play on here
our exploration type adventure games
like Uncharted or even sports games like
racing and basketball there are some
downsides however it doesn't support HDR
for one which we would like to see in
future models and secondly if you're
sitting close to the monitor roughly
around two feet you'll see the screen
cast a shadow on the edges however if
you sit further back about four feet I
would say then it won't be a problem
there isn't anything LG could do about
it except making it curved but I feel
like that would put this monitor in a
completely different price bracket the
sheer footprint of this monitor probably
scares most people from buying it but in
truth this screen actually works great
for anyone who enjoys playing casual
games especially if you're a console
user it's compatible with Xbox one X and
4k as well as ps4 Pro it's also great
for content creators and professionals
out there even people who have I
problems since you don't have to focus
in so much and can sit back and scale
everything up in size it might even be a
nice upgrade to people who still use
dual monitor setup so you can just get
rid of those to put one of these bad
boys in front of you and eliminate that
nasty bezel in between personally for me
I'm not gonna be using this monitor
because it just doesn't meet the needs
that I'm looking for I still love the 21
by 9 aspect ratio and having g-sync
support is also a nice plus but with
that said let me know if this is
something that you guys would use in
your own personal setup by leaving your
feedback in the comment section below if
you guys enjoyed the video feel free to
toss a like if you guys didn't feel fit
of this like as well that's cool too
I'll drop a link to the monitor below if
you
when I check it out as always thank you
so much for watching and I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
