to show you the process of unlocking
your ZTE zmax smartphone so you can use
it with any carrier or country for this
demonstration I will be using my locked
t-mobile Z max and unlock it so I can
use it on my AT&amp;amp;T network but you can
use this video as a guide for any
carrier so first off we need to get the
unlock code to start the unlocking
process one of the best and most
trusting websites that I used to get my
lock codes is the unlocking company comm
because the prices are unbeatable and
their customer service is the best in
the market so head on over to the
unlocking company comm and select your
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop down list and on the next
page go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is t-mobile before
we continue we do need the IMEI number
of the phone and the way you look that
up on your phone is to open up the dial
pad and enter in star pound zero six
pound once the phone displays the imine
number you have to go back on the
website and enter that in once
everything is filled out so let's get a
login code and that will take you to the
final screen where you have to check out
after checking out they will email you
your unlock code the price and delivery
time of your code varies by phone but
don't worry because the prices are the
cheapest in the market than any other
unlocking website so before we continue
make sure that the phone is powered off
next go ahead and remove the SIM tray
located on the side of the phone and
inserting the SIM card that you want to
use with the phone I want to use the
zmax on my AT&amp;amp;T network so I am putting
in my AT&amp;amp;T SIM card if the SIM card is a
different size and you have to adjust it
in order for it to fit I have left a
link in the description section to show
you how that's done so after you insert
your SIM card in the tray go ahead and
slide it back inside the phone and power
on your device once the phone boots up
go ahead and leave the lock screen and
immediately after you will get a prompt
asking you for the unlock code this is
where you put in the hola code that was
sent to you by the unlocking company
after inputting the code your phone will
take you straight to the home screen and
your phone will be permanently unlocked
so that's how you unlock your ZTE zmax
smart phone that this video helped you

you want to any problems or have any
