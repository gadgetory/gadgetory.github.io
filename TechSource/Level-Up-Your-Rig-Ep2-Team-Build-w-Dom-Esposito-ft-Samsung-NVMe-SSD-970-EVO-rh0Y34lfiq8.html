walking back to my new series on the
channel level up your rig I pretty much
get the privilege of going into
someone's house and upgrading their PC
it's very similar to setup makeover but
instead of upgrading the setup I'm gonna
be focusing on upgrading the PC samsung
has reached out to sponsor this video
and they sent over their new 970 Evo to
help me with the series so this
episode's gonna be a little different
because the person's PC I'm gonna be
upgrading is Tom he's also a buddy of
mine and he has a techie Tube channel as
well and we're actually building the PC
together but before all that Dom tell us
a little bit about what you can be using
this PC for well mainly I do a lot of
editing and productivity type of stuff
but I also like to game so I really want
something that can handle both of those
tasks fluidly awesome so we did talk a
little bit about what parts we're gonna
be using in your build we are going with
the 8700 k-6 core processor it is
unlocked and I'm going to overclocking
it for you we're also gonna be throwing
in 32 gigs of RAM to help you out with
the productivity side and also a 6/10
atti to help you on the gaming side yeah
having all these high-end parts are nice
but the build is incomplete without a
storage device to complement it
the 970 bow will do just that well up to
34 hundred megabytes per second read and
2500 right so it's basically gonna boot
your PC faster it's gonna load up your
games and your applications faster and
just increase your overall productivity
flow that's kind of the purpose of this
build you guys already know this is a
tech source build so it's got to look
good in the aesthetics department which
is why we picked up some custom cables
from kala mod and some other
miscellaneous mods like a GPU backplate
also I came up with this color scheme
because of two reasons reason number one
it's actually Dom's channel's theme and
the reason number 2 is actually I sent
out a survey on Twitter and you guys
voted on a white and purple color scheme
alright so with all that out of the way
let's build a PC what do you say let's
do it
ladies and gentlemen I present to you
Griffith a beautiful white and purple
gaming and productivity PC so we
overclock the 8700 K to 5.1 gigahertz
using the NZXT camp software we also
added some juice on the GPU as well now
i know domme you had some time to test
the pc around tell me how long it takes
right out to boot your pc compared to
the pc back at home so this guy boots in
just about 12 seconds which is
absolutely insane over the roughly 40
seconds it would take my other PC to
boot so all around much improved that's
a big difference actually well there's
also a significant difference in loading
games that also applies to loading maps
and loading safe data so it's going to
enhance your overall gaming experience
so that way you spend less time waiting
and more time gaming so I know you have
a tech youtube channel as well Daum and
you edit videos for a living how has the
97 Evo helped you on the productivity
side well seriously because this thing
is so fast not only do I get faster
launch times for like applications like
Adobe Premiere but also opening up
projects is a lot faster and even
exporting projects because of the
ridiculous read and write speeds on this
em--to drive is just fast all around and
definitely enhances my productivity so
the reason why you're actually noticing
a difference in speed does not only due
to the higher read and write speeds but
also because of the intelligent turbo
write technology the 97 Evo basically
identifies the user workload and gives
it the appropriate buffer to simplify
things it works great on their heavy
workload so it's perfect for editing
videos and also using any software
that's the back beat so that about wraps
up the video Dom what do you think of
your new
see well it matches the channel colors
it's super fast and I'm excited to put
this 970 Evo to the test with my editing
and gaming so thank you so much for that
