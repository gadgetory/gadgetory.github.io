to show you the process of unlocking
your Samsung Galaxy Note 4 smartphone so
you can use it with any carrier or
country you like for this demonstration
I will be using my locked t-mobile
Galaxy Note 4 and unlock it so I can use
it on my AT&amp;amp;T network but you can use
this video as a guide for any carrier
you like so first off we need to get the
unlock code to start the unlocking
process one of the best and most
trusting websites that I use to get my
unlock codes is the unlocking company
comm because the prices are unbeatable
and their customer service is the best
in the market so head on over to the
unlocking company comm and select your
phone manufacturer and phone model from
the drop down list and the next page go
ahead and select the country the phone
was originally purchased from and the
carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is t-mobile before
we continue we need the IMEI number of
the phone and the way you look that up
on your phone is to open up the dial pad
and enter in star pound zero 6-pound
once the phone displays the IMEI number
you have to go back on the website and
enter that in once everything is filled
out so let's get a locking code and that
will take you to the final screen where
you have to check out after checking out
they will email you your unlock code the
price and delivery time of your code
varies by phone but don't worry because
they deliver their codes much faster
than any other unlocking website so
before we continue make sure that the
phone is powered off next remove the
backplate of the note 4 and the battery
as well so you can gain access to the
SIM tray then go ahead and insert the
SIM card that you wish to use with the
phone I want to use the note 4 with my
ATM network so I am putting in my AT&amp;amp;T
SIM card if your SIM card does not fit
properly then you have to adjust the
size I have left a link in the
description section to show you how
that's done after you insert your SIM
card in the phone go ahead and put back
your battery and the backplate and power
your phone back on once the phone boots
up go ahead and leave the lock screen
and immediately a prompt will appear
asking you to enter in the lock code
after entering in the lock code that you
received from the locking company your
phone will take you straight to the home
screen and your phone will be
permanently unlocked as you can see here
I am using my t-mobile note 4 on an 18
at work so that's how you unlock your
Galaxy Note 4 if this video helped you

questions at all feel free to leave them

will answer them as soon as possible
