say that I'm like 90% there but it's a
lot better than last week where I
sounded like a dying giraffe so I'm
sorry that you guys had to sit through
that entire episode my deepest
condolences but anyways welcome to setup
wars episode 125 budget Edition where
we're gonna be looking at some setups
based on a budget we've got some high
end budgets we got some low end budgets
so let's grab our wallets put a run in
front of us let's hold hands and cry
while watching this episode because
we're gonna realize that most of these
setups are still better than what we
have at home well if the set-up wars
begin before you guys skip straight to
the setups I wanna let you know that
Skullcandy recently released their new
hash three wireless headphones which is
an affordable alternative to the
Crushers they released not too long ago
these are much lighter they offer a 22
hour battery life with rapid charge
allowing you to get 4 hours of play time
in just 10 minutes of charging it
features 40 millimeter drivers that
sound incredible with a nice heavy bass
and you get noise isolation thanks to
the comfy memory-foam cushions that wrap
around your ear you can fold it and take
it with you wherever you go and they
come in several different colors I know
I said that the Crushers were my main
pair of headphones but honestly these
are more my style the extra base from
the Crushers were a little too much for
me and personally I didn't take
advantage of it and plus these are in
red so they match my color scheme even
better and it's lighter and more
portable
so I'll doubling below case you guys
want to check it out I get a huge things
to Skullcandy for sponsoring this video
kicking off the episode we got Manny and
a very clean black and orange setup
featuring a single 27-inch monitor from
Ben Q that's hooked up against a custom
backboard that he made in fact his
entire desk was custom built and he
designed it in 3dsmax nothing says
budget then building your very own desk
I mean at least this way you can
customize it to fit your needs
he built a dedicated spot for his PC on
the bottom left and he attached a USB
hub next to it it is currently rocking
an i-5 35 70 and a GT 6
and aside from the PC he also has a
MacBook Pro for the portability factor a
few things I really like about this
setup the f1 hangar that he made for his
Colton gaming headset the shelves to
store his ps4 games and the cable
management he took advantage of his
entire back board and tucked the rest of
the cables and power strips underneath
the desk in a pull out drawer he did
keep the surface area nice and tidy
thanks to the wireless peripherals and
he did a nice job hiding the wires from
both the West our speakers like I said
earlier this is a very clean setup I
feel like the only thing that's really
missing are some black and orange skins
for your ps4 I mean if you made the
extra effort to skin your macbook why
not skin the console as well I feel like
it can use some orange to give it a nice
contrast against the black drawer
underneath man he also stated that his
PC isn't powerful enough to play games
so he's only using it for productivity
while he games mainly on his ps4 now I
know what you guys are thinking if you
actually use the money that he spent on
the ps4 and all of those ps4 games he
would have built himself a really nice
gaming PC and you're right
I'm actually not gonna defend him in
this episode because I have no excuses
but those were his choices based on his
budget I mean I do feel like there are a
few pricey tech pieces in this setup but
overall there definitely was a budget
involved otherwise he would have picked
up better speakers a better headset a
better PC and better peripherals
regardless this is a very clean and
organized black and orange setup props
on all the custom work and thank you
Manny for entering speaking of clean and
budget setups Miguel is next up he's
rocking the 24-inch AOC monitor that's
sitting on top of the IKEA Mount
understand and below that we got the
Logitech k810 keyboard and the MX master
mouse combo once again we have another
wireless setup so Ferrario is rocking a
pair of JBL pebble speakers and the
popular Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones
so someone pointed out to me a few
episodes on setup wars that I was using
the word symmetry incorrectly picked
this set up for example so the monitor
and the two speakers are considered
symmetrical however the headset and the
here plant are asymmetrical even though
they complement each other they are not
the same size hence why I was incorrect
to call them symmetrical
I know these are very technical terms
and most of you guys don't even care
about this because you know what I'm
trying to say but I want to be as
accurate as possible in my videos so
again a huge thanks to whoever was that
pointing it out in the comment section I
appreciate it
probably the setup as an Asus laptop
with an i7 36th nqm processor whatever
the hell that is
eight gigs of ram and a GT 650 M clearly
McHale didn't have a budget for an
actual gaming PC cable management is
very clean thanks to the net that comes
with the IKEA desk and everything else
has tucked away behind the alex' or a
very clean and simplistic setup not much
I can recommend here Thank You Mikkel
for entering a number three we got
Stefan and a slightly higher budget set
up featuring a 24 inch Samsung monitor
sitting on the Satechi monitor stand and
a 32 inch high sense TV up top for
peripherals he's using the popular red
dragon K 55 3 keyboard which by the way
is a solid $35 mechanical keyboard I
featured it a few times on the channel
and it's one of the best mech keyboards
you can buy under 50 bucks definitely
check it out if you guys are interested
I'll leave a link below the mouse is
from combat or wink I think that's how
you say it and it kind of looks like a
ripoff of the Mad Catz Mouse if I'm
being Frank but nonetheless Steven
stayed consistent with the black and red
color scheme so props to him speaking of
color scheme he's rocking a sweet black
and red Mini ITX gaming PC featuring the
6600 K and a gtx 1050 TI but that's not
a budget PC it actually has good specs
not quite it's still based on a budget
because if he didn't have a budget he
would have picked up a 10 60 or even a
10 70 so you guys see what I'm trying to
say here do you see now why this is
setup wars budget Edition and not poor
edition speaking of his PC he does have
a 13 inch Asus laptop resting next to
his iPad Mini in the corner I will give
you points on those wall shelves it's a
great way to add additional storage
space while improving the look of this
most people use hangers to hang their
headphones but Steven uses it to hang
his mini guitar Ferrario is rocking the
Harman Kardon 2.1 desktop speakers and
has Sennheiser urbanite XL headphones
hanging underneath the desk cable
management is also on point for the most
part I'm glad that you tied both the
keyboard and mouse wires together and it
looks like he made his very own cable
raceway he using some white duct tape
but other than that it's looking pretty
good also that's a cool looking USB hub
that he hooked up underneath the desk
I mean it's got some crappy reviews on
it from Amazon but it does look pretty
dope not a bad budget setup Thank You
Steven for entering coming in at number
4 is Vince and his lightly themed Star
Wars setup featuring a 24-inch BenQ
monitor
we got the courser k 65 keyboard and the
me onyx cast their Mouse it also looks
like he's going with the black and red
theme
judging by the LEDs on the desk he's got
a pair of Logitech Z 340 speakers an
Xbox one controller he's also got a
smart phone on a stand and a few Star
Wars props the blue Yeti microphone has
an unusual spot on top of the PC so if
you have the extra budget I strongly
recommend a boom arm for that and you
can actually hook it up on the side of
your table it's gonna make it way more
convenient for you for cable management
I think that the Signum rack was a bit
overkill since you don't have much on
there I feel like a simple Raceway would
have sufficed especially considering
that you don't have any power strips or
anything bulky on there it's just wires
so yeah I recommend either a Raceway or
even some cable sleeves would have
worked just fine there the PC power in
the setup is equipped with an i3 6100
and in a suit Strix 1060 C now this is a
PC bill that actually makes sense
to use a stock heatsink he's using a
locked CPU so there is no need for an
aftermarket cooler so good work Vince it
looks like you did your homework or
maybe just watch a lot of tech stores
videos the only thing that really
bothered me with those random black
squares on the back board underneath
your desk but other than that it's a
dope setup Thank You Vince for entering
wrapping up the episode we got Walter
White and his extreme budget set up and
I say extreme budget because he's
a plastic bin as a monitor riser to hold
up his 24-inch samsung display and if
that isn't budget enough the desk he's
using consists of four legs that he
picked up from eco center and the
tabletop is an old door of a friend of
his that's right his desk is an actual
door for peripherals he's using the Fuji
tech portable bluetooth keyboard and
that's paired with the gigabyte Thor m7
Mouse he's also using two headphones one
of them is a bluetooth headphone and the
other one is the Siberia prism 3 headset
that actually broke down during a road
trip which he later fixed according to
his notes by the way I'm liking your
budget headphone hangers on your PC and
speaking of pcs is actually an
interesting build so the case itself is
made up of three junk pcs which he ended
up painting in black afterwards in terms
of hardware it's actually not that bad
it has an i5 4460 16 gigs of ram and an
AMD rx 470 aside from the PC he also has
a console in fact he's still rocking the
original ps3 system from 2006 the fact
that it's still running even after 11
years is incredible and finally we got
the cable management and I have mixed
feelings about it I mean he did tie the
cables together and use duct tape to
cover the cable on the ground but
aesthetically it doesn't look that great
I'm not sure what your reasoning was
behind the duct tape and routing the
cables in that direction
but if you can I do recommend the wall
Raceway which will look a lot cleaner
also props on your self-made cable
management net underneath the desk
that's actually a pretty clever idea
overall you did make this setup work
despite your tight budget and since we
are hanging stuff on the side of your PC
I do recommend these super cheap
controller hangers that you can hook up
on the side of your PC for the ps3
controllers but other than that and the
wall raceway that I recommended earlier
it's a pretty decent setup Thank You
Walter for entering so that wraps up
this episode of setup wars which one of
these setups will take home the crown
