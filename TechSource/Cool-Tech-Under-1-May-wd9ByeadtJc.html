and welcome to this month's cool tech
episode this time we are looking at tech
under a dollar for the third and final
time on this channel and everything I
mentioned in this video will be linked
below so that wasting any more time
let's dive right in starting up the
episode is this pair of earbuds that
features a zipper closing mechanism yep
these are earbuds with a zipper and I
think that's pretty cool the zipper
actually works really well surprisingly
it helps keep the earbuds from being
tangled up it also features a remote
with a built-in mic so you can actually
accept calls with it but as far as sound
quality these are probably the worst
sounding earphones I have ever heard the
low end is flatter than Natalie
Portman's personality and the mids and
highs are very muddy it's kind of like
listening to music in a jar I mean sure
it looks cool with a zipper feature but
I wouldn't spend anything over a dollar
for these next up we have something that
I actually use to unbox my stuff this
year is a credit card shaped knife it
has the same thickness of 2 and 1/2
credit cards it can basically be folded
into a fully functioning knife this
thing is no joke it's pretty damn sharp
there is a locking mechanism that lets
you lock the blade in place so it
doesn't accidentally pop out while it's
in your pocket and end up stabbing you
if you have a wallet phone case like I
do then this should fit in there with no
problems this next item is pretty
straightforward it's a 4 port USB hub
and I featuring it in this video since
it's under $8 if you make youtube videos
or use a camera then this handy tool may
be of use to you it's basically a lens
cleaning kit and one on one end is a
brush that lets you clean off any dust
from the lens and on the other end is a
microfiber tip that helps clean more
aggressive smudges or dirt without
damaging the lens the same kit goes for
around $7 everywhere else so I thought
it was pretty cool that you can buy one
for less than a dollar and finally we
have a lens add-on for your smartphone
it comes with a keychain so you can hook
it up to your keys and basically gives
your camera a wider fish-eye look once
you slap it on your phone part of the
lens still shows up which is pretty
annoying but I mean it's only 77 cents
speaking of budget I want to introduce
you guys to tink which is a carrier that
offers much cheaper rates on your
monthly phone bill on average people who
use ting pay
23 bucks a month per device and there's
even a calculator on their website that
will tell you how much money you'll be
saving each month I decided to have fun
with it and put in my info and I found
that that I could be saving over 40
bucks a month if I make the switch team
will also cover 25% of your cancellation
fee up to $75 if you're stuck in a
contract and they also have coverage on
to nationwide networks both CDMA and GSM
networks you guys can check out the
coverage map by visiting the link below
so before you guys do anything make sure
to visit Texas teen comm and mess around
with the savings calculator just to see
how much money you could be potentially
saving each month if you guys do end up
signing up you can get $25 and teen
credit or towards the device of your
choice but I'll leave a link down below
if anyone is interested in checking it
out that's basically a thing guys so
much for watching if you enjoy my
monthly cool tech deals make sure to
leave a like and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
