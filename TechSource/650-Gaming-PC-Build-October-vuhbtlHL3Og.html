Texas and welcome to the budget build
for the month of October this is Z on
the $650 gaming PC and like all my
budget builds on the channel there will
be a how to build guide for anyone that
wants to buy the parts and build one for
themselves if the video is uploaded you
can find a link to it along with all the
parts featured in this video down below
zeon is currently the best possible
gaming and productivity PC that anyone
can build for only 650 bucks and I got
benchmarks to validate that claim so we
have an Intel i5 4690k quad core
processor and a CM 212 Evo CPU cooler
for the motherboard I went with an ace
Rugby 85 and micro ATX board a gtx 950
super clock graphics card eight
gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance ram with
a memory speed of 1600 megahertz and one
terabyte of storage from Seagate
powering all of these parts is the 500
watt power supply from EVGA and
everything is packed neatly inside the
popular NZXT source 210 case so we're
getting lots of questions on why I went
with the 4690k CPU with a locked chipset
motherboard instead of going with the 44
60 CPU well as I said before I want this
PC to be great at gaming and
productivity and the 4690k
offers both better single and multi-core
performance which is great for editing
and other productivity type tasks
however if you guys want to go with a
strictly gaming PC then yes you can swap
out the 4690k with the 4460 you can save
like 50 bucks and you can either put
that towards a gtx 960 or dare I even
say an r9 380 you guys can also save
another 30 bucks by not buying the CPU
cooler like I did for this build so
that's like a total of $80 you can save
on this build
you can put towards a graphics card but
the reason why I went with the 212 Evo
is because it's currently one of the
best bang for your buck budget CPU
coolers that anyone can buy and it's
extremely extremely quiet this is how
quiet it is while gaming
yeah it's practically that silent while
gaming that's one of the reasons why I
picked this up instead of going with the
stock CPU cooler now with always
thinking about time that
go and check out the temps of the PC
before we jump into the gaming
benchmarks so an idle we get cpu temps
between 27 and 36 degrees Celsius
whereas the GPU sticks to a constant 32
degrees now at max load we can see the
CPU temps maxing out at 50 degrees
whereas GPU gets up to 71 but do keep in
mind that these are max low temps during
benchmarks and the PC won't reach these
temps while gaming for Cinebench r15
Gyan scored one sixteen point five 40
fps and ascend a bench score of 552 for
geek bench we have a 36 58 for single
core and an 11717 for the multi-core
last but not least we have the popular
fire strike benchmark and Xeon scored a
58 45 now due to high demand I have
listed the benchmark scores of my
previous budget build side-by-side so
you guys can see so my previous budget
builds were as Orion and Orion for the
months of May and July and here are the
fire strike benchmark scores so starting
next month I will add Geekbench scores
as well next up we have a rendering test
so I use these settings in Sony Vegas
Pro 13 and rendered a 4k raw video file
that I shot on my GH 4 by the way I will
have the video file available for
download if anyone wants to compare
rendering speeds with their current pcs
so Z I render the 60 second 4k file in
just under 7 minutes alright so moving
on to the best part of the video the
gaming benchmarks if there's a game you
guys didn't see in a test make sure to
let me know by dropping a comments down
below and I'll pick it up and benchmark
it for my next PC build also the frame
counter will be live on the top left of
the screen so you guys can check out
that without wasting any more time let's
start the test
you
all right so that's a for the benchmarks
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did and want me to continue doing
these budget builds every month
let me know by leaving a like on the
video to show your support

huge thanks to lynda.com for making this
video possible so beginning lots of
questions on what gear I used to fill my
videos or what software I use to edit
and even color grade my videos and to be
honest I learned them myself online and
