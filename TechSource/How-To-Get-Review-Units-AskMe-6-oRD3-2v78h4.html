questions to be answered and if you guys
have any questions that you want to ask
me feel free to reach me on Twitter with
the hashtag ask Edgar and I'll go ahead
and save that question for my next
month's ask me video though that we sing
it over time let's jump into this video
first question comes from Jordan gaming
and he asks how many Ed's does it take
to screw in
all right I just move on to the next
question this one comes from Jim and
he's asking have you ever pissed on your
laptop actually I did there was one time
in Vegas where I got really really waste
what's your life's most regretting
decision ever made the only decision I
regret is not starting YouTube earlier
if I started this when YouTube was just
starting out I would be at a much higher
place definitely at least a few million
subscribers but honestly other than that
I have no other major regrets what is
the most expensive piece of tech you
have ever bought that obviously goes to
the camera I'm using the film this video
the Panasonic gh4 do you have a degree
in something believe it or not I
actually don't have a degree and
anything
no but honestly I was just a few classes
away from finishing up my AAA in
Community College
but then work took over and then I was
doing YouTube part-time so I just didn't
have enough time to focus on my school
so yeah that's what happened which is
the first step that you open when you
wake up
so the first step I open up is the
YouTube studio app and I like to check
my previous video and a few videos
before that just to see how well it's
doing on YouTube as well as we the
comments that you guys are leaving me on
my videos and I can respond to them
really quickly the app is amazing I love
checking out my analytics to see what
videos are working so well with me and
what videos aren't and I probably check
it every 30 minutes to an hour which is
way too much if you have to be stuck in
a room with another person for 24 hours
with nothing else in the room who would
it be
definitely would say my girlfriend so
you know we can talk about politics and
stuff so we don't get bored
how do you approach exponentially larger
companies for review units when you are
a small channel on YouTube I actually
get this question asked many times in
different forms but the best way is just
to send them an email a professional
well-written email explaining what you
plan on doing with the product and how
it's going to benefit the the company
that you're promoting another thing
that's really helped us out in the past
when we were starting out just like some
of you guys is that we actually went out
there bought the products and we did the
video and then we would send it to the
companies and they would look at them
and most of them would respond back
saying wow that's a really good job
thank you so much for promoting the
product and then they would send
additional review units so if you're
starting out that's also another way to
do things
can you speak Russian if yes speak a
little bit now even though I was born in
Moscow Russia I don't speak any Russian
actually I used to speak question when I
was a kid but when I moved here in the
States I started speaking in Armenian
and English and I completely forgotten
my Russian language so thank you mom for
that if you weren't a youtuber what
would you be doing for a living I don't
know honestly don't know what I want to
even think about it I used to work for a
bank probably that's what I'd be doing
just because I know banking so well but
yeah thank God I'm doing YouTube if you
could get one thing for free to add or
change your setup what would it be um
honestly I don't know I'm really happy
with the way my setup is I don't think I
would change anything
probably just a better PC what languages
do you speak so I only speak two
languages Armenian and English so yeah
believe it or not English is my third
language and a lot of guys don't know
that if you hit a million subscribers
what will you do probably jump off a
bridge with all of the excitement I
don't know honestly I've never even
thought about that probably do a special
giveaway and a thank you video to all my
amazing subscribers that have been
supporting me for such a long time
yeah something like that or maybe even
something even more crazy you have no
idea but until that happens we will see
what is your favorite movie my number
one movie of all time is definitely old
boy the original not the remake
absolutely love that movie are we going
to see a website anytime soon also some
more t-shirt designs I actually talked a
little bit about this on my previous ask
me video but I do have a website it's
not an official or like real well done
website it's just there to host my gear
list and you guys can find the link to
that down below if you guys want to
check that out but I'm not gonna be
running a full time website because
there's just too much work to maintain
it as far as my t-shirts I will be
making some t-shirts that you guys can
purchase later in November or December
maybe even in January but they'll be
definitely a video to update you guys on
that but it's basically it yeah anyways
thank you guys so much for watching if
you guys have any questions feel free to
follow me on Twitter and send me a tweet
with the hashtag ask Edgar and I'll
feature your question in the next video
thank you guys so much for watching I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
