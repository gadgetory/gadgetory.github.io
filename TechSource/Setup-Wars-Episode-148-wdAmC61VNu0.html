welcome back to setup wars episode 148
we used too much desk setup to get
featured on the channel and if you want
to participate you know what to do
make sure to watch the video linked down
below with that said let the setup words
begin kicking off the episode as angel
and his insane quad display gaming setup
he also uses this for school video
editing and screaming that's good
because if it was only for gaming it
would have been seriously overkill I
mean it's overkill either way but at
least it's making good use of all the
monitors it also looks like he went with
a black and purple color scheme and he
kept that consistent throughout the RGB
lights from the keyboard mouse and mouse
pad for audio looks like he's using the
LG sound bar with the subwoofer and some
headphones we got these status audios
and the Skullcandy crusher by the way
those are awesome pair of headphones the
bass on those are insane it feels like
there are subwoofers right inside your
ear and you can actually feel them
vibrate it's pretty cool what's also
insane is that desk choice really and
IKEA linman you have a very expensive
setup I mean couldn't you have at least
spent a little more and got something
more sturdy you got a lot of stuff on
that flimsy desk and it's starting to
bow in the center I will give you props
on picking up an extra linman desk just
to hold up your PC Angel is probably
like screw that I'm not putting my PC on
the floor so he picked up an extra desk
and you put the PC on top of that nicely
done this beauty is rocking an 8700 K 16
gigs of ram and ladies and gentlemen 210
70s and SL I actually I take back the
beauty part what the hell is going on
with those cables dude speaking of
cables what in the name of Satan's ass
crack is this are you seriously using
tape to hold up your cables I mean have
you not seen the past 137 episodes of
setup wars I apologize if you're new to
the channel but I always recommend the
same thing almost every episode jhi
Raceway cable sleeves cable clips velcro
straps hell if you're really lazy just
pick up a signal from Ikea and call it a
day there should be no excuse using tape
for cable management come on you know I
really like the setup I really do but
please fix the cables the right way and
getting stronger desk because that's
about a fall apart any day now Thank You
angel for entering next up is Carl and
his setup for work and play emphasis on
work because we do have an ultra-wide
from LG which is actually the monitor I
recently upgraded
it's great for productivity but not so
much gaming
he's also got two LG TVs mounted against
the wall and a Dell monitor hooked up to
his MacBook on the side you guys know
that I prefer I cleaner looks all that
stuff on the desk while useful to Carl
is a bit too much for me however I do
like that he mounted the speakers on the
wall otherwise would have been more
cluttered if he kept it on the desk
under the desk is where his PC is and
it's got some nice specs you got a 77
jack a 32 gigs of ram and a gtx 1080
which is more than enough to max out any
game
however the ultrawide monitor is
limiting its potential since it's capped
at 75 Hertz also if you're using
programs that take advantage of multiple
cores like editing software designing
modelling then that quad-core cpu you
have isn't the best choice by the way
the power supply is installed upside
down I do recommend for you is to flip
it around so it sucks cold air from the
outside inside the case and a PC stand
like this one which will keep the PC off
the carpet that way it's not sucking in
dirt or dust also it's gonna be a lot
easier to move around in case you need
to reach the back to plug stuff in or
out overlooking the keyboard why are
going across the desk I gotta give you
props on the rest of the cable
management using those wall raceways to
hide the wires coming down from the TVs
and the speakers was a great idea with
that said you do have a great
productivity and gaming setup I just
need some minor changes Thank You Carl
for entering a number 3 is Jason and his
gaming and streaming setup between 229
inch ultra wide monitors from LG I gotta
say this is a very unusual monitor setup
and I've seen this a few times already
on setup Wars normally it's not ideal
putting two ultralights side-by-side
because you won't be able to see the
sides very well if you sit right in the
middle that's just too wide but anyways
on the desk he's got quite the
collection of Funko pops I just wish
there was the same amount on both sides
he's also using a budget keyboard and
mouse from red dragon with the Razer
Firefly mousepad I love that the
mousepad is worth more than both the
keyboard and the mouse combined he
doesn't have any speakers but he does
have a pair of HyperX clouds chilling in
the corner on a headset stand on the
opposite side is where his blue snowball
ice microphone is mountain
very clean job I think that Jason did a
great job not only keeping everything
organized but also staying true to the
white and black color scheme for the
most part the PC pairing at all is
equipped with a 7700 K and a GTX 1060
sadly there aren't any close-up pictures
of the PC to see inside the cable
management on Jason's setup isn't bad I
mean it did use some zip ties to keep
some of the wires organized and
technically nothing is touching the
ground so it's all good in the hood a
very clean gaming and streaming setup
thank you Jason for entering now this
next setup I included on the show for
two reasons and two reasons only first
of all that insane view goddamn and the
incredible photo quality it only makes
sense after all he is a filmmaker and
photographer if you guys send in quality
pictures like these I'm gonna feature
you regardless of the type of setup you
can send me a potato setup using a
toaster as a desk and I'll feature it as
long as the pictures are quality the
setup itself is very simple and its
purpose is obviously productivity he's
got a 2070 MacBook Pro retina we got the
Apple keyboard mouse trackpad and the
iPad pro with the iPhone X I mean this
guy has pretty much every Apple product
available I feel like if Apple made
computer speakers he'll be using those
as well but right now he's using the
bose companion speakers instead I'm not
gonna bash jcu on his cable management
because I know most of the stuff on his
desk need to be disconnected easily in
case he needs to go somewhere so I
understand his situation if he ties the
cables together or routes them through
sleeve then it's gonna be inconvenient
taking it out when he needs to travel I
mean at least he's using a cable box to
hide some of the cables or the power
brakes inside out of all the pictures I
gotta say guys this one is my favorite I
just love the overall mood it's
nighttime outside all the lights inside
are off except a desk lamp overlooking
the city lights now if this doesn't get
you into a productive mood I don't know
what will a simple yet effective setup
Thank You JC for entering and thank you
again for taking your time to shoot
these amazing photos ending the episode
and quite possibly my monetization on
this video because of that wallpaper
we have Tony all the way from Belgium
and has
being set up he's got to deal monitors
one is ultra wide but neither of them
have gaming specs because they are
capped at a 60 Hertz refresh rate I'm
actually curious as to why he picked
these up instead it appears that Tony is
left-handed judging by the placement of
the keyboard and mouse by the way Bravo
on the cable management it just looks so
much cleaner without any wires I also
like what he did for his audio setup
he's using a 5.1 system from Edifier and
he's hooked up the center speaker on the
desk and the other four satellites on
the ceiling he's got two in the front
and two in the back of em so he gets
that true surround sound experience if
he's not immersing himself in surround
sound he's using the Asheville 850
wireless headset which is hanging from a
stand in the corner powering this
awesome setup is this even more awesome
custom loop gaming PC featuring the 8700
K 16 gigs of ram and 2 msi 980 TI s and
SL i beautiful work on the bends and
great choice on the custom cables since
the glass panel is slightly tinted the
white colors pop through nicely I also
see that is using several racks behind
the desk to hold up the wires and you
even hooked up the Parrish tip behind
the back board which is very clever the
only thing I would change in this setup
are the monitors for something with a
higher refresh rate because I feel like
you're not taking advantage of your PC's
full potential other than that it's a
kick-ass gaming setup thank you Tony for
entering and I pretty much wraps up this
episode as always guys dropping a like
is really simple and it helps support
the show and the channel so thank you
guys again so much for watching make
sure you guys are commenting down below
on what setup you think is the best and
unless the winners on my social media
platforms thanks again for watching I
said that three times already I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
