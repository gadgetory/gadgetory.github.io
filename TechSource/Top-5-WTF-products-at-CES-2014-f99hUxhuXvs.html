Squarespace the one tool needed to
create your very own website or
portfolio for free trial or your first
purchase use the Kotex source one for
ten percent off hey guys sex toys here
with some more CES coverage I wanted to
do a special video this time and go over
the top 5 WTF / interesting items we
found at CES 2014 so let's just jump
straight into this coming in at number 5
is dubbed gear with their dub steam
product what you're looking at is a mug
with speaker capabilities that's right
you can now listen to music while
enjoying some nice cold beer this mug
also serves as an insulated so keeps
your cold drinks cool and your hot
drinks warm with that said this gets an
interesting stamp from us this product
is also prototype so if this is
something you guys are interested in
then check out our website for more news
coming in at number 4 is the bandshell
from tjm innovations this is basically a
two in one case for your iPhone 5 or 5s
and it has a sound or which you can pull
out to amplify the speakers which
greatly increases the volume and sound
quality on top of all that it also has a
kickstand which automatically enhances
your viewing experience we walk this
interesting as well at number three we
have lazy hands I really don't know what
to say here this is basically a piece of
velcro attached to a device with holes
made for your fingers so you can hold a
device securely in your hand I guess
lazy aunt is the perfect name for this
product I mean how lazy can you really
be to hold your own tablet or phone it
comes in many different colors which is
a huge plus and look at how elegant the
design is people will surely be jealous
once they see your lazy hands WTF on
this one okay we were debating on
whether or not to include this for this
list but I strongly believe that this
belongs here this is exactly what you
think it is this is an air duster let me
remind you that not only these guys paid
for a booth here at CES but they
traveled all the way from China to
showcase their brand of air dusters I
mean we were speechless when we came
across this booth so much that we had to
do a double take to make sure that we
would not dreamy
this definitely deserves a WTF and now
for number one you may be wondering what
can possibly top an air duster for even
a velcro strap for your devices ladies
and gentlemen prepare your eyes for this
is beyond anything we or you have seen
before I present to you the megaphone
from N and ease this here is a ceramic
meet amplifier for your iPhone device it
basically amplifies the sound from your
iPhone making it sound a little louder
the best part about this is the price
the normal color ones go for 399 euros
and the gold play-doh ones go for 599
euros that's 680 US dollars i mean what
the fee let me remind you that you can
purchase a bose soundlink series 3 music
system for only 250 which sounds much
better and you can even use other phones
to play music so it's not limited to
just an iphone the only reason I see
people buying this is if they are into
art I mean I'm not gonna lie it does
have an elegant design and if money
isn't a concern to you and you're into
these kind of stuff and I don't see why
not well that wraps up all the
interesting and WTF items we saw here at
CES which ones did you guys find most
interesting or strange feel free to
leave a comment down below I'm actually
pretty interested to hear your thoughts
so this concludes our trip to see as
this year I hope you guys enjoyed our
coverage on the cool products we share
with you we wouldn't be here if it
wasn't for you guys so we thank you very
much I also want to thank Squarespace

before I go I want to thank Squarespace
for making this possible and show you
guys our website yeah we do have one in
fact we had a for a while now for those
of you that did not even know it existed
we built it using square space and it
was extremely easy for us I think we got
up and running in less than a day
everything is drag and drop which makes
it super easy to configure and there's a
bunch of awesome templates you can
choose from or you can even start from
scratch like we did this isn't just a
website you can do a lot more with
squarespace you can build your own
portfolio
create an online store and sell stuff
and also scales to look beautiful on any
device the support team is also
available twenty-four-seven if you have
any questions or run into any problems
and they offer live chat and superfast
email responses the best part about all
this is that it's free to try there's no
credit card required to sign up if you
guys do this set is set up an account
use the Opera Kotex source one for ten
percent off their already low prices so
that wraps up the video thanks again for
watching and we'll see you guys next
time
