and welcome to another episode of the
best tech deals of the week for some
reason we have a bunch of really awesome
tech deals to go over but also for my UK
and Canada followers out there I started
looking at a bunch of other places to
bring you guys some really good tech
deals as well so make sure to check the
links below if you're interested
starting off with an awesome deal on the
galaxy s7 right now you can pick up an
unlocked model for two hundred dollars
off from newegg the offer does expire on
the 9th of this month so be sure to jump
on it if you guys have been wanting an
s7 for a while another deal that ends on
a 9th is this shadow rock to cpu cooler
from be quiet that's currently 10 bucks
off we also have a rose will f BM 0 1 pc
case that's going for only 20 bucks
after a ten dollar mail-in rebate and
this is the same pc case i used in my
$350 gaming build for februari by the
way speaking of pc parts the gigabyte
gtx 970 is going for two hundred ninety
bucks after the twenty-dollar mail-in
rebate and you also get a copy of tom
clancy's the division for free the
plantronics gaming headset for the xbox
one and ps4 is going for only thirty
bucks using the code listed on the
screen that's a total of fifty dollars
off of the original price moving over to
newegg flash we have a 27 inch aoc
gaming monitor with the 144 hurts
refresh rate and a one millisecond
response time I can almost guarantee
that you won't find a better deal on a
gaming monitor with these specs anywhere
else 220 bucks with free shipping is
ridiculous there was one more deal that
I can't see the price on it's a sandisk
one terabyte SSD and by the time you
guys are watching this video we will be
available so make sure to check this
page for the price if you're interested
you guys can find a link to that below
popping over to Amazon I found a pair of
noise cancelling headphones that are
eighty-two percent off which is pretty
crazy so I decided to do some research
the actual price is not three hundred
dollars and instead it's only eight
dollars according to their website but
it is still around thirty dollars
cheaper on amazon so I figured I would
include it in this video anyways also an
Amazon is the popular mionix naos 7000
gaming mouse that's going for 47 bucks
and a bitfenix ATX mid tower case that's
ten dollars off the PNY 128 gigabyte
microSD card is currently going for
thirty dollars but
is that a stock currently and more will
be coming in on the seven the Sony
65-inch 1080p smart TV is going for
almost a thousand bucks with a crazy
discount and finally on Amazon is this
15,000 million of our power bank from
maschi that's going for only seventeen
dollars there's also a bunch of cool
tech deals on mastra one of the best
headphones out there which are also
really expensive are the th X zero zeros
that are usually around a thousand bucks
if you're an audiophile I'm sure you've
heard of these but the reviews pretty
much speak for themselves by now 1400
people have purchased this on mass drop
and it's currently going for 450 bucks
which isn't cheap but it's a hell of a
discount from the original price a few
more items on mass drop include these
t1000 wireless earphones that's going
for 25 bucks the roccat myth modular
gaming mouse for $90 and this beautiful
invention which I still use today the
ergo tech freedom arm that's holding up
my monitor for this past year strongly
recommend this as it's one of the best
single monitor mounts you can buy for
the money the jaybird x2's are also
discounted a mass rob along with the pre
onic mechanical keyboard kit now I
personally want to buy something like
this because for one it doesn't have any
letters or numbers and two it's missing
a numpad but this isn't a review and
there are a lot of people out there that
prefers they'll be keyboards like these
finally let's take a look at some deals
from ebay a one terabyte elite edition
xbox one bundle that comes with their
overpriced elite controller Sony's
65-inch 4k smart TV that's going for
1549 with free shipping and a Microsoft
Surface book that's currently
forty-three percent off these things are
pricey as it is and the fact that you
get over a thousand dollars off is a
pretty damn good deal the last item of
this episode is the philips SHP 9500
over the ear headphones that's currently
hundred bucks off I personally never
heard of these so you might want to do
some research before pulling the trigger
but a deal is a deal for my UK followers
out there amazon is having a one-week
special on pc gaming gear from the
fourth of april to the 10th from gaming
laptops two monitors accessories pc
parts and even routers just make sure
