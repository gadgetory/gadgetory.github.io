multiple times a day with variety of
tech products so if you guys live in the
US UK in Canada and want to save money
on your next purchase consider
bookmarking dual source tech and
checking back at least once a day what's
up guys it's that from tech source and
welcome to a Black Friday edition of the
best tech deals of the week now there's
gonna be a long episode but I promise
you guys the deals in this video are
insane and you guys are gonna be saving
tons and tons of money so with that said
let's begin so kicking off the video we
have a few amazing TV deals check this
out guys starting off with a 65 inch
Samsung 4k TV going for only $1000
here's another 65 inch 4k TV but it's
from a less popular brand named Hisense
it's only up at a 64 but based on the
ratings it's not a bad brand you get to
save a few hundred bucks because it's
not one of the mainstream companies now
if you're not a baller but still want a
4k TV then this one is probably your
best option right now for Black Friday
week since you can pick this one up for
only 348 dollars which is actually the
cheapest TV I found for 40 inches here's
a very cool deal for people that are
looking to buy a dashcam for their cars
maybe you have an expensive car or maybe
you just want to protect your investment
either way these cams are awesome first
up is a 1080p wide-angle lens camera for
both front and back that features a 1.5
inch LCD and a super night vision this
thing looks awesome right now it's
actually listed for $190 but if you
enter this code on the screen you can
get it for only a hundred and twenty six
dollars there's also an upgraded version
with a quad HD display which I think
personally is overkill but if you want a
higher quality dashcam then this is it
this was actually going for $130 but
again if you put in this code you can
get it for $90 instead changing things
up let's take a look at some gaming gear
so first up we have the popular Logitech
G 402 mouse that's going for $35
speaking of Logitech there g502 is also
discounted down to $59 and this is the
newer version and features RGB lighting
tunable weight and a balance as well the
Razer Mamba is also discounted $200 down
from 150 and if you guys are looking for
a solid gaming keyboard the Corsair
straight with the Cherry MX brown
switches
has been discounted to $70 which is the
most I've seen on this
keyboard usually they discount this to
$80 instead the popular jaybird x2
earbuds have a huge discount on them as
well they're not going for around $80
compared to 150 quite possibly one of
the best deals right now on a pair of
very solid wireless earbuds if you guys
have been looking around for a very good
looking case then check this out the
Roseville ATX tower with a side window
panel that's going for only 120 dollars
keep in mind that it has a tempered
glass side panel this isn't plastic it
also comes at four pre-installed fans
and a PSU shraddha to cover up the power
supply and the hard drives near the
bottom just overall a very nice looking
case and finally on Amazon we have a
very nice 27 inch curved monitor from
Samsung going for $220 this is a 1080p
panel with AMD freesync and features a
60 Hertz refresh rate and a four
millisecond response time it's not the
best for gaming but if you need
something to spice up your productivity
setup then this will do just fine now
let's take a look at some new egg deals
so starting off is the popular NZXT s340
case that's going for $60 and you also
get $2 off if you put in this code
seriously $2 now this is a solid deal on
a mechanical gaming keyboard check this
out guys this keyboard is going for
ninety dollars on Amazon but you can get
it for only $50 here on new egg it's a
full-size mechanical keyboard with blue
equivalent switches you also get a full
10 key macros RGB backlighting which you
can choose from 13 preset effects
overall a very solid mech keyboard
definitely something I highly recommend
if you guys are shopping around Newegg
has also discounted the new 6850 k-6
core processor from 590 all the way down
to $500 that's an $80 savings on a very
powerful processor which is excellent
for gaming and editing as well here's a
really sweet deal on a mid tower case
from Roseville so $25 after a mail-in
rebate that's pretty hard to beat it has
a black and red color scheme 2 USB 3.0
ports in the front and 3 pre-installed
fans with a PSU shroud I honestly don't
think there's a better case out there
for 25 bucks
here's another huge discount on a gaming
headset so this thing usually goes for
more than $120 so you will be saving a
lot on this it's a closed back full-size
headset with a velour ear
that provide excellent noise isolation
and based on the reviews on both Amazon
and Newegg this thing is a beast
sapphire is having a pretty small sale
on an Rx 484 gigabyte variant which is
going for $185 with a mail-in rebate and
also if you guys are looking for a power
supply for your next build then you
should check out the courser CX 550 M
which is a modular PSU that's going for
30 dollars after the mail and rebates
and also you guys get a $5 discount code
listed on the screen
sticking with PC parts use a solid deal
on a great motherboard so the azrog
z170a is going for $60 after a mail-in
rebate which is actually a really good
deal considering most z170 boards start
at $90 and finally we have two CPU
coolers the first one is the very
popular 212 Evo which does an amazing
job on keeping the temps cool for
overclocking and you guys can get that
for $20 after the mail and rebate and
finally for my enthusiasts out there
that want cooler temps with virtually no
noise at all we have to be quiet dark
Rock pro three cooler going for sixty
dollars this is clearly going for ninety
dollars in Amazon so you will be saving
around 30 dollars on this this is
actually the cooler I'm using on my test
bed believe it or not so that is it for
