welcome to PC Wars episode 10 worst PC
Edition where I go over some of the
worst submissions that I received for PC
Wars so just like the worst setup
edition of setup Wars I'm gonna be
critiquing these builds and as always do
not take anything I say in this video
seriously because I'm doing it for fun
I don't mean anything I say in this
video so with that said the douchebag
hat is going back on and let's go ahead
and start the show never pay full price
for games ever again guys g2a offers the
cheapest CD keys you can find anywhere
check them out by clicking on the link
below so just like before the person
with the worst PC will receive a hundred
bucks hopefully that will go towards the
PC but there will be a strawpoll link
down below you guys can go in and vote
on who you think has the worst PC at the
end of this episode so here are your
five lucky victims we have Gary Hussein
Christian Mike and master I am so so
sorry
starting off the episode is Gary's PC
name the darker than black from a
distance that actually looks like a
pretty cool PC but once you open the
case you will have nightmares for days
the cable management looks like last
night's leftover spaghetti when you got
cables going through drive bays easy to
stop and ask yourself am I doing this
right so this PC is running on a 4790k
that's overclocked to 4.4 and a gtx
980ti are you kidding me i feel so bad
for that 980ti right now for benchmark
so scored a sixteen thousand six twenty
six putting this PC all the way to the
top if you're not going to take the
effort and fix up the cables and why did
you go with a clear side panel the only
thing darker than black is my soul which
has left my body after
at this PC Hussein is next up with
another good-looking PC for my distance
but of course taking a look inside will
make you want to gouge your eyes out I
honestly didn't even care about the
horrible cable management or even the
fact that there is a blue and red LED
fan up top but what was so damn
interesting was this sli bridge that's
just hanging from the GPU I don't mean
to crap on your parade but adding an SLI
bridge to your GPU doesn't make it go
faster so we have a 4790k paired with a
gtx 970 and four benchmarks we got a ten
thousand forty two which ends up taking
second place once again if you don't
care about cable management please don't
pick up a case with a clear side panel
guys and what's more depressing is that
he added LEDs inside to make the parts
stand out more christian is next up with
this abomination that's right ladies and
gentlemen I don't know if this was a
troll or if he actually was serious that
this would stand a chance and PC wars we
have a tiny-ass eighty millimeter fan in
the back which looks like it's about to
fall off we have a random piece of the
PC on the floor of the case and a
cluster of cables everywhere I'm sorry I
offer exaggerated guys I was a little
too harsh on this PC I mean clearly he
cares about his cable management just
look at the zip ties he used to tie the
cables together the PC couldn't even run
five strike without crashing so I don't
have any benchmark scores for you guys
let alone other pictures to show you
because probably this is the best angle
of the PC Mike is next up with his PC
named Theodore so this one has a closed
side panel which means that he is the
smartest one out of the rest in this
episode popping the cover open and we
are greeted by a pleasant surprise Mike
Mike Mike my good friend you have your
power supply upside down what the hell
were you thinking so inside this PC we
have an FX 4350 and an r9 280 and for
benchmarks it's called a 5345 taking
third place for this episode which leads
to the final contestant
Nasr now this dude has a water-cooled PC
so you might be asking Edgar what's a
water-cooled PC doing on this episode
let's take a look yes what you are
looking at is a water-cooled PC running
on an FX 8350 and a GTX 9
I think the scariest thing besides the
tubing is the fact that there are no
fans on the freakin radiator itself I
mean he went with one of the biggest
radiators to fit in this case no wonder
there's no room for any fans now let's
take a moment and look at the tubing I
mean couldn't you at least try and cut
them to make them shorter what sir
although this tubes lying around and
lastly for benchmark set scored an 80
365 taking third place for this episode
so that will do it for this episode of
PC Wars there is a strawpoll link down
below so make sure you guys go and click
and vote on who you think has the worst
custom PC and the loser will be
announced on my Twitter and Instagram
accounts on Sunday or on 15th I should
say it's basically I hope no one was
butthurt watching this video like I said
in the beginning I did this for fun
nothing I say or said in this video
should be taken seriously it's basically
if you guys enjoy these worst set up
editions or worst peace editions make
sure to leave a like and let me know in
the comment section down below I'll
probably do these every 10 episodes but
anyways let me know guys I know haven't
stopped talking thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll see you in the
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
