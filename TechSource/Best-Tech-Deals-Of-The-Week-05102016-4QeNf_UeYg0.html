welcome to another best tech deals of
the week video surprisingly we don't
have any GPU deals this week even though
nvidia announced their 1080 and 1070
GPUs but i think we'll most likely see
those deals in the next few weeks so
make sure you guys are subscribe to the
channel so you don't miss out on some
amazing graphics card deals starting off
let's take a look at some really great
deals on ebay first up you have an xbox
one system that's selling like hotcakes
it's going for only 195 but keep in mind
that is refurbished uncharted 4
pre-orders are going for ten dollars
less than retail only on ebay so if you
guys I've been wanting to get your hands
on one make sure to snag it right now I
actually cancelled my pre-order on
amazon and bought this one just to save
that extra 10 bucks next up we have
probably the best deal in this entire
video we have a motherboard and cpu
bundle you get the 6700 k and a gigabyte
Z 170 board just for 389 dollars keep in
mind that the motherboard goes for
around one hundred twenty dollars and
the CPU goes for around 350 so instead
of paying 466 dollars you're only paying
389 so you're basically saving $77 going
with this bundle and finally on ebay we
have a dope deal and a macbook for all
of my Apple users out there the 13.3
inch macbook pro with retina display is
going for 1,200 bucks which has a $300
price cut we all know that finding
discounts on apple products is almost
impossible so this one is definitely a
good find not that many deals on amazon
this time around we do have an LG 34
inch ultra white monitor that's going
for eight hundred dollars and this is
the monitor I used for about a year on
the channel without any complaints we
also have a corsair 750d full tower case
that's going for 95 bucks and I've never
actually heard of this website but
apparently they have a sweet deal on a
real cat cone mouse and a chrome sense
mouse pad for only 25 dollars so not bad
on newegg we have the asus 28 inch 4k
monitor that's discounted to 430 dollars
a 34 inch ultra wide monitor from AOC
that's going for five hundred seventy
bucks which is actually cheaper than the
LG ultra wide monitor I just mentioned
and finally I newegg a pretty cool deal
on a 480 gigabyte SSD
PNY that's only a hundred dollars
speaking of ssds we have a 512 gigabyte
SSD from sandisk going for a little bit
more on newegg flash and a triple
monitor arm from roseville that can
support 3 26 inch monitors that's going
for 160 dollars wrapping up the video
let's take a quick look at some deals
from mass drop the roccat nith MMO
gaming mouse is going for $90 a super
tiny drone is going for around thirty
dollars and the kanto u5 speaker system
is seriously discounted down to two
hundred seventy bucks and lastly my
personal favorite monitor arm that i use
for myself is actually going for sixty
dollars and this thing is usually around
ninety dollars so you would be saving
about twenty bucks if you were to pick
it up from mass drop instead that's
basically it for all the deals a really
short episode this week but for my UK
and Canada followers make sure you guys

really dope deals for you guys it's
