before the year ends I want to go over
three separate PC configurations for all
types of budgets starting with a
non-tree level 1080p gaming PC for less
than $500 then we have a mid-range
$1,000 gaming and streaming PC with an
RT X 2070 and for the ballers out there
that want to build a beast 4k gaming
machine that can also be used for
streaming content creation and pretty
much anything else really then I got one
just for you that cost three thousand
dollars I'm also going to be building
one of these pcs on the channel but I
want you guys to vote and let me know
which one in the comment section down
below I'll be doing a full build guide
as well as an overclocking tutorial with
Windows installation and all that so do
keep that in mind also this video get
6,000 likes I will pick one random
person in the comments section and I
will send over the parts for the budget
PC which is the first PC I'm gonna be
talking about in this video and if you
guys live outside of the country I'm
just gonna send you five million dollars
in cash so that we can avoid customs and
shipping costs and stuff like that
winner will be announced January 15th on
my Twitter account also since Christmas
is around the corner I teamed up with
MSI on their best tech gift ideas under
1225 if you guys are interested in it
I'll drop a link to it down below
alright so the first build is gonna cost
you a little less than $500 and that's
including the Windows 10 CD key which
you can buy for just $15 we're going
with the 2,200 G quad-core processor
which offers a lot of performance for
the money the 2200 G is very popular in
budget builds because of the overclock
ability you can easily push it to 3.8
gigahertz on the stock cooler or 3.9 if
you're lucky there's a great tutorial on
overclocking which I will link below if
you guys want to check it out
I didn't want to cheap out on the
motherboard and I wanted something with
future expandability so the b4 50m
bazooka from MSI has a decent price and
some nice features for starters it
supports overclocking it has four dimm
slots m-dot to support and three fan
headers the board does support ram up to
34 66 megahertz but we're going with two
sticks for a total of eight gigs at 3000
megahertz from team Vulcan which fits
perfectly within our budget and since we
do have two extra them slots on the
board you can always add an extra a gigs
of ram in the future if you do end up
upgrading for storage we're keeping it
simple with a one terabyte hard drive
from Hitachi
however if you have a slightly higher
budget consider buying a 120 gigabyte
SSD for the operating system for the GPU
I went with the rx 574 gigabyte card
because that's currently the best bang
for your buck GPU under $200 for 1080p
gaming when you look at the benchmarks
you can see that it outperforms the gtx
1050 TI in almost every game it's also
cheaper than the GTX 1050 TI by around
20 dollars making it the obvious choice
for this budget build you can go with
any rx 574 gigabyte card out there just
make sure you're not spending more than
$150 on the GPU the case we're going
with is super cheap it's only $27 and
it's from Rosewell I try to save as much
money as I could on the case but at the
same time not get something really
crappy for the price it's actually not a
bad case it's got a see-through side
panel four USB ports in the front two of
which are USB 3 and it comes with two
pre-installed fans we got a single 120
millimeter fan in the front and an 80
millimeter fan for the rear it's
definitely not the best looking case out
there but for $27 I think it's a steal
finally powering the PC is a family
white bronze certified power supply from
EVGA which is going for $38 if you plan
on picking up a Windows 10 CD key for
$15 that will bring your total up to
$4.99 and 44 cents before tax and
shipping
so that's your on tree-level gaming PC
on the $500 now let's move on to
something with a little more power
this build is for anyone that wants to
game in quad HD resolution over 60 fps
or wants to max up most games and 1080p
in the highest settings over a hundred
FPS this build is gonna cost you a
little over a thousand dollars but this
time we're going with the horizon 5 2600
for several reasons first of all once
you overclock the 2600 you will get
pretty much the same performance as the
2600 X it just doesn't make any sense
spending an extra 45 dollars to get the
same thing in almost all the benchmarks
the performance is nearly identical
you can even overclock the CPU using the
stock cooler it can easily hit anywhere
from four to four point three gigahertz
the second reason is that the 2600 is on
par with the i3 8400 when it comes to
1440p gaming and it's 55 dollars cheaper
than the i-5 so you're getting more bang
for your buck the motherboard we're
going with is the B 450 M
it's a micro ATX board but it also has
two PCI slots it's got support for two m
dot 2 SSDs and four dimm slots it even
has some wide UB lighting on the side
and two additional RGB headers on the
board this is a really popular microwave
TX board and it's been sold up for a
while now so make sure to check back
after Christmas if you want to pick one
up for RAM we're sticking with the usual
eight gigs from team Vulcan at 3000
megahertz but once again and there is
room for two additional sticks if needed
for storage we're going with a simple
one terabyte hard drive from WV once
again guys I'm focusing more on gaming
performance so feel free to throw it and
then dot 2 or an SSD if you like now for
the graphics card we're going with the
our TX 2070 with this GPU you will
either gain comfortably in 1440p over 60
FPS or if your gaming in 1080p you can
expect average frames over 100 in max
settings across most games according to
the benchmarks the case I picked up for
this build is the do case or do Cassie
from deep cool I don't even know how you
say that which is an all-white mid tower
case and as a clear side panel with a
single USB 3 port in the front and the
case comes with 2 pre-installed fans
there's a lot of good-looking cases out
there between 50 and 60 dollars so this
one doesn't look appealing to you then
feel free to look around for something
that does finally powering the build is
a 650 watt power supply from Rosewill
this is actually a really good price for
a fully modular power supply that's gold
certified this entire build will cost
you a little over a thousand dollars
before tax and shipping but it's a solid
gaming and streaming PC which can also
be used for productivity since it does
have 6 cores and 12 threads so when the
applications that utilize multiple cores
will take advantage of this build that's
been at least for my ballers out there
we have a souped up gaming machine and
that will keep you happy and satisfied
for a long time and this is for anyone
that wants to game comfortably in 4k
resolution or someone that is looking
for a PC that can handle heavy
multi-core applications or maybe someone
that wants both you can pretty much do
anything with this configuration but
you're gonna pay a pretty penny for it
for starters we were throwing in the
best gaming CPU in the market right now
the 8 core 9900 K it doesn't beat the
8700 K by much but nonetheless if you're
looking for the best of the best this is
it when it comes to gaming we do need to
cool this bad boy since we are going to
overclock it the H 159 from Corsair
should get the job done
and it will look good doing it too the
240 millimeter radiator with RGB
goodness I don't want to go completely
overkill on the motherboard since we're
not doing SLI or any crazy water cooling
so the msi mag z 390 is actually the
sweet spot when it comes to features
design and price it pretty much has
everything you need to build a high-end
gaming PC for starters it has a 12 power
phase delivery with two eight-penny PC
connectors which will help in getting a
smooth and stable orbit clock it also
comes with wireless AC and some RGB
lighting on the heatsink so a pretty
solid board for the money now for RAM
we're going with a total of 32 gigs at
32 hundred megahertz from the popular
treinen z or RGB sticks for storage we
do have some options this time around
after all that is a high-end build so
we're throwing in a 250 gigabyte m2 SSD
which will have the operating system
installed on we're also throwing in a
one terabyte SSD for all the games and
applications that we want to boot fast
from and finally a 2 terabyte hard drive
for all the junk and miscellaneous files
the r-tx 20 80 TI is a no-brainer for
this price point it's currently the
fastest GPU at right now well aside from
the Titan RT X but that's way over price
right now but what the RT x 2080 TI you
should be able to gain comfortably in 4k
resolution over 60fps and most titles
the case we're going with on this build
is the H 500 P from Coolermaster which
I've actually then I build in a while
back on that channel one of the reasons
why I really like this case other than
the design is the airflow you get two
massive 200 millimeter RGB fans in the
front and a 140 millimeter fan in the
rear it also has a PSU shroud any
vertical GPU man there's just an
all-around sexy case with really good
airflow I mean we're gonna be
overclocking both the CPU and GPU so
airflow is gonna be really important in
this build and finally powering all the
components as the 1000 watt
platinum-certified power supply from
corsair this build is gonna cost you a
little over three thousand dollars but
what you're getting over here is a beast
PC that can pretty much handle
everything you throw at it
once again I'll drop a link to all the
parts mention in this video if you guys
enjoyed it drop a like and if you didn't
you know what to do
thanks again for watching as always I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
