and it's been a while since I did a top
5 video and since the galaxy s7 is out I
figured I'd put together a list of the 5
best cases let's begin so starting off
the video is the crystal bumper case
from Varys it's a two piece case with a
transparent TPU layer that's surrounded
by a PC bumper which obviously provides
protection in the event that the phone
drops it does have subtle curved edges
which complement the curves on the s7 it
also feels more natural in a hand the
buttons are really easy to press without
using any force at all and the cutouts
are large enough to fit most third-party
accessories however larger headphones
like the m50 X's will not fit in a jack
the case does have a slight lip so if
you do place your phone facedown it will
protect the screen the same goes for the
camera and the back
I do like transparent cases due to the
fact that it doesn't hide the design of
the phone and in my case I can show off
the skins I've installed which by the
way if you guys aren't a fan of cases
and still want some protection you
should definitely check out the brand's
adding your skin is very minimalistic
but at the same time it provides
protection against scratches but I'll
drop a link below if anyone's interested
in checking them out if transparent
cases aren't your style then the high
profile is your next best option you get
the same TPU material which has a
brushed metal look and a hard bumper
surrounding the case that comes in
several different colors the only real
difference between the crystal bumper
and this is the TPU material and the
cutouts for the camera you get one large
cutout on the high profile whereas you
get two separate cutouts for the crystal
bumper next up we have case ology cases
which are somewhat similar to the
previous cases in the sense that it's a
two-piece as well a dual layer TPU
material to encompass the phone with a
polycarbonate bumper I do have to say
that I prefer the Vera's cases over
these since the edges are not seamless
the bumper piece does not wrap around
the rest of the case and it's noticeable
when holding it in the hand also the
construction isn't as 30 other than that
the buttons are easy to press and the
cutouts are good enough for standard
accessories but once again they're not
big enough for larger 3.5 millimeter
jacks the back of the case will
definitely protect the
EPOC shooting camera although i don't
really feel too confident about the
front of the phone the edges aren't
raised by much it almost looks flush
with the phone so i would definitely be
careful laying it face down I do like
the material in the back there this one
has a three-dimensional pattern that
feels pretty cool whereas the other case
is made out of genuine leather at least
that's what they claim on their website
honestly it kind of feels like fake
leather at number three we have our
first bulky and most expensive case in
this video this is the UAG wallet case
not only does this case offer more
protection in the previous cases but it
also has a compartment to hold up to
four credit cards if you don't mind the
extra bulkiness of course I don't know
if it's only my model but it seriously
took some strength to pry open the case
which was not attractive at all
hopefully it gets loose when you use it
multiple times other than that the
buttons are pretty easy to press and the
power button has a tactile grip which is
a nice touch as far as the cutouts are
concerned I'm really surprised that it's
even large enough for bigger jacks like
the m50x is the rear camera has
definitely protected since it's very
deep in there and the front is also
protected since the edges are raised
just enough because of the design and
the material of this case it's
definitely not the most comfortable when
holding it in the hand but if you guys
want a case that will do its job and
protect the case with storage to hold
your cards then this is something you
should look into I just wish the case
wasn't this bulky or uncomfortable to
hold otherwise I would use it personally
next up we have the spigen tough Armour
series once again you get shock
absorbing TPU and a polycarbonate shell
the tough armor series are a bit pricey
when compared to other cases but you do
get what you pay for speaking does make
some of the best cases out there and the
tough armor series is no different the
edges are flat which provides a solid
grip and the volume and power buttons
are flush with the case they are really
easy to press and it doesn't stick out
like the other cases it has a stealthy
look to it and I like that the cutouts
are also large enough for even bigger
3.5 millimeter jacks which is nice and
the case provides a fair amount of lip
to protect the front of the phone
overall this is a really solid case and
I have nothing bad to say about it last
but not least we have the eye blazing
armor box this is a three-piece case
that comes with a
screen protector well technically it's a
two-piece but it does come with a belt
clip which swivels 360 degrees this case
is more aimed towards construction
workers and people who like the outdoors
since it can practically protect your
phone from a tank the flaps on the
microUSB port and headphone jack are
there to prevent dust and dirt from
getting inside and although it's a nice
feature I kind of find it inconvenient
to constantly remove it just to plug
something in with that said I'm glad the
cutouts are at least large enough to fit
most third party accessories and even
larger 3.5 millimeter jacks if you have
a charging dock or a phone stand this
might not be the best option for you
since this case will definitely get in
the way out of all the five cases in
this video I have to say my favorite one
is the virus high pro shelled I love the
minimalistic design and how it feels in
the hand without adding much bulk to the
phone it's also more affordable compared
to the others and I think for the value
it offers a lot all the cases in this
video will be listed down below if
anyone is interested in checking them
out but that will do it for the video if
