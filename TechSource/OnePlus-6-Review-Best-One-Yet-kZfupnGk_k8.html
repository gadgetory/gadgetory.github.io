devices for a while now and this year
they have unveiled their one plus six
their most premium handset to date with
a glass back edge to edge display and
the latest in hardware that would be the
SAP dragon 845 as the brains backed by
the adrenal 630 for the graphics card as
well as six gigs of ram and a starting
storage space of 64 gigs all for five
hundred thirty dollars they even have
other models starting at eight gigs of
ram wood more storage with a higher
price of course okay so let's start with
the hardware and this is really where
oneplus needed to change things up and
they did just like other handsets we've
now got a glass back the model we have
in the video is the mirror black that
has a ceramic look to it they achieved
this by applying a thin film to the
inside and I really dig it even though
it's Gorilla Glass five and scratch
resistant I did apply some dban skins to
it so I wouldn't have to keep wiping
away the fingerprints there's also a
white with gold trim and a matte black
version all of which have the same glass
back but with different textures so we
also get water resistant this year and
they don't give a rating but oneplus
says it's enough to survive a drop in
the sink or a spilled glass of water now
I'm not gonna take the risk and test it
because I might damage the phone so I'm
just gonna go ahead and take their word
for it surprisingly the oneplus six does
not have any wireless charging and
that's kind of a letdown to be honest I
think they did that to keep the cost
down but nevertheless we are aiming
towards a more Wireless future so I
would have loved to see that but we do
get their famous - charging which claims
to give a full days of power and just
half an hour of charging which when we
tested it it's about 60% - give or take
with moderate use you can actually go on
a full day with 60% battery life left
when I was using it I usually finish the
day off with about 20 to 30% but that is
with heavy use something that's living
this year is the fingerprint sensor and
they've actually reshaped it which has
less surface area than before and
they've placed it right below the dual
cameras which is a little annoying
because I sometimes smudge the camera
lens instead of tapping on the sensor
but I feel like over time I will get
used to the placement
however it is quick as ever and they've
also brought back their face unlock
that's freakishly fast it recognizes
your face so quick that you might miss
your lockscreen I mean it's not gonna be
as secure as the iPhone face unlock but
it works great and honestly so far I
haven't run into any issues with it
every single one plus phone before this
one was known for their mesh camera
quality and this year the company is
promising much better performance from
the two camera setup the primary camera
has a 16 megapixel Sony sensor with an F
1.7 aperture and an optical image
stabilization the second camera is also
a Sony sensor but with a 20 megapixel
camera and again at F 1.7 aperture
what's weird about this configuration is
that both cameras actually have the same
focal length typically in this setup you
would have one telephoto lens for a
lossless two time zoom and the other
lens would be a monochrome lens for
those black-and-white stills but how the
1 plus 6 cameras work is the second
sensor actually captures the entire
image detail and that's sent over to the
main cameras image for a better digital
zooming you also get lower noise and
better detail and the end result
drumroll please
it's decent I mean it's definitely
better than last year's oneplus but it's
far from phones like the pixel 2 and the
iPhone 10 the software applies a little
too much sharpening when I found that
shot too noisy in darker environments
but they were overall much better than
the 1 + 5 t in part due to the optical
image stabilization that also smooth it
out our shaky videos in the video front
we also get the super slow motion at 480
fps at 720p and 240 FPS at 1080p it's
really fun shooting in these modes even
though 40 FPS is limited to 1 minute
it still turns out to about 16 minutes
of slow-motion footage and you can even
make the most normal things like a guy
riding on a scooter look pretty cool the
selfie cam is also pretty decent at 16
megapixels now I'm not a big selfie guy
so I won't be using this as much but I
didn't notice that the pictures are
sharp without any Distortion oneplus
hasn't released a portrait mode for the
camera yeah
but it's coming soon after the phone's
release so at the front we've got this
edge-to-edge 1080p display and of course
a notch and to be honest I don't mind
its small and I don't find it
distracting like all there's mites
if it bothers you there is an option to
hide it in the settings and speaking
about software it's pretty close to
stock just like oneplus has always kept
it there are a few additions that I
think add to the overall experience like
a drawer to the left of the home screen
now this is where you can pin widgets
and have information quickly accessible
however I do think they should allow
users to switch this with the Google now
feed because I much prefer that instead
they've also kept the alert slider which
toggles between different sound profiles
and this is probably one of the most
undervalued features on oneplus phones I
use it all the time and I hope they keep
this going forward we've also got
gestures if you want to maximize your
screen real estate I gotta be honest it
was weird at first but I didn't get used
to it quickly and now I have it turned
on so you swipe up to exit an app and
then you swipe and hold for multitasking
and to go back you basically swipe up on
the right or left side I mean it's not
as great as my iPhone tens gestures but
it's a great start which hopefully they
will improve with software updates
another welcomed feature in oxygen OS is
the dark theme which blacks out the
system UI and with the AMOLED display it
looks great the display by the way is in
the sharpest at 20 to 80 by 1080 but
you'd have a hard time telling being
AMOLED it has dark blacks and the colors
are vibrant it has good viewing angles
and no noticeable color tints overall
it's great to look at there is one thing
that does take away from the media
experience and that is the speakers I
mean it does get loud but the higher you
go the more teeny it sounds and there
isn't even a second speaker hidden in
the earpiece so you are getting a truly
mono experience fortunately they have
kept the headphone jack once again and
they've added Bluetooth a px which
improves the sound quality with
supported Bluetooth headphones before
it's why is this thing is a beast with a
snapdragon 845 you're not gonna see any
stutter especially since oxygen OS is so
close to stock playing games like pub G
mobile were no problem as expect
and owning oneplus phones in the past I
didn't expect this phone to slow down
for a while I like other Android
manufacturers a snapdragon 845 also
enables faster connection speeds with
4x4 MIMO but here in the states were
ways from that being available but it's
nice to know that it's future proof for
$530 this thing checks a lot of boxes
but I wouldn't call it a flagship killer
since it's so bare bones and what I mean
by that is that there aren't any special
hardware or features that make the
oneplus 6 stand out against the rest of
the crowd if you're someone that doesn't
have one grand to drop on the latest
flagships and you're looking for a
smartphone with a great camera modern
hardware and an old 8 battery life with
a headphone jack then the well plus 6 is
a great start but if you're someone is
looking for something a little more
maybe it's a higher resolution screen or
better camera or maybe just better
sounding speakers than the 1 plus 6 is
not for you and you should definitely
look elsewhere and I pretty much wraps
up my review of the oneplus 6 if you
guys enjoyed it dropping a like would be
awesome and you can help support the
channel I'll drop a link to this down
below if you guys want to check it out
and as always I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
