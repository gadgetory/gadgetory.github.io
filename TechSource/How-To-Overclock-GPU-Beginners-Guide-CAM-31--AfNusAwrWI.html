step-by-step on how you can overclock
your GPU for free and the software I'm
using is actually free to download I'll
drop a link to it down below
it's called cam and also we're going to
be using the benchmark tool Unigine
Heaven benchmark and also leave a link
to that down below but it's really easy
guys honestly a lot of people think it's
difficult to overclock your hardware CPU
and GPU especially are extremely easy
and I will show you guys how to do that
and also if you guys want a tutorial on
how to overclock the CPU as well let me
know by dropping a comment down below so
before we get into the overclocking it's
really important to understand the
software that you're going to use to
overclock so as I mention before this is
the NZXT cam 3.1 and I once again I will
leave a link down below so you guys can
download it's completely free and this
is basically the program going to be
using to monitor to monitor the GPU as
well as overclock it so let's quickly go
over the tabs on the dashboard tab you
guys can see the temperature the load on
both the CPU and graphics card and then
down below there you can see the RAM and
also all the programs that are running
in the background as you can see camp
client is currently running and how much
RAM is being used and how much what the
load percentage is and on the right side
over here is you can see the storage
space so how much storage is used and
how much you have free space in your
hard drive so moving on to the Advanced
tab you guys can check out the hardware
in more detail so you guys have options
for CPU GPU motherboard when hard drives
and the internet and so for this video
purposes I'm going to be using CPU and
GPU and down here you guys can check the
minimum and maximum temperatures you can
check out the clock speeds the memory
and just a bunch of really useful
information that we're going to be using
and then if you expand a little window
will pop up and basically giving you
guys even more in-depth details leaking
out you guys can check out each core for
the CPU again like the core clock
multiplier bus speed and all that so but
I'm not going to be using this tab at
all now if you hit the maximize button
everything will expand right now it kind
of expands over the
shot area that I'm using but basically
everything that I've shown you guys is
expanded into one window so instead of
hitting tabs you can see everything so
moving on to the build tab is pretty
self-explanatory this is where your PC
specs are listed you have your processor
a video card motherboard and all that
good stuff as well as your PC name
moving on to the games tab basically it
will show the games that you recently
played on your PC and what's great about
this is actually you can see the
duration played the start time and also
your minimum and average fps so if
you're benchmarking a game for example
you can always refer to this chart and
then record those numbers so if you're
benchmarking a specific game you can
check out the average FPS and it's just
very helpful and finally the last tab
which is the tab we're going to be using
is the tuning tab and this is where
we're going to be overclocking the
gravis card but more on this tab later
so if you guys click on the cogwheel up
here and go to settings there are some
useful options here that you can enable
if you go to FPS overlay there's an
option here where you can overlay
information in a game so let's say if
you want to check out the current FPS
the GPU load the memory clock or clock
and all that good information you can
check it through this settings menu here
you can change the color using the font
color over here obviously it's RGB but
for this video I'm going to keep it
yellow and you can you can basically
display the information you want during
the game you can have FPS come up
average FPS memory and all that stuff
but for the sake of this video I'm
actually going to just disable most of
this and just keep GPU and the FPS you
can also overlay the position so you can
put at the top right bottom right any
corner you desire and that's you can
also even set up a toggle so you can
disable it while you're in game and then
you just Save Changes
so another really cool feature or I
should say add-on that comes at cam is
actually their free app which you can
download for Android or iOS basically
gives you the option to monitor your PC
when you're away from your computer so
you can open up the app and you can
check out the current stats the CPU GPU
load the temperature the percentage of
load and you guys can even check out the
recent games played on it
another really neat feature you guys can
do is get notifications on your phone
let's say if your CPU or GPU pass a
certain threshold so if you go to
settings and then go to notifications
tab over here you can basically manually
select what threshold you want for
example if your CPU passes theta
seventy-five degrees Celsius or the GPU
passes 73 degrees Celsius you will get a
notification on your phone so since this
is a beginner's guide I'm going to be
showing you guys the easy way to
overclock your GPU and there is a more
advanced way which involves messing with
the voltage to increase the clock speed
and memory speed of the GPU but for this
sake for the sake of this video I'm
going to keep it simple for you guys and
we're gonna be using this program and
just stick with the core clock and
memory clock we're not going to be
messing with voltage so basically
overclock this GPU before I start this
video so I know what the maximum limit
is but I went ahead and reset the
settings and I'm going to be showing you
guys from the beginning basically what I
did
alright so I basically have five
sections in this tab we have power limit
core clock memory clock we have the GPU
fan profile and down here we have the
stats we have the core clock memory
clock GPU temps and the fan speed so for
the peril limit we're going to keep this
at 100% this basically allows you to
draw more or less watts for your GPU but
we're going to keep it hundred percent
and I'm going to be focusing on core
clock for now so we're not gonna be
touching the power limit this basically
allows you to draw more or less watts
for your GPU but we're not gonna mess
with that for now and we're gonna be
messing around with the core clock
majority of the time because this
basically impacts the GPU the most and
this is what will give you the most
frames right now it is on default 1607
megahertz and that depends on your GPU
whether you have an MD or an Nvidia also
make sure that your graphics card is
overclockable otherwise this tutorial
will not work so typically people do
increments of 25 to 100 but for the sake
of this video I'm gonna keep it
simplified and we'll do increments of 50
megahertz so I'm going to put in 50 on
here and I'm going to go and hit Save
Changes also make sure to apply tuning
when system starts that way you guys
don't have to always overclock your GPU
when you restart your system so
hit Save Changes again and now we're
going to be using the heav'n bench one
this is the benchmarking tool I use to
well benchmark the GPU and make sure
one's stable if it crashes obviously
then that's what I'm gonna be adjusting
the settings a bit so I'm gonna hit run
I usually typically leave it on 1080p
but you guys can do to K or even 4 k if
you want so I hit run even before you
hit benchmark your GPU will start
working as of now so if it crashes at
this point then obviously you have to
lower the settings but it shouldn't
crash because rolling increasing it by
50 megahertz so I'm just kind of kind of
showing you guys an example so your
wedding benchmarks you want to keep an
eye on your GPU temperature and your
core clock so right now we're hovering
around 1832 1850 with the core clock and
our GPU temp is about 82 degrees Celsius
which is pretty hot but it's not
crashing everything's running fine so
what we're going to do is we're going to
stop the benchmarking you can exit the
program completely but I usually just
keep it running in the background but
make sure you're not benchmarking so if
you hit the escape button it will stop
benchmarking so going to go back here
and we're going to increase it again by
another 50 so we're going to bring it up
to 100 which will bring us to a core
clock of 1707
so here we go hitting save settings save
changes again and as you can see it's
not crashing so we're going to go ahead
and benchmark usually I would leave it
here for a few minutes or a full cycle
and then I would come back so I'll be
right back alright so it's not crashing
we're going to stop the benchmarking now
and again we're going to be increasing
it by another 50 so that should be
actually 150 because we were at 100
before so this will give us 1757 for the
core clock who can hit Save Changes
again
usually when you hit Save Changes and
normally the GPU with crash after a few
seconds but if it's not crashing that's
a good sign that it can handle those
settings and once again we're going to
hit the benchmark option
all right so still no crashes now we're
going to jump this up to 200 megahertz
and then we're going to hit Save Changes
and then look in the benchmark
alright so still no crashes we're going
to exit out of the benchmark and I can't
hit 250 I can't I should say hit 250 on
this card otherwise it will crash the
actual limit is 225 so for the sake of
this video I'm going to keep it at 225
because anything about that will crash
the GPU so my hit Save Changes is to
show you guys that can handle a core
clock of 1832 and I'm I have benchmarks
all quick so we're getting a core clock
of 1924 which is 1930 sometimes 1950
which is pretty good considering that
this is the EVGA founders Edition GTX
1080
alright so once you're happy with your
core clock now we're going to move down
and mess with memory clock over here you
guys can do again increments of 50 but
to speed things up I'm going to do 100
and then move on from there so we start
off with 100 hit Save Changes again same
concept basically is rinse and repeat
you do the benchmarking and then you
cycle recycle upwards until you find the
most stable memory clock so but as GP
you actually maxed it out to 500 so I'm
just going to put 500 here as you can
see you can't dial it any more than that
so I'm going to save changes
I'll show you guys benchmarking so
basically the settings are looking at
now are the max settings for my specific
GPU and of course these settings will
vary depending on your GPU even if you
do have the founders edition of the GTX
1080
every every graphics card is different
so for my core clock I was able to
achieve 1832 megahertz and for memory
clock I was able to achieve 1500 which
is basically max
I'm definitely happy with these numbers
so basically once you achieve the
numbers that you're happy with you can
run a more intense benchmark or a longer
benchmark I think anywhere from an hour
to two hours is fine but basically if
you're playing a game let's say and your
GPU crashes obviously the settings you
have is a little too much so you have to
go back on the program and dial down the
the numbers a bit if you GPUs running on
the hotter side like it is in this video
for example it's hitting 82 degrees
Celsius which is more than I would want
on a GPU normally I try and aim for the
low 70s which you guys can do is go to
the fan profile over here click on
change mode go to fixed and you can
adjust the actual fan speed on your
graphics card so for example I'm gonna
put it around 90 percent and hit Save
Changes
all of you guys can hear that but the
fan is on basically full blast and we
can see the temperature right now
lowering as we speak or as I speak I
should say so this is this definitely
helps the temps but in return you guys
do get a much louder GPU so so yeah
there definitely benefits of increasing
fan speed you get obviously lower temps
for GPU but at the same time you get a
much louder GPU and a louder overall
system so it just depends on you and the
case that you have so if you ok with
hearing a jet engine next to you then
you can keep the fan on full blast but
alright guys so that's basically how you
overclock your GPU I know that was a lot
of information so I'll go ahead and
recap this real quick you believe the
power limit alone and you would start
with the core clock and increase it by
increments of 50 as I've shown you in
the video you hit Save Changes and then
you'll run the benchmark if the GPU
doesn't crash then you would go back and
you would increase it by another 50 so
you'd go to 100 so on so forth until you
find a point where it crashes let's say
it crashes at 200 well I would go back
and lower it by 25 instead of 50 so then
it'll be 175
and then repeat that process until you
find a stable core clock once you find
your stable core clock you would move
down to memory clock and do the same
exact thing
once again you start from 50 then you go
to 110 150 and 200 so let's say crashes
at 400 megahertz then I would basically
lower it down by 25 instead of 50 so it
would be 375 instead
again same process you know you would
Save Changes and then when the
benchmarks once you find the settings
you are happy with that's when I would
be to play a game for like by 30 minutes
I would say I'll run a benchmark for
about 30 minutes to an hour now let's
say you're getting extremely low core
clock and memory clock what you guys can
do is mess with the power limit and you
can agree to increase the bar you can
even increase it up to 110 percent and
then you go down and do the exact same
thing for the core clock and memory
clock and most of the time you will get
higher clock speeds if you adjust the
power limit that basically lets the
gravis card bring out or receive more
power than stop that's what the power
limit does but yeah that's basically it
guys have any questions at all feel free
to drop them down in the comment section
down below
and feel free to experiment with this
because this is really really easy to do
and pretty much anybody can do it then
you guys so much for watching if you
enjoy this type of videos and want to
see how to overclock CPU hopefully a
shorter video let me know in the comment
section below and I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
