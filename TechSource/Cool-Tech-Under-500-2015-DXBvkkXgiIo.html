back to the cool Tech series here on
Tech source this month we're gonna be
looking at some really dope tech under
the $500 price tag and if you guys are
new to the channel feel free to check
out my previous cool tech videos I did
and I'll go ahead and drop a link to the
playlist down below but without wasting
any more time let's begin so first on
the list we have is coin this thing
keeps all your cards in one place you
can sync the cards using the app and
cycle through the list of cards you have
added by pressing the button on the coin
it swipes just like a regular credit
card which is awesome and the best part
about it is that it will send you a
notification via bluetooth if you leave
it behind additionally you can look up
the last location of your coin by using
the app this is an absolute must for
anyone that uses multiple cards next up
we have the very popular balance wheel
and these things are becoming extremely
popular and it's one of the reasons why
the sales of skateboards are decreasing
it's because everyone is picking one of
these up and after playing around with
one for a few hours I can see why it's
really easy to learn you just simply
step on it one leg at a time and lean
forward to go forward and then lean back
to well you get the idea to turn you
basically tilt one of the pads forward
and the other back and vice versa for
the other side this thing gets up to ten
miles an hour which is incredibly fast
by Segway and trust me when I say that
it gets pretty dangerous and hard to
control at high speeds I've been writing
this thing for a few weeks and this is
what happens when you max out at 10
miles per hour
so yeah I don't recommend going
machspeed on this but overall it's an
extremely fun way to write around and
it's really addicting next up is one of
my favorites featured in this video and
this is the heated hoodie by rave en
they do have other styles available for
both men and women and come an optional
black and blue colors except for the
hoodie which is in gray only so the
jackets have heated pads in the front
and back and get activated when you
press and hold the control button which
is located on the inside near the top
you can also control the temperature
from three settings white for a low blue
for medium and red for high depending on
the temperature is outside the hoodie
can last up to seven hours on low mode
on a full charge on the inside you can
find several pockets the smaller one
near the top is big enough to fit your
wallet and a much larger one below is
big enough to fit even a nexus 6
there's also another pocket on the
opposite side and this is where the USB
cable is located which is used to try
the jacket speaking of charging you'll
get a small patch to carry the Powerbank
which is included with your purchase
it's a five thousand milliamp hour power
bank with a touch-sensitive LED panel on
the side that will display how much
juice is left if you tap on it you can
use this to charge the hoodie or your
phone up to six times depending on your
phone of course the fire bank can also
get a full charge in just 90 minutes
regardless of the technology I wouldn't
wear anything like it unless it's
extremely comfortable and after wearing
it for about a week now I can say with
100% confidence that they got that on
lockdown
all raven apparel our washer friendly
and come with a five-year warranty and
they are currently on Kickstarter so if
you guys want to get 50% off the retail
price and make sure to go over and
pre-order yours today I'll go and drop a
link down below for you this next item
isn't out yet but when I came across
that while looking for products I knew I
had to feature it in my cool tech video
this is called wall-e and it's a smart
wallet it connects to your smartphone
via bluetooth and it will display a
notification when you get too far from
it the wallet also monitors each pocket
and will send you a notification if an
item is missing from a specific pocket
which is pretty damn impressive this
also works the other way around if you
manage to lose your phone you can simply
double tap the wallet and it will set an
alarm on your phone even if it's on
silent while he also doesn't require any
charging and operates on a cell battery
which is easily replaceable the wallet
will last you anywhere from four
six months on a single battery pre-order
starts soon and you are looking at
anywhere from 100 to 150 dollars so make
sure to visit the website by clicking on
the link below and sign up with your
email address next up on the list are
the August Bluetooth speakers these both
have 5 watt drivers and will get you up
to 15 hours of battery life which is
insanely long for speakers you get a
pair of really good-looking and durable
speakers which have a matte finish and
are extremely light weighing only at 250
grams on the back you will find the
micro USB the connection port followed
by the power button the left speaker
also comes with an extra port to connect
to it via 3.5 millimeter cable these
speakers work together to provide you
with powerful and crisp stereo sound and
here's a quick audio sample
speaking of speakers this next item is a
sound bar from go groove it features two
5y drivers one on each side and a single
12 watt subwoofer in the middle which
provides amazing sound most sound bars
are expensive so when I found out that
this was only 70 bucks I had to test it
out for myself and I was not
disappointed not only can you hook this
up to your TV gaming console or PC but
you can pair it with any Bluetooth
device and turn it into a miniature home
theater
try to create a suit of armor around the
world but I hate something terrible
artificial intelligence
it's called the Ultron program you can
either rest it on your TV stand or
mounted on the wall with the included
screws in the back you will find the RCA
ports optical in and DC end to power the
speaker on the side you will find the
controls that includes the power or
source button which will allow you to
switch from bluetooth to other
connection types along with the menu and
media controls you can also connect to
the speaker via 3.5 millimeter Jack near
the bottom the speaker also comes with a
remote which also has a few extra
options like adjusting the bass the
treble and even three equalizer settings
like music movie and voice depending on
the content you are watching if you're
in the market for an amazing and
affordable sound bar the go groove
should definitely be on your list to
check out this next item is a portable
monitor that you can take with you when
you travel it's a 13.3 inch 1080p IPS
monitor with a bunch of input options
that include HDMI VGA and even mini
display ports it connects to Macs
laptops smartphones cameras and even
gaming consoles it basically acts as an
external monitor but its small form
factor and lightweight makes it awesome
for travel by the way the reason my ps4
looks boss as hell is because of the
carbon fiber skins I have on them and if
anyone is interested in where I got them
from I'll go and drop a link down below
for you it's actually a bunch of
different materials and colors you can
choose from as well it also has an
adjustable stand in the back to give you
the best viewing angle possible next up
we have the Jaybirds x2 which are
notorious for being one of the best
premium Bluetooth earphones anyone can
buy they come in a variety of colors and
will get you up to eight hours of music
and call time it comes in a pretty sweet
carrying case and two sets of ear tips
either a memory foam or silicone
depending on your preference
additionally they come with a flat
charging cable three different sized ear
fins for a comfortable and snug fit
along with three cable management clips
on the right earbud you can pop the
cover off and gain access to the
microUSB port needed to charge the
earphones and it features a via mode
with a built that mic so you can accept
calls and control your music with it
these are by far the best Bluetooth
earphones I've used and they offer
amazing noise isolation due to the
precise and snug fits the sound quality
is also really great they are much more
louder and crisper than last year's
model the X tombs also have noticeably
more bass and more detail for the highs
I strongly recommend these to anyone who
is into fitness or just wants a pair of
really high-quality earphones
this next item really doesn't need any
duction dxracer chairs are notorious for
being one of the best gaming chairs
anyone can buy this one here is one of
the hero series and they also have a
bunch of other awesome designs and color
options available aside from it looking
dope as hell the chair is extremely
comfortable
it features an adjustable pillow for
lumbar support and one more up top for
the neck or head I'm six-two so it's
kind of hard for me to find a chair that
works so well with tall people just
about everything is adjustable on the
chair you can adjust the tilt angle
adjust the padded armrest in all four
directions and even rotate them 15
degrees left or right the chair even
comes with a rocking option which can be
locked it's wrapped in carbon look
Vanille and PU leather and features a
strong aluminum base with awesome covers
to go with the overall theme of the
chair overall a really solid chair for
gaming or productivity my only regret is
not picking one up earlier next on the
list is the Amazon echo now if a
Bluetooth speaker made love to Siri this
is what the outcome would be meet Alexa
the extremely intelligent bluetooth
speaker it plugs straight into the wall
so you don't have to worry about
charging it and it's always listening so
it's ready for your command Alexa what's
the weather like today right now in
Chatsworth it's 66 degrees with clear
skies tonight's forecast has just a few
clouds in the sky and a low of 57
degrees you can practically ask her
anything you want and Amazon is always
adding new features every time which
gets updated automatically but one of
the more cooler features I think is the
fact that you can use echo to control
your smart home products like LEDs from
philippi o or the lights and switches
from Wemo and a few others echo has
seven microphones tucked under the light
ring which will hear you from any
direction and features 360 degrees of
immersive sound to deliver crisp vocals
with dynamic bass response
here's a quick sample of the audio
these last items are a treat for my
gamers out there especially if you're a
hardcore gamer first up we have the
creative soundblaster x7 amplifier to
explain it as simple as possible
disconnect all of your audio sources
into an all-in-one high-quality
component and place them back however
you want the x7 can connect to your game
consoles passive speakers mics and even
USB and Bluetooth sources if you guys
want your audio experience greatly
enhanced then look no further
the x7 provides extremely clear audio
and immersion you can listen to music
the way they were recorded originally in
the front you will find a volume knob up
top followed by the Bluetooth pair and
power button and an SV X button on the
right which enables advanced processing
to provide a cleaner and more realistic
sounds on the bottom row we have the
microphone in and two different sized
headphone jacks on the back we have a
wide array of connection sources that
you can hook up to from passive speakers
to game consoles mobile devices and even
your PC there's also an optional
headphone hangar they can attach to the
unit although it isn't a sturdiest it
definitely gets the job done
the x7 also comes with built-in NFC so
you can just tap any capable Android
device to pair automatically now here's
where the x7 really shines it's almost
cheating using this in games because you
can hear the enemies so clearly it's
ridiculous especially when playing csgo
I can hear the enemy about a mile away
before he is even visible it's even more
enjoyable playing single-player games
like Metro last light or even half-life
2 it really does suck you in the game
and feels so immersive the sounds are so
clear that you can hear background and
ambient noises that you can never hear
before with your headphones it feels
like you are in the game yourself
combine this audio experience with an
ultra wide curve monitor and you have
yourself an incredible immersive
experience you can forget about virtual
reality because this is on another level
these last three items are from g.skill
apparently rap sticks aren't the only
thing they are good at they make some
really badass gaming gear as well first
up we have the rip draws km 780 RGB
keyboard the construction of the
mechanical keyboard is really sturdy
with a brushed aluminum top plate and
100% German Cherry MX switches with
matte coating just like most mechanical
keyboards you get fully programmable
keys anti-ghosting full and key rollover
and even backlighting options for each
individual key using the software you
get your G keys off to the side along
with a
set of macro keys on top and usual media
controls as well on the right side you
will find the windows lock key LED
toggle and timer key and right next to
that is the volume wheel one of the
features I really like about the
keyboard is the USB pass-through located
in the back along with a microphone and
headphone jack extension port the km 780
also comes with a few extra
interchangeable keys which you can
attach to the rail of the keyboard so
you don't end up losing it you also get
a detachable wrist rest which is
rubberized and here's a quick typing
demo DMX 780 RGB Mouse is next up on the
list with 8 programmable buttons and
8200 dpi laser sensor and
interchangeable side grips the MX 780 is
easily a contender for the top gaming
mice out there the side grips are
interchangeable as I mentioned before
which is great for both left and
right-handed users the mouse also comes
with adjustable weights one on each side
it's an extremely comfortable and
responsive Mouse and I love gaming on it
needless to say it works well with my
setup after all it is an RGB Mouse and
you can change the color of the LEDs to
match your own theme last but not least
we have the RIP drawers SR 910 gaming
headset it features real 7.1 surround
sound and an inline / channel volume box
that gives you instant and accurate
control over each audio channel with
ease it also features a retractable mic
which you can hide when not in use the
construction of the headset itself is
really solid the headband is retractable
and the ear cushions have really soft
leather like material that goes over
your ear the ear cups also have a 180
degrees swivel for a more comfortable
and precise fit not to mention it's
extremely flexible the overall design of
the headset is badass and I especially
like the see-through glass on the side
of the ear cups it definitely stands out
especially when gaming at night so
