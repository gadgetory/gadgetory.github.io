reppin California Santa Clarita baby
let's see what I can do
by the way there's a watermark in the
soundtrack I apologize my name is Ed and
I like to book these things I may not
know how to rap but I do have STDs yeah
they call me master builder cuz I know
what fingers feel if your setup really
sucks then here take this - cuz you know
you're not worthy of my seal of approval
so please stop crying you silly wedding
what's guys the semtex source in the
year is finally over the time I'm making
this video it's actually December 30th
it's not quite the New Year's yet but
I'll probably launch it after New Year's
but I decided to wrap up 2017 with a Q&amp;amp;A
and as always I reached out on Twitter
and asked you guys to send in your
questions tech related or not and here I
am answering them so let's begin what's
your favorite video you've made in 2017
that one has to be I think the ultimate
desk set up a Wolverine Edition and I
say that because it took me literally I
think four or five months to make that
video everything was carefully planned
and executed and I think it came out
amazingly it's not even a word amazingly
but yeah because I needed a channel and
you somehow missed that I'll drop a link
below check it out for 2018 I plan to do
more of that a sick gaming setup in a
normal house or a normal gaming setup in
a sick house that's an easy one actually
a normal gaming setup in a sick house
because I'm more into productivity PCs
than actually gaming and speaking of
sick I'm actually kind of sick you guys
can tell I have the flu so I apologize
if I sound like a dying giraffe why did
why did you start YouTube so I started I
believe in May 2013 it's been I can't do
math I think over four years now I
started as a hobby with my cousin Bob
and I didn't think much of it I didn't
know you can make money on it until like
six months into it so and it just kind
of spiraled out of control and became a
career as some people do in unboxing
videos and at the time I was like oh
this is pretty cool I'm gonna do this
myself so literally went to Best Buy I
think that same weekend we picked up
some products who came back and we
started according so fast-forward Here I
am the best thing that's happened to you
in 2017 oh geez a lot of good things
happen but if I had to pick one I would
have to say buying a home to me
personally that is such an
accomplishment for someone like me to
actually purchase my own home so yeah
definitely the best thing that's
happened to me are you paying to all
your tech slash PC parts or the brands
send you to make reviews so starting out
obviously it was old me and my wallet I
would only go to Best Buy or order stuff
from Amazon
or just going by parts from Fry's
Electronics and build my pcs and do my
reviews I think the first like six
months to a year of doing YouTube but
obviously as a channel progressed brands
would come out to me and send products
and send parts to do builds and stuff
like that
so even till today actually I still pay
for majority of the parts for my budget
builds I reach other sponsors and they
send out the parts for that but for
budget build yes I would say 99% of
those parts are funded by me and of
course you got some other videos like
let's say my top favorite tech of the
month or stuff that you see on my set up
those things I would go out and purchase
for myself are you planning to do more
hardline water-cooled pcs next year
funny you asked that actually I'm sure
you've noticed the parts in the back
that's gonna be going in my personal
build and I've actually set us in a few
videos I'm going to be focusing on a lot
of water-cooled builds specifically
hardline bills for 2018 I think I'm kind
of over doing air-cooled pcs I feel like
it's just it's getting redundant the
build a because there's only so much you
can do in terms of modifying the PC so I
think taking it to the hard-line level a
water-cooled level is definitely the
next step what got you into PC gaming
and how old were you I remember this
vividly I was actually in high school I
was in tenth grade during lunch break my
friend Martin introduced me to this
computer room where everybody was
playing csgo at the time and this is
like the original original csgo
everybody would be teaming up they're
playing like four or something I was
like this is actually really cool and at
the time I didn't have a PC and I
couldn't afford a PC so every time I'll
be so excited to actually go to school
and play csgo at lunchtime it sucks that
only lasted like 45 minutes per day but
I got me two PC gaming and that is why
you don't see me with any Mac books if
given the opportunity to upgrade to a
better supercar Lambo Reventon or tesla
roadster 2.0 why okay so I'm guessing
you're assuming that I already have the
Tesla Model X and of course the hurrican
if I had the decision I would obviously
upgrade to the Lamborghini Reventon
I would definitely be satisfied with the
Model X I don't think I need a electric
sport car so ya are making more
overpriced tech videos yes
one of my goals for 2018 bring back the
overpriced tech videos because you guys
seem to love that new year's resolution
uh-huh so my new year's resolution would
have to be actually tweeted something
about that I'll post a Twitter post
somewhere here because when I checked
that out so those are my goals I would
say that I want to achieve in 2018 what
is your main goal in life that's
actually a good question I would say my
main goal in life would be just to be
happy and healthy definitely want to
start working out again eating healthy I
might want to travel the world just to
enjoy life you know as long as I'm
healthy and I'm married to the love of
my life
to share this amazing journey with and I
have no complaints and I don't care
about anything else life those are the
main two things that I care about
happiness and health PC Wars yes that is
also one of the series that I'm gonna
bring back because a lot of you guys
missed that as well what games you
usually play on your free time
what PC do you use so a lot of you guys
will probably be shocked at my answer
you will either unsubscribe you will
dislike the video or you would shake
your head in disappointment are you guys
ready for this answer okay so the PC I
use is the iBUYPOWER snowblind that was
sent to me I think a few months ago
but as you guys can see I'm currently
planning on a custom water-cooled build
videos are coming up I promise you guys
I don't know how to say this the games I
play on my PC either pop G overwatch or
fortnight but the game I play the most I
would say 99% of the time is actually on
my smartphone I'm just gonna show you my
battery life so you guys can believe me
all right so that is legit my battery
life for the last seven days if you guys
look at the top its mobile legends bang
bang
you would think person building pcs for
a living what game on his PC but 99% of
time I play on mobile legends because
the fact is I can take this with me
anywhere I want and I can play anywhere
I want its addicting its competitive I
play ranked that's it that's all I got
what's your favorite aspect of being a
youtuber so my favorite thing about
being a youtuber honestly is you work
for yourself
but if I was gonna be specific I would
say sleeping in I love the fact that I
can sleep in and wake up and work
whenever I want that's that has been the
best thing ever since I've started doing
youtube full-time there's nothing else
nothing in this world that tops that I
don't care about any of the free tech I
don't care about the sponsored deals the
fact is I can get my 10 to 12 hours
sleep every single day I'm the happiest
person ever by the way sorry I thank you
so much for that cool banner you sent me
yeah this guy actually made a custom
banner for the channel and for my
Twitter account contact him if you guys
want any graphic design work pretty cool
when was your favorite PC build of 2017
and why that is a good question I
actually never put too much thought into
it
Lamy late let me take a look at my
builds and figure out
so yeah it looks like it was Jack the
Ripper that's interesting I guess I
didn't do that many interesting builds
for 2017 that's gonna change by the way
for 2018 for sure definitely different
than the other cases I've worked with
before I think that's one of the reasons
why it was so fun how should you
distribute money when building a PC what
part should you spend big on and not it
really does come down to your preference
now if you're just building a gaming PC
obviously it's gonna be powered mostly
by your graphics card so I would spend a
little bit more on the GPU but if you're
looking for a Productivity PC and you
need something that's more CPU intensive
then I would spend some more money on
the processor itself if you can't I
would prefer to get an unlock the
processor so you can overclock it the
third thing on the list should be the
motherboard if you're gonna be
overclocking obviously you should spend
a little bit more and get a solid and
reliable motherboard to handle the
overclocking on your CPU everything else
really just comes down to your
preference do you want RGB in your case
do you want glowing Ram sticks
you want a cool looking case basically
aesthetic things
so to summarize a question if your
gaming spend more money on the GPU if
you're doing productivity and you're not
going to be using a GPU acceleration I
would spend more money on the CPU I know
that there's a lot of programs out there
that don't support GPU acceleration so
they rely ninety-nine percent of the
time on the CPU police are looking for a
new office again or are you fully
satisfied with the place you've got in
your house that's a good question Benny
I actually told everyone I was gonna get
an office for this year but that never
worked out because I kind of got busy
with a new home and just planning things
and stuff like that so and I've been
recording it here but honestly I'm not
satisfied because I'm so limited to the
amount of projects I can do in this
small space believe it or not these
rooms are so tiny guys I could barely
fit this table and the stuff on it so I
definitely want to plan and focus on
getting an office for 2018 and hire some
additional help because this is not
gonna cut it I have so many amazing
projects that I want to do and I just
simply can't because of this space I'm
very limited can you give us a house
tour this question always pops up
everywhere and I promise you guys I will
give you a house tour I'm just waiting
for everything to be completed with the
helm right now they're working on the
backyard and they're gonna finish that
sometime in February or
but expect the house tour definitely
early next year that's gonna happen can
we pay you to build our PC so that
depends on where you live of course for
shipping and the budget of the PC and I
do a lot of builds for subscribers on
the side and actually feature them on
the channel so if you guys are
interested you guys can send me an email
we can talk and I pretty much wraps up
all the questions I'm sorry if I didn't
answer your question you guys literally
sent me over 500 questions so I had to
pick and choose
most of these I've actually even
answered in my previous episodes if you
guys want to check those out I'll leave
a link to the playlist below this one
wasn't as entertaining and fun as my
previous ones because I kind of wanted
to be a little serious and answer some
of the questions that keep coming up
instead of dodging that like I usually
do but anyways I'm gonna go and get some
rest
I hope you guys are having an amazing
2018 thank you so much for watching and
I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
