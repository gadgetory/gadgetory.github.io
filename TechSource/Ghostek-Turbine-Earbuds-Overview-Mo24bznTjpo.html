source back at it again with another
review but this time we'll be taking a
look at the turbine earbuds from ghost
Tech if any of you guys are familiar
with this brand then you know that they
produce some solid products at
reasonable prices in this video I ain't
to find out if this pair of $35
earphones is worth the purchase so in
the Box you get a semi-hard carrying
case which is nice to see as well as
extra ear tips the material they chose
to use for the driver construction is
ceramic which is of higher quality than
plastic but something to note here is
that it's also heavier I did notice that
the first few times I put these on but I
didn't get used to it the more I used it
the cord is also of higher quality with
a grippy texture and it's also less
prone to tangling than something like
Apple earpods one negative I see with
these is the lack of volume control but
you do get an inline microphone as well
as a single button to control the music
and answer calls people have talked to
with these on have told me that I
sounded crisp without any distortion
let's talk about how they sound the
performance is well for the price there
is definitely some base here so jean
Ray's like pop EDM and similar music do
sound good
I do wish the mid-range and vocals were
a bit more clear I feel like the overall
energy of a song would have a better
feel if they were in the end these
aren't going to be comparable to a pair
of earphones that cost about a hundred
dollars but they do take the cake and
when looking at cheaper prices and
brands if you guys enjoyed this video
make sure to leave a like and I'll drop
a link to the ear buds down below in
case you guys want to check them out
then guys so much for watching and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
