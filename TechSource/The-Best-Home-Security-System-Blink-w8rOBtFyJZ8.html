search for a solid in home security
system i've actually reviewed a few on
the channel before and they were good
but they were not great you see I have a
ton of tech in my house
so I definitely need some solid security
so Blink sent in their home security
device which is literally this and I've
been using it for about a week and after
my time with it it is now officially the
headquarters main security camera now
don't get me wrong this isn't perfect by
any means no security device is but for
what this offers in such a small compact
form factor not to mention how
affordable it is it's really hard to
pass up in fact I have a full list of
pros and cons of this device at the end
of this video so make sure you guys stay
tuned
besides being extremely affordable it's
completely wireless and requires no
monthly subscription which is the best
part so here's the deal one unit cost
100 bucks if you buy two would cost 169
so the more you buy upfront the bigger
that discount is the most popular is the
three camera package that costs 229
which is a savings of 70 dollars
additionally if you change your mind and
want to add additional cameras later
down the line it would only cost you 75
bucks so you don't have to pay full
price for one you also get a sync module
with your purchase and this is required
to connect all the cameras in your home
just simply plug it straight into your
wall outlet to give it power and you are
done these are the camera modules they
are very small and in the front is where
the motion detection sensor is located
along with a mic and a built-in flash
along with the camera they include a
mounting bracket with some adhesive tape
and they're also kind enough to provide
two double-a batteries which are needed
to run the cameras in case you guys are
wondering each one of these actually
lasts up to a year on average on just
two double-a batteries so you don't have
to constantly worry about replacing them
the mounting bracket is optional in case
you want the ability to rotate or tilt
the camera and this relation is also
very simple once the sync module is
hooked up and the batteries are inside
the cameras all you have to do is open
up the app which is available on both
iOS and Android and follow the
instructions to sync each one of them
you can hook up to 10 cameras on each
system and also you can download them on
each device so if you have a family or
multiple
devices you can install the app on each
one of them alright so with that out of
the way let's take a look at the actual
system so everything is done within the
app accessing the files arming your
cameras or changing the settings there
is no desktop version as of yet if
there's anything that blinked it really
well it's their app the user interface
is very friendly and minimalistic so
this is the main page and you have
access to pretty much everything to
start off you can tap on this icon to
add additional cameras by entering in
the nine digit serial number which can
be found on the back of each device I
will send three cameras so I put one in
the living room dining room and one in
the office after syncing the cameras I
pretty much have complete control over
them using the app clicking on the video
icon will show a live feed of what's
currently going on now because the
camera has a built-in mic you can also
hear what's going on what's up guys so
this is basically the audio quality of
the camera and this is unedited and
basically this is what it sounds like
talking directly at the camera tapping
on the cogwheel for each camera takes
you to the settings for that specific
camera and in here you can basically
enable or disable motion detection you
can also adjust the sensitivity with my
time of use I actually haven't run into
any connection issues as of yet despite
two of the cameras being located
downstairs and away from the router
which is actually upstairs so the way
this works is it only records one of the
text motion and as I mentioned before
you can set the sensitivity in the
settings section I find the highest
setting to be the best because it can
detect the movement from a long distance
and activate the camera to start
recording arming all of the cameras is
done by a single swipe near the bottom
right which only takes a few seconds to
activate afterwards you can disarm
single cameras so for example I always
keep the living room camera armed since
I'm upstairs working most of the time
with headphones on so I can't really
tell what's going on downstairs and in
this case I disarmed the office camera
speaking of recording it does shoot only
in 720p up to 30 frames which obviously
isn't the best but I mean it does last
up to a year with double-a batteries so
increasing the quality to 1080p will
drain the battery life a lot quicker
720p is still good enough to clearly see
what's going on as well as see a clearer
image of the person
face it also has a wide-angle field of
view if you haven't already noticed 110
degrees to be specific so you can
practically see everything that's going
on around so here's a quick
demonstration of me arming the cameras
and stepping out and then stepping back
inside my home even in low-light it does
pretty well it doesn't have night vision
so it's forced to use a flash that's
built in the camera so after it detects
the motion it will start recording based
on what length you selected in the
settings and afterwards it stores it in
their cloud and you can access it
anytime within the app it can store up
to 7200 seconds of video or 1445 second
videos you can simply click on the
folder icon on the top right and view
the files you also have the option to
send the video or save it straight to
your phone and finally you can even set
schedules so that the cameras activate
on specific times on specific days but
that's pretty much the gist of it it's a
very simple and affordable home security
system that offers a lot for the money
so here are the pros and cons I'm going
to start off by stating the obvious
first its Wireless affordable no
subscription fees and the user interface
is one of the best that I've seen I also
love the accuracy and reliability of
Blink I haven't noticed any disconnects
errors or any issues in connecting this
past week that I've been using the
cameras I love the wide-angle lens and
the fact that it comes with a microphone
so that I can hear what's going on is
very useful live viewing and playback
all within the app is also very useful
but with all that said here are the cons
it's not waterproof so you can't use it
outdoors it won't be able to eat
motion through glass so if you're
planning to put this in front of a
window looking out it's not going to be
effective no pan or tilt feature within
the app the camera stays static you can
only adjust the angle manually using the
bracket there is no alarm which was kind
of disappointing I wish blink would have
included some sort of an alarm or siren
built inside the camera that can
activate once it detects motion I think
that'll be a very useful feature if
someone were to break in
no desktop access if you want to view
the files or store them on your PC you
have to either send it to your email or
transfer them from your phone which is
kind of inconvenient so in conclusion if
you guys are looking for a very solid
home security system that won't break
the bank
then I suggest trying out the blink home
security system now if you're looking
for an anti-theft security device that
will activate alarms and sirens and also
notify local law enforcement then this
is definitely not for you this is simply
a monitoring security device however
what you can do is pick up a separate
alarm device that you can hook up to
your door and use it in combination with
the blink home security system I
actually did a video on it if you guys
want to check that out I'll drop a link
to it down below that's pretty much of a
video if you guys enjoyed it make sure
to leave a like to show your support if
you guys want to check out the blink
home security system I'll make sure drop
links to them down below thank you so
much to blink for sending these in for
review as always I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
