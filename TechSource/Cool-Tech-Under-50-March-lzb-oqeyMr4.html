and welcome to another cool tech video
this month we'll be looking at tech
under 50 bucks and everything I
mentioned in this video will be listed
down below in the description section
let's begin first up we have Zeus which
is a smart USB car charger and finder
this is no ordinary car charger not only
do you get two USB ports with a total of
four point eight amps of output but once
you plug this into your car download the
app you can actually track where your
car is parked which is perfect for those
enormous parking lots at theme parks and
malls once you get close to your car the
Apple indicate that the car is within
sight another awesome feature that comes
with this device is that it will ask you
if you want to set a timer as soon as
you park which is great for places that
have timed parking or even meters on the
streets this next item isn't the
headphone stand the headphone itself or
even as skins on it but the actual ear
pads I was only got these to replace the
stock ear cups on my m50x is because my
ears would get fatigued after a few
hours of just wearing them these are the
memory foam ear cups from brain waves
that fit most of the over the ear
headphones from AKG - man ath philips
and more and they also come in a bunch
of different colors with these new ear
pads on I can practically where my m50x
is all day the difference is night and
day coming from these stock ear pads
these are also noticeably larger and
thicker with that being said if you're
an audiophile you will notice the
difference in sound quality the larger
ear pads increase the distance between
the ears and the actual headphones so
the sound becomes distant and tinny
however the trade-off to me was
completely worth it as the comfort level
has drastically increased if you're
serious about monitoring sound I would
not recommend these but for gaming and
casual media conception it works like a
charm even though the headphone stand is
in part of the cool tech on their $50
since it's over by 10 bucks I know you
guys are going to ask me about it in the
comment section so just go over a little
quick so this is the silverstone
headphone anchored I recently replaced
my Thermaltake headphone hangar it's
made out of aluminum it's super heavy
and it's overpriced in my opinion I mean
don't get me wrong it looks cool but for
60 bucks I expect it to float or
something instead of just holding my
headphones but I'll drop a link down
below if anyone is interested in
checking it out this next item is a 4/4
USB hub from anchor but with full USB C
compatibility
meaning you can connect your USB type-c
devices and get maximum charging speeds
available for your device the USB hub
also features IQ technology that will
detect the device you are plugging in
and maximize the charge speed up to 2.4
amps per port it does come with a
double-sided 3m tape which is great if
you guys want to add this under your
desk for your own setup and charge your
devices this next item is something I
came across doing my best tech deals of
the week a few weeks ago the original
price of these were 100 bucks and they
dropped to $12 so immediately I picked
up a pair to see if these are in fact
even worth $12 I mean sure it's flimsy
and light but I think is designed to be
like this
it stretches pretty wide and so far it
hasn't broken on me after using it for
about a week on one of the ear cups
you'll find the USB port needed to
charge the headphones and a wheel to
control the volume and skip tracks as
well as to power it on and off oh and it
also has a built-in mic so you can
actually take calls the ear cups are
really tiny but somewhat comfortable
needless to say these are over the ear
type headphones meaning the rest on top
of your ear but how does it sound
honestly I was blown away with the
quality for 12 dollars these sound
pretty damn good you don't get much
noise isolation or deep bass the mids
and highs are above average and the
sound is very crisp the volume control
and these are insane I seriously had the
volume at like 25% and I was going deaf
these headphones get extremely loud so I
wouldn't recommend it for children
actually sounds bad made the exact same
headphones for children and they are
called the SB t-72s
instead of the SB 271 but I gotta leave
links to both of them down below
honestly for 12 bucks these sound
amazing but if we're up to me I'd rather
delete my child and wear these in public
I mean look how silly these look on my
head these last two items are for my PC
master-race people's and do I have a
treat for you guys first up we have a
wireless gaming mouse from habit it
features six pre-programmed buttons with
a dedicated dpi button up top the back
and forward buttons are really easy to
reach and the mouse is extremely
comfortable
due to its ergonomic design seriously
that's comfortable as my MX master from
Logitech which cost about 100 bucks it's
great for palm grippers due to its flat
surface but me being a clogged Ripper I
honestly didn't have any problems with
it what I love about this mouse is that
it comes with a slot where you can keep
the receiver which is perfect for travel
that way you don't end up
losing it please take notes logitech
when I was gaming with it I didn't
notice any lag for a wireless gaming
well surround 15 bucks I was surprised
at how accurate it was with that being
said if you're a pro gamer playing FPS
games like Call of Duty or
counter-strike I probably would stay
away from this mouse and spend a little
extra last but not least we have this
mechanical keyboard from red dragon if I
told you guys you can get a really
awesome mechanical gaming keyboard for
only 40 bucks you would probably slap
the crap outta me in disbelief
so the Kemara keyboard has 87 standard
keys which are all 100% anti-ghosting
you also get a Windows lock key
interchangeable WASD and arrow keys
obviously because of the budget you
don't get german-made cherry switches
but it stays that you get switches that
are cherry green equivalent just listen
at how satisfying the clicks are the
keyboard is constructed out of aluminum
and abs and feels really premium the
only downside to this keyboard is that
you only get red backlighting which you
can turn off but you don't get any other
color options also it doesn't come with
a wrist rest but honestly for only 40
dollars I believe this is the best
mechanical gaming keyboard you can buy
in the market I don't know why I didn't
include this in my top 5 mechanical
gaming keyboards under $50 so that's it
for the video if you guys enjoyed it
leaving a like really does help me out
and I can continue doing these every
single month for you guys thanks again
for watching and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
