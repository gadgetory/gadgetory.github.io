stores today we're going to be unboxing
a brand new Alienware M 18 X r2 laptop
so let's get straight into this
so this is the last gens
Alienware model m18 xr2 that goes for
roughly 20 to 90 depending on what specs
you decide to go with so this particular
model has an Intel Core i7 which you can
turbo boost up to 3.4 gigahertz
it has also eight gigabytes of RAM 750
gigabytes of hard drive space 18 point 4
inch display along with a 2 gigabyte
nvidia geforce GT 675 m graphics card
everyone knows if you purchase an
alienware product that you are getting
an amazing computer built for gaming
although they are overpriced they make
sure you get what you pay for so this
laptop comes with a cool mousepad it has
their alien logo on it but it has a hard
surface and I'm sure a lot of people
including me prefer the cloth material
instead but I'm sure everyone has their
own mousepad so this can be used as a
nice spare if they choose to
moving right along there is a small box
included in here and here you will find
all the necessary cables needed to power
up the laptop speaking of powering up
the laptop let's take a quick look at
the battery life on it'll mode it can
last up to 5 hours and 20 minutes while
browsing the internet with some flash
ads playing you can get up to 4 hours
and 30 minutes and with playback on a
720p by 264 video it can get you up to 3
hours and 45 minutes needless to say
it's a great idea to keep the power cord
plugged in because it does use a lot of
power lastly we have a small package
here where you will find your drivers
installation disc some stickers warranty
information setup guys and all that fun
stuff but I won't bore you guys by going
through each one of them so I'm just
going to skip this part so this is the
m18 X model which is the previous
generation of alien wares gaming laptop
they recently released a redesign 18
Series which is just called alien wear
18 which has better specs and an updated
design I also included some links in the
description below for both models if you
guys are interested definitely go and
check them out but what separates the 18
X from the alien wears newly released 18
model is that the newer models are using
Intel's newest fourth generation as well
processors which improves battery life
and overall performance design wise they
included the air vents in the back so it
does not come in contact with your hands
and they also position the charging
cable on the back so it does not get in
your way while playing so let's take a
quick look on the left side of the alien
where you will find your security lock
port Ethernet cable VGA HDMI mini
display 2 USB 3.0
a digital audio interconnect cable port
a microphone headset n a headphone jack
moving on to the other side you will
find your CD tray a 19-1 media card
reader an SD card reader another two USB
slots a SATA port for external hard
drives and a nother HDMI port besides
the cool designs and the top-of-the-line
specs Alienware is also notorious
because of their lights all alienware
computers come with a program where you
can change the lighting of the laptops
here is a close-up of the shortcut ray
on the top right side you have access to
all the necessary functions like the
media controls eject disk and brightness
control lighting is essential for every
laptop especially when using a laptop at
night the fact that you can customize
the colors to your liking is an amazing
feature this laptop is separated into
eight sections for the lighting the
Alienware logo being the first one the
macro keys on the left being the second
the middle section of the keyboard is
actually split into three parts and the
sixth section is the ten keypad the
other two parts that you can customize
on a mousepad tray you see here along
with the air vents down below you can
also make specific macros and save them
so when you do decide to change the
color scheme all you have to do is hit
the button and it will change
automatically making it really simple
and convenient for you as far as
operating systems are concerned they do
come with Windows 8 stock although when
you do customize your own alien where
you can choose to opt out and install
the Windows 7 instead so a few more
things I wanted to go over with before
in this video and that's the air vents
which I briefly mentioned earlier in
this video they purposely put these in
the back so that air can escape much
easier and it won't come in contact with
your hand while playing the bottom also
has these hardware type mounts so does
not scratch your surface or the laptop
when you are constantly moving it around
another great feature about this laptop
is the battery charging light indicator
if you want to know how much battery
life is left all you have to do is press
the button once and it will light up
showing you approximately how much life
is left on the laptop to remove the
battery simply slide the lever down and
the battery pops right up it's really
easy really convenient to do it and to
put it back in you just have to reverse
the process and put in the bottom side
first and snap it back in place so
that's it for the unboxing / overview
