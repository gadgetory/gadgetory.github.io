today we are going to be looking at a
Seuss's new flagship motherboard based
on the x99 chipset this is the rog
rampage 5 edition 10 a completely
specked out high-end motherboard for
both haswell-e
and Broadwell processors if you guys
have been in the market for a high-end
ei TX motherboard that offers all the
bells and whistles then this may very
well be the motherboard you've been
waiting for don't get too excited though
because this will cost you 600 bucks
which puts the ram-paige 5 Edition 10
out of reach for most so before we get
into all the good stuff let's take a
look at the box and the contents inside
when it comes to packaging Asus never
disappoints I feel like presentation is
just as important as everything else so
opening up the flap we are greeted by a
plastic shield protecting the
motherboard and below that we have
another box which includes all of the
additional cables and accessories you
get 10 SATA 6 gigabits cables SLI
bridges four to three and even four way
configurations they've also included
their dual band Wi-Fi antennas one fan
extension card along with the i/o frame
and two ROG coasters which I thought was
very cool the motherboard also comes
with supreme FX hi-fi a front panel
headphone amp that delivers sound
exactly how the studio intended pure
unadulterated audio delivered straight
to the listeners ears the ESS DAC and
amp work in harmony to faithfully
reproduce every detail without
distortion or jitter it's perfect for
hardcore gamers that need to hear every
little detail from gunshots to enemy
footsteps essentially this eliminates
the need to buy an aftermarket sound
card the only gripe I have with this is
that you will need to connect your audio
device to the front of your case which
can be annoying at times especially if
your case has a front door panel that
doesn't close all the way due to the
knob sticking out aesthetically this is
one beautiful motherboard an all-black
PCB with stealthy black heat sinks and
i/o armor I do wish that the top
heatsink didn't protrude out as much or
better yet if it was located slightly
lower on the motherboard because
installing a radiator with
120-millimeter fans proved to be
impossible the heatsink on the board
came in contact with the fan so I was
forced to go with an alternate route for
I Oasis has gotten rid of the ugly
I owe shield and now everything is
pre-mounted which not only looks cooler
but will help make the installation
process easier I'm very glad that asus
has gone with a neutral black look
combine that with the new ARRA RGB
lighting and this motherboard will
practically look good in any build the
lights are controlled by the ARRA
software and you can change the LEDs to
any color you want using the color wheel
you can not only give it some pretty
cool effects but you can also change the
color individually for each area or
synchronize all the colors together the
parts of the motherboard that light up
are the armor for both the IO and
supreme FX the RG text in the middle
each PCI slot the ROG logo and lastly
the entire right side of the motherboard
additionally there is a four pin RGB
strip header near the bottom of the
motherboard that allows for additional
LED strips to be connected aesthetics
aside you can expect high-end
performance from this board as well I
mean it didn't break three world records
and set 14 global first places for no
reason you get 40 lanes support with
four PCI 3.0 16x slots and one PCI 2.0
for X and 1 X as well this means you can
have up to 4 Way SLI or crossfire
configurations depending on how many
lanes your CPU provides speed of
graphics cards rampage 5 Edition 10 also
comes with 4 we enforced PCI slots which
they are calling safe slot it basically
prevents the GPU from sagging and adds
overall strength to each slot meaning
that they are less prone to breaking off
for memory you get eight dem slots up to
a maximum of 128 gigabytes of ddr4 ram
with speeds up to 3300 33 megahertz
overclocked the motherboard also doesn't
shy on connectivity giving you 4 USB 3.1
ports two of which are type-a and the
other two being Type C you also get four
additional USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 ports
the motherboard also features dual
Gigabit LAN ports and 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
for transfer speeds of up to 1300
megabits per second hooking the antenna
up is also a lot easier than before so
instead of screwing them and you simply
snap it in which is a lot easier and
finally for storage you get 1m to 1 u
dot 2 and 10 SATA 6 gigabits on the
motherboard you get 2 USB 3.0 headers
and 2 USB 2.0 headers
which is nice to see considering some
high-end motherboards only give us one
and sometimes none at all
for powering the CPU socket you get an
eight pan up top with the optional four
pin for a multi GPU configuration and
stable overclocking the board also comes
with seven fan connectors and one
extension fan header for the included
fan extension card out of the seven fan
connectors one of them is actually a
dedicated water pump header which is
nice to see and finally let's talk about
the software asus is UEFI bios is
personally one of my favorites because
it's user friendly and at the same time
it's advanced using the cue fan feature
you can individually control either PWM
or DC fans via curves that can be
adjusted according to onboard or
manually position temperature sensors
and of course you can't forget the
overclocking you can either do it within
the BIOS or use aces dual intelligent
processors five software and overclock
your system by a press of a button I was
able to overclock my 69 50 X from 3.0
gigahertz all the way up to 4.2 with a
core voltage of 1.42 the program
basically detects your hardware then a
stress test your PC to give you the best
possible overclock it can now I do
advise against using overclocking
software because most of the time it
sets the voltage higher than necessary
to give you guys an example I actually
manually overclock the CPU through the
BIOS not only did I get a higher clock
of 4.3 gigahertz but I did it with a
much lower voltage of 1.35 so in
conclusion if money isn't an issue and
you want the absolute best motherboard
in your rig with all the bells and
whistles then this is it this
motherboard is targeted for hardcore
enthusiasts that plan on pushing their
system to the extreme and by doing
multi-gpu configurations or even water
cooling now if you don't care for most
of these features and don't have $600
laying around then the Asus Strix x99
gaming motherboard is the next best
option for a fraction of the price you
still get most of the same features
including the ARRA RGB lighting safe
slot and supreme FX audio but if you
guys are interested in checking out
either one of these I will leave a link
to them down below as always if you guys
enjoy these types of videos we should
have hit that like button and I will see
you in the next
