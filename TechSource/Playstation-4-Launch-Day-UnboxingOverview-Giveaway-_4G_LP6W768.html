here with the new sony playstation 4
i've just got released and we will be
giving one of these bad boys to one
lucky subscriber so make sure to stick
around to find out how you can win one
the standard edition ps4 comes a 50 g
gigabytes of space which can be
acquitted if you choose it also comes
with one controller and it is priced at
399 there are a variety of bundles you
can also buy that come with an extra
controller or any game you choose the
ps4 is all animal stories however there
are still a few places that have them if
you want to still buy one go ahead and
check out the links i left in the
description below inside the box you
will find a brochure offering special
free offers like 30 days free
playstation plus membership and ten
dollars to spend in the PlayStation
Store they also included a quick start
and warranty guide and next to these you
will find the controller under here are
the standard accessories needed for the
ps4 you got your mono earpiece USB power
and lastly hdmi cable you notice that
they no longer have the component cables
it's all hdmi nowadays especially for
the ps4 you have to play in HD otherwise
there really is no point in getting one
so here's the ps4 I do like the design
for some reason it just works it seems
it's only really gave a design some
thought and it definitely looks cool
sitting on my table let's take a closer
look at the earpiece provided
unfortunately it's only for one ear and
i know besides me there are a lot of
people that don't like that setup it is
an earphone instead of a headphone stead
as a downside moving down the line this
is where the microphone is and the way
you control it there is an off-and-on
switch allowing you to meet yourself if
needed and further down you'll find a
clip where you can attach that sets you
shirt well if you are wearing the shirt
and looking at the end of the headset is
the jack which means it is now Bluetooth
and can only be used when connected to
the ps4 controller similar to that of
the xbox 360 so here is the ps4
controller my do love the design Sony
added a touch pad in the center as you
can see here and you can even click on
it which is really cool they also added
a light bar and not only dicate which
player you are by lighting up but it's
also used as a motion sensor the buttons
feel really
comfortable and soft compared to other
consoles and it fits perfectly in my
hand and honestly when it comes down to
controllers you have to have comfort I
also like how the analogues are more
tense than the previous model they
aren't super loose but still move freely
which in return makes it even more
accurate they also added a share button
and an options button right in the
controller for easy access and we'll go
through those in our next video between
analogs you will find an extension port
along with your headphone jack which is
where you would connect your headset
alright so let's move on to the console
it has they basically out where all the
ports are either in the front or the
back of the device in the front is where
the two USB ports are located along with
the disc slot I'm glad they kept this
style because no one likes trays in the
back is where the digital out port is
followed by the HDMI land and auxiliary
for it's all located on the top and on
the bottom left is the AC connector
which is used to power up the ps4 the
ps4 does support blu-ray discs as well
in fact it's capable of reading blu-ray
discs at speeds of up to three times a
day to the ps3's which means you don't
have to buy an extra blu-ray player for
your room so that wraps up the unboxing
and overview of the new sony playstation
