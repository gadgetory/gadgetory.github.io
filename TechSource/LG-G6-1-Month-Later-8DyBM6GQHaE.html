we're going to be reviewing the LG G 6
after using it for the past 7 days as my
daily driver and I've come to some
conclusion that I'm confident with let's
start off with the design the design of
the g6 is simple it has a sturdy metal
frame flanked by two pairs of glass the
gorilla glass 3 on the front and Gorilla
Glass 5 on the back the ice platinum
model I have here hides fingerprints
well but the same can be said about the
black model the g6 has a unibody which
means that the battery won't be
removable which is a trade off LG went
with to gain ip68 rating for dust and
water resistance signature LG design
elements are present throughout the body
like the power button located on the
back that also doubles as a fingerprint
sensor on top of the device you'll find
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack it's
nice to see that LG hasn't jumped on the
Apple bandwagon here LG has also given
the user the choice of expandable
storage something that sets this phone
apart from a lot of other Android
flagships
on the bottom you'll find the USB c-type
port as well as a single speaker
watching movies or enjoying music in
quiet areas was alright by trying to
fill a larger or louder space proved to
be a challenge here's an audio sample
LG has cut out all the BS and has taken
a construction and hardware of the g6
back to the basics I feel like this was
the right move especially after last
year's underwhelming g5 the narrow
bezels on the top bottom and sides
combined with the tall and odd aspect
ratio of 18 by 9 all contribute to given
this 5.7 inch display usability with one
hand the phone is also flat unlike the
galaxy s 8 which should make for less
accidental taps still I did experience
those taps here and there mainly when I
was consuming media with the phone in
landscape mode you might have also
noticed that a display has curved
corners LG says this curved LCD design
protects the panel in the event of a
drop I don't know how accurate this is
but it definitely looks fresh the panel
itself is a quad HD LCD as I mentioned
before LG strikes the perfect balance
between color and contrast without it
looking too saturated like some OLED
panels I've seen the LG G 6 also
supports Dolby vision but I wasn't able
to test this outside of these short
video included by LG there wasn't much
content out there that takes advantage
of this technology but I hear that
Netflix data to update their mobile app
very soon
one thing that takes away from the
display are these black borders that
show up when consuming content that is
not natively 18 by 9 which is a lot
considering most content as of today is
at 16 by 9 ratio luckily though until
app starts supporting this new aspect
ratio LG has implemented a feature that
four scales the app into the correct
ratio this won't affect the media
however there is a decently sized 3300
milliamp hour battery in here it's big
but nothing out of the ordinary I was
able to get around 4 hours of on-screen
time which is good it also supports
Qualcomm quick charge and wireless
charging so those are a nice addition
the ones the Snapdragon 820 1 which is a
very capable chipset it hits new highs
in our benchmark tests while keeping the
phone's temperature manageable let's
shift gears real quick and get into the
software so Android 7 with LG's UI
running on top lggy has improved a lot
over the last few years but there's
still room to grow with the UI feeling
like a melting pot of Samsung and Huawei
software one cool software trick is
enabled by aspect ratio of the display
so when multitasking you get 2 square
apps which improves
the maximum another really cool software
edition and the iOS similar Universal
search however this is only enabled when
using the home screen that doesn't have
an app drawer with a long press of the
home button you get into the Google
assistance and it's actually the first
phone besides the Google pixel to have
this over all the software was ok that's
only a little more polishing is needed
but I was able to daily drive it without
any issues turning over to the camera as
we can see that they've managed to keep
the module flush to the body while
including two thirteen megapixel sensors
now even though they're the same
resolution they do have different
properties the first lens has an f1
point in aperture with optical image
stabilization and a 71 degree field of
view while the wide-angle lens is an f2
point for with a 125 degree field of
view but Alexa is and really enough
autofocus the photos are impressive with
great details vibrant colors and good
dynamic range the wide-angle does suffer
in low-light conditions with its higher
aperture was very you the narrower
sensor in these situations we get a 5
megapixel camera on the front with a
hundred degrees field of view but well
actually we scripted to this angle
though because in the software we can
switch between portrait mode and group
mode the results come out great in good
lighting and the lighting will let you
fit in a few friends without any issues
when it starts to get dimmer the camera
does suffer however with the g6 LG has
taken it back to the basics and have
done a phenomenal job
it has everything you'd expect from a
2017 flagship while pushing the
batteries in design and display there's
still no word on how it stacks up
against the galaxy s 8 I'll be sure to
compare the two once I get my Samsung
device in hand I think that's so much
watching if you enjoy the video make
sure to leave a like and I'll see you
guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
