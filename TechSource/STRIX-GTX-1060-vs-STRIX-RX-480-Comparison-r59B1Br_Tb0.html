and in this video we're going to be
comparing the asus strix gtx 1060
against the Strix our X 480 in terms of
design the Strix lineup is practically
identical across all the cards so if you
guys want a more detailed review of the
Strix lineup and make sure to watch my
GTX 1080 video which I will link below
but first things first let's get the
specs out of the way the RX 480 that I'm
testing in this video is the 8 gigabyte
variant and both of the Strix cards have
two modes overclock and gaming mode for
the sake of this video I will be using
the overclock mode for all the
benchmarks and I will be manually
overclocking them as well but more on
that later
so both cards feature a Seuss's patented
wing blade fans which is set to provide
105 % more air pressure for maximum
airflow they both also feature two 4-pin
GPU controlled headers that can be
connected to system fans for a targeted
cooling and come with the same
good-looking backplate the rog logo on
the back plate as well as the accents
and the name of the GPU on the side can
all be changed using the RGB are a
software you can select from a single
static color or choose from a variety of
special lighting effects the ports are
also the same you get two HDMI 2.0 two
DisplayPort 1.4 and a single dual link
DVI and finally both cards use only a
single eight pin PCI connector looking
at the power draw we can see that the
streaks are X 480 consumes slightly more
than the gtx 1060 and almost 50 watts
more than the reference please keep in
mind that both of the Strix cards are
set to the overclocked preset using the
software for temps we can see that the
gtx 960 one slightly cooler than the
Strix our X 480 however the reference
480 definitely runs hotter during full
load so I'm definitely happy to see
cooler numbers on both the Strix cards
despite them being overclocked by the
way these are the specs I'm using for my
test bed but without wasting any more
time let's jump into the gaming
benchmarks
all right so we got some interesting
numbers here first off the Strix are X
480 did I perform the reference across
all the games now somewhere marginal
while other games had a nice boost
however overclocking the Strix arks 480
was a bit of a disappointment I was only
able to achieve a stable overclock of
fourteen hundred megahertz with an extra
100 on memory while the overclocking
result on the 1060 were far better I
managed to push the car to 21:39
megahertz with an extra 500 on the
memory I was very impressed
even after overclocking the Strix our X
480 the GTX 1060 on default overclocked
preset still managed to beat the RX 480
across majority of the games even in DX
12 titles like tomb raider and hitman so
the conclusion is very simple here the
Strix GTX 1060 has the best performance
when compared to both the reference and
shrieks rx for ATS the Strix 1060 is
around 33% faster than the reference for
80 and the Strix rx4 80 is around 8%
faster than their reference however when
looking at overclock results we can see
a 7% FPS increase from the default
overclocked preset on the gtx 1060 and a
four and a half percent FPS increase on
the RX 480
solar Strix gtx 1060 not only offers
better performance out of the box
compared to the Strix our X 480 but it
also overclocks higher resulting in a
much better performance overall as
always if you guys enjoy these GPU
comparisons be sure to hit that like
button because I do have a ton more
coming up if you guys want to check out
both these tricks our X 480 and the
Strix GTX 1060 I'll drop a link to both
