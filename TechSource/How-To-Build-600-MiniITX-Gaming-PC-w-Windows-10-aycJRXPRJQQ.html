welcome to the build guide of Ice Cube a
$600 mini ITX gaming PC that I built for
the month of June if you guys somehow
missed the gaming benchmarks video that
I did for Ice Cube I'll go and chop a
link to it down below but in this video
I'm going to be showing you guys
step-by-step on how you can build this
exact same PC and also show you how you
can install windows on it as well so
without wasting any more time let's
begin alright so all you need to build
this PC is a screwdriver and the parts
itself which will be linked below and
I'm also going to be adding links to
optional parts like an SSD a better
graphics card and even a CPU cooler
depending on how much you have to spend
you can also pick up an anti-static mod
mat if you want to be extra cautious but
I always build on top of my desk without
any problems so go ahead and remove the
two side panels from the case and the
clear side panel from the top there
should be two screws holding up each
piece then we're going to install the
CPU and RAM sticks so pull out the
manual IO shield and the SATA cables
that comes in the box and take out the
motherboard from the anti-static bag and
place the board on top of the box we're
going to be installing the CPU next so
take out the processor and the heatsink
from the box and I'm going to be
matching the goal to triangle on the CPU
with the triangle on the socket cover to
make sure that the processor is
installed in the correct orientation pop
up on the cover by pressing down on the
lever and gently place the CPU down make
sure not to touch the surface of the CPU
or force it down since you can damage
the pins easily if it's fully seated
both of the notches should sit flush on
each side go ahead and gently lower the
flap and tighten it using the lever once
again the black cover should pop right
off so don't freak out next we're going
to install the heatsink you don't need
to apply any thermal paste since it
already comes pre applied with some
position the heatsink in the orientation
you want just make sure the wire is in
reach with the CPU fan header on the
motherboard as you can see the Intel
logo is upside down if I were to install
it this way now although you can install
it this way without any problems my OCD
simply can't allow this so I went ahead
and remove the wires and rotated the
heatsink so that the logo was upright
once you figure out how you're going to
install the cooler you need
to align the four pins on the heatsink
to the four holes on the motherboard
gently lower the heat sink down while
aligning the four pins with the four
holes on the motherboard and once they
fall into place go ahead and push down
on each of the four pins until you hear
it snap in place before we continue make
sure that they are fully seated and you
can do that by grabbing the heatsink and
pulling up slightly finally connect the
fan cable to the CPU fan header on the
motherboard which should be located
right next to it now we are ready to
install the RAM stick so go in and pull
down the tabs on the RAM slots and align
the gaps on the RAM sticks with the
notches on the RAM slots and snap them
in place by applying pressure in the
center do the exact same thing on the
other Ram stick now it's time to install
the i/o shield so make sure the three
circle cutouts are on the bottom and
apply pressure on all four corners until
it snaps in place if everything is done
correctly it should sit flush with the
case grab the motherboard and gently
lower it down in the case while aligning
the four holes of the motherboard
through the four holes on the case you
will then need for these round-headed
screws which came with the case you
might need to push the motherboard to
the side a little bit in order to align
the holes as you tighten the screws now
it's time to hook up the power supply so
go ahead and flip the case over and
remove the bottom panel with the fan
facing downwards align the holes
together and screw them in while holding
the power supply with your other hand
you will need four of the hexagon shaped
screws for this let's install the
storage next so go ahead and remove the
thumb screws located on the drive bays
if you have two storage units remove
both of the screws and drive bays if
you're installing a hard drive you will
need four rubber grommets and four of
these long screws insert the grommet
halfway through the large hole on the
drive bay and then slide it down so that
it sits nice and snug on the smaller
hole repeat the same process for the
other three holes grab the hard drive
and places flat on the tray with the
sticker facing outwards and facing
upright align the holes on the tray with
the holes on the hard drive and screw
them in one by one if installing an SSD
the concept is similar but instead of
using the rubber grommets you're going
to be using these four round screws make
sure all four of the holes are aligned
and screw them in with the SSD sticker
facing out
once that's done go ahead and snap both
of the trays back inside the case and go
ahead and screw them in before you work
on cable management we need to connect
all the cables so that you know where
everything goes making the wire
management a lot easier later on so now
it's time to connect the front panel
cables grab the USB 3.0 wire that has
the blue tip and connected to the USB
3.0 header on the motherboard which
should be right next to the RAM sticks
next up is the HD audio cable and this
one connects to the left side of the
motherboard right behind the i/o shield
the black fan cable connects to the
chassis fan header right below the CPU
heatsink and finally we have these
annoying little cables let's start off
by connecting the HDD led flip the cable
so that the words are facing downwards
and connect it to the bottom left two
pins next up is the reset switch it
doesn't really matter which way you face
this but make sure you connect it right
next to the HDD led now we're going to
do the power LEDs so let's start off
with the positive cable that has the
plus sign and we can hook that up to the
top left and then we can connect the
negative one right next to that finally
we have the power switch and once again
the orientation doesn't matter
as long as you connect it next to the
power LEDs so if you did everything
correctly this is what it should look
like from the left side and this is what
it looks like on the opposite side now
we're going to connect the SATA cables
to your hard drive or SSD so if using
two drives make sure to connect both of
the SATA cables to each one the other
end of the SATA cable connects to the
motherboard SATA ports which are colored
gray now we need to give power to the
drives so grab the cable that looks like
this coming from the power supply and
hook up one end to the hard drive and
the other end to the second drive
whether it's another hard drive or an
SSD if you're only using one hard drive
or SSD then you only need to connect one
of these we're going to need to power
the CPU so grab the two four pin
connector labeled CPU and connect only
one of them to the four pin socket on
the motherboard near the top left right
next to the heatsink and finally grab
the 24 pin ATX cable and hook it up to
the socket right next to the RAM slots
make sure the hook is fully seated if
there are any gaps your PC will have
problems turning on and may damage the
motherboard make sure you're applying
plenty of pressure and snap it in place
this is what it's supposed to look like
the same goes for the CPU cables
just installed so once all the cables
are plugged in this is what your PC
should look like now that you know where
everything plugs into take this time to
do some cable management
feel free to disconnect all the cables
and route them in any way you like for a
much cleaner look using the bottom half
of the PC to hide majority of the unused
cables is a great idea especially since
you can't see any of it once the side
panel is on make sure to use plenty of
velcro straps to tie the cables together
and I even flipped my SSD downwards to
hide those two cables coming out from it
now it's time to install the graphics
card remove the white plastic piece in
the back to gain access to the PCI
bracket screws and remove both of the
brackets slide in the graphics card
until you hear it snap in place and
afterwards install the screws back on
and then next you'll need to hook up
both PCIe cables to power the gravis
card finish putting back all for the
panels and you are done so
congratulations for building yourself a
badass mini ITX gaming PC now it's time
to install the operating system and the
drivers you will need a USB flash drive
with at least eight gigabytes of space
and a CD key for Windows 8.1 or Windows
10 depending on which OS you are going
with instead of paying full price for
Windows you guys can pick them up for
super cheap on the reddit CD key swapper
which is where I get all my CD keys I
personally use Shawn but you can buy it
from anyone you want Windows 10 goes for
about 35 bucks and windows 8.1 pro goes
for around 25 which is still a lot
better than paying full price so once
you have your CD key and USB Drive it's
time to install the files on the USB you
need to visit the Microsoft website and
download the media tool now there's one
for Windows 8.1 and there's one for
Windows 10 but I'll go to leave a link
to both of them down below so depending
on which OS you are installing make sure
you click on the correct link and
download the correct media tool once you
download the file open it up and run it
next you need to select the language
Edition and architecture once everything
is correct on the screen hit next and it
will ask you where you want to save the
file obviously we're going to install a
file on our USB so select the USB flash
drive option and hit next again over
here you need to select the correct
drive of your USB once you select that
hit next again and a message will pop up
telling you that the files will be
deleted so make sure you have nothing
important in there before proceeding it
will then download and install the files
the process usually takes anywhere from
10 to 30 minutes depending on your
internet speeds so sit tight and wait
for the download to finish once it's
done you will get a message stating that
the USB flash drive is ready go ahead
and pull out the USB Drive and plug it
into Ice Cube and turn it on as soon as
you hit the power button keep hitting
the Delete key on your keyboard until it
takes you into the bios once you are
here navigate to the boot menu and
select hard drive BBS priorities and
make sure that all of your hard drives
are showing up here since I have both a
hard drive and an SSD both of my drives
are showing up now if you're using both
an SSD and a hard drive like me that
make sure that your boot option number
one is your SSD since that is where
we're going to be installing the Windows
operating system if you only have one
drive then the boot option doesn't
matter since it will automatically boot
from it go ahead and hit f10 to save
your changes and it will restart again
and take you to the Windows installation
screen if it doesn't take you to the
windows screen that means that it's
having trouble booting from your USB
Drive so go ahead and try the USB Drive
by plugging it in the back of your PC
instead if that still doesn't work then
you connected something wrong on the
motherboard so go back and watch the
cable installation part to make sure you
didn't miss anything so once you're at
the product activation screen type in
your CD key and hit next until you get
to the Windows setup screen make sure
you select the custom option and it will
display all of the drives connected to
your PC if you have more than one then
make sure to select the SSD drive since
that is where windows will be installed
on so let windows do its thing until all
the files are installed this is really
important once you get this message
stating that Windows is restarting you
need to quickly remove the USB flash
drive from your PC so that it doesn't
boot from it again once it restarts it
will continue setting up windows for you
so just follow all those steps until you
reach the desktop once you're on the
main screen open up your PC and make
sure that both of your drives are
visible as you can see here we have the
windows installed on my SSD and a 500
gigabyte hard drive is also showing up
if you want to access Wi-Fi you can buy
this tiny wireless adapter that cost
only 10 bucks
simply plugging this into your USB port
gives you access to the Internet
up to 150 megabits per second I'll drop
it link down below if anyone is
interested now it's time to install the
drivers I'll leave links to all these
websites down below so it's easier for
you guys to find them so once you add
the asrock website select the download
option for the motherboard drivers and
select the operating system that you're
running you don't have to download all
of these but I do recommend it to ensure
your PC doesn't run into future problems
so go ahead and download the realtek
audio driver Intel engine driver and the
LAN driver then we're going to head on
over to the AMD driver website and
download the auto detect software which
will keep your drivers up-to-date once
all of those are installed and ready to
go do a fresh restart of your system and
you are done if you guys decide to build
this exact same PC make sure to send me
pictures on Twitter with the hashtag
IceCube that way I can share it with the
world so that is it for the build guide
if these videos help you guys out a lot
make sure to leave a like to show your
support and I can continue doing these
for every single one of my budget builds
that's basically a thing guys so much
for watching and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
