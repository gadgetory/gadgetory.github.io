and today we're going to be taking a
look at the omen by HP a powerful yet
affordable gaming laptop featuring the
nvidia gtx 960 5 m graphics card as
gamers we simply cannot accept the
integrated graphics chip that comes
standard with most laptops we definitely
need a dedicated graphics chip and with
the gtx 960 5 m you can take your gaming
to the next level
the HP omen starts at around $900 and
you can customize the specs to your
liking but the laptop I'm reviewing has
an Intel i7 6700 HQ 2.6 gigahertz
processor 12 gigs of DDR 4 RAM and one
terabyte of hard drive space before we
get into the performance of this beast
let's take a look around the laptop
starting with the build so the top
surface has a soft touch rubber coating
build quality overall isn't that bad I
mean it's made out of plastic so you
will get some flex here and there but
nothing really negative on the back you
will find three rubber feet and some
ventilation and near the top is where
you can find a detachable battery
popping up in the lid we are greeted by
a massive 17.3 inch 1080p IPS display
with anti-glare coating this means that
you get vibrant colors and really great
viewing angles so if you're constantly
sitting outside Under the Sun or sit
next to a window with lots of sunlight
in this laptop would be a great choice
since there won't be as much glare on
the screen now there is a 4k option
which I highly recommend getting instead
of the 1080p because you do get a
brighter screen and the image looks a
lot better it only cost about $100 more
but you will be getting more value out
of the purchase moving on down we have
the keyboard and I gotta say it's one of
the best keyboards I've ever used on any
laptop the keys are nice and large they
have very short travel distance and
provide great feedback while typing I
also love the addition of the numpad I'm
someone who just can't use a laptop that
doesn't have one included I just wish
there was some sort of an LED indicator
for when the num lock is pressed I mean
there was one for the caps lock but I
would I'd love to see one for the num
lock as well because often times I just
can't tell whether the num lock is on or
off
the trackpad on the other hand is very
responsive and extremely accurate I
haven't noticed any lag or skipping just
overall a very solid experience with the
keyboard and trackpad the entire
keyboard is also backlit which is great
for anyone that uses laptop
in low-light situations on one side with
the Kingston Lock both a USB 2 and 3.0
and a headphone jack and then further
down the same side we have a DVD drive I
haven't seen one of these in ages on the
other side you have the charging port
Ethernet HDMI and another USB 3 and an
SD card slot needless to say this laptop
has you covered in terms of ports
there's also a front-facing camera now
it's only in 720p so pretty standard
across most laptops it's definitely not
on my priority list when it comes to
gaming laptops though the speakers
however don't sound terrible I mean it's
lacking a little bit on the base end but
overall sound much better than other
laptops I've used in the past and that's
thanks to the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen audio
integration here's a quick sample well
at least I won't dialogue
well that's just typical
alright now let's talk performance and
short the HP omen is a beast when it
comes to games on doom I was able to get
an average FPS of 44 in medium settings
now although I could have gotten more in
lower settings the frames I was getting
didn't really interfere with my gameplay
GTA 5 at high settings got me around 76
fps and not once - the game stutter or
lag black ops 2 beyond high settings
also got some really nice frame rates
hovering around 56 fps and as bad as I
am in csgo I managed to push out an
average of 204 FPS on max settings I did
write these two guys pretty good though
and finally I ran the benchmark for
Metro last light on high settings which
gave me an average FPS of 61 on the dot
so needless to say you can pretty much
play any triple-a title out there giving
at you just the settings accordingly the
only negative I found while gaming was
the fan noise I mean it does get pretty
loud so I would strongly suggest playing
with some headphones on I also looked at
the productivity side I mean just
because it's a gaming laptop doesn't
mean you can't get work done either so I
tried editing a 4k video using Sony
Vegas Pro 13 and it didn't even stutter
or lag once despite it being maxed out
in quality I was able to screw up
through the timeline without any
problems pretty impressive I also
managed to render out a 30 second 4k raw
video file in just over seven minutes
which is actually faster than most of
the desktop PCs that I have built on the
channel let me remind you that this is a
laptop and finally the battery life it
lasted a good 4 hours and 28 minutes
from the start to finish on 80%
brightness all I did was watch youtube
videos non-stop from the beginning to
the end so if you spend an hour or two
on gaming it would have drained the
battery a lot faster and if you only use
a laptop for light browsing and typing
then you would get more juice out of it
somewhere near the six-hour mark in
conclusion if you're looking for an
affordable and solid gaming laptop that
can also handle editing very well then
the HP omen has your name written all
over it
definitely check out the HP omen if you
guys are in the market for a gaming or
productivity laptop I'll drop a link to
it down below I'm going to give you two
thanks to HP for sending this in and
sponsoring this video as always thank
you guys so much for watching and I will
see you at
