welcome back to my new series on the
channel level up your rig I'm actually
in Vancouver Washington right now
visiting David who has a gaming channel
almost two million subscribers we're
gonna go meet up with them check out his
PC and see what we can upgrade huge
thanks to Samsung for sponsoring this
video and sending out their 97 the Evo
to help me level up David's rig alright
let's do this
alright so David thank you so much for
having us pleasure to have you here no
problem here to actually upgrade your PC
so going to take us to your gaming room
and show us what you got right back here
let's do it so this is the studio got
the lights the green screen and of
course computers I actually have to set
up here so one over on the right the
other back in the left corner there the
left computers for these - it's for my
streaming setup and then I have the
gaming PC with my main monitor and
second one here right back there wow
that's the one hell of a setup you got
there quad displays got a mic with a
boom arm two keyboards yeah very nice it
mostly all just runs off with the main
one but yeah my main gaming computer
back there has a Titan XP in it i 760
900 K and I mean I use it mainly for
gaming obviously but also for editing
video going through and recording going
through all my live streams and putting
on text and everything what type of
program do you use to edit your videos I
use Adobe Premiere Oh mainly as well as
Photoshop and all that so this is the PC
do you have a name for your PC I don't I
don't my wife always comes up with names
for everything but I'm not I'm not as
great at interesting okay so it's nice
and tucked away back there
we're actually gonna go to disconnect it
so I can take a closer look at it and
see what exactly we can do to upgrade
just by looking at it no offence I think
you might need some cosmetic upgrades as
well so that's kind of why I'm here this
is something that I've pieced together
like over the last seven years of
creating content if like I I get a piece
here I get a piece there I recently
moved so like I just upgraded a couple
things it's like you
no I haven't been able to just set up
and put together one cohesive piece of
piece of setup cool yeah well we'll see
what we can do hopefully meets your
mystery tastes awesome
but yeah let's do it let's do it all
right let's take this apart take you
downstairs and give him a nice upgrade
all right and you got fall down the
steps and destroy the PC
nice pop this off and see what we're
working with
exactly okay first thing I notice
actually one of the PCI cables is kind
of sticking out halfway I don't know
actually he just popped out so I want to
put this back in it does look like he
maintains his PC really well compared to
the last person it was so much dust than
there so props to David for that but
more importantly this piece is missing
out on something very important fast
storage so I'm gonna hook up David's PC
with the samsung 97 in the evo m2 SSD
with speeds up to 30 400 megabytes per
second read and 2500 megabytes per
second write it's gonna give the PC the
extra juice that has been missing out on
so what the 970 bow its gonna allow
David's PC to not only boot faster but
he's gonna be loading games and
applications faster and it's gonna help
him on the productivity side he did
telling me he edits videos on Adobe
Premiere so the 97 evil is definitely
gonna help him with his overall
productivity flow so aside from the
major storage upgrade he's also gonna
get the text source treatment so there's
gonna be a huge upgrade in the
aesthetics department I did pick up some
custom cable extensions from cable mod
also gonna be moving his parts to a
brand new case so with that said I think
it's time to begin the upgrade
let's do this
alright guys so the PCs finally
completes I left the best part for David
he's going to come and peel off the
plastic so you can see the inside I'm
gonna grab a ball quick
let's see what he thinks if I close my
eyes no thank you
you can keep them open cuz you can't
really see you okay Wow look at that KC
whenever you ready do the honors all I
gotta peel it off Wow music to my ears
boom what do you think this case is sick
I know that you had your motherboard and
your RAM sticks had some white accents
on there so I wanted to keep the color
scheme consistent so I picked up
black-and-white cables and also
obviously case to match that with the
the white LED so once you power it on
you can see some really nice glow inside
the case with those dude I didn't like
the case curve like this that this like
it and how clear it is to see through as
well is not something that I've ever
even seen in person before like showing
off the interiors and everything oh yeah
more importantly your PC is now equipped
with the 970 Evo and I'm happy to report
that it's noticeably faster in almost
every task from booting your PC to
loading games and editing videos is
going to be a lot quicker as well
projects are going to load faster but
more importantly the 97 the Evo is going
to keep up with the Adobe Premiere which
means less lag and overall better
workflow so what do you think Matt how's
the game play date this is Chris the
load time switching between the games
opening this up was fantastic it is
running beautifully you nailed it man
I mean are you noticing any stutter or
lag now now this is this has been
running super clean for me nice looks
like you're getting well over 100 fps
and 2k resolution that's that's pretty
good yeah that's uh I loved switching up
to this and being able to crush it on
this is this is perfect political thing
about the 97 the Evo is you spend less
time waiting between cutscenes and
loading different missions let's say if
you do complete a mission in the game
you can quickly advance to the next one
instead of waiting for
load so that's one of the benefits of
the 97 the Evo as well all right David
now that we're finally here you get to
see the PC in the flesh what do you
think any final thoughts Steve i am
hyped about it first of all thank you
very much for coming out here putting
this together I know it was a lot of
work to change out the case and the
lights and everything but this is
incredible installing the 970 Evo I'm
really looking forward to seeing like
the productivity boost that it has for
me with my editing as well as with of
course gaming booting everything and
going putting everything through its
paces over the next few months is what
I'm really excited to see and just you
know put it put it through the tests
