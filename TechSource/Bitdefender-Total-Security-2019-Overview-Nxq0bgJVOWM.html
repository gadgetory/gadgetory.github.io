this video is gonna be a little
different compared to the other videos
I've done on the channel it is sponsored
by bitdefender and it's one of the
sponsored videos that I was referring to
in my previous video about the incident
so any type of support you guys show
through this video whether it's liking
or dropping positive feedback in the
comment section would be greatly
appreciated but with that said let's
begin the video when it comes to
cybersecurity or malware protection you
really want to be careful on what
programs you trust on your computer the
right application will not only protect
your device and privacy but it will also
do that without slowing down your Mac or
PC since a lot of our valuable
information live on our devices nowadays
it has become a necessity to keep these
files secured after all 3.9 new forms of
malware are discovered every second and
the light of this I found that the
bitdefender's suite of security
solutions to work best trusted by over
500 million users it's been awarded
product of the year from av-comparatives
and has also been recognized by av-test
for best protection and performance so
in this video we'll be doing a
walkthrough of bitdefender's total
security 2019 on windows I will be doing
a giveaway of BitDefender software a bit
later in the video so make sure you stay
tuned for that the latest version of the
software provides you with the best
anti-malware protection against a
threats on Windows as well as Mac OS
Android and iOS so when you install a
program you'll notice that the user
interface is actually a lot more
simplistic and intuitive than most
antivirus programs out there upon
launching it you will be greeted with
the dashboard this offers quick access
to features such as quick scan a VPN and
safe pay you can easily install the
total security 2019 suite on another
device from here as well what makes
dashboard so great is that it's designed
to act as a user friendly hub for your
most used utilities you can choose up to
five of the quick actions you would like
presented here what I like most is that
the defender includes a VPN service that
all rightly encrypts Internet traffic
on whatever device that I use this
allows me to keep the location and
browsing from anonymous on top of
protecting any data that I am sending or
receiving so if you're someone that
frequently relies on working on a public
network away from home then the bit
vendor VPN would be especially useful
for you on the sidebar are several
additional menu options including
protection privacy and utilities each
menu has its array of features and the
first one we'll be looking at is the
quick scan this process runs a scan of
any malware that could affect the most
important files on your machine
BitDefender total security 2019 can
protect you against viruses worms
Trojans ransomware zero-day exploits
rootkits and spyware this online threat
prevention will also block malicious
urls carrying exploits now these
processes will continue to remain
running on your background while your PC
is on but it will not negatively impact
your performance so the next feature
we're going to be going over is the
protection tab here you'll find an array
of customizable anti features including
a firewall anti-spam file protector
threat prevention save files and even a
ransomware remediation feature this
feature alone is key for ransomware
prevention because it detects ransomware
behavior and blocks any execution of
that program it also automatically rolls
back changes to your files in real time
this works for any ransomware attack new
or old and finally in the privacy tab
you also find a handy password manager
the Defender total security 2019 also
includes network threat prevention
backed by new technologies included in
the software suspicious Network level
activity will be analysed and identified
with that requiring user input for
example vulnerabilities presented on
your device can be stopped before they
are exploited now there are other
security measures that take place to
protect what would seem like a secured
computer such as detecting and blocking
brute-force attempts at guessing
passwords restricting from being
compromised in a malware or botnet
attack and prohibit any information to
be sent in an encrypted format paratha
control is offered with a filter to
block out inappropriate content and
limit screen time for in the
users on any supported device now this
can all be accessed through the
BitDefender central website or mobile
app on Android or iOS through the app
you can also manage notifications about
blocked threats check security status
and view approved apps across your
devices this is actually a huge feature
for parents that want to monitor and
restrict their children's viewed content
bitdefender's autopilot is an always-on
feature that acts as a personal guide to
help you keep your computer secure even
if it is not at a risk of an e threat
users can also discover additional
security measures they can take
depending on their specific needs now at
the top of the dashboard there are
recommendations of actions for you to
act upon to a lab BitDefender to keep
your computer protected depending on how
well your computer is protected you may
see a few of the auto pilot
recommendations or even more these can
alert you to tasks that can ensure your
computer is running optimally and reduce
the risk of an attack some of these
include keeping windows up to date
making your account password stronger or
running the startup optimizer to improve
boot times but defender also provides
users with comprehensive 24/7 support
and you can even receive help and phone
call or online chat with a BitDefender
representative as I mentioned before I'm
giving away licenses to a six month
subscription to bitdefender's total
security 2019 so this is for new users
only and cannot be used to extend any
active subscription so all you have to
do is click on the link down below and
it'll take you to a page just follow the
instructions on there once complete
you'll get an email that will show you
how to install the program I do want to
give each things to BitDefender for
accepting my collaborative proposal to
work with them and bring you guys this
video thanks again for watching as
always and I'll see you in the next one
