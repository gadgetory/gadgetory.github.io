what's up guys - zaf√≥n taxes and welcome
to another episode of what's in the box
I know it's been a while but I am back
and with a very special episode because
after three years it's finally time it
is finally time to build my very own
custom PC I've been waiting for this day
for a very long time I've been waiting
for certain parts to get released and
then I've been working with other brands
to set in parts so everything is finally
coming together this is actually the MVP
of this episode which I'm gonna unbox at
the end anyways with that said let's go
open up some boxes I'm gonna whup start
off with this box over here alright guys
seriously all right so if you guys
remembered I think a few episodes ago on
setup wars I saw this really cool dragon
statue on someone's setup and they were
using it as a headphone stand and I
reached out to the guy and a bunch of
you guys actually linked me that exact
same dragon statue in the comment
section so I put in the order but that
company no longer makes that is actually
discontinued so the medieval times
website whatever said that they have
different options available this was one
of the two options they sent me that
looks kind of similar so I think
personally it looks even better but I
can't wait to show you guys I was
looking for a dragon prop for my desk
for the longest time I'm a huge fan of
Game of Thrones and even though this has
nothing to do with Game of Thrones
series I think it looks cool and I can
use it as a headphone stand so ladies
and gentlemen let me open this tape
first
oh that looks sick oh yes yes yes yes it
even has some red on there guys this
looks freaking bad azz Wow
personally I think this looks better
than the old black dragon head statue
the detail on this is insane so yeah no
affiliation to Game of Thrones
whatsoever but I've always wanted a
dragon prop on my desk and I think this
is the one guys let's test it out though
let me bring this set of headphones and
see if it actually works alright so
these are my custom painted Sennheiser
HD 800 s which I did a video on if you
guys wanna check it out in my favorite
tech of 2017 this was on it but let's
check it out see if it actually works by
the way guys this is not a headphone
stand it's just a dragon statue but
oh my god
that looks pretty sick I'm gonna die
haha oh wow
definitely one of the best investments
so far wrapping up 2017 yeah
holy crap it's not a perfect fit but
hell it holds the headphones that is
enough for me this thing I think cost
around 50 bucks if you guys want to
check it out I'll just link below it's
not sponsored it's not affiliated I
purchased my own money here's a
screenshot of the receipt but yeah very
excited the the detail on this thing
guys honestly is incredible and God dang
evil looks freaking awesome all right
moving on contain the excitement that
contain the excitement it's just a
dragon statue alright I finally unbox
some PC parts oh yes okay wow so we got
some items in here alright so starting
off the MVP of the build believe it or
not it's gonna be the storage I'm only
gonna put in the best of the best
I'm not gonna be using any hard drives
for my main boot device it's gonna be an
MDOT two and I'm also gonna hook up two
of these bad boys and raid 0 this is the
WD blue 2 terabyte SSD I do have another
two terabyte on the way so I'm gonna be
combining these two together for a 4
terabyte raid 0 configuration for some
crazy speeds and I do have an MDOT - a 1
terabyte MDOT to drive as well for the
operating system I always tell people
that are building pcs for the long run
to always throw in an SSD in there
especially using one as their main boot
device because they offer some
incredible speeds this one in particular
from Western Digital offers up to 560
megabytes per second read and 530
megabytes per second write a huge thanks
to WD for hooking me up with this SSD
adding a second one of these to a raid
zero configuration that only increases
the capacity up to 4 terabytes but also
gives you faster speeds than this so I'm
very very excited about that ultimately
I want a clean build which is why I'm
going with two SSDs
instead of adding additional hard drives
less cables to work with which means
cable management's gonna be a lot easier
and you get a much cleaner looking build
but yeah if you guys are looking into
building a PC I do recommend picking up
one of these bad boys if you want to
increase the boot time of your PC the
transfer speeds as well as loading times
for games applications a bunch of things
because I want to check this out on top
a link below and I think that Western
Digital is actually sending an extra one
for a giveaway so if you guys want to
fire it if you guys want to participate
to win one of these all you have to do
is leave a like and leave a comment
below letting me know what is your
favorite product in this video that I
unboxed do not mention anything about
the giveaway I will randomly select one
person and send over a two terabyte WD
blue SSD announcements will be on my
Twitter I'm moving on to the storage
g.skill was kind enough to send me over
64 gigs let me let me let me repeat that
64 gigs of DDR for RAM this is clocked
at 34 66 megahertz guys let's just let's
just unbox this Oh glorious RAM sticks
baby these are the tried and Z or GB RAM
sticks by the way some interesting
packaging i've never actually seen the
RAM sticks come in this packaging before
maybe if you order 64 gigs or more it's
just how it comes but interestingly
enough each of these sticks are eight
gigs and you know what I am just
realizing that I might not have this
many slots on my motherboard this this
may be a mistake I think I only have
four slots which means I can fit only 32
gig gigs around no the only way I can
achieve 64 gigs is if I order 16 gig RAM
sticks even if I put in 32 gigs I mean
that's gonna be plenty for what I'm
gonna be using the PC for moving on to
the finale of the episode this giant and
heavy box from ek
all right yes
okay there's way too many things in the
air so I'm gonna get everything out of
the box and I'll show you guys
everything that's inside Jesus how much
more is in here
mother of god I've never seen so many
water cooling parts so anyways yeah
these are all the water cooling parts
that are gonna be going inside my tiny
micro ATX build huge huge thanks to ek
for hooking me up with this honestly I
am ecstatic for those of you I don't
know ek is the best when it comes to
water cooling got some nickel plexi
water blocks for two EVGA 1080p I so you
guys already can tell them going with an
SLI build got two back plates for a 1080
TI and of course we got some radiators I
don't think I've ordered this many I
don't know why they sent me this much so
I've got two 240 millimeter radiators
I've got a single 360 and what on earth
is this a triple 360 obviously I can
only fit two in the case that I'm using
so I think they send me some extra ones
I'm not sure why this is the premix I'll
be going with which is the blood-red
cryo fuel this is going to be a white
and red filled with some black accents
but majority the build is gonna be white
got some hardline tubing's because this
is gonna be a hard-line build of course
got some sexy white fittings also so
yeah lots and lots of water cooling
parts I promise you guys in 2018 that
I'm gonna be doing a lot more water cool
builds and this is the beginning of my
I'm gonna be starting the first ever
build of 2018 doing my personal PC so
anyways let me show you guys actual
parts that are gonna be going inside my
PC so these are the parts that are going
inside my PC and you guys might be
wondering ed why the hell do you have an
AI oh if you're going water-cooling well
here's the thing I'm actually gonna do
an air-cooled version first make sure
everything is working on the PC I'm
gonna be testing temps gaming benchmarks
and overclocking and then I'm going to
take that apart and then convert it into
a fully custom water-cooled PC and the
reason why I'm doing that is because I
want to compare the difference between
an air-cooled PC and a water-cooled PC
using the same parts I want to see how
much performance do you really get
converting from an air-cooled rig into a
water-cooled rig so I'll be testing
difference in temperatures testing the
difference in gaming benchmarks as well
as overclocking capabilities and of
course it's more content for you guys
because that means that there's gonna be
two time-lapse videos but anyways that's
the idea behind it so obviously I'll be
putting in the deep cool captain 360 e^x
cooler one of my favorite coolers out
there and this is upside down I just
realized I'm a huge fan of deep cool
products as well so I wished out to them
and I sent over 360 e x cooler and this
actually fits the color scheme as well
so that's pretty cool so the ramp
situation I have here is this is the
motherboard I'm gonna be going with the
X 299 micro and I think this has only
four slots if I'm not mistaken okay yeah
this has only four dimm slots so
unfortunately I'm gonna go with 32 gigs
of ram I say only as if it's such a low
amount
oh yeah 33 gigs I do heavy editing guys
on my PC obviously I use it for editing
YouTube videos which is why I always
want more RAM but I'm gonna settle for
32 gigs for now I forgot that coarser
sent me two of these these are their new
of engines or GB RAM sticks which
honestly I think looks better than the
g.skill Ram so total over here is 32
gigs of ram 32 hundred megahertz but I
want to ask you guys your opinion let me
know which ramps that you guys want me
to use in the
either the g.skill or coursers vengeance
or GB RAM sticks let me know by leaving
your comments below I'm kind of leaning
towards the Corsair 1 but I want to hear
your feedback guys power supply I'm
using is the coarser h1000 I thought I
requested the i version but this will do
just fine of course I'm going with 1080
TI SLI I was thinking about going with
to Titan XPS but I don't know just kind
of decided to stick with 1080 eyes for
some reason even though I'm not gonna
even use this much power anyways the CP
I'm going with is the 79 80 XE which is
an 18 core processor currently it's not
with me because I sent it over to the
guys at gamers Nexus so they can be live
at the processor for me so currently
that's what I'm waiting on I already got
the case it's downstairs ready to go so
once I get that back in guys I'm gonna
begin my build so that pretty much wraps
up this video I hope you guys enjoyed it
and if you're excited for my personal
water-cooled PC make sure to slap the
crap out of that like button everything
as see in this video will be linked down
below as always I love your faces and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
