in this video we're taking a look at
LG's new 17 inch Graham and their 14
inch 2 in 1 laptop one of the big
changes coming from the previous Graham
lineup is the size LG introduced a
bigger 17 inch version targeted
specifically for professionals with a
new size you get a higher resolution as
well 2560 by 1600 and an IPS screen with
a slightly bigger aspect ratio as well
they switched from 16 by 9 to 16 by 10
which cuts off a little bit from the
sides but gives you more vertical screen
real estate now with these new changes
they had to remove the touch screen
feature unfortunately which was one of
my favorite things about the Graham
lineup but it's not a deal-breaker if
you must have touchscreen on your laptop
then you would have to look at the
smaller sizes what's impressive is that
they're able to fit all of this in a
15.6 inch laptop body now the build
quality is pretty much the same you can
expect a good amount of flex on the
screen and the keyboard which was done
on purpose to maintain the durability
they definitely made good use of space
on the deck by spacing out the keys
nicely and even adding a numpad on the
right the chiclet keys are nice to type
on they're backlit and provide good
feedback I don't have any real issues
typing on this keyboard except reaching
the backspace button the trackpad is
really nice it's using Windows precision
drivers no issues tracking or
recognizing gestures pretty much what
you come to expect from the Graham
lineup
you also get similar port layout as well
you get a total of three USB 3 ports
microSD HDMI and Thunderbolt 3 all right
let's talk performance now because if
you're a professional out there looking
for a thin and light 17 inch laptop then
performance is probably what you're most
interested in for the most part the
laptop is very snappy opening up
programs tabbing between windows and
even light graphic work is very smooth
but where it starts to suffer is in
video editing I mean after all it
doesn't have any dedicated GPU so it's
mostly relying on its 4 cores to do the
heavy lifting
cutting 4k video on the timeline was
pretty choppy on full quality so I had
to lower the playback to 50% in order to
get a smooth experience that's not
really a big surprise though the Graham
lineup isn't made for video editing it
is an ultrabook with 4 cores after all
now if LG doing a 6 core maybe an 8 core
then we'll be talking rendering out a
simple five-minute 4k file without any
color correction or fact
took almost an hour long with the laptop
plugged in and set to performance mode
now if you do have an e GPU you can
connect it via Thunderbolt 3 to take
some of that heavy lifting off the CPU
but you would need to use programs that
enable GPU acceleration like Adobe
Premiere now don't get me wrong guys you
can still edit videos on the lg Grahame
but when you start adding color
correction and effects on a 4k timeline
that's when you'll start to see lagging
if you're doing basic cuts or even
editing 1080p video then you're fine
the good news however is that the laptop
doesn't throttle despite that only
having one fan the laptop also has a 72
watt hour battery which they claim can
last up to 19.5 hours but in my testing
I got around 14 hours on 215s which is
still pretty good on an ultrabook so to
summarize I would say that the 17-inch
Graham is targeted for professionals who
are looking for a super light ultra book
with an all-day battery life for
productivity and it's not quite ready
for heavy video editing unless you have
an external GPU solution but for
everything else gets the job done if you
guys want to experience this 17 inch LG
Graham go visit LG's social media
channels and participate in their
current running campaign links will be
down below now the two and one Graham is
aimed for people that want the
flexibility of a tablet and a laptop in
one and as the same exact specs as the
17 inch laptop without Thunderbolt 3
support but it comes with a stylus pen
allowing you to use it as a mouse the
Pen features Wacom's latest AES 2.0
technology with 4096 levels of pressure
that will help you out with a precise
drawing experience and a battery life of
up to 18 months the 1080p IPS
touchscreen is layered with Gorilla
Glass 5 so it is scratch resistant and
it can be switched into four different
positions you get the standard laptop
mode of course tablet mode stand mode
and tenth mode you definitely have more
options on how you want to watch or
create content with e2 and one gram two
very different laptops with different
purposes thank you guys so much for
watching as always and I will see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
