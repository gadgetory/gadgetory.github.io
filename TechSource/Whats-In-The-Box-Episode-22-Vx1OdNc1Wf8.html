Twitter or periscope whatever you want
to call it but I wanted to do this on my
video on tech stores so I can come back

while but without further ado ladies and
gentlemen I got this big package from
YouTube I'm pretty sure you guys don't
know what it is I'm just going to open
it up I'm going to show you guys because
I'm so excited I couldn't sleep when I

slingshot stop animals if so send them
my way we got a package from t RN the
labs with that and what is this whoa
this seems like a tiny little drone with
a little display on that whoa that is we
can dope of course you don't send the
batteries like a little drone you can
control with a remote I'm assuming there
is no batteries in there so I cannot
activate it unfortunately but thank you
t RN D Labs for setting this end you
know what's interesting guys I haven't
even received one knife yet in this
video it's the music it's very amazing
as I say that this will probably the
nice watch
nope no knife at all instead I got a
microphone new tech source we saw
YouTube channel reviewing other products
and we would like you to review our
company's products that we send in this
package which is the a k7z in a k35 I
don't know about time to review this but
I will showcase the camera
I will showcase some mic I'll see guys
look like the standard be any other
microphones reply on Amazon around 20 30
bucks so nothing really new I don't know
this one comes in an actual mount or
boom arm that's pretty cool most of the
microphones actually don't include this
so that's pretty cool see you got a
shock mount we got a windscreen you got
an XLR - 3.5 millimeter that is s clamp
for the boom arm of course a microphone
itself oh and a pop filter I almost
forgot about that by the way if you guys
want to win any of the products
mentioned in this video let me know in
the comment section down below I would
also leave a like I will be giving away
a stuff I box in these videos except
expensive things like this laptop for
example from iBUYPOWER
but everything else I mentioned earlier
even the case the NZXT case will be
giving away so let me know what you want
to win in the comments section all right
we got an Asus laptop from iBUYPOWER I
think this one has the GTX 1050 TI but
let's check it out turns in a neat
little cloth bag this looks very similar
to the A to Z 750 to drive it one that
is a very nice color scheme orange and
black I'm opening up the one way
doesn't open up with one hand why why
beautiful
I would prefer black and red but this
still looks pretty dope so I think this
thing has let's check out the specs on
air 17.3 inch 1080p display we got one
terabyte hard drive space 8 gigs of ram
doesn't say the graphics card but I'm
pretty sure it's the gtx 750ti and it's
got a 7700 HQ kb lake processor so this
thing is a beast can't wait to do a
video on here and this is more of the
lower end laptops guys because it does
have a gtx 10/15 so I'm assuming it's
around $1,000 or less than $1000 so yeah
very excited and I think that's pretty
much it for the video
like I said if you guys want to win any
of the things featured in this video
except this laptop of course let me know
by dropping a like and let me know the
comments section below
