and welcome to another episode of what's
in the box the series where I'm box
things that I get from viewers watching
the show or companies sending stuff in
to get featured on the channel as well
as personal items that I like purchasing
from Amazon or Newegg for upcoming
projects or PC build stuff stuff like
that but anyways with that said let's go
ahead and dive right in and yes as you
guys noticed I do have a new haircut
which you are probably grilling me in
the comments section let me know what
your feedback is if you guys enjoy or
you like my previous circuit let me know
what your thoughts are in the comments
what is this package oh this is this is
cable mod what why is it a labeled cable
mud on the box these are the cables I'm
gonna be using for my personal build
this was actually the only piece that I
was waiting to start my build so of
course I order some RGB strips on here
but look at these cables guys oh my god
white and red with the white aluminum
cable combs guys this is gonna look sick
oh that fresh cable smell but yeah guys
this is I got a bunch of cables in here
my how many I ordered from cable mod I
had to go with the best of the best out
there obviously this is going in my
personal build so I reached out to the
guys at cable on I'm like please hook me
up with some of your dope cables because
I'm a huge fan of what they're doing
right now with the quality of their
cables adding these aluminum cable combs
and it just makes the cable look so
amazing I also picked up some SATA
cables and red of course to match the
scheme and I even picked up an AI Oh
sleepy
as I mentioned in a previous video I'm
gonna be doing an air-cooled version of
the PC first that's what this is for for
the AI or cooler that I'm using from
deep cool if it even fits I'm just out
an interesting case and afterwards I'm
gonna take it apart and then convert it
into a custom water-cooled PC which is
gonna be fun more content for you guys
and I get to compare the differences
between an air-cooled PC and a
water-cooled PC using the same parts I
also picked up some red thumb screws
just in case I don't maybe I'll use it
maybe I won't but all right next up is
from this one's MSI cuz obviously their
brand names on there micro-star
international for those of you that
don't know what MSI stands for yep I
call it this is the motherboard I'm
actually gonna be using in my build if
you guys watched my previous episode I
actually was showing off an EVGA X 299
motherboard but after doing some careful
research I ended up going with this
instead I had to swap it out and the
main reason there's several reasons but
the main reason why I switched is
because this one actually comes with an
optical port for my audio you guys know
that I'm using the Edifier Luna e25 HD
speakers and those are using the optical
cable and EVGA x-29 unfortunately does
not have that so it also has two m dot
two slots which is huge because I'm
going to be combining two 512 gigabyte m
dot two SSDs from samsung into raid zero
for some incredible speeds so but yeah
overall I'm very glad I made the switch
because this is my personal PC now I
want to put the best of the best in
there and if you're looking at micro ATX
pcs this is the best motherboard that
you can currently buy with all the bells
and whistles alright then we got a box
from Amazon you leave your stuff from
Amazon as the stuff that I buy with my
own money order so many things I just
completely forget stuff
i order okay if that makes sense this is
a really tech and it's not sponsored but
I was running low on trash bags so I hit
trash bags I also picked up two and the
filters for my Panasonic gh4 easin is
because we're gonna start shooting more
videos outdoors and these then filled nd
filters are gonna help out a ton all
right not a package for an Amazon
see what this one is oh okay so guys
this is the SmartVault pro so I'm
actually working on doing a smart home
tech episode 2 because the you guys
would really enjoy the first one and
I've been using a pretty decent lock for
my front door you have to put in a code
to unlock it but I can't access it via a
smartphone I want it to be completely
wireless and I want to be able to unlock
it or lock it using my smartphone and
that's what this is I looked everywhere
on the internet to find something
similar like this and this is the
closest I can find to something that's
fully wireless and I'm kind of skeptical
because I looks like a new product and
it doesn't have that many reviews on
there in fact the reviews itself are are
mixed some of them are positive some are
negative but I decided to pick it up
anyway so I can try it out this next few
weeks and if it's good enough if I like
the quality of it and it's actually
working I'm gonna feature it in that
episode if not it's not gonna show up
and you guys will know less well at
least you have as long box from Corsair
1 they're what they were sending me as
expected I was gonna guess keyboard just
because of the shape and keyboard but
not just any keyboard they're brand new
k68 RGB full-size keyboard this is using
the Cherry MX wet switches it's got a
detachable palm rest which is included
dust and spill resistant very
straightforward let's pop this open and
check it out real quick
all right I think that previous k68
keyboard was only backlit and I think it
was only red LEDs whereas this one is
fully RGB which you can customize via
the cue software I think everything else
is pretty much the same there are some
minor differences which you guys might
see in a later review
there is no bios which in the front or a
USB pass-through but what it does have
are dedicated windows media buttons you
got your volume control up top here with
the pause play and skip track down here
oh and they only have one USB cable this
time
that is actually very welcome I hate
having keyboards with two USBs which
occupy two ports on the back of your PC
one is to power the keyboard and the
other one is to power the RGB lighting
but this one actually comes at one which
is interesting that is of course our
keyboard so you get that very sturdy and
quality build unfortunately you don't
get that aluminium frame with the
aluminium brushed look which I really
like instead you get this plastic matte
finish which looks okay it's also IP 32
rated so if you like me and enjoy eating
or drinking around your setup then you'd
have to worry about spilling drinks
because your keyboard will be protected
this keyboard does go for $130 which is
pretty competitive when compared to
other full-size RGB keyboards with a
full 10 key and a palm rest but if you
guys want to check this out or anything
I mentioned in this video as always
links will be down below but that pretty
much wraps up this video if you guys
want to send in anything to get featured
on the next episode of what's in the box
I'll have the link to my p.o box down
below thank you so much for watching as
always if you enjoyed the series tossing
a like would be awesome and I'll see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
