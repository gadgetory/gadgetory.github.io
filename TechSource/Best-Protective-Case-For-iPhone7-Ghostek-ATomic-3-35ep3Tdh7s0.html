and in this video we're going to be
taking a look at the atomic three case
from ghost tech you guys know I wouldn't
make a video just for any case but when
I saw the ip68 certification as well as
the stylish design and premium material
I had to see what this was all about I'm
going to be unboxing the iPhone 7 plus
model but they do have one for the
iPhone 7 as well for me the unboxing
experience is part of buying a product
that I think goes tech did a great job
with the packaging so inside here you
get the case a lanyard and a microfiber
cloth it feels a lot more premium than I
thought it would for a few reasons one
of which is its weight it comes in at
about 95 grams and for contrast the
iPhone 7 weighs 138 grams so that's like
adding more than half of the weight of
another iPhone 7 that's not to say it
doesn't feel nice or it's heavy instead
the added weight combined with the
aluminum bumper makes the phone feel a
lot more substantial and less prone to
drops looking on the device we see
raised rubber corners for increased drop
protection tactile buttons a large round
switch for your mute a go and rubber
plugs that protect the Lightning port
installation is straightforward
appealing the screen shield off I
inserted my iPhone 7 into the case and
we installed a screen shield making sure
the rubber seal was fully seated in its
correct position and with that in place
it's ready to go the one worry I had
when purchasing this case was the shock
absorption in case of a drop but when
looking inside the frame you can see
that there are rubber gaskets all around
that separate the iPhone from the
aluminum
alright so testing out the waterproofing
we went about five feet deep into a pool
and left the phone there for about 45
minutes now keep in mind that the ip68
certification guarantees up to four feet
for a maximum of thirty minutes but we
wanted to put it through a bit more
stress than that after drying the case
and peeling the screen shield off we can
see that the phone was still completely
dry now what's the point of an IP 68
certified case on an already waterproof
phone you guys might be asking well for
me it's the type of water my phone comes
into contact with saltwater for example
will either damaged or destroyed ports
that meets the corrosion I learned this
the hard way one day when I went to the
beach with my Galaxy s7 and
nothing to worry about until I tried to
put my phone on charge with no luck as
the salt water had destroyed my charging
port and then you have water that is
filled with chemicals such as chlorine
which is also harmful in the same ways
just because your phone is waterproof
doesn't mean you should be exposing it
to all types of water without
precautions and for me the atomic three
adds the extra level of protection I
need now usually with waterproof cases
the sound takes a hit both in terms of
calls and playback but surprisingly the
audio wasn't impacted at all with the
atomic three on you have a listen for
yourselves I thought this is the
microphone the quality tennis that I'm
using the case on my iPhone 7 and I'm
going to do the same test without the
case on alright so again I'm talking on
my iPhone 7 but this time I don't have a
case on and this is what it sounds like
you
I don't really know how they achieve
this with their engineering but good job
nevertheless I did however see a slight
impact and the responsiveness of the
screen there were a few times where I
wouldn't recognize my input but after
using it for a day now I've gotten used
to the screen shield and it barely
happens besides that all the other
buttons are easy to use and provide good
tactic feedback the knob they decided to
go with makes it easy to mute and unmute
your phone with one hand and all the
buttons seem to be made from metal there
is one complaint I had and that is with
the small lightning port cut out at its
current size you'll only be able to use
the Apple included cable or the ones
really close to its size but
unfortunately most docks seem to be out
of the question
the atomic three is priced at $55 for
the iPhone 7 and $60 for the iPhone 7
plus and that is a pretty good deal not
only are you guys getting a premium
protective case but in my opinion a
stylish one as well compared to other
cases like lifeproof but anyways you
guys are interested there will be links
down below then guys so much for
watching as always and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
