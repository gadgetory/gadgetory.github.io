a bunch of friends I was having a really
great time and I get a comment on my
Instagram page saying that Phillip is
selling his setup you know first I
thought I was a troll but more comments
came in more tweets more emails saying
hey ed you gotta check this up so sure
enough I opened it up and it was true
here is a screenshot of the post if you
guys want to check that out and those of
you by the way those of you that don't
know I launched a series called setup
makeover on the channel recently you
guys can check that out and the purpose
of that series is to help people in need
someone who desperately needs a new
setup and I would go over to their house
and I would completely redo their setup
from the ground up and you desk you
monitor new PC keyboard mouse although
the whole nine yards
okay louder
holy smokes what dude that's insane
I've never even seen anything like this
crazy
one word I can use to describe what I've
been feeling this past few days has to
be betrayal obviously there was a lot of
feelings going through but that would be
to sum it all up I think that's the main
feeling I've been going through is
betrayal even till now I do want to
think that Phillip is a really good guy
still and he's just in a very crappy
situation so anyways once I found that I
texted him I'm like do you know what's
going on with this is this for real are
you really selling it and I'll post a
screenshot of all the text between him
and I you guys can go through that if
you want but the gist of it is he's
selling it because he is in debt my
first reaction was honestly I was
confused at first if he was in so much
debt invited this is something he's been
struggling with for a while this hasn't
happened during the five-month span of
setup makeover this is this has been
something he's been struggling with more
than five months now so I guess my
question to him and I know he's watching
this is if you've been struggling with
death all this time and you had
intentions of selling this setup in the
first place
why didn't you let me know in the first
place because clearly I would have not
done this I would not have picked the
person I would have not picked Phillip
and I would have given it to someone
else who was way more deserving I spent
almost five months planning the series I
spent a lot of time building it and I
spent a lot of money this is a big
investment for me and to find out that
you would just turn around and sell it
after a few weeks it's just really it's
it makes me sad you know it's kind of
disappointing and it doesn't make me
motivated to continue the series because
here I am thought I thought I was doing
something good and then it just kind of
I guess lapped back in the face that's
pretty much what it feels like so in the
text he was actually saying that he was
drowning in debt and I'm like you live
in a pretty big house you know I'm not
saying obviously it's your house it's
your parents house your dad's a cop your
mom has a job as well I mean they're
obviously pretty financially stable if
they're able to maintain a home like
that it's a beautiful home by the way
I'm sure you guys have seen the video
you know what I'm talking about
and in the text he was saying well they
don't care that he drowns in debt
parents in general you know if they love
their son or their daughter that they
would jump in and help them financially
if they really need it
they shouldn't resort to selling stuff
in order to make it work and selling a
set up something that you know the
person won as a prize and has a lot of
meaning behind it has a lot of meaning
to me and all my subscribers watching
and it's just it's really it's really
upsetting that there's like thousands of
other people in the world it would have
done anything for something like that
and here it is being you know sold I
mean how'd I know you were gonna sell it
I would enough spend extra time making
that plaque for you I wouldn't spend
extra time making those 3d printed
stormtrooper risers for your desk I
wouldn't have spent all that extra time
and those small little details to make a
perfect setup for you if you're just
gonna turn around and sell the monitor
and the computer I don't know what else
you're selling maybe you'll probably
sold the plaque already but it's just
it's really just really disappointing
honestly if anything this entire
experience has taught me so much for
sure the application process is going to
be reworked because a lot of people can
lie on the interview a lot of people can
lie on the questions as we can see in
Philips situation so I'm gonna be doing
something a little different something a
little more serious I'm gonna be doing
interviews in person I'll be checking
out the person's house but basically
things like that to ensure 100% that
this next person really does need a new
setup I want to do I want to make the
same mistake I did with Philip I think
really the biggest thing that annoyed me
the most was the fact that he was so
adamant about all I can't wait to game
on it I can't wait to give my laptop to
my fiance and I mean although that was
BS essentially he said what he needed to
say in order to to win the competition
there was no intentions of gaming there
was no intentions of given as the laptop
to the fiance or letting his brother
play or use it for schoolwork all that
was lies pretty much so I think that's
what really kind of sits kind of a stab
in the back you know when I finished
putting together the entire set up as a
joke I was laughing well now it's your
setup dude you
auction it off on ebay you can sell
everything and we're all laughing cuz
you know it was obviously a joke why
would you sell something that has
meaning it has purpose especially the
plaque you know the whole custom work I
mean it was specifically made for him
and in the text he was saying well you
know you told me I can sell it I was
like boy yeah I was I was joking I just
honestly didn't think you would go ahead
and sell it so I just I don't know why
he's using that as an excuse to you know
sell his setup if that was the case why
would I do this in the first place right
that's the whole reason as that's the
whole purpose of setup makeover is to
make a setup for someone who deserves it
who needs a setup not who needs a set up
to sell it for money who's actually
going to use the setup but yeah just
wanted to throw that out there there is
one thing I do want to say before I wrap
up this video and it's there is one part
that Philip said which I do agree with
which I believe he's telling the truth
and that is part of his text where he
said that his parents don't care if he
drowns in debt and the reason why I say
that is because when we're locked up in
his room for like six to eight hours
working on a setup
not once did his family member come
inside to see if we're doing okay they
didn't offer water they're not for any
snacks any food we were basically on our
own and we would hear them eating
basically in the dining room right next
door so I'm like it's interesting like
why haven't they come I mean it's it's
fine I'm not like complaining or
anything but I just thought that was
pretty odd I don't know how some
cultures are here in America but for
Middle Eastern countries it's common
courtesy it's actually like it's manners
to go to your guests and ask them how
they're doing if they want water or
snack it's just it's just the gesture
you know it's the principle that really
matters so we actually have to take a
break after four or five hours gonna get
our own food and then come back so I
just thought that was pretty bizarre
that they didn't you know there was no
hospitality at all it's like oh you made
the setup okay thanks bye
you know see you later so that was kind
of disappointing to see but that's why I
believe when Philip says that these
parents don't care if he drowns him
death but anyways I'm not trying to say
what he did was right
I'm still saying that's pretty messed up
so yeah I think that's pretty much it I
don't really know the purpose of this
video other than let you guys know what
happened I feel like you guys have every
single right to know what happened over
the weekend that is not right
I apologize for everyone else who wasn't
selected I really wish I can go back in
time and pick a different person but
unfortunately it is what it is I just
have to own up learn from the mistake
and move on get better and then move on
but anyways we're currently planning on
a season two guys we're very excited to
bring that to you and start planning and
doing an application process so make
sure you stick around for that
and yeah thank you guys so much for the
support seriously thank you for sending
me the emails the screenshots all that
because if it wasn't for that I would
have never found that about this so I
love you guys so much
thank you for your support and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
