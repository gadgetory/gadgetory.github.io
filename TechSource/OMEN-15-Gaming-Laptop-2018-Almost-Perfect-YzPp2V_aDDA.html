and welcome to my review of the 2018
omen by HP this is a mid tier gaming
laptop with a six core 8 gen processor
16 gigs of ram and the NVIDIA GTX 1066
gigabyte graphics card not only are we
going to be looking at the gaming side
but also going to be looking at the
productivity side because if you're
gonna buy a 6 core laptop with 16 gigs
of ram then you're probably gonna use it
for more than just gaming you only
really need a quad core and a px of ram
for gaming and that's because games are
more dependent on the GPU so a faster
GPU will get you better performance so
The Omen starts at $800 for the i5 and
GTX 1050 Ti however the six core version
we're checking out in this video is
going for around $1000 and it also comes
with a 128 gigabyte m2 SSD and a one
terabyte SSD it's also very easy to
upgrade just remove the screws holding
the back panel and you get access to
both the drives the RAM and the Wi-Fi
card also down here is the 71 hour
battery which will get you around 2
hours and 40 minutes with 20% battery
left so expect around three hours of
battery life on this by the way guys the
battery test done on my laptop videos
are done through the PC mark workstation
benchmark that way it's consistent
throughout every single laptop video you
guys watch the build quality is really
good it has the omen trademark so mostly
black with red accents and I really like
the carbon fiber material on the top as
well the keyboard deck is made out of
aluminum but the back plate and top
plate are both made out of plastic so
there is a good amount of flex on the
display which is to be expected nothing
to worry about
I also like the hinge design I feel like
it's built really well and it opens up
easily one hand which is always a plus
for me I also didn't notice any bowing
across the keyboard probably because of
the aluminum backing overall I'm very
happy with the construction of the omen
so the monitor is a 15.6 inch full HD
IPS display we had 60 Hertz or fresh
rate and it has this anti-glare coating
the viewing angles are not too bad even
with the anti glare
however II can't expect some color
shifting here and there now if you guys
are looking for a 4k display instead
then the omen laptop does have a 4k
option available but the laptop comes
with a 1050 Ti instead now the reason
why the laptop comes with a 1050 Ti is
because laptop is meant to be used
mostly for productivity you get a 6 core
processor up to 32 gigs of ram and more
storage options so anybody was gonna be
picking up a 4k display option is
obviously gonna be using it for CPU
intensive tasks and also programs that
eat up a lot more ram the 1050 Ti is a
nice plus if you want a game in 1080p
but the main reason for the 4k display
is for productivity so the screen
doesn't get that bright at 213 it's it's
good enough for indoor use and it's
accurate enough to do color sensitive
work one of the more welcoming changes
coming from the previous models are the
bezels it does have a chin but the sides
and the top are very thin which is great
since they are able to utilize all that
space for screen real estate instead
they were even able to squeeze in the
front-facing camera up on the top the
keyboard is really nice
the keys are RGB backlit and spaced
nicely I haven't run into any issues
typing or trying to reach certain keys I
feel like the shift key and the
backspace are easy to reach but the
arrow keys took some getting used to
the lighting is controlled through their
software however you're only able to
change the colors of each zone rather
than each individual key but they do get
really bright if you crank up the
settings the trackpad isn't using when
those precision drivers which is what I
prefer in laptops but it's not bad it
tracks very well for the most part
however once in a while it won't
recognize some of the gestures I make
it's not a big deal for connectivity I
love what HP did here so check this out
guys they put the most used ports on the
sides so on the left you get an SD card
reader USB 3 with the headphone jack and
another USB 3 on the other side but they
move the rest of the ports in the back
you get HDMI mini display Thunderbolt
and even an Ethernet port back here this
is a really nice design choice by HP
because this way you don't end up with a
bunch of cables coming out from the
sides of your laptop awesome so the 1060
does great in games
obviously you can expect the game
comfortably over 60fps across most
triple-a titles in high settings some
newer games like Shadow the Tomb Raider
are more demanding so if you want to
play over 60fps you will have to lower
the settings a bit The Omen also does
great in productivity the 8750 h is
enough to power those CPU hungry
applications editing is a great example
I was able to cut 4k footage easily and
I didn't experience any issues you can't
expect some stuttering and lagging while
scrubbing through the timeline on 4k
files however for 1080p it's actually
buttery smooth 4k playback was also
fairly smooth however I had to lower the
quality to 75% but overall experience
was very pleasant editing on the Illman
now here's where things get heated
literally so when it comes to thermals I
wasn't that impressed the CPU and GPU
get pretty toasty after gaming on a
laptop for over an hour with the CPU
temps hitting around 90 degrees Celsius
the temps got so hot that I even
experienced some throttling playing
black ops 4 if you guys take a look at
the graph here you can see where the GPU
dips and clock speed every time it dips
I experienced a split-second stutter
in-game for some reason black ops 4 was
the only game that made the Omen
throttle other games like overwatch csgo
fortnight and even pub G were smooth no
stuttering or lagging playing those
games this leads me to believe that the
game is not yet optimised considering it
was just launched so I'm confident that
an update can fix this later on which
leads me to the fan noise even an idle
you can hear them and if you're in a
quiet place like a library then it can
get pretty annoying really fast
unfortunately there is no way to control
the fan speed manually otherwise this
would have been an easy fix
now once you start using a laptop for
gaming or editing the fans will kick up
and you're gonna want to put on some
headphones because they get pretty loud
especially once you put it on
performance mode so yeah I wouldn't
recommend taking this to quiet places
like libraries or Church on Sunday is
anywhere else you'll be fine finally I
want to talk about the mind frame
headset and the reactor Mouse first up
is the headset and guys this is one of
the coolest had said
I have used quite literally so this
headset features frost cap and it
basically uses a thermoelectric device
inside each ear cup to cool the speaker
grill plates to transfer the heat away
from your ears honestly guys I thought
it was a gimmick at first but man it
works like a charm that it actually
feels really nice it's like having your
own personal air conditioning for your
ears it is trippy the headset itself is
very comfortable to wear with a
synthetic leather padding for the
headband which automatically adjusts for
your head and they come with these
breathable mesh ear cups which fit
nicely around my ears and at 7.1 virtual
surround sound with a built-in
microphone and you can control the
volume using a knob on the ear cups the
RGB lighting on the ear cups can be
customized using the allman command
center and through here you can also
even control the icecap cooling
technology but yeah guys if you're
looking for a solid built great sounding
headset for those super long sessions of
gaming then you gotta check out the mind
frame headset the frost cap feature on
this thing is insane finally we have the
reactor mouse so a lot of people have
been talking about this mouse on the
forums and I realized why quickly it's a
really great mouse for fast paced games
it's really light and compact with
rubber grips on both sides making it
really easy to lift and slide around
it's a 16,000 dpi mouse with RGB
lighting and a metal cable which keeps
the wire on the table and prevents it
from kinks I really like the thumb rest
on the side it keeps my thumb from
rubbing across the mouse pad every time
I have to drag the mouse around and I'm
not a really cool feature is the
adjustable palm rest there's a lever on
the side that lets you adjust the height
and it's actually the first time I've
seen this on a gaming mouse I think that
HP did a great job on this laptop they
definitely improved on their omen lineup
over the past few years I think this is
the best omen laptop to date the fan
noise on this shouldn't be a big issue
to most people because I'm sure you guys
to be carrying around your headset or
your earphones every time nobody really
uses the speakers on laptop especially
in public places so if you guys can look
past that and the minor hiccup with
throttling on black ops 4 then I think
that this is definitely a solid buy for
anyone looking for a lab
top for gaming and productivity and that
does it for my review of the omen gaming
laptop I'll jump a link below if you
guys want to check this out along with
the headset and the reactor mouse which
is actually my favorite mouse right now
if you guys enjoyed the video and want
to see more types of these laptop
reviews drop a like and make sure to
dislike if you didn't enjoy the video
thanks again for watching and as always
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
