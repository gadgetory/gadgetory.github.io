brand-new season of setup Wars basically
after 50 episodes we begin a new season
which means new contestants and new
setups so if you guys submitted your
setup a few months ago or even last year
and didn't get featured now's your time
to submit your setup so make sure to
watch the video linked below
but yeah without wasting any more time
let the setup wars begin never pay full
price for games ever again guys g2a
offers the cheapest cd-keys you can find
anywhere check them out by clicking on
the link below as always everyone's gear
for their setups along with anything I
recommend in this episode will be linked
below but here are your 5 very first
contestants for the brand-new season we
have Cameron Chandler Manuel Martin and
William congratulations for making it on
the show starting off the episode we
have Cameron with a triple display setup
we have a 34 inch Acer predator in
between - 24 inch Asus displays which
are in vertical mode on the desk of the
courser k95 RGB keyboard and a Logitech
Proteus spectrum mouse with a blue Yeti
setup off to the left side we also have
a pair of San Heiser momentum M 2's
hanging from the drawers and a Samsung
wireless charger the PC that's pushing
all these pixels has a 59 60 X which is
overclocked to 4.5 and then we have 2
gigabyte 980ti s and sli cable
management is on point it looks like all
the cables are wrapped up and are off of
the ground I wish I had an outlet with
as many slots as you have there the most
I get are two sockets at a time which is
pretty annoying I also noticed how close
the keyboard is to the edge of the desk
and I kind of find it a bit odd since
most people including myself love having
extra space between the keyboard and the
edge of the desk to rest my arms on but
if that's comfortable for you then I
have no problem with that there are a
few things just laying around like the
Xbox controller and headphones but
overall it's a really sweet setup and
also see that you have the black and
white dxracer chair as well as a really
sweet ocean view
Thank You Cameron for entering next up
we have Chandler with a pretty simple
setup a 25 inch Acer monitor with a
Razer BlackWidow chroma keyboard and a
razor Mamba chroma Mouse both of which
are tournament editions on top of the
Razer Goliath is extended mousepad the
headset of choice is the Razer Kraken in
blue for some reason and we also have a
blue snowball mic that's resting on the
Xbox one to the left side the PCs
powering this setup has a 6600 K that's
overclocked to 4.0 and it's paired with
two EVGA GTX 970 s and sli with awesome
fallout 4 back plates and also a custom
painted SLI bridge great work on the mod
selection there I also just noticed the
Razer Leviathan sound bar underneath the
monitor cable management seems to be on
point I don't really see any cables
anywhere so whatever you did with them
seems to be working
overall the desk surface seems a bit
small to be honest and having the Xbox
one there really takes up a big chunk of
it if you don't really need to use that
space and I guess you can just leave it
there but I would recommend an extension
arm for the microphone so it's easier to
reach there also isn't any consistency
in the color theme it looks like you're
going for black and white but the blue
Razer headset and the green mousepad
kind of throw it off a bit I also see
that you're a huge fan of The Walking
Dead judging by the posters and pictures
it is that an autograph from Carl that's
pretty dope but you know what no one
really likes him overall it's a great
set of Thank You Chandler for entering
at number three we have Manuel with our
second triple display set up and two
mice a single 27-inch asus rog swift
in-between to 1080p asus monitors the
keyboard of choice is the Logitech G 9
10 and we also have two mice a worldcat
cone xtd and a Logitech g600 for them
mmo's excellent placement with a boom
arm which is hooked up to the t-bone SC
440 mic we also have a pair of bear
dynamic DT 770 headphones with the mod
mic attachment resting on the desk and
finally another dxracer chair to top off
the setup once again there really isn't
a consistency in a theme there's just a
lot of different colors which isn't a
bad thing by the way it's just a
personal preference and this entire
setup board series is based off my
preference so don't think that you're
obligated to change
just because I'm recommending it these
are just my opinions cable management
looks pretty good overall majority of
the wires and power strips are hooked up
on the roof and then we have a single
set of wires going down for the
subwoofer which is cool and then we have
the headphone wire hanging down there's
really nothing you can do with that
other than adding a headphone hanger
underneath and then wrapping the cable
around it that will definitely look a
lot cleaner though the PCs powering the
setup has a 5820k which is overclocked
to 4.5 and a gtx 980ti
also a great job on the cable management
for the PC I like how you set up the
monitors you have the usual layout and
then you have the chilling on the bed
layout to where you can basically flip
the monitor around and watch videos
while relaxing in your bed very clever
overall a very double triple display
setup Thank You Manuel for entering if
Mac setups have their own seal of
approval I would give it to Martin hands
down this isn't just a setup it's a work
of art we have a 27 inch iMac on top of
the Alex add-on unit and two speakers
from Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins that steal the
show ladies and gentlemen this is
minimalism at its finest we also have
the Sennheiser TR 130 wireless
headphones off to the left side an
amplifier underneath the Alex unit and a
beer opener mounted against the wall not
really sure what that's about but
overall this is a very clean setup with
excellent cable management not much else
to say or even recommend but thank you
Martin for blessing my eyes with such
beauty last but not least we have
William and his multi system setup we
have two ACS 27-inch monitors and Razer
BlackWidow chroma keyboard and a death
adder mouse we also have the blue Yeti
Mike with a pair of logitech g930 s
resting on it and an MSI laptop on the
other side breaking the trend of dxracer
chairs we have an ache a racing chair
instead which honestly looks all the
same to me but at least there is more of
a consistency in this setup
despite the green mouse pad from Razer
the PC on the other hand is powering
this setup has a 47 70 and a GTX 780
inside the Corsair air 540 case I like
the little figurines you have across
your desk
I think it has a nice touch to your
setup and gives a little personality but
the cable management on the other hand
I do not like there's a bunch of wires
on the floor that can easily be hidden
in these sleeves that you can zip up
together and you can even hide a power
strip in a cable box if you want the
other set of cables on the other side
can also be hidden using the Omni mount
cable sleeve and it will honestly clean
up the bottom half of your entire setup
but make sure to check out the links
below if you're interested in picking
those up but everything else looks good
a pretty cool setup overall thank you
William for entering but that will do it
for a very first episode of the new
season of setup wars as always make sure

desk setup as always voting will end

the new season of setup wars and I'll
