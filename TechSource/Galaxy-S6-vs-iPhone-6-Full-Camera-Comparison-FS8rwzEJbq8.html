One m9 is sponsored by cell cashier com
they compared iPhone prices on the
Internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iPhone what's up
guys and welcome to another ultimate
camera comparison video this time we are
facing off the samsung galaxy s6 and s6
edge against the iPhone 6 or 6 plus but
Before we jump into the sample let's
take a quick look at their specs so the
galaxy s6 and s6 edge both have the same
exact camera which is a 16 megapixel
rear-facing camera with an aperture of
1.9 that can shoot up to 4k resolution
at 30fps the iPhone 6 and 6-plus also
have the same camera with an 8 megapixel
rear facing camera and an aperture of
2.2 that can shoot up to only 1080p at
60fps both phones feature optical image
stabilization except the iPhone 6 which
only has digital surprisingly the galaxy
s6 and s6 edge don't have digital image
stabilization whereas both the iPhones
do now for slow-motion the iPhone 6 and
6-plus can shoot up to 240 frames per
second and 720p whereas the galaxy s6
and s6 edge can only shoot up to 120 fps
in the same resolution for front-facing
cameras the galaxy s6 and edge both have
a 5 megapixel camera that can shoot in
1440p at 30fps whereas the 1.2 megapixel
camera on the iPhone 6 and 6-plus can
only shoot in 720p at 30fps so that's a
Frollo spec since both the galaxy phones
have the same camera and both the
iPhones at the same camera I'm going to
be using the s6 and the 6 plus to
perform the camera test so that wasting
any more time let's check out the
samples
when it comes to focusing the galaxy s6
does a fantastic job no problems
whatsoever trying to focus the object
and the speed is insanely fast most
definitely faster than the iPhone 6
samsung has definitely improved this
feature from the last year's model the
iPhone 6 plus on the other hand focuses
really well I actually have no
complaints here although it's not as
fast as the s6 is that's for sure for
daylight video the galaxy s6 takes some
stunning footage in 4k resolution it has
great color reproduction and just
overall the video is a lot more vivid
the iPhone 6 footage seems way too
washed out compared to the galaxy s6 and
you can especially tell by looking at
the sky there's definitely no
competition here and I'm going to give
the point to galaxy s6 for daylight
video
moving to low-light video it's a
different story the iPhone six-plus this
footage is a lot more sharp even though
it's a bit darker than the galaxy s6 at
least it doesn't have as much noise and
this white fog over the video you can
actually read the sign that says
Northwest Business Park so I'll have to
give the point to the six plus for
low-light video what does it be guys and
welcome to the stabilization test and
microphone test between both of the
phones that you see on the screen and
also make sure you guys check out the
audio icon somewhere on the screen and
it will basically tell you which phone's
microphone is being used all the phones
are strapped onto one device to ensure a
accurate stabilization reading also all
the phones are being shot in 1080p to
ensure optical image stabilization is
enabled if the phone does have optical
image stabilization for stabilization
and microphone quality the s6 easily
takes the point you can clearly see how
smooth the video is on the galaxy s6
compared to the iPhone 6 as well as the
audio being produced from the microphone
it's just that much louder and clearer
for daylight pics the galaxy s6 produces
stunning pictures as well the 16
megapixel camera definitely makes a
difference as the images look more
sharper and detailed the iPhone 6 also
does a great job but I think the s6
definitely has the edge not only is
there more contrast but the colors are
more true to life the galaxy s6 is
dynamic range is also superior I mean
everything is crystal clear in the shot
on the s6 even the front-facing camera
is a lot better than the iPhone 6 is you
just can't compete with 5 megapixels the
galaxy s6 definitely takes the point for
daylight pictures moving indoors and
away from the Sun I think both phones
are pretty much equal here the 6 plus
seems to have better whites while
maintaining great color reproduction and
the s6 remains sure to life the color of
the cup and the s6 shot resembles the
actual color in real life dimming the
lights a bit the s6 seems to be doing
better at maintaining white balance and
less
images than these six plus the flash is
also exceptionally great on the s6 on
most objects it's not too weak or too
strong and it's nicely balanced except
when you're taking pictures of white
objects for some reason white objects
like to absorb the flash from the s6
which in return over exposes the entire
shot like you see here with the white
flour and the miniature Android figurine
so for low-light performance on pictures
I'm gonna have to call it a tie since
both cameras have their strengths and
weaknesses so the final verdict I'm
gonna have to give the win to the galaxy
s6 it is well deserved and I applaud
Samsung for finally making a great
smartphone camera to compete against the
iPhone 6 the colour contrasts dynamic
range through realism and the amount of
sharpness and detail in the galaxy s6
pictures are stunning and no doubt it
has a phenomenal smooth video camera as
well that takes stunning 4k video the 6
plus still dominates a low-light and its
flash is really hard to beat even till
today
well done Samsung so that's it for the
