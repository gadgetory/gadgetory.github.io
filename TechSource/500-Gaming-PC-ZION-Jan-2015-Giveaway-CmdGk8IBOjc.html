what's up guys it's ed from Texas and
welcome to another PC project we asked
and you guys voted on Twitter to see a
five hundred dollar gaming budget build
so here it is in this video we will be
going over all the parts we selected all
so make sure you guys stay till the end
of the video for a special announcement
so with that said let's start with the
case here are some specifications on the
side for those of you that are
interested and also all the parts showed
in this video will be listed in the
description section down below our paths
to ultimate gaming pcs have always been
inside NZXT cases and it isn't
surprising that we went with another
NZXT case for our budget gaming pc i
just personally love their case designs
and the prices are great too so I went
with the source 210 mid tower case
because it looks really clean and a
white case is pretty attractive for a
tower instead of the regular boring
black look so the source 210 is a mid
tower and we didn't go with a mini ATX
case this time around because we wanted
some extra space for future
expandability although the case itself
is pretty small anyways on the front you
have your audio ports and two USB 3.0
slots along with three DVD drive slots
however for this build we aren't going
to be installing any disk drives looking
inside the case there's actually plenty
of room for all of our parts and more
definitely space for more storage if
needed in the future next up we got the
motherboard we chose the Asus m5 a 97
because it fits all of our requirements
and it comes with just the essentials we
need for a gaming PC you really don't
need a ton of extra features that you
probably won't even need especially when
you're on a budget we feel that this
model is the best possible selection out
of any other motherboard currently out
the board also has a 2 SP ports two of
which are 3.0 and it has 4 Express slots
and two additional regular PCI slots it
also has 4 Ram slots which can support
up to 32 gigabytes and 20 133 megahertz
of memory speed for the graphics card we
went with the ACE suits r9 270 and it's
probably the best bang for your buck
graphics card you can buy at the moment
which made it the obvious choice for our
gaming budget build the overclocked r9
270 should handle most games at medium
to high settings without any problems
and it's custom asus cooling system will
keep it nice and cool and relatively
quiet you also get the usual DVI and VGA
ports along with one standard HDMI na
this
I port if you feel like connecting the
PC to a 4k monitor moving on to RAM you
can't go wrong with g.skill RAM sticks
because they are notorious for being low
priced and very reliable making it an
easy choice for budget builds we went
with two sticks of focus bytes each
clocked at 1600 megahertz of memory
speed a thicker bytes of RAM will be
plenty for gaming and light editing if
needed now let's talk about the space we
figured one terabyte is plenty for
gaming and whenever the time comes to
expand we can just add another terabyte
to the collection with no problem remind
you that this is a budget build so going
with SSDs would completely defeat the
purpose of this build although it would
have been a very nice addition going
with the budget field we had to go with
an AMD processor because they offer the
best price per performance you can
currently buy this is currently the best
processor you can purchase for this
price point it does come clocked at 3.5
gigahertz stock but we are going to
overclock this as close as possible to 4
gigahertz and with its 6 cores running
at that speed this PC is going to run
like butter the CPU does come with its
very own heatsink so you don't have to
purchase a separate CPU cooler now will
this be enough when we overclock the CPU
I think it should be fine for a slight
overclocking but we will push it to its
limit and see how much we can get out of
it last but certainly not the least we
have the power supply to power up this
bad boy 500 watts is plenty for this
configuration and it even has extra
juice to support an extra graphics card
if needed I decided going modular for an
extra 5 bucks won't hurt at all since I
hate cables with a passion and I want my
pcs to look very clean and clutter-free
had to go with coarser a brand I swear
by I will never go with any other brands
when it comes to the power supply
because Corsair has kept me happy all my
life building pcs with no problems and I
always say why change things that work
so well well there you have it that is
all the parts that we are going to use
in this build those of you that follow
me on Twitter and Instagram already have
seen the parts since I like to post a
lot of sneak peeks and I will continue
to upload pics starting today for this
PC build and other stuff as well so if
you guys want to follow me there you
certainly can alright so that's it for
the video I hope you guys enjoyed it
before I go I want to make some quick
announcements first off this PC is going
to be given away to one lucky subscriber
and it's going to be an international
giveaway and we will have a video
with the requirements later this week so
make sure you guys stick around for that
I've actually partnered with two other
youtubers to make this happen and all
the details will be explained in the
video coming up within this week so make
sure you guys stick around for that the
second announcement I want to make is
that this PC is going to be split into
three projects kind of like how I did
with big red but instead of four parts
is going to be only three parts part 1
will be the selection process which
you've already seen part 2 will be the
build process of this PC with the parts
that you see here we're actually going
to be doing a step-by-step instructions
on how to build a species so those of
you that want to actually buy the parts
yourself and do it you will know exactly
how to so that's gonna be part 2 and
then the final part will be the actual
completion of the PC and we'll be doing
gaming performances and the benchmarks
tests just like how I did with big red
so that's all the announcements I have
to make on this video if you guys enjoy
this video feel free to leave a like and
if you didn't you can leave it dislike
and let me know your thoughts about the
parts election in the comment section
down below as I'm actually interested to
hear what you guys think anyways thanks
again for watching this is that from
tech source and I'll see you guys in
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
