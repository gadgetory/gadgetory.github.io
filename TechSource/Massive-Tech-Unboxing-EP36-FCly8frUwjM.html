is having a deal on the new shadow of
the Tomb Raider game on Steam for less
than $50 you can also get an additional
3% off if you use the code TSS 1 at
checkout check the link below to find
out more
what's happening guys FM tech source
welcome back to another what's in the
box episode there's a lot of exciting
stuff happening on the channel the next
few months and you guys actually get a
sneak peek or some hints on what to
expect
through these unboxing videos because
most sort of stuff they get in from
companies whether it's for a review or
for a PC build i unbox them in these
videos so you guys kind of get an idea
of what to expect but anyways what that
said as always let's start off with
small boxes and work our way up to the
big ones let's do this
alright so this tiny one is coming from
a cooler master that's dude is actually
I'm getting a lot of stuff in cooler
master and while I'm on the topic of
cooler master a lot of you guys have
been asking me what's happening with
setup makeover season 2 I can't really
go through too much detail because there
was an incident that happened recently I
don't know if I'm gonna be doing a video
on it or not but it's still in the still
in the making guys the winner has been
selected his name is Heath he lives in
North Carolina and he is the person that
I'll be going over to his house to we do
his setup but anyways from a cooler
master we've got some RAM sticks xpg DS
R or a GB RAM sticks so we had 16 gigs
here and also 16 gigs here they are
rated at 3000 megahertz ok and also from
XP G we have a 240 gigabyte and I'm that
2 SSD alright moving on
alright this next box is from also
Coolermaster there's gonna be a lot of
stuff from coolermaster so if you guys
haven't deduced already
well I'm just gonna leave it at that I'm
just gonna say user coming from
Coolermaster and those of you who've
seen season one kind of already know
what these parts are for so I don't want
to get I don't give it away too much oh
all right so this is the MH 751 gaming
headset from Coolermaster with a
detachable boom arm which is pretty cool
and it's compatible with PC ps4 Xbox one
and a Tendo switch and of course
smartphone and I shouldn't do that
anyways moving on also guys we are
planning on two seasons of setup
makeover at the same time this one is a
very special one this this next one's
coming out the one with heath is
actually being pushed to season 3 which
is gonna happen I would say sometime in
September so from MSI we've got the
Radeon rx Vega 56 this is going in
season 2 of said I'm a Kermit I
shouldn't be telling you guys this but
anyways let's actually open this up and
see what it looks like I don't want to
spoil everything for you guys I want to
keep some of this a secret so I'll just
unbox things and tell you what it is I'm
not gonna really go into detail on what
video you'll see it in
whoo she's a lot heavier than the
reference actually and this is the Vega
56 air boost version from a Masai
similar designed to the reference card
but honestly this looks a little better
because of the accents and even the
backplate looks a lot better so as I was
saying guys season 2 of SATA makeover
will begin filming in September and
season 3 will be sometime in October but
both of them will be launched before
this year ends I can promise you that I
know it's taking a long time but because
of the first because of the incident
from season 1 obviously I have to make
sure that this next person really does
need a setup all right also from my
massage we've got us more computer parts
obviously other they sent me two
motherboards but this is just an empty
black box so they sent over there be 450
tomahawk this is their new motherboard
for the B 450 platform it supports the
first and second generation rising chips
and it's got four dimm slots it's
unlocked so you can overclock the CPU as
well and it's got an old black theme so
it's gonna fit nice in this next bill
let's open it up point up whoa okay I
like it
I like the aesthetics of this board it's
really clean okay an Xbox again from
Coolermaster maybe I should just do all
the cooler master boxes first and then
leave the MSI ones oh hey this is the ML
240 our RGB cooler from coolermaster I
don't think I've actually used one of
these ever in a build so it's gonna be
the first time officially oh that's
pretty cool it's got its own RGB
controller so you can control it via
remote instead of using the software
this is interesting choice I'm guessing
they did this because not a lot of
low-end boards have a dedicated RGB
header on there so it did give you an
optional remote but you can also hook it
up to your board if you do have a
dedicated or you beheaded because it is
supporting our async and of course the
MSI miss
big light so it's pretty cool all right
our first box that isn't from our MSI or
coolermaster this is actually from
Amazon I think this is something I
bought oh yes I was actually waiting for
this I was wondering where it was so a
lot of you guys know I currently use a
blink security system at home and at my
office why I bought one for the outdoors
the the white version that you guys see
on the channel a lot is for indoors only
this one specifically is made for
outdoors because it's more durable it's
water-resistant and it's got a longer
range so it's gonna be connecting to
your Wi-Fi router inside your home a lot
better so yeah I picked up five more
cameras to install around my home just
to be a little more cautious let's open
this up why not I think there are the
same exact size as the indoor ones - oh
wait a minute now things are a little
bigger yeah these look slightly bigger
the low-light performance on the on here
is a lot better as well
because obviously it's for outdoors all
right now this one's from a snooze okay
let's see what we got here okay so first
up is the Strix RX Vega 64 and to
complement that of course we've got the
Asus Strix X 40 eye gaming motherboard
this is a micro ATX version of the x47
the platform again supports both first
generation and second generation rising
ships
so both these builds actually that are
coming up are gonna be an AMD build so
we've got a AMD CPU and of course an
anti GPU I've been giving Intel a lot of
love recently so I like to balance
things up and do some AMD builds for you
guys as well
alright almost forgot about this one
this is coming from my good friends at
cable mod
this is also a pretty big giveaway on
what color scheme the PC is going to be
obviously judging by the color scheme of
the cables that I ordered so nothing too
exciting these are all black even with
the cable combs the aluminum cable combs
are also all black there's a movie
coming out in October which involves an
old black theme that's all safe you guys
figure it out right in the comment
section because that is what the next
setup makeover season is gonna be
revolved around and that is what the
next PC build is gonna be as well so
yeah all black cables black cable combs
this is actually for another build this
is black with white accents alright this
one is coming also from coolermaster
alright
see what you got in here this knife is
like falling apart I've used this for
such a long time you guys remember that
episode where I unbox this another
unboxing knife well another knife I
should say I wonder if it's the same one
this time oh this looks bad ass take a
look at that it kind of reminds you the
msi dragon this looks sick wow what
whoever sent this to me by the way it's
been holding up really good okay so this
is the V 750 power supply from
Coolermaster you guys probably saw the
me unbox this a few episodes ago well I
lost the power supply so they sent in a
brand new one for me to use Coolermaster
again okay Oh
yes keyboard and we got a mousepad as
well so this is the master key MK 750
RGB mechanical keyboard with a
detachable wrist rest this is actually a
really nice looking keyboard Wow Cherry
MX switches
it's got RGB backlighting with a light
bar that's really cool I haven't seen
that on any keyboard so far this one's
from Amazon I think this is something I
purchased myself actually this one is a
personal purchase usually I don't hold
off on Amazon boxes when something comes
in for Amazon I know it's something I
placed an order on so I unbox it
immediately because well it's probably
important but for some reason I don't
open this one up
why oh okay this was actually recently
sent to me that's probably why so here's
a few things I ordered for myself this
is a case for my external hard drive
from Seagate I have a 5 terabyte
external drive that I take with me
everywhere although important files are
on there like my intro the music that I
use in the videos and stuff like that so
I don't have a case for it so I ordered
one I thought I was gonna be red but
it's kind of like a pinkish tint to it
ok and then this one is a smaller case
for my external SSD from Samsung I
bought a one terabyte Samsung t5
portable SSD because I have all my games
installed on there so when I'm doing
benchmarks that is what I use to store
my games and stuff so yeah 2 cases for
that and you guys might be wondering ed
why did you buy a laptop stand a lot of
you guys have been asking me that I do a
laptop themed
setup I do a lot of high-end custom PC
setups but none of them have a laptop in
it so I'm gonna change things up a bit
and throw in a laptop for my next
ultimate desk setup which by the way
guys it's coming up I would say sometime
in September so be psyched because it's
gonna look pretty epic let me see they
sent the wrong color
just looks like a silver one to me Oh
apparently its face great but in the
picture look really black to me yeah I
can work with this
I thought I was gonna be like black
black would have been really cool but
Space Gray I think I can make it work
all right this next one's from my good
friends at ek it's open top okay all
righty there's a as always there's a lot
of stuff in here so the back plate over
here we got the actual block itself a
120 millimeter radiator got some soft
tubing
yes soft tubing you guys because because
why not no reason really it's actually a
lot easier to do soft tubing at home on
a time crunch so we got a 140 reservoir
and pump combo some cables not a bunch
of fittings again they're all black guys
and two additional radiators you got the
240 slim and the 360 so yeah really cool
old black-themed
PC coming up as well with the black
cables that you guys saw earlier this is
for setup makeover season two by the way
I can give you guys too many hints you
know what I'm done I'm done talking
about it
you guys are gonna have to wait and see
it's gonna be epic though the only thing
missing from here is the RGB CPU block
which I think I got an email a few days
ago from UK they shipped it out to more
massive boxes to go guys kiss ones from
MSI
there's quite a few things in here first
up we have a gaming headset the immerse
GH 70 RGB I don't know why people do RGB
head says it just it makes no sense
unless you're playing in front of a
mirror and you can constantly see
yourself with the lights on but I don't
I don't understand RGB headsets honestly
this box is really light must be a very
comfortable headset alright what else
you got
I'm a cyclic GM 70 Mouse RGB of course
ooh we got a risin 5 2600 X the second
generation risin CPU and it's coming
with its own cooler oh this is a very
heavy keyboard the vigor GK 80
mechanical RGB keyboard this actually
looks really nice Wow
I want to open this one up actually
let's see what we got in here
homicide loves the red accents that
feels nice it's got a really nice design
I like the brushed aluminum top plates
but it's got red accents here's my take
on RGB device as you guys if if a
company is going RGB why would they add
an on RGB accent that doesn't go with
RGB lighting if I want the keyboard to
be blue colors for example on the LEDs
it's not gonna match the red accent on
here so it just I don't know you guys
get what I'm trying to say here it makes
no sense adding a color that's not
neutral you know just make this white or
something or maybe black that fits in
with the RGB P alright let's check this
one all this is actually a wireless
mouse as well so it could be wired or
Wireless what I feels a nice
it's got a very flat surface on the top
so this is more for palm grippers I'm
guessing yeah not so much for claw or
finger type grips looks like it's
modular as well you can customize the
top plate on here also the sides that is
dope okay all right guys the final box
is from DHL oh it's this big yellow box
also from MSI let's check this out I've
got a cooler master 550 power supply
another RGB cooler this one is the ML
240 from cooler masters it's the same
one as the other one so I'm guessing the
top one is the newer one
I wonder what the difference really is
one comes with the remote and the other
one doesn't
some storage devices got the HyperX
savage - 40 gigabytes SSD and we also
got some RAM sticks also from HyperX 16
gigs at 2400 megahertz
another rise in CPU have another 2600 X
another be 450 tomahawk motherboard with
the MSI rx 580 ladies and gentlemen is
actually one more thing down here oh
it's a hard drive the Seagate 2 terabyte
Barracuda hard drive
so that's pretty much it for the video I
hope you guys enjoyed it
everything unboxed he obviously will be
linked down below make sure you guys
have notifications enabled because
there's some really really cool exciting
stuff happening on the channel before
this year ends 2018 is coming to an end
unfortunately it is your zoom by pretty
quickly Wow anyways thank you guys so
much again for your support I love your
faces and I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
