just got finished watching the world
wide developer conference and he already
top five things I took away from it
let's start off with the improvements to
messaging there were a few updates
introduced here but my favorite is
Apple's decision to open up the SDK and
allow for the third party apps to be
built into the messaging experience so
for example you could without ever
leaving messages use square cash to
transfer money to another user the
second notable change to messaging are
the new ways of interaction like being
able to send different sized emojis and
dynamic bubbles that grow and shrink to
allow different ways of expression
messages and pictures also now have a
way of being sent with an element of
surprise users will have to swipe or tap
particles away to reveal a received
picture or message and finally the last
cool thing I saw what messaging was the
full screen effects one of the examples
shown were of birthday balloons flowing
in the background of the conversation
when the keyboard happy birthday was
sent I just think this makes the
messaging experience a lot more animated
and fun the second notable change coming
to iOS 10 are the improvements
introduced to Siri there are a few
changes here with the most notable being
the third party integration with iOS 10
we should see things like being able to
call an uber start work out sending
payments to friends and much more
Apple's keyboard also is getting a major
overhaul with the help of Siri it will
now be able to use Siri to offer
suggestions like calendar availability
and intelligence scheduling based on
what you're typing third on my list is
the reworked Maps application it's
getting an all-new design that makes it
easier to access the controls the app is
also more proactive and has better
search filters something they're also
doing is adding quick controls to be
able to see nearby gas or food stops
that go along your route and sticking
with this theme of opening up SDKs Maps
has also received its treatment
third-party apps like uber and open
table can build functionality straight
in like ordering a ride or booking a
table they've also improved the
infrastructure of the app with live
traffic conditions finally being
available all the changes might just
bring me back from google maps but the
jury's still out on that one the fourth
change is the addition of the new home
app this makes it a lot easier to
interact with your home kit supported
accessories so controlling your lights
they're almost
locking your doors are easily accessible
through one app instead of a bunch of
third party ones the home app also
includes automation with the geofencing
and scheduled tasks so for example
having a garage door open and the
jacuzzi start up when you pull up to
your house I mean I don't know about you
guys but that sounds freaking cool and
finally my last favorite change to iOS
is probably what gets used the least
nowadays and smartphones the phone
application now carriers can include
information on your screen when you
receive a call which is a big plus for
me because I get a ridiculous amount of
spam call so this should cut out a good
amount of those they've also included
the ability of voicemail transcripts
which is basically text from what was
said in the voicemail this is definitely
a cool feature and I can see this saving
me a lot of time instead of listening to
the entire message I can basically skim
through the entire text but overall I
was somewhat disappointed with the whole
conference not because of what Apple
presented but the lack of any new
hardware I was really looking forward to
some of the new macbooks but i guess i
left the week until their next event as
far as iOS goes they brought some cool
things to the table and definitely
improved on some things that needed it
but overall nothing was mind-blowing but
that pretty much wraps up this video if
you guys enjoyed it make sure to leave a
like and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
