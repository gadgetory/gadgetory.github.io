look at samsung's newly released Galaxy
Tab pro 10.1 we first saw this tablet
Samsung's booth during CES 2014 along
with a few other Samsung tablets the
2560 by 1600 10.1 inch screen puts it
right in the middle of Samsung's tablet
line out of the box it comes with
Android 4.4 KitKat and magazine UI on
top swiping from the right of the screen
you will be able to run two apps side by
side which is not something new from
Samsung but the new menu system does
offer quicker and easier way to access
this feature the big thing with this
tablet was Samsung's new magazine
interface it lives a part of the
homescreen kind of like the blinkfeed
for HTC it gives the user glanceable
information about certain topics all
which can be changed the users liking
you can also browse through more stories
by simply swiping up and this makes it
really easy to quickly catch up without
having to actually enter the application
swiping to the right we are brought to
the productivity screen where users have
access to that personal calendar a
customizable new widget where news that
only matters to you is presented as well
as easy access to email swiping right
takes us back to the traditional Android
home screen swiping down we can see that
we have quick access to settings as well
as a slider to easily control the
brightness of the screen as well as the
tablets volume the menu system is
divided into tabs where the user can
easily find the settings that they are
looking for but we kind of found this
confusing at times probably because we
are so used to a more traditional
settings layout from our quick hands-on
here with the Galaxy Tab pro we feel
unimpressed sure the display is gorgeous
but that's about all at the tablets
going for maybe if Samsung had opted to
include the s-pen we would have thought
that the tablet offered more but they
did not as a right now there is nothing
that really separates this tablet from
all the other Android tablets out there
on paper it seems like an absolute beast
with a Snapdragon 800 CPU and 2 gigs of
RAM but unfortunately that's not the
case there were times when we would
experience lag and severe delayed
applications like as
voice which just took forever to respond
I'm sure this is mostly because of
TouchWiz and all features that come with
jammed into this tablet by Samsung but
that is no excuse to charge this much
for an experience that is no better than
beasts in I mean don't get me wrong this
tablet isn't a total fail I mean some
features like being able to have two
applications open on one screen make
this a great tablet for productivity and
getting work done with so much screen
real estate features like those work
really great that being said they are
not for me I always prefer a laptop or a
desktop to get work done or do anything
that requires the smallest level of
accuracy I would recommend this tablet
to anyone looking for a great screen
though I mean watching movies and
playing games should be a dream on this
so that's a quick look at the Galaxy Tab
pro 10.1 hopefully you guys enjoyed the
video if so please leave a like and as
always I will see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
