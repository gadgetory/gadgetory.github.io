five benchmarks video I figured I'll
give you guys some tips on some pretty
cool AMD PC build configurations for
those of you who have been patiently
waiting for risin 5 so the first build
is a 530 dollar budget gaming PC and
then we got a slight upgrade from that
with a better GPU and CPU for only $600
and finally a 6 core gaming and
productivity PC featuring the R X 480
for only around eight hundred seventy
bucks so the first field is using the r5
1400 which is the low-end quad core CPU
with a 3.2 gigahertz base clock it does
come with that rate to stealth coolers
so we don't have to spend extra money on
that and we can also overclock it
without any problems
the MSI B 350m will get the job done and
it costs only $80 it supports 32 gigs of
RAM features an m2 socket and four SATA
ports it honestly has all the essentials
for any budget build and the fact that
you can overclock on it is a huge plus
we are going with 8 gigabytes of RAM
which is all you need for gaming and for
storage we are sticking with the one
terabyte hard drive from WD now since
this is a budget build we are going with
the RX 460 from gigabyte which should
get you at least 30 frames in most games
and high settings however if you have an
extra $50 laying around I would go with
the Ark's 470 instead for nearly double
the performance the case we are going
with is the Zelman t2 which is a mini
tower and it's only going for $20 which
is perfect for this build it does
feature a USB 3.0 port in the front
panel which is great and powering the
entire build is a 430 watt power supply
from EVGA once again this will cost you
around five hundred thirty dollars if
you stick with the artist 460 and five
hundred eighty dollars if you go with
the RX 470 from Asus I believe which is
what I would recommend speaking of the
RX 470 this one is a more balanced build
and it's pretty much using the exact
same parts as the last build except this
time we are using a slightly faster CPU
the 1500 X and also we have the RX 470
which will get you around 60 frames and
most triple-a titles in 1080p of course
this build will cost you closer to $600
oh and almost forgot we're also using a
slightly better looking case since we
have a nice black and red theme going on
it would be cool to show that off
through the clear side panel from the
Neos
and finally we got a mid-ranged balanced
gaming and productivity PC featuring
their high-end 1600 X which is a six
core processor with a base clock of 3.6
gigahertz this PC is the perfect sweet
spot for gamers and streamers who also
do like editing whether it's graphic
design work like 3d modeling or just
video editing the 1600 X doesn't come
with a CPU cooler which is why we are
going with the 212 Evo since we are
going to be overclocking however we are
sticking with the same motherboard
because the value on this thing is
really hard to beat for RAM we are going
with 16 gigs instead of 8 to help out on
the productivity side we are speaking
with the same 1 terabyte hard drive
however adding an extra SSD your MDOT 2
is optional the GPU we are going with is
the msi RX 480 which will easily get you
over 60fps in most games and because we
have a really nice-looking black red and
white theme going on I decided to go
with the case to match that the NZXT
s340 in white and it has a clear side
panel as well which is nice and finally
powering the entire build is a 520 watt
power supply from C sonic which is fully
modular that way we can keep the build
looking clean of excess cables the total
cost of this build is a little under
$900 but it is a very solid gaming and
productivity PC so that is it for this
video if you guys enjoyed it be sure to
leave a like and if you're new here
consider subscribing because I put up
content like this consistently in fact
I'm working on a PC build a AMD PC build
featuring the 1500 X and that's coming
up within a week so if you guys are
psyched make sure to stick around thank
you so much for watching I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
