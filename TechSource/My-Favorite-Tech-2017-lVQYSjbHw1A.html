the year is almost over so I decided to
make a video and just share some of my
favorite tech of 2017 everything on this
table was either purchased by me or it
was sent in for review at one point in
time also some of the products in here
will make a great gift for the holidays
for those last-minute shoppers out there
and everything mentioned here of course
will be linked below in the order that
they up here so with that said I do want
to start off the video by talking about
probably the MVP of this entire video my
camera alright so this here is my red
digital cinema camera this is the
Scarlett W has a 5k sensor and I
attached the Sigma T to 18 to 35 Sinha
lens and let's just say it's overkill
for what I use it for I spent about 25
grand on this camera guys that's not
even including the lens the lens itself
is another five grand
so yeah you know what the sad thing is
though is I only use this like twice a
month maybe even once a month for those
high production type videos I do swap
between three cameras it's either this
the Panasonic gh4 is most of the time
and then the a 6500 from Sony which is
the one I'm using right now for this
video but yea I did purchase this in
2017 and it is one of my favorite pieces
of tech and that is why I included it in
this video but moving on to my next
favorite piece of tech my desktop
speakers these are the Edifier lunar
eclipse e 25 and i know you guys heard
me talk about these so many times but i
just can't get over the quality of these
incredible sound quality very clear
highs a very deep bass you can connect
them via bluetooth 3.5 millimeter as
well as the optical cable I think one of
the reasons why I was so attracted to
these in the first place is the design I
mean just look at these they are not
your ordinary rectangular shaped
bookshelf speakers so not only do they
look cool but they sound amazing as well
and since we're on the topic of speakers
we have these also from Edifier so these
are the Edifier are 1280 powered
bookshelf speakers technically these are
studio monitors so you would use them
or monitoring REO or mixing music you
can still use them for media whether
you're playing games or watching videos
as well because these have incredible
sound quality as well these will also
look awesome in a setup with a wooden
table top because it does have a natural
color scheme as well
silver with a wood encasing it's a very
clean design as well you got the knobs
on the side here which can control your
volume bass and treble and they're
fairly small for a bookshelf speakers so
they won't take up much space wherever
you put them I think the pair goes for
around $100 but they are one of the
highest rated bookshelf speakers on
Amazon okay since we're on the topic of
audio I do want to mention my favorite
Bluetooth speaker of all time which is
the boss if you guys remember a few
months back actually gave out a hundred
of these speakers 50 of them went to my
Twitter followers and another 51 to my
subscribers and every single person that
got their speakers in was actually very
impressed with the sound quality what
can I say about these speakers the build
quality is sturdy the sound quality is
great these get very loud there is a
little bit of distortion at max volume
but honestly you guys will be set at
around 70 75 percent max volume it's got
a pretty great bass as well but my
favorite feature of this speaker by 4 is
the auto shutoff
I think after 2 to 3 minutes of inactive
use the speaker will actually power
itself off to conserve battery life
which is awesome because I don't have to
go and manually press the button to turn
it off there's an SD card reader in the
back as well as a microphone to accept
calls thereby your life will get you
around 10 to 12 hours of continued use
but yeah overall a very solid Bluetooth
speaker it comes in four different
colors but yeah this would make a great
gift for anyone I just realized there's
a lot of audio devices in this video and
I don't even notice that until I start
out recording but anyways before I
didn't have two more audio devices left
and before I talk about my absolute
favorite headphones of all time I do
want to talk about my other favorite
wireless headphones which are DS so
these are etrex air wireless bone
conduction headphones it comes in as
rubber carrying pouch and you can
actually store your headphones in here
the micro USB charging cable and some
memory foam ear plugs my go-to source of
audio has always been wireless or wired
head
but that actually changed a few months
back when I got these in one of these
absolutely love about these is that they
don't go inside your ear they sit around
your ear and they use bone conduction
technology to basically vibrate the
sound to your ear
it delivers sound through cheek bones as
crazy as that sounds it actually works
these are really comfortable to wear and
it's also sweat resistant so if you're
jogging or going to the gym you don't
have to worry about damaging the
headphones and I think personally the
best part about these is that you're
self-aware nothing is being plugged into
your ears so you guys can hear all the
background noise and ambience however
for those of you who really want to get
lost into that music and just want to
block out all outside noise then that's
what these earplugs are for it also
comes with a microphone so you can
accept calls and I think the battery
life gets you around six hours of use
the only downside is the price it's a
little steep I think it's around 150
bucks but if you guys are looking for
earbud alternatives then I definitely
recommend trying this out and I think
it's time to talk about these these are
the pair of headphones that I've been
using I think the past two months
definitely overkill I think they cost me
around $1500 including the custom paint
job these are the sennheiser HD 800
open-back headphones i pretty much use
these for everything watching videos
playing games and even monitoring audio
I use these to edit my videos on and one
of the things I really love about these
is the comfort level extremely huge ear
cuff design and the sound quality on
these are just incredible I mean for
1500 dollars they freakin better be
right
are they worth $1,500 though definitely
not but this is definitely one of those
impulse buys that I had because of the
color scheme and everything I just I had
to have them for my setup definitely
don't recommend this for everyone this
is this is definitely overkill here's a
pretty cool tech product that I've been
using for over 4 years now this is a
smart lock this is the quick lock and
it's basically a smart lock you can open
this up three different ways first
method is by using their lock you get
the button on their top against the lock
and it's unlocked method number two is a
keychain card which I don't have with me
right now
same method press the bun tap on it and
it opens any third method is using your
smartphone so once you download the
quick lock app and go inside all I have
to do is click on the unlock button and
it becomes unlocked it's very simple it
comes in red and blue and I think one
other color and I have like three of
these around the house so this is
awesome the battery life lasts forever I
think the last up to ten years because
I've had this for four years and I
haven't even charged it once but it does
have a micro USB port in the back so you
guys can plug in and charge that if you
ever need to I love this lock so much
because I don't need to carry on any
Keys it's perfect
moving on to some actual gaming gear
let's take a look at the keyboard
amounts that a lot of you guys have
constantly been asking me about so this
is the Logitech G 613 wireless
mechanical keyboard and this is the G
603 Wireless Gaming Mouse the Logitech
actually sent this over
whenever it got released I think like
six months ago it's been a long time I
was supposed to do a video on this but I
didn't have time but I've been using it
ever since for my PC builds every single
month just because they're wireless and
the quality is incredible and easy so
yeah aside from the awesome build
quality it is a mechanical wireless
keyboard so the switches that the
keyboard is using our Romer G if you
guys are familiar with that I love the
fact that it comes with an attached
wrist rest and you can connect to the
mouse and keyboard via bluetooth or the
provided dongle on the website the
states that it has an 18 month battery
life for both the keyboard and mouse
which is ridiculous but I've had it
since the beginning and I never even
replaced the batteries once which is
pretty insane both the keyboard and
mouse do come with double-a batteries
which is cool and there's even a slot to
store the receiver for both the for both
the mouse and keyboard
I think for the keyboard it's down here
somewhere and this yeah for the keyboard
is actually next to the battery tray and
just to be clear guys I'm not a
professional gamer at all but while
playing games like pop G or overwatch I
honestly can't tell a difference between
this wireless mechanical keyboard and
the coarser mechanical keyboard that I'm
using in terms of latency and response
it's pretty crazy how accurate these are
I feel like a lot of you guys are going
to judge me
right now but one of the reasons why I'm
not using the mouse and keyboard for my
main setup is because they don't have
RGB if Logitech came out with a RGB
version of the mouse and keyboard
consider me sold but I feel like that
would impact the battery life a lot
which is one of the reasons why they
didn't go with it
but yeah a very solid mouse and keyboard
combo if you guys are looking to go the
wireless route and still want a quality
mechanical keyboard with extremely fast
response time I recommend checking this
out I do want to quickly mention the HTC
vive this is definitely one of my
favorite pieces of tech of 2017 this has
definitely changed my perspective in VR
I've tried the PlayStation VR I've tried
oculus rift and honestly none of that
comes close to the vibe from the comfort
of the headset to the accuracy of the
controls and just overall design of the
vive I feel like there is nothing out
there that comes even close that's just
my opinion but yeah I just had to
quickly mention that because is
definitely one of my favorite pieces of
tech of 2017 and I had to put it in this
video I just had to alright let's talk
about this little thing over here a lot
of you guys thought that this was an
airless fan from Dyson and I know what
you guys are talking about because it
looks very similar but it's not this is
actually a smart lamp from GE general
electronics these guys make
refrigerators and washers and stuff like
that so it's crazy that they actually
built a smart lamp so this is pretty
much a smart lamp with alexa built in it
comes with a very own app and on here
you guys can control the brightness the
color temperature and you can even
create certain scenes where you
basically combined the brightness and
color temperature on specific times of
the day for example if you're watching
movies or if it's nighttime whatever it
is you guys can configure it within the
app there's even a pretty cool feature
on here where you can set a clock
display which will tell you what time it
is based on the blue and red LED
indicator that's cool and all but my
personal favorite feature is the
built-in alexa pretty much functions as
any other device with alexa built in
whether it's the Amazon echo or the
Amazon dot
hey Alexa what time is it today
the time is 1003 p.m. hey Alexa can you
set a timer for 10 minutes 10 minutes
starting now I almost forgot to mention
it has a built-in speaker so you can
even play music on this thing hey Alexa
can you play bravado from ulta
I mean a speaker is nothing compared to
an actual bluetooth speaker or even the
Amazon echo or dot but the fact that
it's built inside of a lamp pretty
badass I love this thing it's incredible
I put it next to me on my nightstand
when I'm sleeping it's perfect last but
not least my favorite laptops of 2017 I
only have two I reviewed over ten of
them but I only have two first one is
none other than the Asus zephyrus this
is one of the first laptops that
actually was introduced with the max Q
design look how thin this laptop is it's
got a GTX 1080 in here this is a laptop
I take with me if I need to get work
done actually I'm taking this with me to
CES coming up I think in three weeks so
I want to be using this for editing and
it can handle gaming without a problem
it is a beast it can even handle my HTC
vive believe it or not so yeah guys full
review on that check it out I'll leave a
link below
my other favorite laptop is the LG gram
I've been using the 15 inch version for
the past two years now but they came up
with their new refresh model which has
the coffee like CPU and this is my go-to
laptop I take with me everywhere I go
this laptop weighs less than a kilowatt
guys it's one of the reasons why I love
carrying this with me it's light compact
I can fit in one of my tiniest bags with
me and it packs some serious power this
one has the new coffee like 8700 HQ
process around here this is the default
laptop that I take with me wherever I go
whether I'm answering emails or
launching videos messing with social
media whatever it is this is the laptop
if I'm editing or gaming de souza phorus
is the go-to
last but not least my favorite piece of
tech of 2017 hands-down
unfortunately I can't fit it in this
room it's actually my bed this is where
the action happens this is where it goes
down every single night this is where
wet dreams are made this year is
obviously my bed featuring the eight
sleep mattress now what makes this
mattress so amazing other than how
incredibly comfortable it is is these
smart features the mattress will analyze
how you sleep and display an appropriate
score but I do have to say my favorite
feature is the built-in warmer you can
manually turn it on or you can set a
schedule so for example if you sleep
every night at 11:00 p.m. you can set a
schedule for it to start warming up at
10:30 p.m. that way it's nice and toasty
by the time you get into bed I
absolutely love the mattress I think
that sleep is very important and this
was one of the best investments I have
ever made towards my health so yeah that
pretty much wraps up the video and all
of 2017 I hope you guys enjoyed it if
you did tossing a like would be awesome
and if you didn't like it please I
encourage you to leave a dislike I
promise I won't be mad but anyways happy
holidays to everyone and a Happy New
Year thank you again for watching I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
