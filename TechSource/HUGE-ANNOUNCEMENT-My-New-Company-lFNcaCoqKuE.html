I'm very very excited to tell you guys
about something I've been working on
really hard these past few months I
actually have my good friend Julian
bright helping me out with this he's
actually the one who created the website
and he's helping maintain the website as
well guys I've seen him around on the
channel before specifically on setup
wars so if you guys have been subscribed
to the channel for a while now then that
means you know about my show already the
best tech deals of the week that I do
every single Tuesday I basically look
through the internet and I find the best
tech deals for US UK and Canada and I've
been doing this for months now but
there's a huge problem with that after a
few days or even during the middle of
the week those deals expire so people
that come home from work maybe later the
weekend they have time to watch my
videos that video is pretty much useless
to them because all the deals on that
video already expire by the weekend so
that got me thinking why not host a
website and gather all of these amazing
deals not only upload them daily but
also update the list throughout the day
so you guys get fresh deals for us UK
and Canada ladies and gentlemen
introducing deal source yes the name is
very creative I know so if you guys go
right now and type in deal source tech
it will take you straight to my website
other main page is where you guys can
find all the current and fresh deals
that are going on in the US and there's
also tabs for both the UK and Canada as
well the main goal of deal source was
basically to make the website really
user friendly and make it super easy to
save money under each product you guys
will find a full retail price and next
to that you will find a discounted price
and both so it's easier to spot if you
click on the product it will basically
take you straight to the products
website and here you can check it out or
even buy it if you want additionally
there is a merchandise tab up top and
clicking on that will take you to my
apparel website and here you guys can
buy some textures t-shirt or merchandise
and finally the shop tab will take you
to the page where I'm selling my review
items now these are tech products I
receive for review purposes
I basically use them for a video put
them back in the box and I'm basically
selling them because honestly if you
look at my storage I am running out of
space and it's complete chaos here so
I'm definitely trying to get rid of
these at a super low price all the
products on this page are either brand
new and sealed or they have been lightly
used just for video purposes clicking on
a product will take you to a page and
display more information the product
name the price that is being sold at and
he condition the item if it's a 10 out
of 10 it's basically brand new and
sealed and if it's an 8 or 9 it's
lightly used for review purposes there's
also a link to the product page in case
you guys want to check out the full
price of this most of the items on here
are pretty much 30% off retail price and
the reason why I'm selling them for so
low is because I do need space in my
storage and I don't want to deal with
eBay fees or Craigslist so I'm trying to
get rid of these as soon as possible if
you guys do decide to buy one of these
and check out there will be an autograph
option so if you guys want me to leave a
note or maybe you sign the item then the
option is there for free if you guys
scroll all the way on the bottom you'll
find my Twitter handle and my contact
email in case you guys need to get ahold
of me if you guys have a Twitter account
make sure to follow me at the deal
source because I will be tweeting out
some of the best deals from the website
throughout the day I promise not to
flood your Twitter feed because I will
be only tweeting out one or two amazing
deals that I come across each day but
yeah guys I'm honestly really stoked to
finally get this going I've been working
really hard the past few months a huge
thanks to Julian bright for making this
possible the duties of genius but make
sure you guys bookmark the website maybe
check on a daily or maybe even a few
times a week and hopefully I can save
you guys some money I also tell your
friends tell your family members anyone
who's into tech to check these they
check the website out I do have Canada
US and UK I'll be working on a few other
countries early next year so stay tuned
also for my youtubers out there if you
have a youtube channel over 50,000
subscribers I want to sponsor an ad spot
in your videos for deal source so if you
guys are interested make sure to hit me
up in the email link below and you can
talk some numbers but it's basically I
think you guys so much for watching as
always
let me know what you guys think about
the website honestly down below if it's
anything you want me to change and even
you like by the website anything you
don't like about the website it's still
fairly new so obviously we're adjusting
as we go it's basically I think as you
can had so much for watching thank you
so much for your support honestly I'm
very excited I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
