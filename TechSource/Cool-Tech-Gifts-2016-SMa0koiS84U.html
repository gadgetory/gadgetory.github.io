anniversary or maybe even a holiday well
I got you guys covered on some pretty
cool gifts for your friends or family
the first portion of this video is
sponsored by AT&amp;amp;T and you guys can find
all the links to everything mentioned
down below starting off we have the
Microsoft Surface 3 which is a
two-in-one tablet that can replace your
laptop it features a 10.8 inch display
with a resolution of 1920 by 1200 and
comes rockin with an Intel Atom
processor and either 2 or 4 gigabyte RAM
configurations what I like about the
surface 3 is that it comes with a full
size USB port SD card reader under the
kickstand and a full HD camera for the
front and back this is the perfect
mixture between a laptop and tablet and
because it's extremely compact and light
you can practically fit this in any bag
making it perfect for school and travel
with the surface 3 you are getting a
full windows experience you get access
to the Windows app store and the ability
to run desktop software like the entire
Microsoft Office suite the optional
keyboard that attaches to the surface 3
magnetically is strongly recommended if
you want the full laptop experience not
only does it offer protection from
scratches but it's a lot easier typing
on it than using the touchscreen right
now through September 22nd 18th is
offering customers an eligible Microsoft
Surface 3 type cover keyboard with a
purchase of a Microsoft Surface 3 on a
two-year agreement if you guys are
interested in checking this out be sure
to click on the link below and be sure
to review the restrictions and fees that
apply once again I want to give you huge
things to eat in tea for sponsoring this
video
after all Father's Day is coming up it's
over these next three items are great
add-ons for keychains let's face it our
keys are one of the most important
things that we carry around almost every
day so why not enhance it this first
item is my absolute favorite and I'm
sure most of you guys have seen this on
a channel so many times but I just can't
get over how great this is this is the
orbit key and it's basically a wallet
for your keys it holds up to 7 keys and
not only does it protect you other items
from getting scratched if they were
grouped together in your pocket but it's
also a lot easier to pull out the key
that you need plus your keychain looks a
lot cleaner have you guys often find
yourself without a pen when you really
need one well this is the answer
your problems the Telepan which is
pretty much a telescopic pan for your
keyring slide it open when you need to
write something important and slide it
back when you are done the cap stays on
the keyring so the tip never gets dry
finally we have the Nomad lightning to
USB cable for Apple devices I don't
really need to explain this one you can
either use this cable to charge your
phone with a power bank or connect it to
your PC to transfer files speaking of
nomads this next gift is perfect for the
guys out there this is their bifold
charging wallet that's made out of
quality Horine leather this particular
model is a bit pricey because of the
high quality of the leather so I would
recommend checking out their other
version with the Saffiano leather
instead for a third of the price but
basically this is a wallet with a power
bank built inside 2400 milliamp hour to
be exact which will give you iPhone 6 a
full charge
now obviously 2400 milliamp hour isn't
that much the actual purpose of the
power bank in this wallet is for
emergency reasons but I don't see why
you can't charge up your phone when you
want to it does come with a lightning
cable inside so you don't need to bring
extra cables and honestly I'm surprised
that health in the wallet is this next
item is for my good friends out there
with the crappy laptops if you have an
older laptop that keeps crashing because
it's overheating
or maybe just have a laptop that gets
really hot then well this may be for you
this is a cooler for laptops between 15
to 17 inches it comes in either red or
blue fans and actually has really high
ratings on Amazon near the back you will
find two wheels which are used to turn
the fans on or off as well as adjust the
speeds if you want to the button on the
right activates the LED in the center
which is kind of pointless if you ask me
since the laptop covers it anyways and
finally we have two USB ports one of
them is used to power the fans on by
connecting one end to the laptop and the
other is an extra USB pass-through since
you are using up the one on your laptop
on the back there are two legs that you
can retract to have the laptop at an
angle and near the bottom front you can
find two pegs that will prevent the
laptop from sliding down surprisingly
the fans are really quiet and I can't
hear them spin but do keep in mind that
this will drain your laptop's battery
slightly faster since it does need to be
connected to it for it to work these
last two items are great
for gamers we have the Lenovo Y gaming
headset and mouse the Y gaming headset
is extremely comfortable thanks to its
lightweight carbon-fiber
texture this thing looks pretty sweet
the ear cups are made out of this
washable sport cloth material which
caught my ear is pretty warm while
gaming but nothing too distracting the
headset does come with a built-in
retractable mic and since it has a 3.5
millimeter audio jack it's compatible
with both the ps4 and Xbox one with an
adapter these also sound really good you
get crispy highs and deep lows which
brings the games to life overall a very
solid gaming headset and then we have
the 4000 dpi gaming mouse with an
ergonomic design that's made for
right-handed users it has a dedicated
three switch dpi button up top and two
side buttons that are very easily
reached and because of a small
form-factor it's really easy to lift in
quick reflex games however it's only
available in red LEDs and au pulsate
which can be a deal-breaker for some but
overall it's a very responsive and solid
gaming mouse for the money so that will
do it for this episode of cool tech
