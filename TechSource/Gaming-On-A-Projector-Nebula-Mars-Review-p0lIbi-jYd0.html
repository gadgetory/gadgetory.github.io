and today we're going to be taking a
look at a very cool projector from
nebula if you guys didn't know nebula is
a sister company to anchor and hopefully
the quality we've come to expect from
them translates here as well so this is
made to be portable this dimensions are
5 by 7 by 5 there's also a leather like
strap that makes it even easier to carry
around
there's even a regular tripod thread on
the bottom that enables mounting this
device and any orientation you like but
don't let the size fool you
this thing is packing some impressive
hardware the system relies on a 64-bit
1.5 gigahertz quad-core arm a processor
with 8 gigs of RAM the 3,000 lumen lamp
projects an image between 40 and 300
inches unfortunately there isn't any
zoom so to change the image size you're
going to have to move the projector
closer or further away from the wall of
course the bigger the images the less
sharp it's going to be with the max
resolution of 1280 by 800 and for
reference you guys can find a full 1080p
projector online for five hundred
dollars while the Mars projector is on
sale for 600 retail price of 800 the
extra cost comes from its portability
which Intel's it to have its own
speakers as well as a built-in battery
I've been using this device for about
three weeks now when I've got a pretty
good idea of its limitations as well as
its strong points but with that said
let's begin the review so first off it
feels very durable and since it's made
mostly out of plastic it weighs only at
four pounds
I want to necessarily say I feel
comfortable accidentally dropping this
thing but I wouldn't worry about bumps
or light impacts for input we get a
single HDMI to a USB 3 and a headphone
jack the holes on both the left and
right sides are for the JBL speakers
pulling down the cover turns the system
on and vice versa
the fan kicks in and the Android based
interface cakes on the fan does get a
bit audible but not too loud and it's
not distracting the interface is very
simple to use with the included
controller which works with infrared but
likely you don't have to be behind the
projector for it to work unfortunately
the UI is a little too simple for my
liking
I don't understand why they didn't just
shift
is out with Android TV we don't get much
apps here either
instead we get a few nebula improved
ones but luckily since it runs on
Android I can install apk directly from
a USB Drive not the most seamless of
solutions but it still works besides its
shortcomings where this projector really
shines is in its picture quality open up
some media and you are greeted to
awesome colors and a 10,000 to 1
contrast ratio and with the brightness
of 3000 lumens you don't necessarily
have to be in a dark environment even
though that would be preferred obviously
it's a projector aside from the great
picture quality we also have great audio
quality believe it or not you guys can
even Bluetooth sync this to some
speakers but I didn't find that
necessary because it does come with dual
10 watts JBL speakers inside there's got
solid performance throughout the lows
and highs and have a surprising amount
of bass in fact here's a quick audio
test
now there are programmed image profiles
but I found myself using the user mode
and fine-tuning my own image we get
control over the color temperature the
brightness RGB brightness contrast and
even the wall color if we're not
projecting onto a white wall something
to note here is if you're actually
running off the battery of the device
it's limited to a certain level of
brightness obviously if you can I do
recommend plugging it straight into the
wall so you can have that extra layer of
brightness as well as picture quality it
does have a 19,500 million power battery
which is claimed to last up to three
hours and for my usage it was actually
pretty accurate what's also cool is that
you can even charge your own device
using the built-in battery which is a
nice touch but do keep in mind that it
does drain the battery of the overall
projector a lot faster something I was
surprised to see included in the
software is Apple AirPlay support to
mirror my iPhone screen all I have to do
is click on a device on the airplane
menu on my iPhone this makes sharing
content or just playing my mobile games
on a largest scale much easier if you
only Android device you can also mirror
your screen or cast content as though
this was an official Google device the
image is 60 FPS so playing games was
also great actually to be more accurate
playing games those on another level
plug it in the console and watch how
your games become much more immersive
I'm not too sure what the input lag is
but it must have been not too high
because I didn't really notice it and it
didn't affect my gameplay at all if you
guys are looking for a projector that
sits at home and doesn't have much
versatility beyond that then I would say
skip this you'll find cheaper
alternatives on Amazon but if you're
looking for something more mobile that
has great image and sound quality
wherever you are with decent battery
life I recommend you guys to check this
one out while it's still on sale
I'll drop a link below if you guys want
to check it out there if you guys
enjoyed the video and are feeling
awesome feel free to drop a like to show
your support and if you guys didn't like
it feel free to dislike as well thank
you so much again for watching and I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
