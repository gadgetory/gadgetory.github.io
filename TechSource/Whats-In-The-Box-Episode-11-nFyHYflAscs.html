unboxing knife pretty small package it's

premium to get this sli bridge there's a
booty really awesome project coming up
with this and I cannot tell you what it
is yet we have a package from Amazon
three sets of Crucial Ballistix ram and
why is this sent to me I'll have to dig
and find out because I did not order
this unless it's actual fan mail but I
don't get any notes in there and I don't
know why anyone would send me six RAM
sticks four gigs each by the way but
yeah I'll have to check around and find
out what it's came from alright on to
this long box with a bunch of stickers
on there it's here oh my god it's

pretty sure you guys already realize
with that other SLI bridge was four so
yeah guys I think we can end the episode
over here thank you guys so much for
watching leave a like if you guys enjoy
I'm just kidding I'm just kidding of
course we got boxes let's go ahead and
open these up
nice to see you so guys this is a
package from glasses usa.com and I
actually have an announcement to make
I haven't told this to anyone but it's
come to my attention that recently I
need sunglasses I went to an eye exam a
few weeks back and turns out my right
eye is no longer as good as my left eye
so I went from a 20/20 vision to a 2030
vision and I knew it was a matter of
time before I needed glasses because I
said in front of a monitor every single
day and I'm surprised it took this long
for me to get glasses so I was in the
market looking for glasses guys and I
kid you not these guys eyeglasses
usa.com reached out to me
perfect timing by the way and they asked
me if I can take a look at their glasses
and I said send them in so guys glasses
USA calm is pretty much a website where
they offer prescription glasses at a
super cheap affordable price I think
people get them for a 70% off of retail
prices so they went and sent me four
different models that I chose myself and
actually it's really cool how you can
see yourself wearing these glasses you
can upload a picture of it on the
website and you can see how these look
like on you before you make the purchase
so I got four glasses here and I want
you guys to let me know which one of
these I should wear in my videos because
starting now you guys going to see me
wearing glasses and my videos because
the time has come you know always
thought that I take good care of my eyes
and I would never need glasses even
though I do work in front of the
computer every single day at least ten
hours but ocular degeneration is real
guys and it's happening to everybody
it's actually happening to you guys as
you're watching this video if you don't
have any glasses so I urge you guys to
go check out your eyes doing eye exam at
least once a year or once every two
years and protect your vision because
that is the most important thing but one
of the most important things of on your
body so and these are actually really
cheap guys you can get an entire frame
and glasses starting at ajust I think
$48 and you also get the prescription
lenses which are included with your
purchase but definitely check my guys I
think your first pair you get a really
good discount
you guys can visit the glasses usa.com
I'll drop a link to it down
No all right stick out the Hat and give
this a go I think I'll put a shroud
pulling down below let me know guys be
honest which one of these look the best
on me so here is whoa that is so much
more clear so anyways here is the first
one I'll give it a few seconds and then
let me switch it over to the next pair
of glasses moving on to the third one
these are kind of like reading glasses I
don't know but I don't know about these
I have a pretty big face but and I'm not
I'm not feeling nothing that one let's
check out the fourth one these are I
don't know I hope you guys can see from
that distance but so yeah those are the
four glasses they sent me let me know
which ones you guys want to see me
wearing my videos from now on I'll
probably choose to them and cycle
between them that way am i wearing the
same glasses every time it was actually
really hard for me to choose which four
to try out because they had such a wide
selection I think they have over 2,500
different frames and I think they have
designer brands as well like rabe and
Oakley the Armani just a ton of
selection and these are actually really
quality lenses basically what we what
you would get in retail but you would
get it much cheaper from glasses usa.com
and actually the best part about this
guy's is even if you don't like the
glasses you can just send it back within
14 days I believe and they will give you
a money back 100% but anyways guys if
you're interested check them out glasses
usa.com I'll drop a link to them down
below and hopefully you guys are voted
wisely because these are the glasses
I'll be wearing in my videos alright
let's go and finish off the left side
here we have more PC parts in threes
again we got three core i3 s and I just
realized what this is about
I don't know why on earth they sent this
to me but looks like this is for the
candid giveaway so all these parts
including the RAM sticks and also
there's a few more boxes over there
which I'm sure are part of the PC bill
but the candidate winners have reached
out they've claimed their prize by the
way if you why
this video congratulations on your $500
build but I'll be saying I guess I'm
going to be sending this out personally
on my end so I will keep you guys
updated but yeah it looks like I got
more work to do I'm not sure why I
didn't send it directly but I guess
there are some issues with Amazon
shipping directly to specific countries
so that's why they sent this to me so
I'm gonna have to deal with it but yeah
your parts are here actually all your
parts are here so I'll be sending these
out within a week so keeping half of
that all right so this looks like a deep
cool RGB script for my deep cool build
which I know a lot of you guys have been
asking for and somehow I don't know why
I busted an Edgar and I said I said the
wrong case I'm not building it inside a
deep cool tesseract I'm building it
inside a deep cool try stellar case so
yeah hopefully that clears up a few
things
but this is the last piece I needed
actually I'm waiting on a few more cable
sleeves from a company that is last
piece I need to begin the build
looks like three more packages in here
I'm guessing is part of the PC I'm
guessing the hard drive episode this is
the one terabyte Seagate hard drive that
I ordered for the $500 build i've
ordered in other than the case because
Brianna broke her original one and she
actually cracked her screen last week
and I was pretty bummed to see that
considering about that tear for her as I
think a birthday present or anniversary
so yeah
the case came in a little too late so
she's gonna have to take a sample and
get that repaired so but hopefully once
it's repaired she can put on the new one
I did not even know I was getting this
so guys this is hyper exes new gaming
headset and this is going to be one of
the most popular if not one of the best
budget gaming headset you can buy
because this thing's going to retail for
around 50 bucks so I'm very excited to
do a review on this maybe put in my cool
tech videos but very stoked to give this
a shot because I know a lot of you guys
are interested in checking this out
last but not least we have one more
Amazon package please no more PC parts
of course we have three of the same
motherboards again for the PC build so
this is a this is a motherboard that's
going in the $500 budget bill for you
guys so yeah I got a lots of shipping to
do within this week so I hope you guys
are patient and don't go straight to
Reddit as always if you guys enjoyed
these what's in a box series make sure
to leave a like if you don't like them
make sure to leave a dislike and as
always I'll see you guys in the next
