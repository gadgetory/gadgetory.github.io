always everyone's gear for the setups
will be linked down below if anyone is
interested but here are your 5 lucky
contestants we have Andy Ronnie touka Z
big I'm just gonna call you Z and then B
that congratulations for making it to
set of 4 is episode 38 so starting off
the show is Andy's single display set up
with a white and wooden theme we have a
24 inch LG Ultra right on top of the
walnut monitor stand by grove made and
below that we have the wireless apple
keyboard mouse and trackpad I love how
you kept the theme consistent we have
wooden wrist pads pencil holders
headphone stands MacBook stands and hell
even a freaking USB hub is wooden it's
definitely nice to see something fresh
every now and then on the show Caleb and
Ruben is also on point the power strip
is mounted against the roof of the desk
and we have several velcro straps
holding up the cables so they don't hang
down I'm also really liking the get
done poster off to the left side with of
course of wooden frames on the other
side of the setup we have a white canon
printer on top of a drawer and to top
off the entire setup we have a black and
white tea chair from the x-ray sir I
love this setup it's clean organized and
everything has purpose it's not on the
desk just for show it's not too crowded
and at the same time it's not
minimalistic this setup has a great view
and I love the atmosphere you have going
on there just looking at the setup makes
me want to be more productive and get
 done I definitely love the attitude
of this setup all that combined is why
I'm rewarding this the setup wars seal
of approval if you guys are new to the
channel the setup that gets awarded the
seal receives 250 bucks a custom made
plaque and my t-shirt so Andy if you're
watching this video make sure to toss me
an email to claim your prize' buddy
really an awesome setup Ronnie is next
up with a single display black and red
set up we have a 24 inch LG monitor
that's hooked up against the wall and on
the desk we have a thermal take eSports
challenge your keyboard and black
element Mouse on top of the Pyrus
mousepad we have a bear dynamic DT 770
headset hanging from the wall as well
and a few other miscellaneous things on
the desk like a docking station for the
Xperia Z phone an Xbox 360 game pad and
a speed link microphone kale management
is pretty clean for the most part I
can't really see any wire so I can't say
much but the PC that's powering this
entire setup has a 4670 CPU and a
gigabyte gtx 770 graphics card inside
the BitFenix shadow case with
custom-made logos pretty straightforward
setup the only thing I'll really
recommend is to hide those LED strips
since they are visible the point of the
LED strips is to give a glow effect so
if you can bring the desk out a little
bit and put it behind the desk then it
will look a lot better
also maybe hiding that remote as well
what people usually do is stick some
velcro or 3m tape on the back of it and
then put it against the roof of their
desk but that's just my recommendation
awesome setup Ronnie thank you for
entering to CRA's next up with to
Samsung 27-inch monitors on the desk we
have a Microsoft Wireless 800 keyboard
and a gigabyte M 6900 mouse on top of
the asus strix mousepad also know that's
keep a pair of logitech Z 323 speakers
and RS 122 headphones from sennheiser
that's resting on its own Stan cable
management is excellent it appears that
you hooked everything up against the
backboard at the desk very clever idea
and the PC that's powering this entire
setup has an FX 6300 that's overclocked
to 4.4 gigahertz and an asus strix r9
285 but yeah everything looks organized
and clean for the most part thank you to
Kerr for entering next up we have V dad
with his minimalistic triple display set
up three days to 23 inch monitors a
steel series mechanical keyboard and CM
storm week on Mouse I do see a mouse pad
and some of the pictures so I'm not sure
why you removed it in some of the shots
but regardless I'm gonna go ahead and
recommend a white extended mousepad to
go along with your setup and a white
headphone stand for your sony MDR s as
well there are a few different designs
to choose from so I'll have them link
below for you to check out if you're
interested
excellent work with cable management not
a single wire in sight that SteelSeries
vertical rack thing in the back of your
PC seems to help quite a bit I didn't
get any pictures of inside the PC but it
is running on a 4690k
with a GTX 970 but yeah other than that
extended mouse pad the only other thing
I'd recommend is maybe some covers for
your bed so you don't freeze your ass
off how do you sleep at night last but
not least we have Z with a single 24
inch monitor hooked up against the wall
on the best we have a wrap ooh-ee 950
keyboard and a logitech m5 10 Mouse fun
fact this desk was made out of a
freaking sewing machine
what talk about unique anyways you also
have a pair of creative t20 speakers and
creative our vana live headphones lying
on the desk
excellent work with cable management
then again there aren't really that many
things to connect in the first place so
I'm sure at this point you guys have
noticed something missing something
significant if you still haven't found
it I'll give you a few seconds to figure
out what it is so yeah the thing that's
powering this set up is not there there
is no MacBook iMac or even PC so where
the hell is it well it's on the other
side apparently he ran the cables
underneath the floor and into this IKEA
TV stand as running on an FX 6350 and an
NVIDIA Quadro GPU that's sitting on a
self-made aluminum extended rail that's
been customized to fit inside the ikea
unit I think it's safe to say that the
cable management is on another level get
it cuz it's Underground that's another
very impressive set up Z thank you so
