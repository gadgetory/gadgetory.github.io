deals of the week this week we have a
bunch of awesome deals for all of us UK
and Canada so make sure you guys check
all the links below let's go ahead and
start this episode so starting up the
show we have this a fun toy gaming
headset that's compatible with pc xbox
one and ps4 if you put in the code
listed on the screen you can get this
headset for only eight dollars and
ninety-nine cents which is a pretty damn
good deal next up is a bass-heavy
bluetooth speaker from Innotech that's
going for only twenty dollars using the
code listed on the screen again and
finally a pair of symphonies drm earbuds
as going for only ten dollars and
eighty-nine cents by once again using
the code on the screen if you've been in
search for a quality monitor then look
no further the acer 23.6 inch monitor is
going for only one hundred and ten
dollars and it features a 5 millisecond
response time and a 60 Hertz refresh
rate which is decent for gaming speaking
of gaming we have a coarser m-65 RGB
mouse that dipped in price 250 bucks and
a thermaltake core v31 mid-tower case
that's ten dollars off and the BitFenix
micro ATX case for $85 and five cents
this deal only applies to white and
black but the black version does not
have a clear side panel and finally on
amazon we have a really awesome deal on
a gtx 750ti that's going for only $85
after a twenty-dollar mail-in rebate if
you're building a budget PC I would jump
on this right now on newegg you can find
a cursor k65 RGB keyboard going for only
seventy dollars after a mail-in rebate
but keep in mind that this is for a
refurbished product there's also a two
terabyte hard drive from seagate that's
going for 60 bucks using the code listed
on the screen if you want a ps4 you can
now buy a one-year PlayStation
membership for ten dollars less than the
original price so you might want to
stock up on this since there's only five
days left in ASU's 15.6 inch laptop on
ebay is going for two hundred dollars
which is a great deal considering the
other laptops with similar specs you
won't find anything similar for around
two hundred dollars in fact the same
laptop goes for 235 on
amazon now this isn't a tech item
obviously but I came across this badass
crossbow while shopping around and it's
currently going for four hundred twenty
dollars so i thought i'd share this with
you guys on newegg flash we have a 21.5
inch dell widescreen monitor going for
110 dollars and check this one out guys
a full computer package for only a
hundred and fifteen dollars now while
i'm against pre-built pcs this actually
doesn't seem like a bad deal even though
it's refurbished you get a monitor
keyboard mouse and a system for only 115
bucks obviously don't expect to play
crysis 3 on it or anything but if you've
been looking for a full pc package for
school or work and this might be
something you want to look into
