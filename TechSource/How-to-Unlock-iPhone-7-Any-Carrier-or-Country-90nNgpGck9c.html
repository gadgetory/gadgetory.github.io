source and today we're going to be
unlocking the iPhone 7 so you can use it
with any GSM carrier in the world now
this process is exactly the same for the
iPhone 7 plus as well and it doesn't
matter which country you purchase the
phone from now there are a bunch of a
locking websites out there and it
doesn't really matter which one you use
but if you're looking for the cheapest
prices and the fastest delivery times
then you should check out the unlocking
company comm and that's actually where I
get all my unlock codes from so the
first step is to find the IMEI number of
the phone and you can do that by opening
up the dial pad and typing in star pound
zero six pound once the number pops up
you have to visit the unlocking company
comm and enter in all of the information
put in the manufacturer and the model of
the phone on the first page and then on
the next page you have to select which
country the phone was originally
purchased from and the carrier of the
phone in my case I bought it from the
United States and the original carrier
is AT&amp;amp;T once you hit next you will need
to put in the IMEI number that we just
looked up on the phone and finish
filling out the rest of the boxes once
you finish checking out they will
remotely unlock your iPhone but you will
need to finish the unlocking process on
your end and here is what you need to do
so before we continue we need to put in
the SIM card that you want to use with
your iPhone so pop open the SIM tray
which should be located on the side and
put in the SIM card you want to use with
the iPhone
once the SIM card is on the tray go
ahead and slide it back inside your
phone and go ahead and reboot the device
once you get the email stating that your
phone is remotely unlocked you'll need
to plug in your iPhone to your computer
and open up iTunes now once you log in
and hit continue a message will pop up
stating that your iPhone is now unlocked
so that's how you unlock your iPhone 7
or 7 plus for any country feel free to
leave a like if this video helped you
guys out and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
