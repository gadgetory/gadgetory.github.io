makeover well I figured I mean I knew I
needed one and I really didn't have the
money to afford to get a new one
but I figure you know what the heck I
mean what is worst what's the worst that
can was that gonna have anything what's
the worst that could happen if I didn't
win well so be it you know about your
life right yeah so after five long hours
the setup was finally complete I was
actually surprised everything went
according to plan and there were no
missing parts nothing was damaged on the
way so everything went smoothly for the
most part so then it was time to go grab
heat and show him his new setup
Oh
all day oh ha crap
I like that wallpaper
I was wondering how it was all gonna
come together and stuff it looks good it
looks really good I like the lights on
the case and stuff I really like the
monitor though it's really nice oh yes
it's a huge open ring just like both
little ones that I had put together so
this time around I wanted to build a set
up with an emphasis on function
something that is not only an upgrade
coming from his old set up but also
something that Heath can comfortably use
every day there's nothing overkill or
super flashy like I usually do I feel
like I took a more simpler approach this
time so the monitor is actually the same
one I'm using for my personal setup back
at home it's an LG 38 inch curved
ultrawide monitor with a 3800 by 1600
resolution so instead of using two
separate monitors he now has a massive
ultra wide so one of the reasons why I
picked this monitor is because of free
sync it's gonna help me do screen
tearing and stuttering since he is using
an AMD GPU I also overclocked the
refresh rate to 75 Hertz for 1080p
gaming it's more than enough plus it's
great for color sensitive work so heats
wife can use it to edit her photos only
this time the PC won't be crashing
speaking of the PC it's a really nice
upgrade from his old one it's got a rise
in 520 600 X 16 gigs of ram and the RX
580 a gigabyte graphics card from
sapphire I did go with a six-course
since he said he likes Ustream a lot so
the extra two cores will help in
encoding and multitasking
the case I went with is the cooler
master q 300 p I picked this up because
I wanted something small enough that
would fit on the same desk it did come
with two ygb fans in the front for
intake but I did add two more fans in
the top for exhaust this is a it's a
huge upgrade from what I had yeah a very
huge
I didn't go with the neutral color
scheme so I left the RGB lining alone so
that Heath can change it to whatever
color he desires
speaking of RGB I didn't hook him up
with some Coolermaster peripherals we
got the MK 750 keyboard we got the mm
531 mouse and an RGB mouse pad all from
coolermaster the keyboard has Cherry
blue switches and it comes with a
detachable wrist rest and dedicated
multimedia buttons which will make it
easy for Heath to control his music I
picked the mouse because I thought it
would be really easy for Heath to game
on since he uses his knuckles and this
mouse has a flatter surface I also
picked the headset that was going to be
comfortable to wear for long hours at a
time
the MH 751 kind of fit that criteria not
only do they sound really good but
they're really comfortable to wear and
since he does stream a lot I wanted to
get him a headset that has a great
microphone so he's a really lightweight
much lighter than those other ones we
got so Haiti where he knows I know it's
gonna take him some time to get used to
all the new gear so I even told them if
there's something he's still not
comfortable with after a few weeks I can
send him new gear or you can even swap
it with his previous gear aside from the
headset I did give him a really nice
upgrade for his speakers now these are
the Edifier Spinnaker's which are the
exact same ones i've been using at the
set up back in my office they sound
really great and he's able to control
the volume and his tracks using the
wireless remote that it comes with I
didn't want to drill a hole in his desk
so instead I routed the wires across and
underneath the table the fact that the
IKEA Beck hands desk comes with a net
for cable management is awesome and I
made my job so much easier
finally I added some metal leaves on the
wall to spice it up a bit that way it
doesn't look so plain like I said
earlier I did go with a more cleaner and
minimalistic setup this time around with
a focus on functionality other than
gaming is there anything else you would
like to do with your new setup umm well
to be able to stream again I mean I
don't have a big following anything like
that but I do it for fun you notice
enjoyment last time mainly because you
know me being paralyzed I see a lot a
lot of the streamers I follow on Twitch
or charity streamers and I wanted to be
able to try some way to be able to help
get some information out there
about maturity that I like it stuff like
that okay and also like I said you know
to help maybe we're my wife with a
photography stuff and be able to do it
for her to help her out right
I say UD twit do you stream on Twitch or
is it which is which - okay cool I'll
drop I'll drop a link below to your
channel people want to check your art so
he let you see to set up what are your
final thoughts about it what is I guess
what is your favorite part about the set
up the monitor is absolutely amazing
it's it's bigger than my TV I mean it is
it it's one a friend I mean the PC the
lights on RGB the mousepad I mean it's
all are you find out the RGB lighting I
am I do I do like it I mean my old setup
had incorporated a little bit into it
but putting too much but I love the
lighting on the wall lighting and
everything and it's awesome I just want
to say thank you tick source and Bob
Coolermaster all you really do
appreciate it and I'm going to take
excellent care of it I do want to say
one final thing before I end the season
and this is to Heath and Amanda I know
you guys are watching this first of all
I want to thank you guys for letting us
in your home and I'm sorry that it took
up most everyday secondly I just want to
say what you guys have there is very
special the love between you two is
something I haven't seen anywhere else
the fact that your wife stood by you
after the incident and even getting
married after says a lot about how
strong your love is and I think that's
really where to find these days it's
really sad but it's true loyalty is very
rare to find these days but I wish you
guys the best of luck in your future if
there's anything you ever need don't
hesitate to reach out I'm gonna be
