welcome to the best setup of 2016 where
I showcased all the winners from setup
wars of last year and you guys get to
vote on who has the best setup of 2016
so it's going to be three prizes first
place winner gets $300 a custom-made
plaque and also a text or speakers while
second place gets $100 a Texas t-shirt
and then third place just gets $50 so
there will be a straw poll links down
below make sure you guys to click on it
and vote at the end of this video and
it's going to be like 50 setups in this
videos I'm not going to waste that much
time on each one so with that said let's
dive right in
if you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2
a.com
because they have the cheapest CD keys
available for pretty much any game I'll
drop a link to them down below if you
want to check it out the first set up of
2016 was from Mike and he has a pretty
cool gaming setup in his bedroom with an
articulating mount on his TV so he's
chilling on his bed he can get the
perfect viewing angle from episode 33 we
got to blur with a very dope looking
ultra light setup and great cable
management with a badass water-cooled PC
of course we can't forget about gem from
episode 34 with a very nice triple
monitor setup I like this one a lot
because of the symmetry and cable
management I appreciate the fact that he
drilled a hole in the desk for the
keyboard and mouse
sultans setup was from a budget edition
of setup wars but I'm going to include
it in this video regardless and then we
have the popular Yazzie from episode 36
so this is actually his first appearance
on the show and since then he has
improved his setup greatly in fact let's
fast forward a bit to episode 77
everyone was upset that he didn't get
the seal of approval for having such an
amazing setup and although I did give
valid reasons as to why people still
didn't agree with me but this time it's
up to you guys to vote on the best setup
of 2016 so it's not up to me anymore
continuing where we left off episode 37
we have a dual monitor white and black
set up the acoustic foams I nice touch
and a water-cooled PC was the icing on
the cake for Roca not only was Andy the
winner of episode 38 but he actually won
a seal of approval for this amazing
white and wooden ultra light setup
everything was so clean and all the
products on the desk at purpose
it wasn't on there just for show his
whole room just screams productivity and
motivation from the wallpaper to the
posters resting on the shelves just an
excellent setup and still one of my
favorite still today from episode 39 we
have Martin with a budget set up nothing
too crazy but what got him the win was
the simplicity and the beautiful white
and black PC speaking of white and black
Eric was the winner of episode 41 with a
very clean and minimalistic dual monitor
setup
surprising us on episode 42 with Sam oh
and his six triple monitor setup
he was also rocking a MacBook on the
side for when he needs to go mobile so G
was also one of my favorites from
last year mainly because of how clean
the setup looks I don't see many dual
monitor setups that I mounted against
the wall and even though those speakers
are not exactly symmetrical the
presentation was awesome here was
another popular setup a lot of you guys
actually liked Andres setup from episode
44 the white and black contrast on his
setup was spot-on and I really liked the
portal turret he had on his desk for
that added personality I think Jimmy was
officially our first-ever contestant
with a Pokemon themed set up
well technically all he had was the
wallpaper some figurines and even a
custom decal on his PC so I don't know
if it's technically classified as a
Pokemon theme but it was definitely a
refreshing to see our look from episode
46 definitely impressed us with the
presentation of to set up the acoustic
foam layout would be red LEDs be on a TV
really made this setup pop speaking of
popping cydnus did such an amazing job
on his setup as well from the Joker
mural on the wall to the symmetry and
custom water-cooled PC just wow
everything was pretty much flawless and
I was really close to receiving the seal
of approval
had I not disagree with a few things
Tobias also had a great setup very
simple and straight to the points with
amazing contrast the Star Wars theme has
proved to be a popular scheme in 2016
and I think Tobias did a great job
keeping it to a minimum Marcus from
episode 49 in fact received the seal of
approval despite me stating otherwise on
the video it was actually meant to be a
joke which a lot of people didn't get
unfortunately but let's be real the
cable management alone in this setup is
worthy enough for a seal quite possibly
the cleanest setup i've seen on the show
yet
marking about the win for episode 51 for
having a very clean and symmetrical mac
setup while justin got the win for
having a massive monitor and a dope
looking PC everyone was impressed with
Stan's and his battle station a fully
custom-built PC inside a desk or what
did it for me was the two giant
reservoirs that ran down into the desk
very impressive Ethan's black and red
budget set up 1 episode 54 of setup wars
and Allan 1 episode 55 because of his
shoe collection seriously I don't think
there's not a person on this planet with
this many shoes but joking aside he does
have a very nice ultra light setup as
well Colin from episode 56 10 an
interesting
that was built on a custom-made desk and
his creativity earned him a seal of
approval and then we got David with an
updated set up from last year this was
personally one of my favorites as well
because of the sheer creativity he put
into this and I'm not just talking about
his 3d printed PC he actually 3d printed
eight orange cubes which he is using to
hold up his tabletop and he even added
some LEDs and therefore a glowing effect
because of that it was an obvious
decision to award him a seal of approval
so damn good
winner of episode 58 was Josh with his
very minimalistic ultra light setup and
episode 15 I went to Isaiah with a black
and red dual monitor setup the only
thing I don't like about this was the
fact that the second monitor was
blocking off his PC Janak had a pretty
cool white and green setup from episode
61 and Dmitry took the crown for episode
62 for the budget edition another one of
my personal favorites was Gus from
episode 63 not because it's black in red
but because of the level of consistency
symmetry and that badass PC of his I
mean sure the cable management could
have been slightly better but his setup
was overall amazing Jonas took the win
for episode 64 for having a very clean
and symmetrical ultra light setup with
flawless cable management just like
Eric's from episode 65 I mean look at
the wires there isn't any because you
can't see them he did such an amazing
job keeping everything under his desk he
would have done the steel is a 1 for one
of the bottles having less liquid than
the others now here's another unique and
colorful setup that got my attention
Chris from episode 66 blew me away with
his creativity I wouldn't even call this
a setup this is art this setup belongs
in a glass cube somewhere in a museum of
course we can't forget Julius from
episode 67 god damn every time I see
this setup it makes you want to throw
mine out the window such perfection
symmetry color coordination and cable
management this setup has it all
speaking of quad display setups we have
J's a custom made desk built with cable
management in mind I especially like the
placement of his PC on the top shelf
Valerie from episode 69 made history on
setup wars for being the first girl to
win a very clean black and red setup not
much else to it I don't know what it is
the black and red setups but I've
noticed that people who rock that color
scheme have a higher chance of
and that's definitely the case here with
Michael's ultralight setup cable Angemon
is also one of the strongest aspects of
the setup and of course the PC itself
running SLI Sean has banished or once
before but this time not only did he win
the episode but he also picked up a
steal as well not because he has a quad
display setup or an amazing-looking PC
because of his attention to detail and
next level consistency
he even wraps his Amazon echo and D band
schemes to match his setup that level of
customization is where to see a true
battle station and worthy of my seal of
approval with an unusual name Pig
managed to steal the win for episode 73
with a badass black and red setup once
again no surprise here I was also
impressed that his custom made wall
shelves that managed to hold up to
massive bookshelf speakers another
good-looking setup came from Rick if you
want to explain what symmetry is to
someone to show them a picture of this
setup and they will get it
cable management and attention to detail
are the reasons why Wieck took the win
here's another budget winner James with
a single monitor setup with exceptional
cable management from episode 75 then we
got J with a crazy gaming room featuring
a few setups the most noteworthy was the
NES console setup on the left side
episode 78 winner was Robert with
another quadrants play set up but what
got my attention when addevent scans on
his consoles and his audio interface
also I'm a huge fan of DBZ so the fact
that he can draw Goku and Super Saiyan 1
mode easily got my vote a true artist at
heart and an amazing set up that
reflects that Saru setup was actually
one of the best for 2016 and it wasn't
because of how clean the triple monitor
setup was no sir he stole the show by
his custom water-cooled ps4 and Xbox one
console on the right side what you are
looking at here are both ps4 and Xbox
one PCBs inside a rectangular case
that's also water-cooled this dude is a
genius of course he has his own
water-cooled PC as well and his entire
room is white and black the level of
consistency in his room is unmatched
it's one of the reasons he got awarded
the most recent seal of approval despite
him not even claiming it truly an
amazing gaming room alright I think
black and red setups are getting a bit
too repetitive John took the win for
episode 81 for how
a badass squad display setup and a
monster PC so we got two more setups
left the first one is from Felix from
episode 82 this is actually his second
time on the show with major improvements
as you can see on his monitor custom
made speaker stands with built-in
headphone hanger and excellent cable
management is the reason that he won
that episode and finally we have Richard
from episode 83 another very sexy black
and red ultra white setup with a killer
PC so that is it for this video I'm
going to show you guys all the setups
that I've mentioned and they're going to
be in order from the beginning and
there's also going to be the episode
number right next to the name so make
sure you guys click on the straw poll
and vote on who you think had the best
setup of 2016 and as always honest the
winners in a few weeks on my Twitter and
Instagram accounts do you guys so much
for participating
I hope 2017 will be an awesome year as
well continue submitting your setups as
always I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
