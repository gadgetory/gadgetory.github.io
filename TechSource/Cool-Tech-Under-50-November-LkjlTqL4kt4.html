welcome to another cool tech episode as
always you guys can find the links to
everything mentioned in the video down
below so first up we have a very solid
condenser microphone that's going for
under $50 and it does come in a variety
of colors which is great if you want
something to match your setup it also
comes with this pretty cool tripod which
can fold up making it easy to pack for
travel and you can also use the knob on
the tripod to adjust the angle as well
as rotate the mic in any direction to
get that perfect position for voiceovers
the best part about this mic is that you
don't need an audio interface it's a
plug and play USB microphone and here is
what it sounds like alright so this is
what it sounds like talking directly at
the Cadieux 37 microphone the distance
between the mic and my mouth is about 1
feet I would say and I'm talking
directly at it and this is without any
editing guys so the background noise is
still present so I'm going to stay quiet
for a bit and you guys can hear what the
microphone picks up from the background
and this is what it sounds like talking
directly at the mic again the same
distance between the microphone and my
mouth but this time the background noise
is removed and I'm going to stay quiet
for a bit and you guys can hear that as
well I'm actually going to be to this
mic in my upcoming top 5 budget mics on
their $50.00 episode 2 so if you guys
are interested be sure to hit that
subscribe button if you are new to my
channel these next set of headphones are
actually really cool and the only reason
I'm featuring them in this episode is
because of their main feature they're
calling it the share me headphones and
aside from being a very comfortable and
great sounding pair of headphones these
can also connect with other Cheramie
headphones so let's say you want to
watch a movie or a video with someone
else well if they have a pair of these
headphones then you can synchronize them
together and listen to the same thing
which is perfect for long road trips or
flights it does have a built-in mic and
comes with an aux cable and even though
they state it lasts up to 20 hours of
continued use it only lasted about nine
hours for me which is still pretty good
for a pair of headphones the mic on
these headphones isn't the best so if
you guys use that feature on your
headphones a lot then I wouldn't
recommend these but other than that the
build quality is decent and the noise
isolation is good enough to block out
most of the noise
however you still can hear your
surroundings now if you guys want a more
premium feeling headset for just $10
more then you should check out either
the share me pro or the share me 5 which
is their latest versions of these
headphones also if you guys won 50% off
these headphones I'll drop the discount
code down below if you guys are
interested
speaking of headphones this next one is
quite possibly the best gaming headset
that you can buy under $50 this is the
new HyperX cloud stinger which is
compatible with PC Xbox one and ps4
design wise there's not a whole lot
going on you get a matte black finish on
these which is something I prefer
compared to a glossy finish the only
buttons you will find on these are
located on the bottom of the headset and
it's pretty much just a volume slider
the ear cups are large enough to fit
over my ears and I'm honestly surprised
at how light and comfortable these are
if you guys have long gaming sessions
then you'll be pleased to find that
these won't cause any fatigue the ear
cups also rotate 90 degrees which is
great since I can leave them hanging
around my neck without it bothering me
the headphones do come with a short 4
foot 3.5 millimeter cable which is fine
if you're plugging it into a controller
or something nearby let's say a ps4
controller for example but if you need
to route this in the back of your PC or
through another device that's pretty far
from you then you need to use the
extension cable that they provided the
mic also doesn't sound that bad I mean I
wouldn't do any voiceovers with it but
it's good enough so that people can
understand what you're saying and in
fact here is a quick sample what's up
guys is that from tech source and this
is what the mic sounds like using the
cloud stinger headset and this is
without any editing or without any audio
tampering tampering tampering and
finally the sound quality for costing
only 50 bucks these sound pretty damn
good there's more emphasis on the bass
so explosions and gunshots will give you
a more immersive experience and the
highs are fine-tuned for the casual
music listening or watching videos if
you guys have 50 bucks in your pocket
and are shopping around for your next
gaming headset then you should
definitely check out the cloud stingers
next up we have the grand Vela 325 $30
gaming mouse with seven programmable
buttons and a 3,000 VPI sensor
unfortunately it's only created for
right-handed users but it's very
comfortable for
palm grippers however I didn't find any
discomfort from being a claw gripper
myself there are two side buttons which
are very easy to reach and near the top
you'll find two additional buttons one
of which is a dpi key to cycle between a
customized DPI settings that you can
configure in the software the color
theme of the mouse may be a turn-off for
most people since black and yellow isn't
really that popular however they do have
two other color options available but
yellow is still present in both of them
if you can get past the colors this is a
very responsive and comfortable Gaming
Mouse which by the way is also
compatible with Mac the only downside to
this mouse is that it doesn't have any
rubber feet so if you guys don't have a
mousepad this will scratch the surface
of your desk and make it difficult to
slide across the table so do keep that
in mind if you decide to buy it last but
not least we have the e element RGB
mechanical keyboard with blue switches
the keyboard features a t1 anti-ghosting
keys full and key rollover and of course
RGB lighting not only can you select a
solid color from the keyboard but you
also get a bunch of cool color effects
from Ramah mode to a wave effect and
eight more color modes the keyboard is
also very small so it's great for those
minimalistic setups and the best part is
that it comes with a detachable cable
which is perfect for cable management
just drill a hole in your desk and route
the cable through for a clean look this
