and welcome to another detailed camera
comparison test this time we're gonna be
facing off the LG g4 against the Galaxy
Note 4 now the test will be done in auto
mode just like my previous camera
comparisons however I have been doing
manual camera comparison test videos as
well and not too long ago I compared the
LG g4 against the Xperia z3 all in
manual mode so if that's something you
guys want to see done with the g4 and
the note 4 then let me know by dropping
a comment down below but with that said
let's go ahead and start the video the
twenty two thousand four hundred million
power bank from ICI technology is the
most affordable charger you can buy in
its class you can charge up to three
devices at the same time using the
fastest charging speeds for your device
and it even comes with a built in
flashlight it has an awesome compact
design and comes in several colors click
on the link in the description for more
info all right so before we jump into
the samples let's take a quick look at
the camera specs the LG g4 is rocking a
16 megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 1.8 that can shoot up to 4k
resolution the note 4 is also sporting a
16 megapixel rear facing camera but with
a 2.2 aperture and it can also shoot up
to 4k resolution for prompt facing
cameras the g4 has an 8 megapixel camera
that can shoot up to 1080p whereas the
Galaxy Note 4 is 3.7 megapixel camera
can shoot up to 1440 P by the way for
those wondering I am rocking the carbon
fiber skins from the brand on both of my
devices and I will leave a link down
below to their website if you want to
check them out but with that said let's
sit back relax and check out some
samples
the LG g4 has a laser autofocus feature
like their previous model which helps
detect objects and quickly focuses on
them for the most part it is really
activated until you start using it
outside on the really bright conditions
the note 4 on the other hand doesn't
have a fancy out a focusing feature but
it still does a great job picking up
objects really fast and it's really
consistent
for daytime video both phones shoot
amazing quality 4k videos the note 4 has
slightly warmer colors but the g4 has
sharper footage the colors are also more
vibrant on the g4 and you can tell by
just looking at the sky it also has a
wider field of view so for 4k video I'm
going to give the point to the g4 for
low-light video it's pretty obvious who
the winner is the note 4 footage is just
too dark or as you can see a lot more on
the g4 I mean take a look at the white
board in the back on the note 4 you can
barely see it whereas it's clearly
visible on the g4 so I will give the
point to the g4 for low-light video
performance for stabilization both
phones are being shot in 1080p to ensure
that optical image stabilization is
enabled and they are also strapped on a
device for a very accurate stabilization
reading but honestly they both look very
similar and I can't quite tell the
difference so I'm gonna give the point
to both phones for stabilization what's
up guys and welcome to the front-facing
video camera test and microphone quality
test between the LG g4 and the Galaxy
Note 4 the g4 is being shot in 1080p
whereas the Galaxy Note 4 is being shot
in 1440p and from the footage it looks
like the Galaxy Note 4 kind of under
exposes in certain areas whereas the g4
has an overall better dynamic range also
you guys are listening to this on your
headphones then you guys can hear the
background noise so I'm gonna stay quiet
for a bit
while front-facing video the note 4
actually has a much better color
reproduction everything is much more
vibrant and you get sharper footage
thanks to its higher resolution but as I
mentioned in the video it does
underexposed certain areas and the g4
has overall a much more balanced dynamic
range so I will give a point to both
phones for front-facing video for the
microphone quality the note 4 seems to
have a much louder mic but with that you
get more background noise which means
that it will easily pick up wind noise
if you're trying to take video outside
so I guess I'll give the point to the
note 4 for having a louder mic for
daytime picks both phones deliver
excellent color reproduction while
sticking to the warmer side the g4 is
notorious for having slightly more
saturation than other smart phones but
it does deliver more vibrant and truer
to life colors the subscribe below on
the left is far more accurate than the
one on the right now one thing I don't
like about the note 4 is the brightness
I call it the white fog and no amount of
adjusting gets rid of it so I did lower
the exposure and it does help a little
bit but in return it darkens the overall
image if you look at the image by itself
you can't really tell it exists until
you bring it up against another pic so
the g4 takes the point for more vibrant
and truer to life colors for low-light
pictures the g4 is pretty hard to beat
with its 1.8 aperture the image is just
a lot more sharp and clear on the g4 and
it also has much less noise than the
note 4 so the point for low-light
pictures goes to the g4 the flash on the
note 4 is just too strong it completely
over exposes the object whereas the
flash on the g4 is a bit less harsh you
can still see the blue 4 on the Android
from the g4 pic whereas it's completely
washed out on the note 4 so once again
we have a clear winner the LG g4 has a
better camera pictures and videos are
just a lot more crispier on the g4 not
to mention it has true to life colors
and it's low-light performance is one of
the best you can find on any smartphone
you know for no doubt has an excellent
camera as well
but it's just not enough to be tg4 and
raised that's it for the video I hope
you guys enjoyed it if you did and if
you'd like to see these types of camera
comparisons then let me know by leaving
a like on the video and if there's a
specific camera comparison test you want
to see next then let me know which two
phones you want to see go up against
each other by dropping a comment down
below anyways this is Ed from Texas I'll
see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
