will find $1,000 iPhone 6s case now I
gotta show you yet so yeah there is a
$1,000 iPhone 6s case in that little box
there unfortunately I can't make the
video because I don't have an iPhone 6s
I should did a giveaway on a success and
a 6s plus back in September or October
so I'm fresh outta phones so now we're
going to go to the Apple store and pick
one up so I can make the video but first
we gotta have breakfast just finished
eating before we have to the mall gotta
put on some clothes much better she
always does this we're just going to the
mall why
made it to the North Ridge Mall and I
just realized that is the day after
Black Friday and it's extremely packed
people people everywhere but yeah I'm no
choice I've to get the phone now so I
can work on the video this weekend so
I'm just going to top it up hopefully
everything goes smoothly
so it was a great feeling unboxing
something brand new don't you think
voila brand new iPhone 6s Space Gray
all right so I got both of the iPhone 6s
and the titanium iPhone 6s case and all
I'm gonna be waiting for right now is
the skins from be banned so I can start
on this video it's going to be a very
interesting video I should say so
hopefully I'll be done with this and
give it to you guys by Wednesday
hopefully
so since I'm waiting for the skins from
the brand I'm going to take this time to
work on the setup wars video for this
coming Monday and also for the following
money because I'm going to be leaving
for Canada on December 4th to the 6th
for the LG's Dream Center party so I
need to get those videos done before I
head out so actually before I begin the
setup wars video I picked this thing up
the leveler or level rule or whatever
its called
am I going to straighten my acoustic
foams because I thought you guys many
times it's crooked and it's bothering me
so finally today I have some time if you
take it apart and then strain them or at
least make them as parallel as possible
to the table into the monitor so let's
do this
so yeah as expected there is some pieces
left over from the tape and honestly
it's not as bad as I expected this is uh
this is doable but yeah I'm warning for
anyone that's going to be using some 3m
spray adhesive this is what's gonna
happen to your wall you have some pieces
of foam stuck to it that you can either
scrape off or well you have to scrape
this off of course and then repaint the
wall but for now I'm just going to go
ahead and scrape some of these off and
then go ahead and put these on the right
way all right so after an hour of
scraping I managed to peel off the large
foams that are sticking out these are
just the I guess some of the pieces
that's left over but that's completely
fine because I'm just gonna go ahead and
glue these over them so it's not really
gonna be an issue so I figured out the
problem check this out guys so this is
technically straight according to the
ruler check it out that is perfectly
centered my subscriber plaque is
perfectly centered and basically all the
cushions are perfectly centered as you
can tell now moving back putting this on
my monitor
it is perfectly centered now check this
up I put it on my table and it's not
perfectly centered so this entire time
my table is either crooked or it's the
floor but because of that this won't
really look parallel to the floor
it will only look parallel to the
monitor as you can tell the bottom
portion of the monitor and the desk or
even the speaker you can tell it's kind
of off so yeah that's driving me crazy
and I saw I can never win but you know
I'm just going to finish this up because
it's already halfway done
all right so I decided to cover the
entire top row as you can see and then
maybe add some on the side so I'm going
to go with the flow and see what happens
this is what I came up with so far looks
pretty cool I guess so everything's
straight I mean everything's I don't
know let's it's weird but but I don't
know what it I don't what else to tell
you guys I use the ruler it's straight
according to the ruler but either the
ground or the wall is crooked but
overall I'm happy with design I think
this looks pretty cool I'm just leave it
at that
and stop messing with it I'll have to
raise the left side a bit more to make
it make it even if I don't know I'm done
I'm tired I'm exhausted I'm gonna go to
end this vlog thank you guys so much for
watching as always if you enjoy these
make sure that that like button and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
