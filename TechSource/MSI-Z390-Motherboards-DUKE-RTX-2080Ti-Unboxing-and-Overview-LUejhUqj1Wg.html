Intel just announced a new ninth
generation CPUs which go on sale this
October 19th
and obviously with every new CPU launch
comes new motherboards the Z 390 chipset
I do have a few motherboards from aside
that we're going to be unboxing and
taking a closer look at as well as the
msi duke RT x 2080 TI which you can
expect in an upcoming build so yeah with
that said let's take a closer look if
you guys want to find the best deals on
tech make sure to check out deal source
tech we have a team of ambassadors
constantly searching the internet and
uploading the best deals multiple times
a day across the US UK Canada and even
Germany anything from PC parts to TVs
even Windows CD keys you will find them
all on BL source tech check out the link
below if you're interested so here's a
full list of the CPUs that are launching
with the 9900 Kay being on the top it's
an eighth course sixteen thread CPU that
comes out of the box with a 5 gigahertz
turbo clock on two cores they also have
slightly higher l3 cache 60 megabytes on
the 9900 k-8 core compared to only 12
megabytes from the 8700 k-6 core so
aside from the obvious speed bump coming
from the eighth generation CPUs what you
guys can expect on the newer ninth gems
is better thermals and better
overclocking Headroom the reason for
this is that until now solders the IHS
directly to the core they're calling it
stem also known as solar thermal
interface material in addition to being
compatible with the new Z 390 chipset
you can also use the 9 generation CPUs
with any other Intel 300 series chipset
now one of the main differences jumping
to the new Z 390 platform is that now
you get native USB 3.1 gen2 support so
chipset PCIe lanes won't be wasted on
secondary controllers anymore also Intel
promises wireless AC and next-gen
wireless connectivity which includes
gigabit speed and you can expect to see
support for those on the new Z 390
boards as well so I got three boards
femicide that we're gonna unbox and
check out starting with the mag is III
90 god-like which is currently am
sighs most expensive Z 390 board so let
me put these aside and take a look at
this baby
so the godlike is obviously for the
enthusiasts out there who want all the
bells and whistles in a motherboard and
they don't mind paying extra for it
I think this currently retails for
around $600 and the price might go down
as more as Z 390 boards are available in
the market all right so these are all
accessories that come with a board
including an expansion card for m2 SSDs
and a screaming boost card which is
essentially a capture card for screamers
all right let's take a closer look at
this piece this is a hefty board Wow
it's not a bad looking board I do love
the neutral color scheme and noticing
that most manufacturers are taking this
approach which makes sense
give us a neutral color like this on a
motherboard with RGB so that way we can
be in control and decide what to go with
that way it matches our color scheme so
props to MSI for finally going with a
neutral color scheme so the extent that
heatsink design is nice it's got a
pretty good coverage for the V RMS I'm
actually curious to see how hot they get
the X 299 platform from MSI was
notorious for having extremely hot V RMS
in fact the PC I'm using has an X 299
gaming + motherboard and right now the V
RMS are hitting 100 degrees Celsius on
my 18 core CPU the 79 80 XC which is
deleted and overclocked to 4.7 piga
hurts it is extremely hot so I'm curious
to see how the temps do on the new z3 19
chipset now homicide does claim that the
26% bigger design will bring 8 to 10
degrees Celsius cooler temps but we will
see if that's even true so the board has
four PCI slots so you can do two-way SLI
or four-way crossfire
it's got four dimm slots I think up to
4600 megahertz which is ridiculous and
you also have support for 3m tubes over
here and you have an additional two and
that two slots if you guys use the
expansion hard it also looks like they
kind of redesign at their MDOT to
shields they're calling it the shield
froze at this time and the big
difference coming from their previous
boards which honestly didn't do much the
thermals is that now they're doing
thermal pads on the top and the bottom
so it's going to be
managing the SSD and they're claiming
it's going to keep thermals low and
prevent the SSD from throttling I love
that this board comes with two eight pin
EPS power connectors for the CPU an
additional six pin for the PCI slots
it's also got a sixteen power phase
design
needless to say overclocking should be
very stable and easy on this board I do
like the steel armor around the PCI
slots which will protect it from getting
damaged over time believe it or not I
have seen heavy GPUs bend at the PCI
slot over time so this is a really nice
addition now when it comes to
connectivity on this board you will not
be disappointed first of all I want to
point out that I love the built-in IO
shield it's always annoying when I'm
installing the IO shield every time I
build a PC it might not bother a lot of
people out there but it bothers me guys
you might think I'm crazy but having an
i/o shield already built in a
motherboard makes my life so much easier
just the little things that make me
really happy anyways back here you'll
find five USB 3.1 ports a single USB
type-c you get two Ethernet ports with
built-in wireless AC which can be
extended via the antenna
you also get an optical out for audio
and something that I haven't seen before
on the motherboard a six point three
millimeter headphone jack usually
professional headphones that I use to
monitor audio use this type of jack but
if you guys are using a regular
headphone or a gaming headset with a 3.5
millimeter jack then you can actually
use the adapter that's included with the
motherboard now for the front panel you
not only get two USB three connectors
but also two USB type-c ports as well
once again if you're buying this board
you're obviously building a high-end PC
in a premium Tower probably with
multiple type-c ports actually I would
even say this is a waste of money if
you're not gonna even water cool your PC
this motherboard is perfect for a
water-cooled build that has a ton of fan
headers you get a dedicated pump header
up top alongside five fan headers and
you get four more across the board for a
total of 10 there is one cool thing I
like about the motherboard and is the
LCD display right here on the side so
this will basically light up and give
you useful information about the board
for example if there's something wrong
with a specific part they will show an
icon and
tell you which part it is for example
you can see here it says CPU obviously I
don't have a CPU installed so there's
something wrong with the CPU and I
should probably go and check that out it
just makes it that much easier to read
and understand that way you can diagnose
your PC and figure out what the actual
issue is instead of looking up some
codes and then trying to figure out what
those codes mean so I think that's
really cool you can even customize the
display to show Hardware informations
like temperatures of your PC and the
coolest thing I think is that you can
even put custom shift profiles on there
so guys that is the msi god-like
motherboard stepping down a bit we have
the msi meg zi 390 ace now this is their
mid tier board and it doesn't quite
offer all the bells and whistles like
the godlike but it does give you all the
necessary features to still build an
epic high-end PC instead of a 16 powder
face design you guys get only 12 but you
still get the 2 8 pin EPC powder
connector for overclocking and
everything else is pretty much the same
same amount of them slots you get the
same amount of em to support the only
thing is you have one last PCI slot
coming down from God light board you
still get a similar heatsink design with
the dragon logo and a neutral gunmetal
color scheme and RGB lighting of course
but you'll start to see less
connectivity and features as you move
down with each tier for example you only
get one frozen shield for your MDOT 2
slots you get no LCD screen for
troubleshooting and you have no.you dot
to support down here honestly if you
guys ask me I think that the ACE board
offers the most value because you still
get most of the features coming from the
godlike and it's like half the cost
built-in wireless AC you got great
overclocking support 3m 2 slots 2 USB 3
headers which one of them has moved to
the bottom I don't know why and
personally I'm not a fan of that but
whatever and for I should be lighting
unfortunately it's only the infinity
mirror on this side the dragon logo
doesn't light up like it does on
god-like and oh and you still get the
pre-installed i/o shield so yeah for the
money I feel like this is a well-rounded
balanced motherboard that gives you
pretty much whatever you need to build a
solid gaming PC and finally we got the
gaming
AC which is targeted for the mainstream
gamers out there it costs a little under
$200 and offers all the essential
features for any gaming PC you get a 5
power phase delivery with an 8 plus 2
pin EPC power for the CPU which is good
enough to get a nice overclock with a
decent cooler just don't expect any
world record you still get four dimm
slots support for 2 m dot 2 SSDs and 3
PCI slots but you only get one USB 3
header and one USB type-c for the front
panel of the case however you do have an
extra USB type-c in the rear i/o
speaking of the rear i/o this board also
comes with a built-in wireless AC I mean
it doesn't look as good as the other
boards and it doesn't have much RGB
lighting just on the side of the board
but it will get the job done and it will
save you money in the process
this is pretty much for the average
everyday gamer so to recap gamers who
are on a budget looking for a solid
motherboard for gaming that aren't
looking for anything extra or over the
top then the gaming edge AC is what
you're looking for now people have a
slightly higher budget and are looking
to do a high-end build maybe they're
doing SLI or crossfire maybe even a
water-cooled build and they want extra
features and extra ports and slots and
connectivity all that jazz then the Z
398 should be on your list and finally
the ballers out there who don't care
about the money you just want the best
of the best out there no matter the cost
well you already know last but not least
let's take a look at the msi duke r-tx
20 80 TI and also guys let me know in
the comments section which motherboard I
should use and pair it with the 20 80 TI
for my next build comment down below
let's pop this baby open and take a look
this is actually the first r-tx 2080
card I have unboxed on the channel now
that I think about it
beautiful yeah this is pretty heavy
which makes sense why there's a GPU sag
tool that comes with this card it's not
a bad looking card to be honest
triple fan design you got two eight pin
PCI connectors for power delivery it
also looks like it's a two and a half
PCI slot card so it's gonna take up some
space on the motherboard
I can't elite Auk much about performance
or cooling since I just got the card
obviously this is the overclocked
version which means it comes out of the
box overclocked at sixteen sixty five
megahertz for the boost compared to
sixteen thirty five megahertz from the
regular one that's interesting that's
only like a thirty megahertz offset on
the clock speed why would anyone pay
extra money for an overclocked version
when they can do that so easily using
MSI Afterburner but anyways I digress
that pretty much wraps up this video I
hope you guys enjoyed it or if it was at
all somewhat helpful on the signing of
what motherboard you guys should pick up
with your next build
if you guys enjoyed this types of videos
make sure to leave a like then I can
continue to do more of these and also
let me know which motherboard I should
use in my upcoming build in the comment
section I love your faces as always
thank you guys so much for watching I'll
drop a link to all the parts featured in
this video down below of course as
always and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
