welcome back to another episode of top
three apps you must try just like all
the previous episode with all these apps
are available for free and the links
will be in the description down below
starting up the list we have picks off
this is the perfect app to have if you
were using an Android device that has an
AMOLED display what makes picks off
different is that the app allows you to
change the amount of pixels that are
powering on to save battery life instead
of having just a black wallpaper on the
home screen of the device picks off
takes effect in any app that you are
using you can actually choose how many
pixels are used and even the type of
pattern filter the app displays a
helpful guide that shows the percentage
of pixels your device is keeping on
which is the amount of power you are
saving there's also a customizable night
mode to adjust the tint of the display
which can be very helpful in reducing
eye strain at night all the pixels
features can be automatically enabled
when the battery reaches a certain
percentage so next up at number 2 is
quartz this time on Android as well as
iOS this app is aimed at making worldly
news more personal by focusing on
text-based conversations with actual
journalists some messages include a link
to read a more in-depth article
pertaining to a story but if you're not
interested you can always skip to the
next one
each chat is also packed with emojis
gifts and other forms of media so feels
more and more like you're having an
engaging discussion quartz will send
periodic push notifications to keep you
up to date as well the app also has
support extended to the Apple watch
making news available at a glance the
complication for quartz will display a
different emoji on your watch face
indicating the direction of the stock
market when there isn't any news left
for the day the app will continue to
keep you entertained with activities
such as quizzes the last stop for this
episode is in kit available for Android
and iOS in kit prides itself on
providing thousands of free novels from
independent authors there are titles
from a wide variety of genres whether
that be sci-fi mystery action and even
erotica for example
you won't have a problem finding your
next read as each book is selected as a
topic by many readers that use ink it
every book is in English and you can
download them offline for later reading
as well you can also customize the look
of the text and background to create a
reading experience you are most
comfortable with so that's it for the
video if you guys enjoyed the series
make sure that
leave a like and feel free to leave any
app suggestions you guys have in the
comment section down below and I'll have
a look before my next episode if you
guys want to watch my next video on tech
stores which isn't available yet you

it on there a few days early I'll drop a
