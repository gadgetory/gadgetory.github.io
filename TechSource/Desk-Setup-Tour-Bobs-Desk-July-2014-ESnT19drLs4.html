and I thought today is a good day to
show you one of our setup toys this is
Bob's desk setup and for those of you
that don't know who Bob is he is the
other half of the tech source team he is
the one that finds the products for our
channel and it also helps out with the
script and if you can't tell already by
the setup he went with a black and white
theme so without further ado let's start
off from the right side so this baby is
called a Yeti and for those of you that
didn't watch the video we did on it then
I strongly recommend you to pause the
video and click on this link to watch it
now Bob decided to go with a stunning
white NZXT H for 40 tower with an Asus
Rampage 4 Black Edition motherboard
that's running a GeForce GTX 780 Ti if
you want a complete list of the parts it
will be in the description section down
below right below the Yeti is a white
drawer he purchased from Ikea which
doesn't have too much in it for now but
all the extra space is definitely nice
for the near future on the right side of
the desk are some miscellaneous items
going with the white and black build you
definitely have to be careful on what
you touch because white gets dirty
really quickly so keeping some hand
sanitizer definitely helps we also have
our good friend Walter white and some
pens oh I almost forgot about this
little guy this is a miniature Android
Yeti which he got because his PC is also
named Yeti and on the back he decided to
keep some of the boxes of his favorite
products that he purchased also on the
desk he keeps his planner where all the
upcoming products are written down also
it includes release dates prices and
other useful information that we use for
the channel for peripherals he uses the
Razer products the keyboard is a razer
blackwidow ultimate stealth model
alongside the Razer DeathAdder Mouse and
an extended Corsair Vengeance gaming
mouse pad and once again all of these
will be listed in the description
section if you guys want to check it out
instead of using the PCs USB ports Bob
purchased an anchor 3.0 USB hub which he
uses to connect all of his devices
conveniently moving towards the left
side of the desk is where he keeps these
headphones truly one of the best
headphones on this plane
the ath m50x s provide amazing sound and
comfort with great noise isolation he
uses these for gaming watching movies
and listening to music while getting
work done at the same time when finished
with his work he places the headphones
on the sign Heiser headphone holder
which keeps the overall desk area much
cleaner now for the monitors he is
walking to Asus PB to 7 AQ 27-inch
monitors with a resolution of 2560 by
1440 these become the sweet spot between
1080p and 4k these also have matte
coating with an IPS display so you can
definitely expect color accuracy last
but not least you can't sit and do work
without being comfortable which is why
he picked up a white leather office
chair from flash furniture I honestly
think that this brings the entire setup
together very clean and elegant and most
importantly comfortable anyways that is
it for Bob setup tour he and I really
interested to hear what you guys think
so feel free to leave your thoughts in
the comment section down below if you
guys enjoy the video leave a like and if
you think that a setup is horrible then
leave a dislike just so we know my
ultimate setup tour is coming up next so
make sure you guys stick around if you
want to see that this is at from tech
source and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
