welcome to the third episode of setup
Wars where you submit your desk setup to
get featured on my channel and a chance
to win 25 bucks I hope some of you
Monday and basically randomly select
five of these submissions that you guys
sent me and feature them on my channel
you guys get to vote on the best desk
setup I count the number of votes and
announce a winner on Sunday and my
social media accounts and if you guys
are new to the series and want to submit
your desk setup you need to watch the
requirements video link below for more
details but with all that said let the
setup Wars begin
all right so d5 chosen contestants for
this week are danielle de Wong ethan nic
and head up congratulations for making
it to this week of set-up wars
all right so Daniel let's see what you
got okay so a dual monitor setup one
from Samsung and one from Acer which are
also different sizes it looks like you
are in two cars two so that's pretty
cool and by the way I will leave links
to all the products I mentioned in this
video down below for those of you that
are interested so you have a ps4
controller on your desk with no ps4
inside and I'm guessing it's in the
drawer below so I would recommend you to
put the controller in the drawer as well
and take it only out when you decide to
play that way there's less stuff on your
desk I'm also not sure about the little
Eiffel Tower model that's right in the
center of the table
I mean it does not bother you when
you're trying to use the mouse but not a
bad setup actually good choice on the
razer headphones and the Death Adder
gaming mouse although I think you need a
bigger mouse pad than that for gaming I
have no idea how you game on that thing
but let's go ahead and check under your
desk all right very clean there are
barely any cables inside and I'm really
liking that glass countertop you got
going on but yeah good setup Daniel
thank you for entering setup wars let's
go ahead and check out D Wang so d Wang
has a YouTube channel called the day go
Tech and it looks like every single
monitor setup from Dell and a custom PC
with a cooler master case I actually
think the last person had a cooler
master case as well what a coincidence
but anyways it looks like you have a
moto 360 with a steel band
I'm definitely digging a look on that
and you have your blue snowball
microphone which is the best budget
microphone recording so good choice
there it also looks like we have another
team Sony I think there's more ps4 is in
this set of boards and Xboxes I'm
personally a team Sony fan so I'm not
really complaining so let's take a look
under your desk and looks like we have a
cheater hiding all the cables behind the
desk huh but eh that's more convenient
and requires less work so no complaints
there there is something different about
the desk and actually now that I'm
looking at it looks like the desk is
wooden
itself but you have a white tabletop and
I just notice that you put a whiteboard
or something over it to make it look
like a white table top so really clever
with that and I'm sure it's killing you
that it's not covering the whole table
but maybe you're cool with that I don't
know but that personally is bothering me
so just a few things I want to say since
you have a wireless keyboard maybe a
wireless mouse would suit you better and
I strongly recommend you to pick up a
mousepad but other than that and the
random toy car on top of your PC case
you have a very clean set up so thank
you deewan for entering set up words
I hope it's Dee Wang or day one I don't
know you can correct me in the comments
section all right next up we got Ethan
and my god we finally finally have a set
up with two matching monitors
I applaud to you my friend oh it looks
like my video is pulled up on the screen
- that's that's what you not subscribed
to me
now I'm just kidding I forgive you no
but seriously subscribe to my channel
but overall very clean setup wireless
mouse and keyboard got your MacBook
there on the side with a very bad
sticker choice and the wireless beats
headphones hanging from the wall got a
very very clean setup I also like the
see-through speakers from H&amp;amp;K you got a
good choice there but let's check out
the bottom of the desk so super clean
once again really good job on your setup
man digging the little dolly you have
under your PC case I'm sure that makes
it very easy for you to move your tower
if you need to get behind it so thumbs
up on that one but yeah really liking
your setup I'm actually really jealous
that you get to sit in front of a window
I can only imagine the feeling when it's
raining outside while you're gaming
inside but thank you Ethan for
submitting your desk setup next up we
got Nick and holy dude I don't know
where to start on this okay you know
what the speaker's if you haven't gone
deaf from those things by now you will
surely get blind by that massive ass TV
in front of your face my question to you
how do you do it straight up like how do
you do it
I mean it's obvious that you say very
close to that display so how on earth do
you game on that thing Jesus okay so
besides the Godzilla display we have
three PC cases which I'm guessing are
needed to power on the massive display i
but seriously jokes aside that is a
crazy setup I'm not gonna lie huge plus
on a case choice and it looks like you
got LEDs in there which is a cool
addition and you also got a ps3 so
another one for the Sony team so your
desk is very tiny for the amount of
stuff you got on there so adding the
tablet on a crowded desk to begin with
doesn't seem like a good idea so I'm
guessing you probably just put that
there for the video but I mean if this
setup works for you then by all means
more power to you man I just personally
can't handle a screen that big
especially that close and it looks like
there aren't many cables under the desk
as well so your job on there I have two
questions for you if you're watching
this video and two questions only one
what are those two PC cases use for
exactly and - what are those speakers
used for because I don't think you use
them for gaming
so I'm looking forward for your comment
all right last but not least we got
haddock setup ok so interesting place
for your Razer headphones then there are
so many Razer headphones instead of
videos but anyways it looks like we are
in your room and oh there I am again but
did you subscribe to me is the question
you're lucky I can't tell but it seems
like you really cool dude so um I guess
you did so it looks like you have a
really awesome room I wish my bedroom
looked like this back then all I had was
a cheap Dell PC on a crappy table so I'm
really diggin the atmosphere you got
going on here for sure I wish there was
more light in the room so I can see
things clearly maybe you could have
moved the red curtain to the side to
allow some light in but hey what can I
do so it appears we have another h4 40
case down here for the PC I got some
blue LEDs inside it looks really good
and you have a monitor mounted on the
wall an asus monitor on the desk with a
Samsung tablet underneath and then you
got a white screen TV on your nightstand
any laptop next to your bed it seems
like you will never get bored in this
room of yours that's for sure oh and
look we got our first Xbox player you
not only have the 360 but the Xbox one
as well definitely minus one for that
I'm just kidding I already care about
but consoles that much it's all about PC
gaming for me but anyways moving on I
like the fact that you have a pair of
audio Technica's as well finally we are
talking and it looks like you have the
cables tucked away behind the curtain
out of sight so good job there but yeah
my nothing really much to critique here
I feel like a bigger desk will
definitely help you space things out
more and overall you've a really awesome
gaming room so thank you for submitting
your desk setup to setup wars alright so
