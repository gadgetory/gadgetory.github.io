source and welcome to September's PC
build of the month and I remember
promising you guys a thread ripper build
so not only am I going to be going over
one in this video but I'm gonna be
building that exact same one on the
channel for October so with that said
let's begin the video before you pay
full price on your next purchase
consider checking out deal source tech
for the best tech deals online because
not only do we have a team of people
uploading deals daily but we
cross-checked them with multiple
websites to make sure you're getting the
best price out there right now we cover
all of us UK Canada and even Germany so
check out the old source tech link below
so we're gonna focus on some AMD builds
for this episode in fact I'm gonna be
building one of them on the channel
which is the very first one and I'm
calling it Jack the Ripper it's a super
high-end thread Ripper build featuring
the 1950 x16 core processor right now
there aren't that many coolers
compatible with the tr4 socket so I'm
gonna be using my trusty old H 100 IV 2
with a supplied bracket that came with
the 1950 ex the motherboard I'm going
with is the MSI X 399 gaming Pro carbon
that I unboxed the neat last episode
which is gonna work well with the black
and orange team I'm going with and I'll
be able to overclock the 1950 X easily I
wanted to go with orange RAM sticks to
stick with the color scheme and the only
way I was going to achieve this was
through RGB and g.skill is actually one
of the best ones out there and I've used
that Ram a lot in my previous builds and
I'm a huge fan so I'm gonna throw in 32
gigs in there for storage I'm going to
use a single m2 but I'm also gonna throw
in two one gigabyte that says these to
use in raid 0 now if this was going to
be my actual build I would throw in a 10
terabyte hard drive for mass storage but
the actual build won't have a hard drive
since I'm not gonna keep this PC for
myself I wanted to go with to Vega 64 in
this PC to make a complete AMD build but
unfortunately I only have one and well
you guys know that one is never enough
for me so I decided to go overkill
status and throw in 2 EVGA 1080p is
texture style powering the build is a
1000 watt power supply from EVGA
and also a quick note for people doing
thread Ripper builds you guys have to
make sure that
power supply comes with a second 8-pin
for the CPU socket
since the tr4 socket requires a total of
16 ApS connectors that's only if you're
gonna be overclocking though if not then
a single 8 pin connector for the CPU is
fine the case I'm going with is
Krueger's new conquer tower which not
only looks badass but it's also gonna
fit the color scheme of the build
beautifully the cost of this entire PC
will come out to a little over 1,500
dollars including the cables leaving and
the back plates that I will be picking
up from v1 Tech I will be getting the
Rison logo on the back plates and I'm
also gonna be picking up two SSD covers
as well all right this next build is
more budget-friendly and it's gonna cost
you around $650 it features the rising 3
1200 quad core CPU and the newly
released Vega 56 if you're lucky enough
to snag one while it's in stock the
asrock a B 350 M actually got a price
cut from 80 to 60 bucks making it an
even easier choice to use in the build
it is a budget gaming PC so I'm starting
it off with only 8 gigs of RAM but the
motherboard does have two extra dem
slots for future expandability I'm also
gonna start to build a single one
terabyte hard drive from Seagate since
it's currently cheaper than the WD that
I keep using ok so here's why I went
with the Vega 56 card so this PC is
actually built mainly for quad HD gaming
if you guys can be gaming in 1080p
you will experience bottlenecks in some
games I did make a video to prove this
so check it out if you guys are
interested but it looks like the GTX
1060 and the rx 580 is the sweet spot
combined with the 1200 CPU but once you
increase the resolution to 2 K then the
GPU starts getting utilized more which
means you want to experience any
bottleneck II I hope that makes some
sense to you guys that is why this build
is mainly for 2k and not 1080p to keep
the cost down we're going with the vo6
from vivo which is a micro ATX case and
honestly it doesn't look too bad for 35
bucks you get a clear side panel to 120
millimeter fans in the front with blue
LEDs and also a front USB 3.0 that's
actually not a bad deal and finally
powering this entire build is a 600 watt
power supply from EVGA which has a crazy
deal right now from that
by it's only going for $25 as opposed to
55 and that brings the total to a little
under 650 bucks 2k gaming for less than
$700 that is not a bad deal but anyways
that wraps up the video thing guys so
much for watching if you excited for
thread rubber build make sure to toss a
like to show your support if you guys
didn't like the video feel free to
dislike as well as long as you leave
some feedback but anyways thank you so
much again for watching I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
