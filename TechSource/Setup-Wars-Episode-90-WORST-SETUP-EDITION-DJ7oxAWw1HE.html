a.com
because they have the cheapest CV keys

drop a link to them down below if you
want to check it out starting off the
episode we got Ahmed and I don't
actually have the vocabulary to describe
what exactly this is I don't know if
this is an actual setup but here we go
anyways so he's walking a 32-inch TCL TV
that's hooked up to his PC which has a
45 70 and an EVGA GTX 770 it seems like
his display is on a dresser while the
wireless keyboard and mouse are on top
of a drawer that appears to be falling
apart in fact I think the drawer was a
part of a desk or something at one point
I'm not sure what that cable is used for
but I'm pretty positive you don't need
that much of it speaking of cables the
management is pretty much atrocious
there are a few ethernet cables
disconnected the PC wires are all over
the place and it just seems like a
tornado hit this place hard I mean this
dude has socks and paper bags on the
ground there's really nothing I can
recommend that will help me sleep better
at nights because the main issue here is
the space the dresser is taking up most
of it and there's really no way around
it I mean at this point I would rather
pick up a lap dog and throw away that
broken drawer at least this way you can
game on your lap and have more legroom
good luck Ahmed and thank you for
entering thanks to heavens at least Brad
has a decent looking setup so what his
laptop is being held up by a box and
that his setup is on top of a nother
setup at least it doesn't look like a
tornado hit the place so on the top
setup he has a 22 inch dual monitor
that's hooked up to a Dell laptop and we
also have a pair of sony MDR headphones
and a smartphone charging dock while the
bottom desk that's holding up everything
as a printer and bail router it also
looks like he hooked up something to the
table to hold up his Microsoft keyboard
and mouse I got to give him some credits
for being creative though I mean that's
pretty impressive he also actually
worked on his cable management unlike
some other people in this episode I'm
not sure why he kept the long power
strip on the ground since there is
clearly room for it on the rack but if
there isn't a simple cable sleeve and
box , would work just fine however you
probably need a small
a power ship for it to work I will link
my favorite ones down below for you if
you're interested one thing I really
don't understand is the extra table on
top the bottom desk has plenty of space
for your monitor and a laptop but call
me crazy I feel like you purposely set
this up to accommodate the height of
your chair and if that's the case
wouldn't it be cheaper to just get a
smaller chair I don't know about
whatever this is it's a least organized
good luck and thank you for entering and
we're back to tornado season john has a
21 inch Toshiba monitor which also
happens to be his PC there's a corsair
void headset hanging from it and he's
also using the same keyboard and mouse
that came with the pc and that's pretty
much it on the nightstand other than his
iPhone 5s box and his wallet stacked
with cash I don't even know what kind of
chair he is using I feel like there used
to be a giant hole in the middle and he
decided it would be a good idea weaving
the hole with some strings it's apparent
that cable management is well there
actually isn't any cable management so
on that note I would obviously recommend
a larger desk to begin with and five
minutes of your time watching my cable
management video because there's a lot
of work that needs to be done here thank
you John for entering and good luck
traveling to France we got Paris coming
in at number four with another decent
setup actually even though I strongly
advise putting against the monitor on
top of your ps4 especially if it's skin
by dbrand how dare you I guess you
needed some space for your I don't even
know what this is but apparently it's
flipping everyone off for audio he's
rocking a pair of havoc headphones and a
nemesis keyboard and world cats Mouse
one thing I just noticed in the notes is
that this desk is custom made which is
interesting I can't even be mad at his
cable management at least he tried even
if it's wrapped up in take I mean this
guy's cable management is better than
most submissions I receive believe it or
not he even has a glass desk and finally
the windowless PC that's powering the
setup has a 2100 K and an EVGA GTX 740
honestly if it weren't for the dirty
wall which also has holes in it
this setup would have been a great
contender for the 2017 set up of the
year yeah right thank goodness this
episode is almost over last but not
least we have will with a single
monitors setup I actually take that back
you actually doesn't have a
it's just a Dell PC hooked up to a Dell
keyboard and mouse that's on a carpet
he'll even as TV is on carpet he's also
using a note pad of some sort as a
mousepad and some pillows as his seat
but what really touched my heart was
this tiny mercury beam Bluetooth speaker
that hooked up to his PC he just wanted
to listen to some music man ladies and
gentlemen a moment of silence for our
brother will who had to deal with this
abominable setup for I don't know how
long that's enough nonsense will my
prayers are with you my friend thank you
for entering and good luck so that is if
