hope you're doing well I just came back
from CES and I want to share some cool
stuff that I found at the doggie booth
so in the first showroom they introduced
me to Dolby Atmos and Dolby vision which
completely changes the way you
experience movies TV shows music and
games the technology is actually very
impressive but let me break it down for
you guys just so it's easier to
understand
so Dolby Atmos changes the way you hear
sound unlike stereo which is limited to
two channels Dolby Atmos can arrange
individual sounds in a 3d space to
position sounds all around you I mean I
was hearing sounds above me around me
and even sounds that are moving past me
all the sounds fill the entire room and
I felt like I was inside of it all Dolby
vision on the other hand changes the way
you view content it enhances the image
on your screen to give you ultra vivid
picture quality and it does this by
giving you deeper blacks better
highlights that are up to 40 times
brighter and of course contrast that
makes everything pop out combine both
Dolby Atmos and a Dolby version together
and you truly get an experience unlike
anything not just for listening and
watching content but also gaming as well
I had the chance to play shadow of the
Tomb Raider in Dolby Atmos and it was
the most fun I had gaming when I'm
gaming back at home using speakers or my
headphones it sounds really tame and
flat it doesn't really grab my attention
so I'm more focused on the actual
gameplay but with Dolby Atmos I felt
like I was pulled in the game suddenly
everything came to life there's this one
scene in the jungle where it felt like I
was right there walking through the
jungle myself I could hear birds
chirping above me and leaves shuffling
around me kind of gave me goosebumps to
be honest this is really something you
need to see and hear for yourself to
truly experience the right way of gaming
or watching content whether you have a
large family and get together for movie
nights or you're someone that games a
lot I feel like Dolby Atmos and Dolby
vision will enhance your experience
regardless of the type of content you're
consuming Dolby Atmos is available in a
growing range of sound bars and
headphones while Dolby vision can be
experienced across multiple platforms
like your TV pc and mobile device also
there are a lot of partners that support
both vision and Atmos currently you have
to check them out make sure to click the
link below
by the way Dolby is offering 100 of my
subscribers a free download
of dolby atmos for headphones and you
can redeem it on Xbox one or Windows 10
via the Microsoft Store
I'll leave the promotional code down
below if anyone is interested I really
feel like this is the next step for
anyone that's looking for something a
little more instead of just watching
your content be truly moved by your
entertainment I hope you guys enjoyed
this video leaving a like would let me
know that you did and if you didn't you
know what to do
thanks again for watching as always I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
