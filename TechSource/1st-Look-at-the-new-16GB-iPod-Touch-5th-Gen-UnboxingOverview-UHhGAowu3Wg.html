today we're gonna be looking at the new
16 gig iPod touch recently released by
Apple
this is the 16 gig version of the ipod
touch that Apple released just a few
days ago and this goes for about to 29
through the Apple Store and it's only
available in one color which is the
black and silver which you see here so
there is really no difference between
these and the 32 and 64 versions except
that this does not have a back camera
along with a loop in the back where you
attach a band to this seems very
suitable actually for someone that
doesn't take much pictures or any
pictures for that matter or use up a lot
of space for movies and music I believe
that this is an ideal iPod touch for
children in my opinion the way it was
set up and the price for I think
honestly will make great gifts so here's
the iPod itself once I peel the sticker
off notice that the front is actually
black and back of it is actually silver
so you can see here that the camera is
also missing on the top left and as well
as the loop on the bottom it's it's no
longer there so I'm gonna put this
inside real quick and look at the rest
of the box
honesty's is straight forward I don't
know why I'm going over this but anyways
here it goes so all Apple products
always come with a Hello and it's kind
of like a general guide showing you how
to use iPod and what each button is used
for basically just some basic things
like that and next you have some
stickers which no one ever uses these
are actually the same USB chargers as
the previous models you have the usual
USB to lightning connector and last but
not least you have the Apple earpods so
that's basically it for the unboxing and
first look everything else is basically
the same thing it's the same software
same accessories they just took out the
camera and the loop and they lowered the
size to 16 gigabytes not much else to
say about this I hope you guys enjoy the
video if you did please like the video
as it helps me out a lot and stay tuned
for future giveaways and videos this is
the text source guys and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
