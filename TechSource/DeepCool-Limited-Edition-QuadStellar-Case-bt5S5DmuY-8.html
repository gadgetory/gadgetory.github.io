and I'm here at the deep cool suite
checking out some of their new product
launches as well as their awesome
limited edition cases so first case I
want to talk about which is also my
favorite case is the quad stellar
electro which is this alien looking ei
TX chassis that can be controlled by
your smartphone not only can you control
the front vents for a better airflow but
you can even control all the fans that
come pre-installed and the RGB lights as
well you can use the app to set certain
fan profiles and RGB effects which I
find pretty cool the electoral limited
edition is very similar to the previous
quad stellar that I checked out last
year except this limited edition has a
new silver and orange color scheme and
it also has these awesome a mirrored
tempered glass panels and also there's
only gonna be 100 of them available in
the entire world one of the things I
love about the quad stellar is the crazy
amount of storage space there is 8 3.5
inch drive bays near the top which can
also store SSDs and five additional 2.5
inch SSD trays each compartment also
stores a different component we have one
for the power supply one for the
motherboard storage and even the
graphics card speaking of the graphics
card the quad stellar comes with a
single PCI riser however you can pick up
two additional risers for a 3-way SLI
configuration as far as cooling it can
support a single 120 millimeter fan and
the rear and six 120 millimeter fans in
the front it can also fit a three sixty
millimeter radiator in the front with an
additional 240 millimeter radiator on
the bottom if you guys are interested in
me doing some crazy water cool builds in
this bad boy
let me know in the comment section down
below as I said before it's a limited
edition and they will only make 100 of
these worldwide making it a little
pricier than the original cost this will
go for $5.99 while the original will go
for 399 and you guys can pick one up
late February or early March however the
limited edition version will be
available in May the next case they
introduced was their new arc 90 which is
also an electro limited edition which
means only 100 units will be produced
it's an e ATX chassis which was built
with water cooling in mind
of the extra space and the mounting
options for cooling components the case
itself looks pretty awesome aside from
the color scheme which I'm not a fan of
I like the external transparent water
tube with the floor rotor that's built
in the front of the case and it's
actually integrated with RGB lighting
that's connected to the top RGB strip as
well and you can control it using the
three buttons on the top of the case you
guys might be shocked at this next part
so the new arc 90 can support up to
three full size radiators 360 millimeter
in the front and the top an additional
two 80 millimeter against the
motherboard tray there is something
about that mirrored a tempered glass and
the minimalistic design that makes this
case very attractive even what the
unique color scheme it has the original
goes for $2.99
while the limited edition goes for $4.99
next up is the captain 240 X RGB CPU
cooler which also has the same color
scheme as the cases however this time
it's not limited edition this version of
the 240 X comes with their dual blade
fans and it's compatible with AMD's tr4
socket which is used for thread Ripper
the 240 X also uses a different radiator
which offers better cooling than their
previous version and it also comes with
RDP lighting this will go for 179 it'll
be available in May this year
speaking of coolers deep cool has also
launched Fry's intere cooler for all AMD
sockets a.m. 3 a.m. 4 and even TR 4 it's
actually a very stylish air cooler it
kind of reminds me of a jet engine with
pretty lights and the cooler is built
with an all-metal frame and an inverse
double bladed fan which is set to offer
twice the air pressure for twice the
performance this will go for $89 and
will be available in April and that
about wraps of the video as always let
me know which of these products you guys
are most excited about in the comments
section below also make sure you have
notifications enabled so we don't miss
out on any CES coverage thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
