source and welcome to a new series on
the channel this is top three apps you
must try
so we're kicking off the first episode
with three games which I think you guys
will really enjoy
now all these apps are available on
Android and iOS but more importantly
they're all free at number one we have
Pali Forge the objective of the game is
actually very simple just Forge each
side of the shape by tapping the screen
but be careful not to tap aside twice
the game gets fairly tricky after level
20 but if you keep grinding at it you
will eventually be rewarded with
achievements from Google Play or even
Game Center there's also an Endless mode
where you can build up your high-score
and challenge friends through Facebook
the game has a very calm and immersive
soundtrack so if you get the chance try
it out with your headphones on you will
occasionally run into some ads but trust
me they're very unobtrusive and it
shouldn't turn you away next up we have
tactile Wars which is one of my
favourite mobile strategy games the
games a bit slow progressing at first
but once you're in tune with the
controls it actually gets really
addictive the objective is to kill the
enemy soldiers and capture their bases
while at the same time keeping your own
base secure throughout battles you can
call in more troops and unlock tons of
achievements which keep this game alive
and fun no matter how many hours you
sink into it the game also isn't very
graphically intensive so you won't
experience any lag or major battery
drain last we have fun1 - which is
personally my favorite game on a list
because of the multiplayer aspect it
takes many elements from arcade style
games and brings it to a platformer the
result is a track of obstacles that your
character races on you can join random
matches or create your own party with up
to three other friends these matches are
short which makes it really ideal to
play with friends between classes or
really whenever there's a good handful
of maps to choose from which players can
pick by voting and the power-ups
actually make the in-game experience
very enjoyable
each match can earn you coins which you
can then use to customize your character
this game kept me entertained for hours
on end and it's definitely worth taking
a look at guys feel free to leave any
app suggestions for the next episode in
the comments below that's all for this
video thank you guys
as so much for watching please leave a
like if you enjoyed and I'll talk to you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
