welcome to the PC bill for the month of
August this is red twin a one thousand
dollar gaming and editing PC rockin the
FX a 370 and two Rx for ATS and
crossfire and by the way you guys can
find all the parts used in this build
linked below so I did go with the FX
83-70 that comes with AMD's new Wraith
cooler and man does this cooler Rock not
only is it much quieter than their
previous version but it also does a
better job at cooling I actually managed
to overclock the CPU to 4.7 gigahertz at
one point 46 volts while maintaining
stable temps because of this I was able
to save money on a CPU cooler and put
that extra savings towards the other
parts I did go with 16 gigs of ram from
the a fixer core series that looks very
nice with the overall black and red
theme and stuck to only 480 gigabytes of
SSD space from the Corsair force LS
series the motherboard of choice was the
MSI 970 gaming which is solid for
overclocking that cost under ninety
bucks it also goes well with the overall
color scheme
finally juicing up everything as the
EVGA 650 watt fully modular power supply
and everything is packed inside the
corsair carbide 400 c case to keep it
theme consistent i did pick up a few
fans from the Corsair air series as well
as two LED fans for the front in case
you guys are wondering why the bottom
fan isn't working that's because the
motherboard didn't have enough fan
headers i did order one a few days ago
but i had to get this video done and
couldn't wait for it to arrive i did add
a few mods as well custom sleeve cables
and fan girls from the guys at v1 tech
overall this is a very powerful and
great looking black and red build I'm
actually very happy on how it turned out
for rendering it didn't disappoint it's
currently the fastest budget PC that I
have built to date it managed to render
out a 60 second raw 4k video file in
just 5 minutes and 15 seconds beating
out Ice Cube which was the $650 gaming
PC I did for June similar results were
found on a fire strike benchmark with
red twin scoring 12,000 631 nearly
doubling the score of Ice Cube
alright so that's great for editing but
how does it perform in gaming let's find
out
so there you have it ladies and
gentlemen a very solid duel our X 480
build for both gaming and productivity
as always if you guys enjoyed these
monthly PC bills be sure to leave a like
and make sure you subscribe to the
channel because my next few builds are
going to be good thank you guys so much
for watching as always and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
