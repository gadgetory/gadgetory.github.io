and today we're gonna be checking out
the first Bluetooth earphones I have
seen with interactable features the
freedoms from j-bird but let's start off
with a design what they've done here is
manufactured in metal ear tips with
injection molding to reduce all
unnecessary material from the speaker
housing I'm a big fan of streamlining
products when there is no performance
loss so when the freedoms improve organ
amix without compromising the sound then
I'm in for it all the electronics
including the microphone and charging
pins have been combined with the volume
controls the difference with the
freedoms is that the charging cradle
also has a tiny battery reserve of 125
million power you can clip this on to
get an additional four hours of battery
life for a total of eight hours of music
playback I've personally never needed
eight hours of usage in one workout but
they are wireless earbuds and sometimes
you forget to charge them leave them in
your gym bag or whatever so having that
much juice is definitely nice that's
kind of what a clip makes the most sense
to me they're not heavy enough to get in
the way of a workout but offers so much
more convenience at the $200 price tag
for the freedoms is a little more
justified inside the ear these are super
comfortable and after a while you start
to forget that they are there and this
is especially true when I use the
freedoms with the included comply foam
tips I also got a better seal with these
which lead to less ambient noise and a
more secure fit the six millimeter
drivers deliver crisp and clean audio
and now with the freedoms interactive EQ
I was actually able to really fine-tune
the sound and the way that I prefer with
more bass this is done through the app
where you could either make your own
sound profile using a tool that allows
for fine adjustments or browse through
these shared sound profiles from known
athletes as cool as they are
customizable sound profiles aren't new
and I've definitely seen some Android
apps that accomplish the same thing but
what's unique here is that the changes
are made to the devices firmware so
whatever device I connect with my
freedoms to my sound profile comes along
with it this is especially important
since now with its support for Bluetooth
4.0 I can have two devices connected to
my freedoms at any given moment this way
the sound for example being transmitted
from my macbook doesn't sound any
different than the music being streamed
through my phone now that's a win also
that Bluetooth 4.1 support allows for
two pairs of freedom earbuds to be
connected to one device I've never had
any battery problems with the freedoms
thanks to a few things the first being
the charging rate I mean sure the
earbuds battery capacity is only four
hours excluding the battery clip but
with 20 minutes of charging I was able
to get an extra hour of music playback
with a volume a bit above 50%
I'm also able to see the exact battery
percentage via the app which is
something I couldn't do on my galaxy s7
and of course the earbuds do notify you
with the battery status every time you
turn them on the freedom stayed secured
no matter what type of exercise I did
with them from hiking lifting weights to
running I was confident in the fit but
that was to be expected but after using
the freedoms for a week I could see what
Jaybirds goal was or at least what I
think it was to make the best possible
pair of wireless sport oriented earbuds
available on the market I don't make
that claim without a lot of thoughts and
admittedly I haven't tried every pair of
Bluetooth earbuds out there but the fact
is I don't have any real complaints
about the freedoms the price is a bit
steep in my opinion but you are buying a
product from an established brand that
knows what they're doing and I'm not
just saying that to type these up that
statement goes true for everything I
mean people buy mercedes-benz because
it's a mercedes-benz not because it has
the best performance to cost ratio my
conclusion is simple if you don't mind
missing out on firmware based eq control
and new design that makes things like
helmet usage more comfortable then you
might as well pick up the X 2's or go a
different route completely but that's
just my two cents that is it for the
video thing guess so much for watching
if you enjoyed it make sure to leave a
like and I will drop a link to the
earbuds down below if you guys want to
check them out and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
