if you guys haven't heard of it by now
then you are seriously missing out
LastPass helps you manage and save all
your passwords and login details by
storing them securely in your LastPass
vault which is protected by your master
password I've been using them for over a
year now way before they reached out to
work with me and I absolutely loved it
I've installed it on my Google Chrome as
an extension but it's also available on
your smart phone essentially how it
works is once you are at a login screen
of any website you can click on the
LastPass logo to retrieve your login
info without having to type in and
manually it saves me a ton of headache
not having to remember the username and
password on every single website I visit
it's also got other cool features like
the sharing center where you can share
passwords and notes to friends and
family and secure notes where you can
store Wi-Fi passwords membership IDs or
any info you want to keep safe it's
completely free so check it out I know
you guys will love it as much as I do
I'll drop a link to it down below
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
