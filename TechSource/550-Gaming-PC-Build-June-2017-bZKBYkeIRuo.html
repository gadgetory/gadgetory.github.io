I'm welcome to June's PC build of the
month now I've been giving Intel some
love recently at this time I decided to
do an all AMD budget bang for your buck
build this it's a lot of words and it's
actually pretty good for productivity as
well since we're using a quad-core
processor so with that said let's dive
right in so the build will cost you
around five hundred and fifty dollars
and I'll be doing a step-by-step build
guide for anyone that wants to buy the
parts and build one for themselves we're
going to be overclocking and installing
windows as well so be sure to check out
the build guide once it's uploaded on
the channel and I'll drop a link to it
below as well if it's already available
so for this build I went with the r5
1400 which I managed to overclock to 3.9
gigahertz and this is a solid quad core
processor for gaming and it does a
pretty decent job for editing video as
well compared to other quad-core CPUs
which we will later see in this video
unfortunately I didn't win the silicon
lottery so I couldn't get it to 4.0 as
much as I tried so I settled with 3.9
instead it does come with its very own
stock cooler the AMD race itself and let
me tell you guys this thing is silent
even during full load without the side
panel on this thing is virtually quiet
as me typing on the keyboard
fans are very quiet it also does a great
job cooling the overclock 1,400 times
reaching only 70 degrees during full
load that's not bad this means that we
don't have to buy an aftermarket cooler
the motherboard choice was an easy one
the asrock be 350 M pro 4 is the best
choice under $100 because it offers a
lot of features for the money not only
do you get four dimm slots that support
64 gigs of ram up to 3200 megahertz but
you also get 2 m dot 2 ports making it a
perfect board for future upgrades
whether it's upgrading your cpu adding
more RAM or testing in an empty drive
later down the line this motherboard
gives you those options right now it's
only going for 75 dollars on new attic
and it's definitely the best bang for
your buck motherboard for budget builds
right now now if it does get sold out by
the time you're watching this video I'll
drop a link to an alternative
motherboard down below for you I try to
change things up and go with the Gayle
RAM sticks but soon realized they went
out of stock immediately so I'll drop a
link below to something equivalent that
cost the same
we're also sticking with usual one
terabyte of hard drive space from WD
because honestly the value of this is
really hard to beat and it's one of the
reasons why I use it in most of my
budget builds along with the power
supply from EVGA
the graphics card of choice is the
gigabytes rx 560 because the new 5
Series cards have a noticeable
performance increase compared to the
last generation lineup and finally we
got the Zelman t2 case that's packing
everything inside believe it or not I
was actually impressed with the quality
of this case despite it being only 35
bucks and as all the ports in the front
for easy access along with a front panel
USB 3 which is rare to find on cases for
this price point the construction of the
case in general is really sturdy and the
side panels don't even Bend on top of
that there is plenty of space for cable
management we get a bunch of holes in
the back as well as if tight areas one
thing I didn't like is the size of the
zip tight areas I would have liked to
see them a bit wider so that I can use
velcro straps instead but it's not a big
deal what I find interesting about this
case is that it gives the users so much
space for cable management yet it
doesn't have a clear side panel which
kind of defeats the point you know if
you
to go out of the way and cable manager
PC make it look good from the inside and
you can't even show it off then what the
hell is the point instead you get space
to mount to 80 millimeter fans if you
choose to now I don't buy you guys but I
much prefer a clear side panel I mean
look how clean the build looks but sadly
I won't be able to show this off anyways
kicking off the benchmarks we got fire
strike first up and it looks like
zoltron scored 5700 yes that is the name
of the build
I know it's Quincy just like most of my
other builds but guys I'm running out of
names here I can only be creative for
such a long time so help me with some PC
names down below in the comment section
please anyways you guys can see how it
performs compared to my other builds on
the channel the only PC it beat was Core
bytes which was a $450 gaming PC back in
November which was using a gtx 1050 but
when we look at 4k wintertimes it
actually didn't do that bad it beat out
silenzio which was a $750 build back in
March that was using an i5 7400 and a
gtx 1060 although i wouldn't call this a
workstation pc it should handle editing
just fine as long as you're working with
1080p files but how does it do in gaming
before we get into the benchmarks I
wanted you guys know that I capture the
footage using the AMD we live screen
capture which basically impacted the
frames of the games anywhere from 5 to
10 frames which is significant so that's
PS that you guys are seeing in the top
right corner of the gameplay is not
accurate so instead pay attention to the
FPS count that I listed on the right
screen because I had to retest the games
while not using the real-life screen
capture hope that makes any sense but
anyways without wasting a number time
these are all done in 1080p let's check
them out
some pretty healthy numbers coming from
this building high settings definitely
playable above 30 SPS however if you
want to achieve that 60 FPS minimum
you're going to have to lower the
settings a bit or upgraded GPU a GTX
1060 or rx 580 will give you that extra
push but you're going to have to pay
closer to $200 to make that jump
so the positives and negatives of
building this PC also are the positives
first up is acoustics it's actually be
quiet so it's perfect for a nighttime
gameplay so if you're living with your
mom or your friend or roommate or
whatever and you don't want to wake them
up then this is perfect for that also if
you're recording on a microphone the
families won't get picked up as well so
that's also a nice plus also this PC is
perfect for less intensive games so
we're talking overwatch League of
Legends smite heroes of the storm and
even csgo so if you guys want to play
over 60 FPS and those games then this PC
will get the job done and you don't have
to upgrade the GPU and finally
productivity now although I don't
recommend this for heavy 3d modeling or
graphic design work like that but if
you're editing 1080p video then this PC
will definitely get the job done
and finally the negatives so this is
definitely not a dedicated streaming PC
you can definitely use it to screen
games but it's not for dedicated
hardcore screamers out there especially
that are screaming intensive games
I recommend a higher core count CPU like
86 core I look at the job done and maybe
even a better GPU for that number two I
mentioned it before
heavy 3d work anything that's CPU
intensive definitely what I recommended
for that this is not a Productivity PC
and number three which is pretty obvious
I really have to even mention it but if
you want a game in 1440p or 4k then this
is definitely not the PC for you are you
definitely a stronger processor and of
course a much better GPU and a power
supply so this is not even the best PC
to start with if you want to upgrade
later down the line this PC is perfect
for those of you who are on a budget now
and want to focus on 1080p gaming with
upgrades later down the line let's see
if you want to get a better processor or
a better GPU but still want a game in
1080p
then this is definitely
for you so that is if it is video if you
guys can do my monthly PC bills leaving
a like will ensure that I continue to do
these every single month be on the
lookout for the build guide coming up in
a few days if you guys I'm going to
focus on a specific budget for the next
month build let me know in the comments
section as well as what preference you
guys want whether it's a screaming PC 4k
gaming PC 4k editing rig whatever it is
let me know in the comments section I'll
check it out but anyways I can't thank
you guys enough for your support all of
your faces I will see you in the next
