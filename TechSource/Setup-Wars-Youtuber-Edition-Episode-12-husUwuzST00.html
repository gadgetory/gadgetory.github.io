bright and this is my setup tour
starting off I have a large custom-built
desk which holds my pc set up on the
desk I have three monitors being powered
by my custom-built PC for peripherals
I'm rocking the CM storm mechanical
keyboard and Logitech MX master these
make my setup look super clean and don't
add any bulk the cool part of my setup
is when I close my blinds they double as
a projector screen so I can play xbox
and watch movies I can use the projector
from the other side of my room where I
dock all my gear and chill on my bed
another awesome part of my setup is that
I can control it all with my voice check
it out
Alexa trigger computer
Alexa turn on lights you can check out
my entire setup and how I made it in
detail on my channel I hope to see you
all there hey guys styler here in this
video I'm going to show you my custom
made desk so as you can tell I have
tried to keep it minimalistic in a
black-and-white style
my chair is the TC stone white with
breathable mesh I use the Logitech MX
master mouse on top of the heart where
is a Firefly
mouse pad with LED together with a
Logitech illuminated keyboard and below
it all the Casa gaming mm 200 mouse mat
extended edition inside the desk I have
attached some black foil while the lower
parts are white plates that can be moved
to the side to gain access to the power
cables the whole setup is just powered
by a 13-inch MacBook pole as monitor I
use the LG 34 um 95 for gaming I'd use a
PlayStation 4 and sometimes my
smartphone on the left side I have a
design shelf called Luna so guys that's
it for my setup tour I hope you liked it
hey guys my name is the key and I want
to tech based YouTube channel just like
edy and this is my setup so I like to
keep my setup minimalistic while also
being sort of flashing away so I paired
to 27 inch 1080p issues MX 279 H
monitors and I don't regret it a single
bit right under that I have an IKEA Alex
add-on unit and I have a pair of Samson
studio monitors to the left and right
over my setup under the Alex Island unit
I also have my beloved ps4 and my
peripherals of choice are the Razer
BlackWidow chroma and the have it gaming
mouse on top of the right speaker I also
have an Alva content from Ikea leaning
to the right of my setup I also have my
akatosh slash your PC before you say
anything yeah I know I've no GPU and
that's because I'm waiting for Nvidia to
launch
gtx970 clicking snapping from PC other
than that it has an i7 4790k and eight
gigabytes of 24 hundred megahertz RAM I
love the OS X interface and I love the
