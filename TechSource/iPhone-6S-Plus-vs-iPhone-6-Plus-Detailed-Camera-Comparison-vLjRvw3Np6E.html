welcome to another detailed camera
comparison test
this time we are facing off the iPhone
6s plus against last year's model the
iPhone 6 plus but Before we jump into
the samples let's take a look at the
specs the iPhone 6s plus has a 12
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.2 that can shoot up to 4k
resolution whereas the iPhone 6 plus has
an 8 megapixel camera with the same
aperture but can only shoot up to 1080p
for front-facing cameras the iPhone 6s
plus has a 5 megapixel camera that can
shoot up to 720p and the iPhone 6 plus
has a 1.2 megapixel camera that can
shoot up to 720p as well so with all
that said and done let's sit back relax
and take a look at some samples
when it comes to water focusing the 6s
Plus does a great job it utilizes its
focus pixels feature to detect the
object quickly and focus with 100%
accuracy the six plus also does a
phenomenal job however it focuses
slightly faster than the 6s probably
because of its 1080p resolution
nonetheless I don't have any complaints
on either phones for daytime video it's
a no-brainer the 6s gets the point for
sharper and more detailed footage most
of the video is going to be going to the
6s simply because of its 4k resolution I
mean there's just no competition pixels
aside the color reproduction is
practically identical when it comes to
the low-light video both phones seem to
be identical I honestly couldn't even
tell which one was shot in 4k since the
color reproduction and sharpness look
very similar on both phones the 6s plus
did have some issues with auto focusing
but other than that nothing else is
different now here is where the
differences are obvious both phones were
strapped on a device to ensure a very
accurate stabilization reading both
phones also have optical image
stabilization but the 6s Plus seems to
have either a better software or better
Hardware stabilization what's up guys
welcome to the front-facing video camera
and microphone quality
video between the iPhone 6s plus and the
iPhone six-plus both of the cameras are
being shot in its highest resolution and
also to be an audio icon somewhere on
the screen that will indicate which
phone's audio is being used also if you
guys are watching this on your
headphones I'm going to stay quiet for
bit so you guys can hear the actual
background noise
we are facing video the 6s plus has a
little more contrast which provides
vibrant colors you can really tell by
looking at the color of my shirt it just
looks more red on the 6s plus but other
than that everything else is practically
identical even the microphone quality is
the same Apple has definitely not
upgraded in my quality now let's take a
look at day time pics honestly the only
way you can tell them apart is by
putting them side-by-side
Dulli difference between the 6s plus and
the 6 plus is the contrast yellows are
more yellow reds are more red and
purples are more purple that's basically
the only difference aside from sharper
pictures due to the megapixel count
dynamic range is identical and both
cameras stay true to life same goes for
low-light other than the contrast and
sharpness differences everything else is
practically the same even the flash is
the same honestly if you're thinking
about upgrading because you want a
better camera I would just wait for the
iPhone 7 because the camera upgrade
really isn't that big of a difference
unless you absolutely want to shoot in
4k resolution or edit your photos the
higher megapixel count is nice but if
you're not going to be cropping your
photos you can't even tell the
difference so there you have it the
iPhone 6s plus does have the better
camera in general but it's a marginal
upgrade the only way to tell them apart
is by putting them side-by-side
otherwise it's impossible to
differentiate if you guys enjoy my
camera comparisons feel free to hit that
like button and let me know in the
comments section down below which phone
I should compare the 6s plus with next
thanks again for watching and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
