today we're going to be looking at the
new samsung galaxy tablet pro 8.4 the
new tablet from samsung brings some
interesting software improvements as
well as hardware the new samsung tab pro
8.4 is Samsung's answer to Apple's iPad
Mini with Retina display which was also
recently launched with its high
resolution display new software
improvements and killa internals does
the new galaxy tab stand up to its
competition we'll find out once you get
this tablet in-house for review Samsung
has managed to give the new Galaxy Tab a
2560 by 1600 super clear LCD and to
power all those pixels Samsung has put
its own Exynos 5 octa-core chipset that
will be clocked at 1.9 gigahertz other
countries that probably include the
United States will get a Snapdragon 800
chipset that will be clocked at 2.3
gigahertz the samsung galaxy tab pro 8.4
will have only 16 and 32 gigabytes of
storage but it'll be expandable by a
microsd up to 64 gigabytes the tablet
will also come with 2 gigs of RAM which
is kind of weird because we've already
seen Samsung implement 3 gigs of ram
into their no 3 device other than that
the device feels really good in the hand
and uses the same pleather material
backing that can be found on the Galaxy
Note 3 line the tablet is also slim but
has good weight to it you shouldn't
really have any problems carrying this
throughout the day the new galaxy tablet
also come pre-loaded with magazine
interface samsung says his experience
was specifically designed for a larger
form factor devices allowing users to
further tailor the experience of the
galaxy tablet to their own needs the
interface enables users to organize the
content the way they want in a dashboard
our automatically pulled new data from
servers as well as organizing apps that
you more frequently use on the top this
will also be Samsung's first device that
runs 4.4 kitkat officially for the one
guy who actually uses the tablet camera
you'll be pleased to hear that the
Galaxy Tab comes an exceptionally good
tablet camera we actually compared it to
an iphone 5s which arguably has one of
the best shooters on a mobile device at
right now and as you can see it could
hold its own against the Apple iPhone
center wraps up the video thanks again

Samsung
to go over as well as other products to
