and welcome to setup wars episode 138
where you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel if you guys
wanna participate make sure to watch the
video linked below let the setup wars
begin kicking off the episode we got
Dickel from the Philippines and his
gaming and editing setup featuring the
x34 ultra wide and a beautiful white
black and red color scheme right after
bad I like that there was some
personality in this setup from the dope
wall shelves filled with the Warcraft
collectibles to the Final Fantasy
figurines on the actual desk speaking of
the desk it's actually custom built and
he even created a dedicated place to
store his parish map and cables in very
nice he's rocking a corsage fave
keyboard with red switches and the asus
rog sicka gaming mouse for his main
setup and he uses a SteelSeries mouse
for his laptop I like the way he routed
his keyboard and mouse wires you've
hatched them to the monitor legs using
some velcro straps for a cleaner look
and he even velcro the rest of the
cables behind the monitor together to
keep them from flaring out speaking of
cables I love the use of the wall
raceways to hide all of those wires
coming from across the room the pc
powering the setup feature is the 7700 K
and an MSI GTX 1080 in the beautiful
s340 elite case and great job sticking
with the color scheme inside the PC as
well except when the PC is on for some
reason you have it set to the rainbow
effect Ferrario is walking a pair of
creative Giga works t3 speakers however
he does have the HyperX cloud 2 gaming
headset as well which is hanging from
the NZXT puck I'm not sure what's up
with the monitor sticker that you have
still on there I mean I don't know if
you kept it there just to mess with my
LCD or you just don't like peeling off
stickers from your gear other than that
you have a very solid and organized
setup he was an actual picture of his
setup before he built himself a new desk
looks like most of the parts are the
same except for the PC case and it also
looks like we're missing the Sephiroth
and oh look that damn sticker is still
on a monitor seriously if you're
watching this video please let me know
your reasoning behind that
I need to be able to sleep tonight why
do you still have that sticker on the
damn monitor next up is Jay and his
fully custom-built setup that he uses
for work gaming and entertainment one of
the reasons why I love this setup so
much is because of the attention to
detail that he put into this he actually
used parts from an old cupboard that he
no longer needed he built his desk a
shelf on the right for his PC and a
backboard that's used to mount both of
his monitors - he even hooked up his
desk lamp headphones and the Xbox
controller further down we can see
another wall shelf that's being used to
hold up a few of his mobile devices and
if you guys look closely you can see two
cables sticking out from the top I'm
guessing that he uses these to charge
his devices in the shelf the keyboard is
the corsair k70 luxe and it appears that
he has two mice the rival 500 and the
performance MX from Logitech for audio
is rocking a pair of Edifier c3x
speakers and the Skullcandy Hesh two
wireless headphones which by the way are
my favorite pair of bluetooth headphones
the left glass shelf is kind of throwing
off the symmetry of the setup so I'm
wondering why you didn't make one for
the right side the cable management on
the other hand is exceptional lots of
cable raceways were used to hide the
wires against the wall and underneath
the desk
he even drilled a hole for the keyboard
and mouse and ran all the wires straight
into the back of the PC from underneath
the desk it looks like he used some
acoustic foams to cover up the wires so
that you cannot see it from the side I
even like the little shelf that he added
underneath the desk for additional
storage the PC powering the set up is
equipped with the 7700 K and a GTX 1080
from I game which honestly I haven't
even heard of until now Jay did send in
a pic of the previous setup which was
temporary because he does relocate a lot
due to work so he's always changing up
his setup which kind of sucks I feel bad
that he has to constantly take apart
what he built but anyways it's a very
clean setup very nice job with the
custom work and thank you Jay for
entering Kuki I think that's how you say
your name I'm sorry if I butchered it is
up next all the way from Israel and his
setup for gaming graphic design and at
also anime whatever anime means I mean
you have a crap-ton of anime stuff but
what does it mean when you say that your
setup is used for anime did you mean
like watching anime anyways he's walking
3 ultra sharp monitors from Dell with a
power tv up top as an overhead on the
desk there's a let's just say there's a
lot of stuff on there it also looks like
he is left-handed
since the mouse is on the left side he's
also got the ps4 wrapped in some skins
and a bunch of anime collectables
everywhere and I mean literally
everywhere there's a bunch of them and
the glass shelves right next to him and
even the wallpapers some of the posters
will straight up we monetize this video
but I'll include them in here anyways
because I got you fam apparently the
wallpaper on the monitors are video
wallpapers and he recorded a little
snippet of his desk for you guys to see
so I hope you enjoy it
I just realized even the key caps on his
keyboard are anime theme I mean this guy
sure has a lot of passion for anime and
feel like he would be the perfect one to
recommend me some new anime shows to
watch cooky if you're watching us can
you please recommend me any series or
movies I love Dragon Ball super one
punch man attack on Titans
I love Bleach only the Arrancar saga
which I think was season 6 and 7
I love no game no life and he's really
cool anime movies which I think it's
called redline and one was metropolis so
those are like my all-time favorites if
you have any similar anime like that
please please please let me know in the
comment section or send me an email
/ audio is rocking a pair of micro lab
speakers which are sitting on top of
some of these scariest-looking wall
shelves I have seen I mean seriously it
looks like both of them are about to
snap off any moment now he also has two
sets of headphones the coarser voids and
he beats solo down here is the pc
powering everything and it's equipped
with a nother 7700 K and a gtx 1070
cable management ain't the prettiest out
there that's for sure but he did give it
some effort wrapping some around the
support bar of his desk and he even used
a cable sleeve to cover up the wires
that are connected to the wall outlet i
would definitely replace that with
actual wall raceways for a cleaner look
but that's just me I know you said you
didn't want to mount your monitors on a
desk mount because you have a thin glass
surface which is true but a way around
this is actually using a thick 1 to 2
inches of wood underneath your desk I'll
have to do is put it between the desk
and the clamp on your monitor mount and
it will keep it nice and snug and it's
able to hold up all three of your
monitors I recommend this because it
will really clean up your desk since you
have a lot of stuff on there it's a very
crowded setup for my taste but if I had
to say there is one thing that it's not
lacking its personality you definitely
made sure to give this setup plenty of
it Thank You cooky for entering Mattia
was contestant number 4 and his gaming
setup between 2 24 inch monitors from
Asus that are mounted against the wall
and it appears that he's going for an
all-black setup with purple accents he's
got the master keys pro as keyboard
paired with the popular MX master even
with all that stuff on the desk he
managed to keep the setup
organized and what I've suggested to
mount the Focusrite audio interface
underneath the desk but that won't work
out because of the drawers so you kind
of just stuck to having all that stuff
on the desk instead with the exception
of the Xbox controller I mean if you
really wanted to you can put that in one
of the drawers for audio is rocking a
pair of Mario speakers and the m50x
headphones which are hidden inside one
of the drawers when he is not using them
and he also has the Samson meteor
microphone as well excellent work with
the cable management no complaints here
and finally we got the PC powering
everything which has another 7700 K
Jesus Christ that's like for an hour
already
it also has an AC Strix 1080 and 16 gigs
of ram the only critique I would give
this set up are the pictures on the wall
I feel like they're a little too high up
there leaving a giant empty space right
above the monitors but other than that
you've got a beautiful PC and gaming
setup Thank You Mario for entering las
policías Tommy and his setup for video
editing and gaming he's using a view
Sonic gaming monitor that's sitting on
top of a monitor riser which he used to
store some things underneath and he's
also got the smart geezer keyboard with
the Logitech G Pro Mouse I feel like I
mispronounced that keyboard as well I
think it's called geezer not Jeezy he
doesn't have an actual set of speakers
or headphones so he's using these sony
xp3 bluetooth speakers instead and we
also got to RGB lamps which are both
from Aki he's also got his flip knife
proudly displayed on the left side next
to his Nintendo switch and that's pretty
much everything on his desk other than
his smartphones and the PC which has
another 7700 K I think this is literally
the first time that all five contestants
have a 77 and rukia and this is not
planned by the way anyways it's also
packed with 32 gigs of RAM and two Strix
1080 T eyes in SLI you can definitely
tell where most of his budget went into
for his setup this overkill PC honestly
if you didn't mention that this was used
for editing it would have been way to
overkill pretty good work with the cable
management I don't think I've ever seen
a power strip quite like that before but
it's nice to see that you use a cable
sleeve to cover up all the wires my only
complaint would be with the keyboard
wire I mean if you're not going to drill
a hole inside the
I would recommend running the cable
straight underneath the monitor riser
instead of having it go over I really
like what you've done with the wall art
those shelves are nicely centered and
the wall art to add some spice to your
setup Thank You Tommy for entering and I
pretty much wraps up this episode if you
guys enjoyed it please make sure to toss
a like and make sure you guys drop your
comments below and vote on who you think
has the best desk setup I love your
faces and I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
