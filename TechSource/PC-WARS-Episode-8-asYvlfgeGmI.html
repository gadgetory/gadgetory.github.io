son Anton Daryl Jack and Scott
congratulations for making it a PC wars
episode 8 first up SAS on with an
all-black build inside the Master Pro 5
we have a 4770 paired with an r9 390 16
gigabytes of RAM and a cooler master
hyper - 12 X cooler for benchmarks that
scored a 10,000 400 for cable management
is OK nothing really impressive but
overall a very straightforward build
with minimal mods that include a
custom-made signature of his that lights
up Anton is next up with an obsidian
750d build we have a 6700 K gtx 980ti
and 16 gigabytes of Vengeance ram
keeping the CPU cool is the courser H
100 I GTX and four benchmarks it's
called a 14,000 331 taking the lead for
this episode
Caleb management isn't bad but I don't
know why you didn't keep the black and
white theme consistent by using another
corsair fan for the rear regardless it's
a sweet build Thank You Anton for
entering Daryl's next up with the
uncanny x-men build which is the first
ever red and yellow build for the show
we have a 5820k overclocked to 4.3 and
EVGA 980 superclocked Edition and 16
gigabytes of Ripjaws for ram we have
custom painted radiators a custom CPU
block with the x-men logo and custom
sleeve cables by ice mods great work
with cable management in the front and
back and for benchmarks has scored a
12,000 622 taking second place for the
show a very unique and awesome build
thank you Darrell for entering jack is
next up with a sweet looking white blue
and black build inside a parvum systems
case we have a 6600 k paired with two
EVGA gtx 980ti s in sli and 16 gigabytes
of a victor ram so much power in such
little space very impressed with the
cable management
given that you didn't have much room to
work with four benchmarks that scored a
nineteen thousand for pinning this build
up top and
number one spot a very clean and
gorgeous build thank you jack for
entering last but not least we have
Scott with yet another water-cooled
build three in one episode I don't think
that's ever happened before this is an
interesting build because the
motherboard is lying flat on the case
that's pretty cool we have a 59 30 K
overclock to four point seven gigahertz
paired with two gtx 980 s and sli we
also have 32 gigabytes of Dominator
Platinum's and everything is packed
inside the case labs s8 case we also
have custom white sleeved cables from
Corsair so I guess this is a black and
white bill for benchmarks has scored a
twenty two thousand seven twenty six
taking first place in this episode since
when there's two 980 s beat dual 980ti
is in fire swag that's pretty
interesting
I guess the 59 30k is to blame so that's
a bit of SEPA soda PC Wars thank you
