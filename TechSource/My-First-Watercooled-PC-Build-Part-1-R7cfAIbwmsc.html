tech source nothing too crazy
but guys it's time to take tech stores
to the next level I know you've been
waiting for this for a long time so have
I what we're going to be doing today is
building my very first water-cooled
build who's excited all right now since
this is my first water-cooled build I
won't be doing a time-lapse build
because I have no clue what the hell I'm
doing so I'm going to be doing a vlog
style build log instead and maybe you'll
have two three parts I'm not really sure
it's kind of like building Legos without
the instruction guide so yeah this is
going to be an interesting experience to
say the least but as soon as I get this
down guys I'm going to be doing these
regularly hopefully I can bring you guys
a water-cooled
build once every two months so yeah very
excited if you guys are excited make
sure to leave a like because this this
definitely a lot of planning involved
into doing these so that's why I don't
do it every single month I haven't even
done what am I talking about but anyways
let's take a look at the parts and then
we can start by building this PC all
right so here are the main parts and on
that bench over there is basically all
the water cooling pieces I just I'm
getting a heart attack looking at these
this is going to be insane
but anyways so the bulk of this is
pretty much on this desk we're gonna be
using these 6700 K 32 gigs of ram from a
trident by the way I'm sure you guys I
realized what color scheme this is if
you have let me know in the comment
section we're going to do a 480
gigabytes
m dot 2 from HyperX we have an SLI
bridge you know what that means we've
got not one but two gtx 1080s from EVGA
this is the super supe super clock
superclocked edition so very psyched
about that there's a there's an EVGA
z170 FTW motherboard underneath this
massive power supply I'll really be
using the 1200 I honestly I think I
ordered and
and an EVGA 1000g 2 instead so I might
use that instead I don't know we'll see
what's up with that and in this baby the
case is going to be the Liam Lee PC 0 9
it's upside down I don't know why did
that but the PC 0 9 case it's gonna be
an amazing looking build and there are
the cables over there black and yellow I
gave it away
whatever whatever is anyways here are
the parts let's go ahead and take out
the case from the box and I guess we can
start off by putting in the motherboard
for us because that is the easiest part
and we can install the RAM sticks and
the waterblock and then yeah we'll go
from there
alrighty then let's go in and get it
open this box
I can't speak today guys I've honestly
I'm exhausted today I doing bunch of
errands so apologies if my enthusiastic
level is under 9000 so let's just let's
do this I'm subsite
all of us can hear that but it's hella
windy over here in California there's a
freakin tornado about to come suck us up
right now I don't realize I've giantess
cases until I really am boxed it I'm
guessing this is the glass panel because
this is really heavy it is the glass I
knew it that looks like the side panels
down there as well so you know what guys
I'm actually I kind of touched this I
think we should put together a PC first
and then we could put this on at the end
just because I don't get any
fingerprints on it and maybe even crack
it during the process all right guys
let's do the motherboard processor and
the waterblock and I think we should
call it for that episode Oh for this
episode here she is and all its glory
guys a very gorgeous motherboard this is
the z170 classified motherboard from
EVGA and by the way I'm gonna get huge
things to EVGA Linley for sending the
parts in as well as mod my mod for
sending in the Alpha cool water cooling
parts you guys are awesome I won't be
able to do this video if it weren't for
you oh also uh shout out to g-scale for
the RAM and also HyperX for their m2
SSDs you guys Rock thank you so much
alright so we got the motherboard in
front of us let's pop open the sockets
put in the 6700 K I'm thinking about
getting a second camera I'm putting it
right above me just so you guys can get
a closer shot of what I'm doing on these
types of videos I don't know if you guys
would like to see something like that
where we go slap it back in and that is
done CPUs inside so this is the block
nice and heavy imagine if I just drop
this right on the Freak motherboard he
is look at that holy crud I was close
I haven't put that down I can't believe
I almost forgot to use my anti-static
mat from alpha pool as well check this
thing out guys this thing is massive
this is legit one of the most detailed
anti-static mouse mats I've ever seen
it's got to being size charts radiator
sizes and holes I mean this thing has
pretty much everything this is
ridiculous and even comes with some
wrist wraps which I think you're
supposed to hook these up to the amount
of the mat itself but I never use them
honestly it just for those people who
are extra extra cautious
I think alpha cool is actually giving
one of these mouse mats away so more
details will be on my final video once
the PC is completed so make sure you
guys stick around if you're interested
alright so the CPU block is now
officially on there I guess it wasn't
too bad it's pretty straightforward
but I feel like that's like the easiest
part so alright so I guess we cannot do
the RAM sticks and then put in the MDOT
2 over here and then maybe move on to
the next step
Oh
check these out these look awesome
black and yellow indeed these drumsticks
are definitely gonna pop and it's build
I feel like there's a lot more black
than there is going to be yellow so I
think that's why these ramp sticks are
perfect for this build
case you guys are wondering about the
speed these are thirty two hundred
megahertz 32 gigs total so it gigs each
stick look at these babies g.skill you
guys do such an amazing job
honestly when it comes to RAM sticks I
feel like aesthetics is more important
than anything since all the RAM sticks
are pretty much the same speed nowadays
alright guys so it's going to put on the
MDOT two SSD and then wrap up the video
and in the next video we can actually
finally put the motherboard inside the
case and then continue on with the build
alright guys so that is pretty much it
for step one or part one of the video I
guess I don't know how short this video
is but if you guys want longer videos
let me know in the comment section down
below
also let me know you guys enjoy these
series if you do I'll probably continue
to do something like this for my next
water-cooled build as well or maybe I
should just do a time-lapse I don't know
whatever you guys like but anyways thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
