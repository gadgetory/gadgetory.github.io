and welcome to setup wars episode 110
potato edition with the crappiest of the
crappiest setups come together for our
enjoyment and entertainment so whatever
I say in this video don't take seriously
because obviously I'm doing it just for
fun the people that submit these setups
want to be part of the potato addition
I'm also going to be roasting setups
because I do have a new series called
roast your setup coming starting I
should say episode 120 and I kind of
want to give you guys a quick a taste or
a small taste of what to expect but with
that said let the setup board's begin as
always just a quick reminder the person
with the worst setup will receive $100
and you guys get to vote so make sure
you do so by clicking on the link below
at the end of this video so starting off
the show we got Abdul and a pretty
depressing set up featuring a crappy 19
inch square monitor from Samsung and
some basic ass speakers from Thompson
along with a standard keyboard and mouse
it appears that the color scheme he was
going for was broke and depressed and he
did a great job keeping it consistent
throughout the setup I do want to give
props to Abdul for cutting out a piece
of the backboard to help with cable
management even though this is a puny
setup he did put in some work cleaning
up the wires and for that I will commend
you he even made a slit near the top of
the desk to route the cables through you
guys gotta admire the effort she'll be
even there talk about the specs of this
port PC hell why not it's rocking a
powerful I 330 240 and the MSI gt70 40
this thing can run Crysis in 4k on
multiple monitors Abdullah maybe odds be
ever in your favor and I hope that the
$100 will go to great use towards your
setup if you do end up winning thank you
and good luck for one disaster to
another at number two we got Bryce with
a solid dual monitor setup talk about
moving on up he's rocking at gateway
1520 VGA monitor that's being powered by
D del and spire on 17 or laptop but it
doesn't even stop there baller Bryce OH
has an 11-inch MacBook Air off to the
right side weather actually works is
irrelevant at this point he doesn't have
a keyboard which means that he's using a
laptop but his chair is in front of the
gateway monitor which confuses the hell
out of me because he has to reach over
to the laptop keyboard in order to type
something and then look over at the
other monitor I also noticed that the
mouse is in an awkward location as well
I really hope that he put the laptop
there just to take pictures for the show
because this is definitely not
comfortable he does have a few audio
devices the iHome speaker under the
laptop and a pair of JVC headphones I
love that he used a few books and a flat
piece of wood to hold up the laptop
Sally the cable management is the best
part about this setup I mean everything
else is lacking aesthetics and
ergonomics but Thank You Bryce for
entering and I wish you good luck coming
in at number 3 is Nick and a beautiful
black and brown setup it's almost as if
he was going with a nature theme with
those wooden nightstands just gorgeous
using the Dell Vostro laptop and unlike
the previous contestant Nick actually
hooked up a separate keyboard and mouse
to it although it's in an awkward
position this leads me to believe that
this is fake because there is no way
that someone can actually sit
comfortably at this setup it just feels
like Nick grabbed his laptop and
keyboard and found a place in his living
room and place them on the nightstands
guys it's very easy to spot a fake setup
but that's the best part of our setup
boards because you guys get to vote and
these clowns can't fool you it's also
really hard finding good quality
pictures for the worst setup edition so
I'm forced to pick these types of setups
instead
but anyways nice try and make better
luck next time Oh fakers next up with a
more believable setup although does look
like the most uncomfortable setup I've
ever seen I mean how the hell does this
guy use his mouse seriously there's like
no room on that dresser maybe it's fake
but I don't know at this point I give up
and it's up to you guys to decide I mean
if you can afford a nice bed like that
then why can't you buy a decent desk for
your setup but anyways I digress I will
give them some props for keeping
consistent would be black and blue
themed the blue drawer is matching with
the blue trash
can and we even got the Blue Chair to
top it all off probably one of the best
color-coordinated worst setups I have
ever seen on the show Bravo the PC
powering this awful setup has an Intel
Core q 6600 which I've never even heard
about and it doesn't even have a
dedicated GPU cable management is
atrocious but that's to be expected but
my only concern about this set up is the
amount of space Oleg is working with
honestly there's just no room for that
Mouse it's not humanly possible
regardless thanks for entering and good
luck last but not least we have sub hand
with another very sketchy setup this is
literally a Dell laptop that someone
brought over to his living room and
placed it on a footrest I mean seriously
if your living room looks that good do
you honestly think that we are stupid
enough to fall for this fake setup sadly
I ran out of qualified contestants to
choose from which is why I had to throw
this crap in here but regardless you
guys get to vote like I keep saying so
that is it for this episode of set up
boards make sure you guys vote using the
link below because those are only votes
that I count since there is money
involved the person with the worst setup
will receive $100 I lost the winners on
my Twitter and Instagram accounts make
sure you follow me there if you guys
want I love your faces thank you for
watching I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
