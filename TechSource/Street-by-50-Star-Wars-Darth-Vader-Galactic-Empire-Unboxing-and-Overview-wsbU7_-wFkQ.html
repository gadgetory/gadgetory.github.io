unlocking company the fastest and most
affordable way to unlock your phone
what does that be guys they're here from
Texas and today we're gonna be looking
at the SMS audio Street by 50 headphones
this year is the first edition Star Wars
Darth Vader Galactic Empire theme and
there are a total of four themes you
could choose from which will cost you
200 a pop street buy 50 isn't a new line
of headphones from SMS audio this
product is more of a design overhaul
than anything they released this on May
4th which some of you know is the
unofficial Star Wars day and if you are
a big fan of the movies then this is
targeted at you however $200 is a pretty
steep price to pay for headphones so
let's unbox this and find out if it's
really worth the price the Box design is
very similar to that of the beats by dre
box it has the same material and even
has a magnetic lock so opening up the
flap we are greeted with some paperwork
on the right it seems like SMS audio
provided us with some cool stickers to
match the theme of the headphones along
with a certificate of authenticity which
has 50 Cent's signature right below and
lastly a 12 by 18 Star Wars poster which
you can proudly hang over your bed they
also included a microfiber cloth to wipe
off any unnecessary finger prints the
case looks pretty cool and feels really
sturdy so you can definitely depend on
it to keep your headphones safe the
colors of the case the poster and even a
microfiber cloth rely on what headphone
theme you decide to go with also inside
the case is the removable cable although
you can't control the volume with the
cable it does have a built-in microphone
for answering calls for $200 I expected
some high quality materials but instead
you get plastic there really isn't
anything striking when looking at these
headphones have had one word to describe
them it would be simplistic I mean I'm
not impressed with the material at all
it feels really flimsy and cheap
although SMS did mention that their
headphones are supposed to be flexible
but I feel as if it can be broken really
easily there is a difference between
flexibility and quality the cushions are
soft and the fact that most of the
headband is made out of plastic it's
super light so the comfort level is
pretty high after a few minutes you can
completely forget you are wearing the
headphones and since these are on your
headphones the noise isolation isn't
quite there likely over the ear
headphones which are made to do
stat the sound quality is definitely
there you get a nice bass boost to your
music and it's not overdone like some
other headphones however the sound leak
on these are pretty bad even with the
volume halfway up people around you can
hear what you're listening to the band
is adjustable and you can fold the
earpieces so you can store it in the
carrying case then again what headphone
isn't these days my final opinion well
if you're a die-hard Star Wars fan that
likes to collect merchandise or has a
lot of money lying around then I'll say
why not go for it
for everyone else I'll say pass these
are overpriced headphones at best but
that's just my opinion I'm more
interested to hear what you guys think
so feel free to leave your thoughts in
the comment section down below as I will
be reading all of them if for whatever
reasons you guys decide to pick one up I
have left a link in the description
section down below and a quick reminder
if you are a patron of tech stores you
do get five percent off the headphones
and you can click here to find out more
anyways I hope you guys enjoy the video
if so please leave a like if you didn't
leave a dislike and let me know why and

videos coming up soon this is at
