and in this video I get to talk to you
about Intel obtain memory until sent me
this dope Alienware Aurora r7 so I could
show off how Intel obtained memory works
and how it benefits your PC's
performance it may not be the most
aesthetically pleasing PC but it's sure
packing some power it's equipped with
the i7 8700 6 core processor along with
16 gigs of RAM a gtx 1070 and a 2
terabyte hard drive that's combined with
the intel obtain memory module so what
exactly is it well as a system
accelerator Intel obtained memory
basically makes your PC perform like an
SSD based device for example it can make
your everyday tasks twice as responsive
you can launch web browsers up to five
times faster start games up to 67%
faster and overall make your system
performance up to 28 percent faster
imagine having an SSD like speed with
the capacity of a hard drive so what if
you're going with a dual drive system
you know when you have your SSD as your
main drive and then you have an extra
hard drive basically for mass storage
well not only are you adding more
devices to your PC but you're going to
be spending more money that way you
don't really need an extra SSD because
the Intel optin memory acts as a bridge
between your processor and your hard
drive speeding up access and helping to
prioritize tasks in short it makes the
small SSD unnecessary okay so what tasks
are affected by Intel obtain memory and
do you really see difference in
real-life tasks well based on my
previous benchmarks you guys can see
that the speeds are very similar and in
some instances the update memory
combined with the hard drive is actually
faster than a traditional SSD setup but
the main takeaway here is that we're
getting s as these speeds but we're
actually paying less for it a simple
task like booting or restarting a PC is
also affected and I was curious to see
how long it would take the Alienware
Aurora r7 to boot up using obtain memory
all right so around 18 seconds from
pressing the power button that's
actually pretty fast and comparing it to
an SSD it's not that far off I'm sure it
would have taken over 20 seconds on a
tradition
a hard drive searching files within
windows is also up to three times faster
on Intel obtain memory basically letting
you find and access files faster I
misplace files constantly because I have
way too many folders that hold my setup
or submissions and all the footage I
shoot for my YouTube video so it's nice
to be able to look them up quickly that
way it doesn't waste any additional time
from creating content a speed of
creating content Vegas Pro 15 which is
my editing program currently has also
gone faster not just by launching the
program but also by loading save
projects and importing a bunch of other
files
have you tried transferring 5k raw files
from a red camera let me tell you guys
it takes a while but thanks to Intel
obtain memory I don't have to wait as
long because of its ability to
prioritize my most used tasks editing is
all about the workflow the smoother the
process is the faster I can get done
with a project and move on to the next I
switch between applications a lot
whether it's to look up background music
for my projects or finding images to
include in my videos so it's nice that
everyday tasks have up to two times
faster responsiveness and finally the
most noticeable difference coming from a
hard drive is gaming with Intel obtain
memory your PC can boot games up to 67%
faster as well as load games faster one
of the games I play a lot on my PC is
pop G and typically this takes around 20
seconds to load from my personal PC
which is running games on a hard drive
however with the opt in memory we can
see that it only takes a little over 10
seconds to launch
combining the Intel obtain memory module
with the hard drive is the preferred
route for anyone that is looking for
large storage space and SSD speeds while
also being on a tight budget huge thanks
to Intel for sending over the Alienware
Aurora r7 and giving me the chance to
check out Intel obtain memory if you
guys want to check out the Beast PC or
the Intel obtained memory module I'll
drop a link to both of them down below
as always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
