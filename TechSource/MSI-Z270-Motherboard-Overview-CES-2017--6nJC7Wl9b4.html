sponsoring our trip to CES 2017 if
you're looking to spice up your device
with the best skins out there then the
brand is where it's at not only do they
provide the most precise fit out there
but they offer a variety of colors and
materials to choose from for tons of
products out there if you guys are
interested in spicing up your device
make sure to visit them by clicking on
the link below what's up guys it's ed
from tech source and I'm here at the MSI
booth at CES where they unveiled a new
lineup of motherboards for Intel seventh
gen CPUs but see too much to go over in
a single video so expect some more
reviews on the channel in a few months
so there are four different categories
of motherboards the enthusiast which is
their top of the line high end boards
with all the bells and whistles which is
perfect for water cooling SLI and just
pushing your system to its limits then
you got the performance gaming series
which is a step down but still offers
most of the features you would find from
the enthusiast series and then you have
the arsenal which is what most people
might be interested in it won't break
the bank but will offer gamers all the
essential features to build a powerful
rig then you have the pro series which
are for productivity and gaming as well
maybe you want the best of both worlds
and don't want to compromise well the
pro series will do just that I'm
definitely loving MSI's new motherboard
design I think they were aiming for more
of a futuristic look with an aggressive
heat shield design some might not like
it but personally I'm a big fan it
features RGB lighting of course so you
don't have to settle down with a
specific color scheme and features the
new m dot to shield which is basically a
steel plate that covers the m2 SSD
preventing it from overheating which can
reduce performance another awesome
feature of the gaming m7 is their audio
boost for pro which has two dedicated
audio processors for better sound this
essentially eliminates the need of
adding a sound board like I said earlier
the enthusiast boards are for people who
demand the best of the best with no
compromises if an all black PCB isn't
your thing they also have the X power
gaming titanium which has an all-white
PCB and black and white heat spreaders
absolutely stunning and perfect for a
white and black or even silver build z2
70 gaming pro carbon from their arsenal
lineup is more for mainstream gamers
since it won't destroy your wallet but
it will still give you most of the
features you expect for a gaming PC
without much compromise you still get us
a life support
RGB lighting and I'm not to shield with
steel armor reinforced PCI slots as well
I also like the old black PCB with
carbon-fiber accents on the heat
spreaders you guys know that I'm a huge
fan of carbon fibre so this is actually
something I would put in my own personal
build as I mentioned before if you guys
want to see some of these motherboards
in action be sure to hit that subscribe
button so you don't miss out and if you
want to check out their motherboards
I'll have it linked down below thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
