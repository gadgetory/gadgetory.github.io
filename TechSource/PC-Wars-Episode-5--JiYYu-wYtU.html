then we have 2 AMD r9 290x graphics
cards 16 gigabytes of g.skill RAM and
water cooling parts from ek I don't see
many water cooling builds in the H 440
case so coming across one is always a
pleasant surprise
I'm loving the black plates and the
custom red cables from PC CG it's
interesting that you went with red
cables for this build but I gotta say it
does add some spice to it
cable management is also really clean
job well done and for benchmarks the mk2
scored a 17,000 138 putting it way up
there and pretty hard to beat definitely
a strong start for this episode of PC
Wars eval o is next up with his black
and blue baby inside he define R for
case an i7 3770 paired with two asus r9
290 s and crossfire we also have sixteen
gigabytes of kingston ram and a fractal
design Kelvin s 24 as the CPU cooler
great work with color coordination and
cable management definitely a
good-looking PC no doubt for benchmarks
that scored a 14,315 putting it in
second place at number three we have jim
with his project be a blue black and
white build inside the case labs sm8
case we have a 4790k overclocked 24.8
with two gtx 780 s we also have eight
gigabytes of ram from kingston and water
cooling parts from ek yet again some of
the mods include custom painted fan
rings from Corsair GPU engravings a
painted sli bridge cover and the custom
blue acrylic floor for benchmarks that
scored a 16,000 219 putting it in second
place for this episode next up is Jose

water-cooled build but this time inside
the
a 540 case a 49 30 K clock to four point
six and we have two GTX 780 Ti
superclocked Edition and SLI and 32
gigabytes of RAM from Corsair
water-cooling parts from ek as always
along with some mods that include a
painted as a lie bridge painted SSDs and
even part of the case is painted red
keel management is clean and it's scored
in eighteen thousand six hundred twenty
seven which puts this beast up top at
the number one spot for this episode
last but not least we have Marcus and
his black and blue build Ayana which has
a forty six ninety and a GTX 970 the PC
also has eight petabytes of RAM from G
scale and a cooler master 212 Evo to
keep things cool it scored a 97 36 on
