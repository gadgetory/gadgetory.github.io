welcome back to another episode of
what's in the box it has been ages I
don't even know how long it's been since
I've done one of these videos and Lobby
hasn't been requesting it so if this
does well I will revive the series and
will continue to do this on the channel
but you guys know the drill I'm gonna
box stuff starting from the smallest box
and move our way up to I took a lot of
energy I'm still out of shape okay
alright what that said yeah let's uh
let's start off with the small boxes and
then move our way up to the large boxes
alright let's do this first box is
coming from
looks like Taipei alright let's check
this box out I'm normally not this out
of shape guys I apologize I don't know
why that took so much energy for me
where do we get today we have an empty
box ladies and gentlemen this is the
first okay oh so we got two things in
this box open this up real quick
I'm guessing this was used as padding
now that makes sense
alright so inside here we have looks
like a thread Ripper processor so this
is the thread Ripper 1950 x16 core 32
thread CPU which is gonna be going in a
very special water-cooled build put this
aside and we've got some RAM 32 gigs at
2400 mega Hertz this is from jail these
are Gayle or jail I don't know how you
say that these are GB RAM sticks
compatible with the Asus are a sting
let's pop this open take a closer look
Isis oh this is open also okay not bad
looking RAM sticks I gotta say I'm glad
that they stuck with the neutral black
color scheme so there's actually a cool
little setup I can just throw in RAM
sticks in here and kind of get a preview
of what it would look like in a build
but these are some pretty sweet RGB RAM
sticks and I love how the color is
evenly distributed from one side to the
other I don't even see any hot spots so
yeah very excited to put this in a build
coming up soon guys next up let's open
up these envelopes actually let's start
easiest
so what are this from new egg this is a
tea forest Vulcan 16 gigs at 3000
megahertz and this is going to the
highly anticipated $1,000 PC which I'm
actually gonna be shooting tomorrow it's
gonna have a build guide and it's gonna
be featuring its r5 2600 with the r-tx
2070 fool build guide overclocking
tutorial for the CPU and GPU installing
windows drivers and all that so you guys
don't want to miss out it's gonna be a
beast build I was actually shopping on
Amazon and I came across these I was
looking for white SATA cables because
this is going in the new big red I'm
rebuilding my PC back at home I'm gonna
give it the r-tx treatment it's gonna be
water-cooled it's gonna be epic and I
was looking for some way to see the
cables to go with it so I picked up to
form Amazon hair clipper blade oil yeah
this was a personal purchase but yeah we
might open packages that I ordered for
myself I do my best to try and separate
that from actual like tech but sometimes
it gets too okay this right here ladies
and gentleman is very hard to find this
is the hyper 212 black edition it's
pretty much sold out everywhere this is
going in the $1,000 PC build guide which
is happening tomorrow yeah in case you
guys haven't noticed the theme of the
build is gonna be mostly black and this
is gonna do a good job cooling the r5
2600 because we're gonna be overclocking
it I'm not even looking at where these
boxes are coming from I'm just gonna
open it up was there like a dying
vulture sign what the hell was that all
right so this is from Nvidia oh my god
ladies and gentlemen let me introduce
you to the second RTX 28 ET i with the
envy link obviously we're gonna be doing
an SLI build for big red you guys know
how it is
I don't need an extra 20 ATI for the
bill but I'm doing it because I gotta
stick with the theme I gotta stick with
the overkill theme here's the other
twenty atti
that was sent to me by Nvidia IP guys
notice that the color of the box is
different I don't know why the packaging
is different but let's open it up shall
we
actually no I don't open it up I'm gonna
open it up in the time-lapse video I
think that will be even more epic this
GPU has been sitting in the back shelf
since it launched I'm sure you guys have
seen it and like all my videos I've had
a chance to play with it
or kiss it or use it in a build but
those the time guys know is the time
finally I get to use these beauties in
the new big red build big red version 3
I think that's what it is but anyways
coming up very soon guys it's gonna be
an epic water-cooled build you
definitely don't want to miss out
alright next up is from DHL it's got an
interesting rectangular shape my guess
would have to be a keyboard but I don't
remember ordering a keyboard or getting
a keyboard for review so let's check it
out
nonetheless anyway how are you guys
doing I haven't asked you how your day
is going my my apologies let me know how
your day is going if it's a weekend
how's your weekend going how's school
how's your day what are you eating are
you drinking tea right now what are you
doing let me know oh it is a keyboard
it's from kietryn key Tron ok
interesting packaging whoa look how thin
this keyboard is what is this oh whoa
this actually looks pretty damn cool are
those blue switches guys I think this is
a mechanical keyboard look how sleek
this is look how thin this is
Wow so this is a mechanical keyboard
with RGB lighting and it's wireless so
this keyboard supposed to last you
anywhere from 8 to 40 hours with RGB
lighting and it varies based on the
brightness and use case that's a big gap
8 to 40 hours ok not a bad-looking
keyboard guys I don't know if you would
be interested in a review of something
like this let me know in the comments
section I've been doing a lot of
keyboard reviews recently in case you
guys haven't noticed but this is this
has piqued my interest if enough of you
want a review on this in the comment
section I will do a review on this but
this looks pretty interesting I feel
like this would fit perfectly in a
minimalistic setup but yeah let me know
guys let me know in the comment section
moving on ok so this is the motherboard
that's going in the thousand dollar PC
build guide that I'm working on tomorrow
this is the MSI B 450 tomahawk I've used
this motherboard so many times in
previous builds and I keep coming back
to it because of the price the
reliability and the features it's got
four dimm slots RGB lighting and I just
love the support for overclocking oh I
already know what this one is just
because of how heavy it is
so this is the Corsair 8 X 1600 I the
beefiest power supply and I'm sure you
guys already know where this is going
it's gonna be going in big red version 3
because not only gonna be overclocking
the 79 80 XD which is a 16 core
processor but going to be overclocking
both r-tx GPUs we're gonna be pushing
the system to its limits and it's gonna
need all the juice it can possibly get
so yeah
can't wait alright guys we've got three
more boxes to go let me know if you guys
aren't enjoying the show by just
dropping a like and if you're bored out
of your mind you know what to do leave
your dislike and your constructive
criticism in the comment section as
always oh speaking of r-tx
we've got another one I would he mention
this before this is the RT X 2070 that's
going in the thousand dollar PC build
guide that I'm working on tomorrow it's
from EVGA this is the XC ultra and
believe it or not this is actually half
the cost of the entire build the build
is $1,000 this GPU is 500 well yeah the
plan of the build is bang for your buck
to give you the best performance
possible by spending only $1,000 and
this right here is the MVP all right we
got one from Amazon see what we got oh
okay again we got the rest of the parts
for the build guide for tomorrow this is
the rise in 520 600 like I said and we
even picked up some fans from Roseville
guys these are probably the best value
right now online for fans
I forgot the price one second for fans
but
you get four 120-millimeter fans for $14
that is a steal
and these offer great airflow and
they're really quiet one of the
highest-rated on Amazon check it out if
you guys want I'll drop a link below but
I know they're kidding though right they
literally just give me four screws they
only gave me four screws for four fans
why do they expect me to use one screw
on each fan like what yeah me you Amazon
all right I'm gonna have to contact the
support all right guys
last but not least alright this one I
already know what it is because it's the
only piece that's missing
what is something something went wrong
oh my god
I don't okay I don't know what happened
here exactly but there's another r-tx
2070 sent from EVGA this is the Black
Edition I think actually this is the one
that's supposed to be going for five
hundred dollars I don't know what this
one is that is weird okay anyways and
yeah this is the power supply that is
going in the build six hundred watt
bronze certified power supply from EVGA
and that wraps up this unboxing episode
if you guys enjoyed it and want me to
continue doing these on the channel let
me know by dropping a like and if you
guys didn't enjoy it
feel free to dislike as well I'll drop a
link to everything unboxed in this video
down below and make sure you guys are
subscribed because I have some epic
builds coming up that you don't want to
miss out especially with these two
beauties right over here ah anyways
