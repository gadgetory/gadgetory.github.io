unlocking company the fastest and most
affordable way to unlock your phone what
is up you guys it's ed from tech source
and it's finally time we have done an
ultimate PC one and two and now it's
time for the ultimate PC number three
aka big red I'm not exaggerating when I
say that this PC is going to be
something you have never seen before
this video is part of a series which
includes four videos the unboxing
portion which you are watching now the
build process the cinematic reveal of
big red and finally the benchmarks and
gaming all the parts I mentioned in this
video will be listed in the description
section and the same order as they
appear for those of you that are
interested so without wasting any more
time let's go through all the parts
starting with the case it was a
no-brainer that I had to go with the
NZXT h 440 case I have not seen anything
as sleek as this and it has the color
theme that I am going for which is black
and red what I love about this case is
not only is it a silent case but the
fact that it's super clean the bottom
portion covers your power supply it has
two spots for SSDs which is exactly the
number of SSDs that I'm going to install
and there are no optical drive bays in
the front to take up any space I'm
pretty confident that my build is going
to work so well with this case what
makes the case soundproof are these
foams that are installed on each of the
panels up top you have your usual ports
you have your headset your microphone
two USB 3.0 ports followed by two
regular USB 2.0 s and then right next to
that is the power button and the reset
button those of you that saw our
ultimate PC number two should be
familiar with this case since it was the
exact same model but instead it was
white okay so moving onto the
motherboard currently the best and
overkill motherboard money can buy the
Asus Rampage 4 Black Edition once again
it works so well with my theme so
choosing this was really easy it has a
ton of features including built-in Wi-Fi
and an overclocking command center which
requires an optical bait to utilize but
I wasn't going to use it anyways to keep
my build clean regardless I am still
going to overclock my CPU using
Asus intelligence software program once
everything is put together now at this
point I'm sure most of you notice that
this is an extended ATX motherboard and
it is currently not compatible with the
NZXT case as it is written on their
website
well I really wanted this to work out so
I got the motherboard anyways and made
some modifications to make it work with
my case and you can see what we did in
the next video which is the build
process if you guys are interested for
the CPU nothing beats Intel so I went
with the core i7 4930 K I didn't go with
the 49 60 X because for the marginal
performance difference it has a larger
gap in price and it doesn't make sense
to spend more money for something so
small I have been very happy with Intel
ever since I switched from AMD and like
I said before I am going to overclock
this bad boy to at least four point five
gigahertz anyways moving on to the next
component the graphics card I went with
not one but two gtx 780 Ti is because
I'm going to use this PC equally for
gaming and 4k editing I have a lot of
confidence that these two cards will
bring me happiness now you may be
thinking that this graphics card has
horrible colors and doesn't go well with
your theme you had in mind well you're
damn right I'm gonna custom paint the
graphics card to my liking which will
also be in the next video in addition to
the graphics cards I've also purchased
two awesome black EVGA back plates for
the graphics card I have seriously
considered painting these red but later
realized that there will be just too
much red in the case and that I want to
balance everything equally so I will be
leaving these black now on to storages I
have decided to ditch the hard drives
altogether and go with a PCI Express SSD
which has faster speeds than a regular
SSD we are talking 800 plus read and
write speeds now I went with 240
gigabytes because this is only going to
be used for my operating system plus a
few of my favorite games that I play
constantly not to mention my editing
software sony vegas pro 13 to really
take advantage of the speeds I also got
it because well I mean look at it it
looks badass and it has my color theme
that I'm going for so overall a really
solid choice for my main storage now for
my secondary storages I went with to 240
gigabytes of Samsung 840 pros and I'm
going to run these in raid 0 to get the
extra boost
speeds and also to combine both into one
large storage unit believe it or not I
don't use that much space I get I think
in my entire life I've never used more
than 200 gigabytes of space at any given
time
most of my files I store online via
Dropbox and the stuff I don't use I just
delete like movies I have already seen
or games that I already beat and such I
keep my files organized and clutter free
and these two SSDs are going to be
plenty for me I don't like the silver
that's around the SSDs years so I am
going to custom paint these as well to
match my theme since my PC is going to
be a silent build I had to go with one
of the best closed-loop coolers money
can buy the h100 AI is the most popular
choice for most gamers and it does the
job really well I don't like the fact
that it has all black so I am planning
on adding some red to it somehow since I
will be doing a lot of editing I had to
go with 32 gigabytes of course tears
dominated platinum Ram sticks with a
speed of 21 33 megahertz these will
definitely be useful for 4k editing even
though it's overkill for gaming once
again the silver bars have to go so I
will be removing the top bars and paying
them red to match my team going with a
custom build I had to ditch the stock
fans so for the pressure fans on my
cooler I went with to 120 millimeters
static pressure fans and for my rear
outtake I went with the 140 millimeter
airflow fan both from coarser of course
I went with these mainly because you can
swap the ring on it to match your theme
so that was a huge plus and of course it
was from corsair a brand that everyone
can trust so to power all of these beast
parts I went with the ax 1200 I power
supply you can't go wrong with the ax I
series fully modular giving you the
complete control of what to connect 1200
watts is definitely an overkill for this
build but I did get it to future-proof
my PC it does come with a bunch of
cables but I set the hell with those and
brought in my custom red cables which
are also from Corsair
so to paint all the custom parts I
mentioned in this video I picked up high
heat resistant paint from dupli-color
it's important that you choose the
correct type of paint so you don't end
up damaging your parts
this particular paint can withstand
temperatures of up to 500 degrees whoo
it should be more than enough for the PC
build in order to modify a few of the
parts before painting I had to grab some
sandpaper so I went with the 3m
blaster Pro the reason why I went with a
sponge type sandpaper is because it's
going to be a lot easier to handle
compared to the flat type some
additional accessories I picked up were
a sleeved led kit from NZXT and I plan
on wiring this along the side of my case
to give it that extra zing I also picked
up two red SATA cables for my SSDs from
BitFenix I really think that these minor
additions will really clean up the build
nicely and I can't wait to show you guys
the result to complete the build I
picked up some peripherals from Corsair
which include a k70 keyboard and the
m-40 mouse so that is it for the part
selection of this video these are the
parts I went with and I want to hear
your opinion on them is there some parts
that you guys would have changed let me
know in the comment section down below
all the parts are listed in the
description section in the order they
appeared for those of you that are
interested and I make sure you guys
stick around for the next few videos you
don't want to miss them this is that
from tech source and I will see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
