at another awesome case for the galaxy
s5 this is called the ghost tech bullet
and it comes in a variety of colors that
you can choose from so the case is outer
shell is made out of high-density
polycarbonate material which protects
the phone from damages if it were to
fall the phone is also protected inside
the case from impacts with this rubber
material around the phone installation
is quite simple all you have to do is
remove the top piece and insert your
phone inside the rubber casing and put
back the top piece and then you're done
now going around the phone we can see
the power button is covered in the same
soft touch TPU material which makes
pressing the buttons really easy on the
opposite side it has the same thing for
the volume buttons and on the bottom
there are cutouts for the charging port
and looking at the top there are
openings for the headphone jack ir
blaster and the microphone a really neat
feature that comes with the case is the
kickstand clip located on the back which
is always a plus to have with any
smartphone now what makes the ghost tech
bullets so awesome is that they really
put that into making their cases the
cutouts are cut to precision they make
sure you have plenty of clearance to
access ports and the most important one
of them all is not altering the
experience of the phone the buttons are
super easy to press and I don't feel the
need to apply extra force it is really a
pet p for me when it comes to cases i
find that it is always a compromise you
gain some benefits while losing some
well with the ghost tech bullet case you
keep your phone as is while adding
protection and some cool features
anyways if you guys are looking for a
simple protective case on the 20 bucks
then i strongly recommend you check out
the ghost tech bullet i will leave links
in the description section if you guys
are interested in checking them out this
is at from Texas and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
