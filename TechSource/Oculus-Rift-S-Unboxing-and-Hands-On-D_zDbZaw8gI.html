this video we're gonna be taking a look
at the new vr gaming headset from oculus
this is the oculus rift s and they sent
us over and sponsored a video so we're
gonna go to unbox this set it up and
take it for a test drive we're gonna be
playing robo recall which is a free game
and it's actually very popular a lot of
people have been playing it and we're
gonna play it on none other than my
newly built pc big red which is sitting
back there it took a while to build that
guys but the time-lapse video is up on
the channel in case you missed it i'll
drop a link to it down below yeah what
that said let's unbox this alright let's
slide this off oh that was fairly simple
okay so it looks like we've got the
headset itself this is actually Wow
really light and two controllers inside
here we've got a set of two double-a
batteries the set-up guide manual and a
mini display two full-sized DisplayPort
adapter so one of the first things you
guys probably noticed is that there are
no external sensors that's one of the
cool things about the oculus rift as you
no longer need to have two or three
external sensors set up in the room all
the sensors are actually built on the
headset itself the oculus rift s uses
all the cameras around it to basically
figure out where you're standing and
what you're doing so yeah the setup
process is gonna be a lot easier so it
looks like there's one cable it comes
out of the headset and splits into a USB
3 cable and a display port cable which
plugs directly into your PC and this is
actually a lot cleaner and more simple
than previous VR headsets you no longer
have to plug it in to an external box
and then have that plugged into your PC
so kudos to oculus so headset has been
improved and that was running on a 2560
by 1440 P LCD screen at 80 Hertz
it's got improved optics which is going
to deliver bright vivid colors and it's
supposed to reduce that screen door
effect that we always see on VR headsets
come with built-in speakers however if
you want to plug in your own headset or
earphones then you can do so by using
the headphone jack located on the left
side here
obviously not all headphones will fit
with the headset because of the size of
the ear cups so I do recommend using
something smaller like earphones for
example so they built this headset with
speed in mind they basically want you to
put this on and start gaming as soon as
possible so they made the old
adjustments very convenient there's a
knob in the back here which lets you we
track the headband there's obviously a
strap on the top in case you have a big
head and there's one button on the
bottom here which brings the entire
headband
forward or back so yeah it's super
simple to adjust that and these are the
new controllers these are so tiny and so
light like I'm not even oh I think
you're supposed to put the battery in
here actually maybe I'll add some weight
to it
so this part of the grip slides down
just like this and this is where you
insert the battery pop this back on and
you're good to go now obviously this
means that you can't charge your
controllers which is something I prefer
because of convenience instead of having
to go out and buy new batteries but at
the same time if you're in the middle of
a game and then the controllers die you
can easily pop in a battery and you're
good to go you don't have to put this on
a charging dock and let it juice up but
anyways I'm done blabbing let's set this
up and test it out so after following a
few simple prompts on the screen the
setup is complete and now have the
oculus rift s hooked up to my PC current
specs we've got the 79 80 X C 18 core
processor at 4.5 gigahertz 64 gigs of
ram at 3600 megahertz and of course to
our TX 28 EP is in sli is it overkill
for VR gaming absolutely it is you guys
don't need high-end specs to run the
oculus rift is actually all you really
need is a GTX 1060 or equivalent or
higher and again all the minimum
requirements will be posted below if you
guys want to check it out but so we got
the game Robo recall installed let's
boot it up and take it for a test drive
alright wow this game looks really good
actually like the environment is so
detailed
whoa whoa is that a bullet that was that
was pretty sick it was like matrix
I think of matrix met an FPS game that's
pretty safe
Wow you can grab bullets too Oh
what that was sick
okay I'm digging this game I'm digging
it
hottest levels huge look at the detail
on the cars though I'm not even kidding
guys the detail on this game is
top-notch
Wow they're like reflections in the
mirror that's crazy the responsiveness
on these controllers are really good
look how great the physics is guys you
can't even see the clip on this gun that
is crazy look at that Wow the physics
are definitely next level
I'd love a accurate these controllers
are not only there's a register every
single trigger or button press
immediately but it knows exactly what
angle I'm holding my guns at I've never
seen this level accuracy before oh that
is so dope you can bounce the gun off
them and then reload it that's sick this
is sick
are you kidding me that punch what does
this do oh my god this is sick go get
some babies okay so a few things I
noticed while playing with the rift s
first of all amazing graphics obviously
the higher resolution with the 80 Hertz
of fresh rate really made a difference
everything just looks so much more crisp
the fact that the controllers and the
headset are so light makes it that much
more easier to move around especially in
games like well what we call wear reflex
is everything it really does make it
that much more enjoyable to play the
controllers are really responsive and
not only that but the sensors capture
every movement I make precisely for
example if I'm aiming at a certain angle
or moving at a certain speed it knows
that and I feel like that's why the
physics of the game is so realistic so
yeah guys my final thoughts on the
oculus rift as if I have to sum
everything up and once
I would say that I've never had this
much fun on a br gaming headset I feel
like we're getting a more refined vr
gaming experience compared to the others
no external sensors to set up in
electric cables to plug in and just
overall a much easier set up process to
get up and running I personally think
that this would be the perfect VR system
on the go as well all you have to really
take with you is just your headset and
your controllers if you're going your
friends house so you can use their PC or
you can bring your laptop or portable
system as well and that's pretty much it
for my video I hope you guys enjoyed it
tossing a like will let me know and if
you didn't you guys know what to do I'll
drop a link to the oculus rift s below
if you guys want to check it out thanks
so much for watching as always I will
see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
