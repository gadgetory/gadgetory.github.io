ultra wide monitors more and more people
are converting their multi-monitor setup
to a single ultra ride I've done it a
few years ago and never looked back
since
LG has also been improving their ultra
wide monitors and this year we have two
different models the 38 you see 99 which
is the one I'm reviewing in this video
and the UC 79 GB that's aimed more
towards gamers with its 144 Hertz
refresh rate and low cost but if you
guys want me to grab the gaming version
as well and do a video on it then be
sure to hit that like button so this is
a 38 inch ultra wide curved monitor with
an IPS display and no I'm not joking I
did say 38 inches that's equivalent to
three 16 by 9 1080p monitors
side-by-side here's what it looks like
compared to the last year's model the 34
you see 98 even though it doesn't look
much bigger side-by-side I can
definitely tell you it's much more
noticeable in person it's been much like
having a small curved TV right in front
of you it took me a few days to get used
to the size but all I can say to LG is
please do not go any bigger
I feel like 38 inches is the maximum for
any single display of course with the
size boost comes more pixels up from
their previous 34 40 by 1440p up to 38
40 by 1600 needless to say you have more
room to work with
here's a quick sample between both
resolutions so this year is a 38 40 by
1600 and here is the 34 40 by 1440p
that's a much more real estate you are
given with their new monitor as far as
color reproduction I honestly cannot see
the difference between the two the
previous version had an amazing display
so I feel like they kept it after all
why change things that work it's still
the same vibrant colors with amazing
viewing angles and of course srgb over
99% in terms of design not much as
changed also the back cover is made out
of plastic and so is the base however if
those have this brushed aluminum look I
do love the consistency of the
glass for both the neck and the back of
the monitor and what's interesting is
that the stand is compatible with their
previous model as well of course it's
optional because the monitor is VESA
compatible as you can already tell but
if you decide to use the stand then you
would be pleased to find that it is
height adjustable up to 110 meters as
well as 5 to 15 degrees of tilt just
like before take a look at the back is
where you will find all of the ports we
have one USB type-c one DisplayPort 1.2
two HDMI is one headphone jack and two
USB 3.0 which by the way are both quick
charge capable something that LG has
improved from the previous version is
their speakers now I know a lot of
people myself included don't use the
speakers on the monitors but for those
of you who do I think you would be
impressed LG is calling it their rich
base and it features 210 watt drivers
compared to their previous seven and
here's the difference in sound quality
obviously it's not going to sound better
than actual desktop speakers but for
being built in the monitor they are
pretty damn good what's also interesting
is that you can connect any Bluetooth
device to the speakers and output the
sound directly from the monitor I'm not
really sure who will use that feature
but it's there anyways accessing the
menu is done by the joystick which is
located on the bottom between the
speakers and within the menu you have
access to the quick settings that give
you the option to change the brightness
contrast and screen off which will only
turn off the screen but will continue to
output the sound then you have input so
in here you can change the aspect ratio
from full 21 by 9 to original which is
16 by 9 and then you have to cinema
modes which lets you watch content and
21 by 9 full screen with caption the
picture setting gives you access to
change the colors but I find the default
setting to be calibrated perfectly with
the most accurate colors sound is pretty
self-explanatory and then we have
general which will give you some
additional options for example enabling
the quick charge feature so what does
content look like on a 21 by 9 monitor
that isn't made in 21 by 9
for example YouTube videos well just
like before you get black borders on
both sides however this time they are
much wider watching movies or videos
however and 21 by 9 is always a treat
and I definitely feel like I get a more
immersive experience since it's a much
larger monitor productivity has also
been affected from the resolution bump
since I'm only using one monitor I can
definitely use all the horizontal and
vertical pixels I can get and because of
this I was able to add two extra time
lines near the bottom which will help a
lot when it comes to editing gaming is
also fun in 21 by 9 again going back to
the whole immersive experience even some
console games are starting to support 21
by 9 like the new Ratchet and Clank on
ps4 the you c99 does feature a virtual 1
millisecond response time with motion
blur reduction and 75 Hertz refresh rate
however the 75 Hertz is only available
with the DisplayPort and free sync
enabled which is kind of a drawback on
the monitor since most people use NVIDIA
GPUs for people that use AMD cards it's
great but for the rest of us we only get
60 Hertz then again this monitor wasn't
made for hardcore gamers
Stud it's aimed at casual gamers and
productivity being the main focus as I
mentioned in the beginning of this video
that you see 97g
is the one that's aimed mainly for
gamers so to sum it up LG has done it
again by creating another amazing
ultrawide monitor by addressing some of
the issues from their previous lineup
the backlight bleed is very minimal and
much improved from last year as well as
an issue with image footprints which
I've experienced on the UC 98 this is
where a faint copy of an image is left
over on the screen after moving the
original I'm glad to report that the you
see 99 does not experience this at least
my model doesn't the only other gripe I
have with this monitor is the price it's
pretty steep and I get why I mean does
come with a bunch of features but
personally if it were up to me I would
get rid of some features like the
built-in speakers quick charge USB
type-c and even free sync since there is
already another version aimed at gaming
dropping these features will
dramatically reduce the cost of
manufacturing which will then in return
reduce the price of the monitor if you
guys already own one of LG's previous
ultra Lite monitors then I don't think
it's worth it to make the upgrade
however if you're looking into getting
an ultra-wide then now is the best time
to make the switch but as I said before
this monitor is perfect for content
creators and it's also great for casual
gamers out there if you guys are
interested in checking it out I'll drop
a link to it down below and let me know
if you guys want me to review the gaming
version of this monitor by leaving a
like and letting me know in the comment
section below thanks so much for
watching as always I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
