and I will continue to do them every 10
episodes so your five lucky victims for
this week are all rally Oh Hudson Oscar
Toby and will
congratulations for making it on the
show so first up we have all rele o with
a single water setup featuring the
Logitech G 100 keyboard and a Lenovo
all-in-one mouse now I don't really know
what an all-in-one Mouse is but
apparently he has one the monitor is 17
inches and it's from LG with what
appears to be a dead vertical pixel from
the top to bottom I do have to give him
props where props are due this guy made
a PC out of a shoebox talk about budget
this little beast is running on a 47 70
and an r9 270 it also has 16 gigs of RAM
and a 2 terabyte storage from Seagate I
think I speak for a lot of people when I
say that the fan not being positioned
correctly is OCD enticing cable
management isn't the best and I'm not
really sure what a random power brick is
doing on the floor
picking up a channel raceway or cable
sleeve will definitely help you shape up
the cable management we also have some
miscellaneous things on the right side
it looks like you are collecting bottle
caps for some reason and you have an
iPod resting on a self-made stand if you
do win the hundred dollars I'm sure you
will make great use of it towards your
setup maybe work on getting better
parts on your PC first but thank you all
for entering now what's going to feature
Kellan in this episode but after looking
at the setup for a few seconds I
realized that this is a completely faked
setup I get a lot of people purposely
ruining their setups just to be featured
and this one is way too obvious I mean
you have stuff lying around on the
ground could you at least pick them up
before taking pictures to scroll home
Hudson is next up with a laptop setup so
he has the Acer Aspire 55 60 G hooked up
to a 22 inch monitor from HP and for the
gaming gear we have a cougar for 50 K
keyboard any Cobra II blue mouse what
after bad you can tell that the cable
management isn't the best you kind of
just let them hang off the nightstand
without properly routing them in the
back picking up some velcro straps along
the cable box will definitely help you
clean up that mess of it
I would also recommend that your
headphone hanger for your Plantronics
game con headset and maybe even some
cable drops to keep your charging cables
off of the ground not a terrible setup
though with some minor changes this can
definitely improve greatly Thank You
Hudson for entering okay so this next
set up is from oscar and it might be
faked
but after looking at it for a few more
times i came to the conclusion that it
actually might be real i mean this dude
has a spare mattress on the bottom of
his bed no bedsheets on top and even
spilled drinks on the floor if he did
fake this then he went through a lot of
trouble so I just decided to feature it
anyways but what do you guys think let
me know in the comments section I mean
if you can't afford bed sheets that I'm
pretty sure you can't afford a desk
to put your setup on but call me crazy
though does that look like a desk in the
corner over there alright so here's a
pro view 17 inch monitor with the
Microsoft wired keyboard and mouse and I
don't even know the specs of that PC
since you didn't list them but I think
we can all agree that he has a modded
custom cooling fan to keep the
temperatures low I'm not so sure about
the dinner plates around your setup also
why your PC isn't on but I think we've
seen enough damage on one set up Thank
You Oscar for entering Tobey is next up
with another interesting set up not
because there's a bunch of items on the
desk or some broken parts on his chair
but because of the speaker placements
they are pretty much grouped up together
we have one on top of the TV and a
subwoofer
on the desk which is kind of blocking
the TV my first advice would be to
obviously keep the subwoofer on the
ground where it belongs and advice to
would be to maybe keep the rest of the
items that you're not using in some sort
of a storage because you don't even have
space to move your mouse cable
management is pretty bad but what I find
hilarious is the power strip that's
dangling in the air also why do you need
two irons and two Xboxes I don't even
know if I would call this an actual set
up it's pretty much a table used to
store unused devices but good luck and
thank you Toby for entering last but not
least we have will he's rocking an HP
laptop with a Microsoft keyboard and
mouse combo with a pair of Ozlem mo6
headphones there may be a bunch of stuff
on his desk but at least most of them
are organized and they're not all over
the place the major ones that really
stick out though are the iPad Mini the
Bluetooth speaker and a notepad cable
management isn't the worst I've seen but
then again it can be improved by picking
up a cable box and some velcro straps
I'm also not sure what a flyswatter is
doing under your desk with those boxes
do you really need to put on insect
repellent inside your own home or is
that a different type of lotion disguise
than that bottle all jokes aside this is
one of the more cleaner setups I've seen
in this episode but thank you will for
entering as always guys there is a
strawpoll link down below make sure you
click on it and vote on who you think
has the worst setup and the person that
deserved $100 as always I'll announce
