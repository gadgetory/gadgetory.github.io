One m9 is sponsored by cell cashier com
they can pair iPhone prices on the
internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iPhone what's up
guys it's ed back again from tech source
and in this video I'm simply gonna give
you five reasons why the galaxy s6 sucks
now before you hit the dislike button
I'm not bashing the phone at all in fact
I think that the s6 is by far the best
smartphone currently out and this is
basically a video illustrating five
areas where the galaxy s6 is lacking and
could use some improvement again this is
my opinion and some of these reasons may
be irrelevant to you so to start things
off I'm gonna mention the obvious things
that bother me like the expansion slot a
lot of people may not end up using a lot
of space on their phone but I'm
certainly not one of them not only will
the price be lower but there'll also be
an option to expand up to an additional
128 gigabytes of space right now there
are 128 gigabyte SD cards that go for
around 50 bucks and I feel that this
would have been a much better option
this way I get as much space as I want
without paying a higher price for the
phone
waterproof capability would be reason
number two and one of the reasons why I
love my z3 so much is because I can take
it with me to the pool I like the
attention I get when I'm swimming with
my smartphone everyone looks at me like
I'm crazy but that's besides the point
the s5 was waterproof and I would have
very much like Samsung to have kept that
feature not only does it offer the phone
protection in the case that it comes in
contact with water but it's actually a
really nice feature to have for people
like me who enjoy the water reason
number three is the speaker quality
Samsung actually improved their speakers
from last year's model not only do they
bring the speaker from the back side to
the bottom of the phone but the sound
quality has also improved however it's
still not on the face of the phone
I prefer speakers to be on the front of
the device like how the m9 or the Xperia
z3 is and let me explain why when I hold
my phone I always hold it from the sides
when I'm playing games or even watching
videos or movies in my bed at night
right before I go to sleep well because
the speakers are located on the side of
the phone my fingers tend to block it
thus interfering with the audio quality
which is why I'm forced to wear my
earphones every time I play
and that just gets annoying really fast
and dynamic action sink reason number
two is the screen size again this is a
personal choice
I love the 1440p display as I mentioned
in my earlier videos I think that 2k is
overkill for a smartphone so the 1440
and 2560 resolution hits the spot and
it's a gorgeous display at that I just
wish Samsung made a larger display
version of their az6 now I'm not talking
about a six-inch screen like the Nexus 6
I would have loved to see a 5.4 even a
5.5 inch display like the iPhone 6 plus
I always thought that bigger screens
weren't comfortable and I started using
the six plus four over a week and I
absolutely loved it ever since then I
can't go back to a smaller screen so
that's another reason why I don't like
the s6 the last and final reason is
because of its UI it still TouchWiz and
despite it being 40% lighter I still
don't like the look and feel of it and
neither do a lot of people regardless of
everything else I said in the video I
would be using the galaxy s6 as my main
driver right now if it wasn't for the UI
and the screen size I really wish that
Samsung does a complete redesign of the
galaxy lineup but again that's just me
my all-time favorite Android skins
however starting at number one would be
the Xperia skin followed by the stock
Android and lastly the LG skin I would
have prefered either one of those
instead of TouchWiz and the galaxy s6
would have been my main driver oh and a
bigger screen of course anyways that's
it for the video those are my five
reasons why the galaxy s6 sucks let me
know what you guys think about my
reasons in the comments section down
below
more importantly what do you guys think

you don't like about the smartphone let
