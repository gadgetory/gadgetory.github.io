HTC One m9 or perhaps you're thinking of
upgrading from your m8 well this is that
from Texas and I'm going to give you
five reasons why you should hold off on
getting the HTC One m9 all right so
before I start this video I want you
guys to know that everything I say here
reflects to the HTC One m9 at this point
in time in the future there might be
updates to fix some of the problems that
I mentioned in this video so it's not 5
reasons you shouldn't buy the m9 it's
more of a 5 reasons why you should hold
off on buying the m9 so reason number 5
is that it's just too early in the
smartphone season to buy the m9 this was
the first flagship smartphone to be
released this year and there are plenty
of other options that might better suit
you there might be even a larger display
m9 there's also the g4 coming up the
galaxy s6 D flex 2 maybe we will see
phones from Sony and oneplus one mid
year so it's a really good reason to
weigh all your options instead of taking
a plunge and locking yourself into
another year or two years for some on
the smartphone you're going to regret
next reason I have has to do with it's
running temperatures now before it's bug
fix the m9 ran up to temperatures of
triple digits when running benchmarks
well even though that was fixed the
phone still gets hot after about half an
hour of use which is a lot warmer than
any smartphone that I have used before
so if you're a smartphone gamer and play
graphic intensive games like asphalt 8
daily then this is something you
definitely need to consider before
buying the m9 unless of course you are
planning on buying a case for it the
third reason is the design and I'm gonna
be picking on the m9 a little bit
because I feel like they didn't put in
enough effort and that they rush the
phone I mean the phone looks like an
exact replica of the m8 this phone
should have been the m8 S or something
equivalent really nothing has changed
from the design except the back and
slight changes to the curves it still
feels very 2014 if you ask me along with
the design I find that the display is
lacking as well I would have loved to
see a slightly bigger screen real estate
on the m9
and one of the ways they could have
achieved this was to make the bezels
slightly smaller now I know there has to
be space for the top and bottom for the
boomsound speakers but I'm sure they
could have made this happen I would have
even been happier to see a slightly
larger phone in order to achieve this
also while I'm a topic of displays they
kept the same display as last year a
1080p 441 pixel per inch LCD 3 screen
now I'm not asking for a 2 case since I
personally think it's overkill but at
least a screen with more pixels would
have been nicer the fourth reason not to
buy the m9 is because of its horrible
battery performance despite having a
larger battery than last year the m9 has
even worse battery life performance
according to foreign Arena the m8 will
give you approximately 7 hours and 12
minutes of typical real-life usage
whereas the m9 gives you only 6 hours
and 25 minutes on top of that the
battery benchmark tests I ran between
the m9 and m8 proved this to be true
with the m9 being drained hours before
the m8 when you buy a next version of a
phone you're supposed to be technically
upgrading not downgrading the fifth and
final reason not to upgrade and I'm sure
you guys already know what it is it's
the camera yes HTC has definitely gained
the spotlight for having a downgraded
camera I don't think there's been any
other company out there to achieve such
an accomplishment they got rid of their
dual camera and replaced it with a
single 20.7 megapixel camera with
horrendous low-light performance in my
camera comparison between both of the
phones the m8 actually did a much better
job than the m9 when it came to
low-light performance and it had better
stabilization as well the only thing the
m9 was good at was daytime pics and
selfies so there you have it my five
reasons why you shouldn't upgrade to the
m9 or should I say downgrade honestly
for the price performance there are a
lot of other amazing smartphones out
there that you can buy that will be
worth your money and just to name a few
we have the z3 the note 4 galaxy s6 1+1
and even the iPhone 6 are all great
options then the m9 currently anyways
let me know what you guys think about my
reasons if you agree leave a like if you
disagree leave a dislike and let me know
if there are any reasons I missed in the
video of not to buy the m9
those of you that are a huge fan of HTC
give me five reasons why you think you
should buy the m9 and I'll make a video
on that next anyways thanks again for
watching this is that from tech source
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
