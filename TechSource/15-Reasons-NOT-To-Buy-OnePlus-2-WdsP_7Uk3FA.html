two and I've been using it this past few
weeks and I got a say for a phone
claiming to be a flagship killer it's
pretty disappointing as always these are
my opinions and a lot of you will not
agree with any or all of these so if you
guys are looking to get the oneplus 2
then here are 15 reasons why you
shouldn't I'm going to start off with
the most obvious reasons with number one
being the invite system you shouldn't
have to wait in line to get an invite to
buy the smartphone of your choice and if
oneplus things this is a great idea for
consumers they are sadly mistaken it's
been over a year now since the original
oneplus and they have enough funding to
mass-produce a bunch of smartphones if I
have to request an invite to purchase a
phone that I want I'm going to go
elsewhere reason number two is the
overheating issue the Snapdragon 810
processor is notorious for getting
extremely hot and we have seen that on
the HTC One m9 this can be extremely
annoying and bothersome to heavy gamers
as the device will reach triple digits
I played asphalt late which is a racing
game for about 30 minutes and I had to
put the phone down since the
temperatures got pretty high battery
life is another issue on the oneplus 2
it features a 3300 milliamp battery
which seems like a lot but I'll only get
you an average screen on time of around
6 hours which is extremely lower than
our last year's model and most of the
other flagships how can it be a flagship
killer with a terrible battery life and
number four we have the sight speakers
and I always mention this in all my
videos but having speakers on the side
is really inconvenient for me when
watching movies or videos as my hands
come in contact with the grills and that
ends up distorting the sound also not
only do you not get stereo speakers but
the quality is also really bad and it's
just not loud enough I'm definitely not
impressed with the sound quality and
number five is the NFC capability
oneplus claims to be future-proof yet
the phone doesn't feature NFC
really guys before you start the
argument and say that you don't use NFC
well I do it's great for pairing with
other devices quickly making payments
and transferring data you can't say that
the phone is future-proof on one of the
most popular features on any Android
device is missing since we're talking
about missing features the phone doesn't
have a built-in IR blaster which means
you can't control your TV or other
devices with your
phone it also doesn't have a microSD
card slot talk about future proofing if
you want more space and in your future
you are pretty much Sol another thing it
lacks is a removable battery now it has
a removable back but it's only to access
the dual SIM card tray I mean why not
add a replaceable battery as well I just
don't get it
I'm personally rocking a D band skin
since I don't like the grippy texture of
the oneplus 2 but I'll go and drop a
link down below for anyone that's
interested in checking them out for
themselves
speaking of batteries it doesn't feature
a wireless charging or fast charging now
the wireless charging I can live without
but not having quick charge 2.0 is
extremely disappointing especially on a
latest Android flagship device
especially when you don't have great
battery performance in the first place
the tenth reason why you should consider
before buying the oneplus 2 is that it's
not water-resistant
forget about taking your phone to water
parks the beach or even the pool in your
backyard now this is targeted to a very
small group of individuals but it's a
feature that I really enjoy having on my
smartphone at number 11 we have the USB
type-c connection I think this is what
they meant when they were talking about
future-proofing but I personally think
it's way too soon to implement this not
only do you have to use a completely
different cable just for your oneplus 2
but it costs more than microUSB cable so
if you do keep losing them
it will definitely add up and cost and
number 12 we have the screen resolution
again going back to the future proof
thing now I'm not asking for 4k
resolution like the Xperia z5 premium
but a 2k display for 2015 as the
standard by now everything bad to say
about the 1080p screen it's actually
really great with amazing viewing angles
and vibrant colors but it's nonetheless
because it's not a future-proof
resolution number 13 is the camera it's
not the worst camera on the market but
it has a super slow shutter speed I'm
talking a good second before it snaps a
pic on top of that you don't have manual
controls so you have to rely on the auto
mode to get amazing shots so that's
something you should consider if you use
the camera feature a lot on your phone
number 14 is probably the biggest reason
of them all the phone doesn't work on
either Sprint or Verizon which is the
biggest carrier in the United States so
even if you want the phone it won't work
on your network this is your future
proof flagship smartphone guys and the
final reason which should be considered
is the case and accessory support
oneplus is still a small company and
there are a lot of case companies that
don't make
cases or accessories for the 1+2 so your
options are very limited when it comes
to protection or add-ons so that's it
for the video if you guys enjoyed it or
agreed with my reasons feel free to hit
that like button and if you didn't feel
free to dislike the video and share your
thoughts in the comment section down
below
it was pretty bold of oneplus 2 to title
their phone the 2016 flagship killer
when it's nothing more than a solid
smartphone for the price
there will be comparisons between this
and the Moto X pure on the channel since
both of them are considered to be one of
the best budget phones for 2015 so make
sure you guys are subscribed so you
don't miss out anyways thanks again for
watching as always and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
