and welcome to my recording and editing
setup
a lot of you guys actually requested
this video so I figured I would go ahead
and put one together I'm not gonna go
through everything that's on my desk I
actually did a setup tour in February of
this year and I'll leave a link down
below if you guys want to check that out
or you can click on the video over here
on the screen but really the only thing
that's different from the setup tour and
today's video is actually just a monitor
I swapped out both of my samsung 4k
monitors for LG's 34 inch ultra wide
curved monitor and if you guys somehow
missed that video then honestly you
should pause this video and go check
that out because this thing is amazing
it's it's amazing for productivity and
for gamers so I'll leave a link below if
you guys want to check that out but
anyways let's go ahead and start with
what I use to record all my videos so to
start things off this is my editing and
voiceover setup for voice-over videos
like the one you are listening to now I
use the scarlet Studio audio package
that comes with the interface and also a
cm 25 microphone and I also added my own
pop filter by the way I will leave all
the links to the products mentioned in
this video in the order that you see
them so it's easier to find now for
on-camera videos I use the audio
technica 88 97 condenser microphone
because it captures great audio from a
distance which is exactly what I need
since I'm sitting away from my desk most
of you guys noticed this set up this is
where I film my on-camera videos I
simply pull the microphone stand extend
the neck and plug in the XLR cable from
the audio interface and I'm ready to go
you can adjust the length and the height
of the stand to however you like it and
I love the fact that you can just fold
it and put it away from view for editing
and pretty much everything else i use
the ath m50x headphones from audio
technica i wasn't a fan of the 8 ehm 70
X's the quality was not up to par and
the sound quality just wasn't there and
actually did a comparison video between
the two and decided that the m50 X's are
much better at least for me they are the
keyboard I use is the mic
soft Sidewinder x4 and yes I'm aware
that this isn't a mechanical keyboard
and I really don't care I do love this
keyboard very much and it's very quiet
and awesome to type on and I really
enjoy gaming on it as well for
productivity this is the best wireless
mouse money can buy but I'm sure
everyone already knows that I do use it
for gaming occasionally but when it
comes to editing and just overall
workflow the MX master is an amazing
Mouse and you guys can check the video I
did on that if you don't believe me so I
keep getting asked what programs I used
to edit my videos so I hope this video
will finally answer them for editing
footage I use Sony Vegas Pro 13 and I
actually tried Adobe Premiere and even
Final Cut Pro but I found that the Vegas
Pro worked so well for me and it was a
lot easier to learn and since then I've
not tried anything else for audio
recording I use the program called
audacity which is a free program that
you can download and it will enhance the
overall audio quality of your video
here's a quick sample with and without
editing the sound with audacity alright
so this is basically the audio sample
recorded using audacity without any
editing and here is the audio sample
using audacity with editing as you can
see there is a big difference before and
after before I move on to the filming
area I wanted to mention how awesome my
desk is so this is called the vertex and
once again I did do a video on it you
guys should really check my channel
before asking questions chances are I
did a video on it but this is
essentially a desk that lets you adjust
its height I wanted to mention this
because this is very crucial to my
editing sessions and that's because
editing and voicing over takes hours and
I get tired of sitting down all the time
not only is sitting down for hours at a
time bad for the back but it also
promotes laziness so the fact that I can
adjust the height with a click of a
button and change things up is what
makes the vertex a must for me
alright well moving towards the filming
area and I'm sure you guys have seen
this shot many times right well let me
move back a little bit this is what my
setup looks like from a distance I have
to Flora softboxes with 685 watt soft
white bulbs in each stand giving it that
pure white look in my videos if there's
a tip I want to give you guys when it
comes to lighting is don't cheat
out I learned the hard way and I went
through like five different lighting
setups before discovering this one and
if you're looking for quality lighting
equipment don't go for cheap equipment
you will regret it not only are the
lights super-bright but the stand is
very durable and it's the best quality
stand I have ever used in lighting the
filming desk is also a vertex that's how
much I love this thing that I had to get
two of them plus it really helps me in
getting those awesome shots that you
sometimes see in my videos the camera I
used to film all this is the Panasonic
gh4 and I mainly got it because they can
shoot in 4k resolution I currently use
only one lens which is the twelve to
thirty five millimeter F 2.8 zoom lens
however I plan on picking up a wide
angle lens sometime in the near future
so right below the camera is the
Manfrotto 128 RC fluid head which lets
me do some pretty cool shots like
horizontal and vertical pans right below
the fluid head is the camera or slider
which is the only slider I use for
smooth sliding shots that you see my
videos and believe it or not but I
actually use my hands for all the shots
including this one that you see now
however I'm still looking for a
motorized slider that has a longer
length and I haven't really found one
that I like yet so right below the
slider is another Manfrotto fluid head
and this is needed to support the slider
itself and without it I won't be able to
mount the slider on and last but not
least we have my trusty tripod also from
Manfrotto this is the 190 X PR OB
aluminum pro tripod and it's a really
strong and durable tripod that gets the
job done
it works wonders for unboxing since I
can expand the legs all the way up
giving me about sixty inches of height
to work with but yeah that's basically
my entire setup for recording editing
and filming I hope you guys enjoyed the
video if you did please hit that like
button as I would really appreciate it
and let me know what you guys think
about my setup I'm actually really
interested in hearing what you have to
say also if you have any questions at
all or have any suggestions feel free to
drop them in the comment section down
below once again I will leave links to
the products you guys saw in the video
in the description section down below
and also those of you guys that are
interested in checking out my entire
gear list for tech source I will leave a
link to that down below as well but
anyways thanks again for watching this
is that from tech source I will see you
guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
