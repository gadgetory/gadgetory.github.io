to show you the process of unlocking
your LG G flex 2 so you can use it with
any carrier or country for this
demonstration I will be using my lock 18
t G flex 2 and unlock it so I can use it
on my t-mobile network but you can use
this video as a guide for any carrier in
the world so first off we need to get
the unlock code to start the unlocking
process now there's a bunch of expensive
unlocking websites out there but the
cheapest one that I use for all my
phones is the unlocking company comm and
they also have the fastest delivery
times as well so head on over to the
unlocking company comm and select a
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop-down list and on the next
page go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is AT&amp;amp;T before we
continue we do need the IMEI number of
the phone and the way you look that up
on your phone is to open up the dial pad
and enter in star pound zero six pound
now once the phone displays the IMEI
number you have to go back on the
website and enter that in once
everything is filled out so let's get
unlocking code and that will take you to
the final screen where you have to check
out after checking out they will email
you the unlock code the price and the
delivery time of your code varies by
phone but don't worry because as I said
before you are getting the cheapest
price online with the fastest delivery
times so once you receive your unlock
code from the locking company it's time
to unlock your phone but before we
continue make sure that the phone is
powered off next go ahead and remove the
backplate of your flex 2 so you can gain
access to this SIM tray next insert the
SIM card you want to use with the phone
I want to use the Flex 2 on my t-mobile
network so I'm putting in my t-mobile
SIM card if your SIM card is a different
size than the tray then you have to
adjust the size in order for it to work
there is a link below to show you how
that's done after you insert the SIM
card go ahead and install the back plate
back on and power on the phone once the
phone boots up it will take you straight
to the SIM unlock page and this is where
you enter the unlock code that you
received from the locking company after
inputting in the code and hitting unlock
you will get a message stating that the
unlock was successful and your phone
will reboot automatically once it
restarts itself and you arrived on the
home screen your phone is now
permanently unlocked and you can begin
using it on any care
here you want as you can see here I'm
using my 18 P G flex 2 on my t-mobile
network so that's how you lock your LG G
flex 2 for any carrier or country if
