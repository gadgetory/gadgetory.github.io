canceling PC Wars a lot of you guys are

going to continue it obviously I don't
want to cancel it and have some people
upset so thank you guys so much for

show
so before I begin the video nice is

guys enable push notifications if you
want to get notified if you have one or
not so starting up episode we have Benny
and his water cool the black and white
PC inside the aged 440 case as a 4770k
and two gtx 980 s and sli with 32 gigs
of ram there are a few red accents on
the motherboard which makes sense why he
has a few red ram sticks to stay a
little consistent with the overall theme
and even though he stayed with a stock
psu cables the build still looks pretty
damn good I mean other than the
obviously repulsive SLI bridge this is a
good-looking PC for benchmarks it scored
in eighteen thousand ninety four
starting off the episode strong Thank
You Benny for entering here's a pretty
sick water-cooled build from Jesse
called Genova it's refreshing to see a
different color scheme even though it's
only from the cables so this is rocking
a 68 50 K and a Pascal Titan X and a
custom loop inside the leanly PC o7s
case Genova also has 64 gigs of g.skill
tried and zeez which tells me that this
is more than just a gaming pc and for
benchmarks that scored a crazy 24,000
139 taking first place for the episode a
very clean water-cooled built Thank You
Jessie for entering Josh is next up with
purity a black and white build inside
the fantex
evolved ITX case it's rocking a 60 180
fire R X 480 nitro Edition graphics card
it may not be water-cooled but damn is
this a clean ass build or what I'm
loving the color consistency and the
custom laser cut SSD cover with his
nickname written on it
cable management is also flawless and
may not top the charts and benchmarks
but this is a good-looking build
nonetheless Thank You Josh for entering
speaking of white and black check this
beast out
Winston is calling it the youjizz
machine you jizz and I can see why this
thing is equipped with a 6600 K and a
Galaxy TX 1070 some odds include Plasti
Dip parts like the radiator GPU shroud
and Triton Z RAM sticks I definitely
appreciate all the attention to the
small details for benchmarks to score a
fifteen thousand twenty seven taking
third place for this episode Thank You
Winston for entering last but not least
we have Lewis with a black and green PC
inside the in win at 9:09 case lemon
rush is the name of the PC and it's
equipped with a 68 50k that's
overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz 32 gigs of
ram and 2 EVGA 1080s and sli it's safe
to say this PC takes first place even
though here an extreme version of fire
strike instead the EVGA sli bridge kind
of sticks out to me I feel like either a
custom paint job or simply removing
those stickers from it would make it
look a lot better regardless it's a very
sick black and green build Thank You
Lewis for entering so that is it for
