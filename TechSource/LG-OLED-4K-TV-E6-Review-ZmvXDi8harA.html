source and today we're going to be
taking a look at LG's new 4k TV they're
calling it the e6 with a Harman Kardon
speaker system intuitive interface and
HDR technology is built into the e6 it
suffice to say that this TV grabbed my
attention so obviously I had to get one
in for review let's start with the
industrial design so the e6 features
what LG calls their picture on glass
technology where a thin OLED panel is
bonded to the glass LG was able to get
rid of the traditional backlight found
on most modern TVs through this method
and achieve this super thin profile of
the panel we have here which a TAS
thinnest point is just a few millimeters
thick at the bottom is where all of the
electronics are the max thickness is six
point six centimeters and this
measurement includes the cable
management hanger that can't be removed
something else that can't be removed is
the Harman Kardon speaker system so if
you're going to use your own audio setup
it's kind of stuck there with no purpose
but if you like me and don't have an
external audio rig then you're going to
be happy with the sound that comes out
of this but more on that later
as far as input goes you get four HDMI
2.0 a and the three USB ports one of
which is a USB 3 so plenty of
connectivity here I do however wish that
LG had positioned them somewhere further
back because it is too close to the edge
and thicker cables can be visible from
the front the design is stunning but
this is a TV after all and that's not
what's important I've got to say when I
hook this thing up I saw the e6 is best
feature the picture quality sadly this
video isn't doing it any justice but in
person it produces the best image I've
ever seen on any TV hands-down the
colors are extremely vibrant and the
blacks are pitch black and as viewing
angles are superb this picture quality
translates to all of your content but
find yourself some HDR videos and it
takes it to another level this TV
features both HDR 10 and Dolby vision to
give you the greatest level of contrast
by representing the widest contrast
range possible and the good news is that
it's becoming more widely supported you
can find HDR content on new major
blu-ray releases and even Netflix is
making a push towards this technology
with some of their content already in
HDR the e6 is also
3d compatible in the box you get two
pairs of glasses and even though 3d
isn't as popular as it used to be it's
still fun to turn on and mix things up
every now and then since it's passive it
works with all your content that I
enjoyed playing anew in charter game
with my PlayStation 4 in 3d mode now
it's obviously not something I'm going
to use often but it's here nonetheless
now in game mode you do get a 35
millisecond of lag which I found to be
fine for first-person shooters and
online gaming it's not going to compare
to the fastest refresh rate gaming
runners out there but it was still a
great experience nevertheless in terms
of audio if you don't need surround
sound or really strong bass the built-in
speaker is great provides clear and well
produced low mid and high frequencies in
fact here is an audio sample
skels while in the dark because I knew
the moment you were presented you would
not be like the obedient painter comes
with two remotes that serve different
needs the larger control is stylish and
provides special features like a pointer
scrolling and even a built-in microphone
the compact remote offers more basic
features and slider weight is actually
the reason why I use this one the most
for an interface we still get LG's new
webOS 3.0 which I've covered in a
previous video it's user friendly and
fast it definitely comes packed with a
ton of new features and an app store
where you can download TV specific apps
outlining all the new features we'll
take a bit of time so instead I'll give
you guys my favorite one the
magnification this allows you to magnify
whatever's on your screen in a number of
ways and makes reading text or seeing
that goal a lot easier LG's webOS 3.0 is
still my current favorite interface on
any TV and I don't think any other brand
comes close the only thing I wish that
LG would have done was maybe implement a
keyboard interface on the back of the
remote or somewhere on the control so in
case you're typing titles on Netflix it
will be a lot easier instead of pointing
and clicking on each letter to sum
things up I really enjoyed my time
reviewing lgz 6 I'm not gonna lie there
were some times where I was recording
the video and I just got completely
distracted by the amazing quality on
this screen I have to say this is one of
the best TVs and
terms of picture quality and even design
that I've ever reviewed on the channel
the 55 inch model does start at around
2800 and I'll drop a link down below if
