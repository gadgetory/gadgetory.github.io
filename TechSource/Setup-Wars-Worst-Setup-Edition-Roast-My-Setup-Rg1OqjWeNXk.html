welcome back to set up or it's episode
160 potato Edition however this time I'm
gonna be roasting some setups you guys
seem to enjoy the last one so it's only
fair to bring back the roasting and
please guys don't take this video
seriously I'm only doing it for fun the
people who submit their photos want to
be a part of the worst set up Edition
that way they can have a chance to win
$100 that's right guys a person with the
worst setup in this video will take home
$100 in cash and you guys get to vote in
the comments section so with that said
let the roasting begin kicking off the
episode is Gabe and already we have a
bad setup I mean that's not even
comfortable to game on by any means not
only is a TV really close to Gabe's face
but there was barely any space on the
desk to do anything it's very crowded
there isn't even enough space for the
mouse how does he game on that let alone
fat what makes a setup even worse is the
TV isn't even 1080p its 720p but being
that close to his eyes might as well be
480p honestly the only good thing about
this setup is the mouse he's got the
logitech g502 proteus spectrum I do like
the custom-made wrist rest which looks
like it's made out of bean bags or
something for his tech RGB keyboard for
audio he's got a sub underneath the desk
and the Logitech G 230 headset that's
hanging from the TV it's no secret the
setup is being powered by his HP laptop
which has an i5 8250 U and a Radeon 530
graphics card forget what I said about
the mouse being the best part of the
setup it's actually the cable management
at least he made an effort to zip-tie
the cables together and he even made a
dedicated cable holder next to the setup
extra points for that an easy fix to
this setup would be to start off with a
larger desk and I feel like everything
else will fall in place although it's a
pretty bad setup with decent cable
management Thank You Gabe for entering
and making our eyes bleed already next
up is kal-el from the US and another bad
laptop powered setup but at least he has
more space than Gabe
a better monitor the LG 24-inch is a
1080p monitor that's hooked up to his PC
on the side which also has better specs
we've got an i3 6100 four gigs of ram
and bgp 730 surprisingly he paid three
hundred dollars for this junk and
apparently he's able to play csgo and
GTA san andreas I'm guessing on very low
settings I don't think that's a good
idea covering up the PC with all those
books your kind of a scripting airflow
but what do I know about pcs it's
interesting that he owns a keyboard that
costs one third of the PC he's got the
Razer BlackWidow which has to be stolen
I mean come on look at the setup you
know I will give him the benefit of the
doubt and say that it was gifted to him
speaking of which I don't agree with the
placement of the keyboard and mouse
maybe he's already used to it but having
the keyboard lower than the mouse looks
very uncomfortable personally I would
place the laptop in the drawer and move
the keyboard up top if he ever needs to
open it up or use the laptop you can
just pull out the drawer it's such a
simple solution also why do you have a
laptop in here anyways it's taking up
extra space for audio is rocking a pair
of Logitech speakers and the newer
microphone which doesn't even have a
mount it's just sitting on the desk
very classy cables are pretty nasty
hanging from the back we got no
management at all and just overall a
very poorly executed setup that needs
more attention and love Thank You calel
for entering and good luck for one
disaster to another we have Miguel's
gaming setup from the Philippines we
have a 1366 by 768 19 inch monitor from
Samsung on a very tiny nightstand the
surface on my toilet is much larger than
this table I mean there's barely any
space to move that poor Mouse and half
the monitors just sticking out like what
is going on here I will give him some
points for mounting his router on the
side of the desk at least he's able to
make good use of the table the PC
powering this puny setup is older than
the building itself it's got an Athlon 2
and an NVIDIA 9400 GT with 4 gigs of RAM
I don't even think you can run
minesweeper on this PC without it
lagging the back of the setup is
probably the worst part lots of dust and
dirt we got loose cables and an empty
condom wrapper on the floor I'm just
kidding let's be realistic here he's
definitely not getting any based on how
this setup looks
Steff only a candy wrapper anyways thank
you for sharing this awesome setup big
yael and good luck winning that hundred
dollars and number four is a dual piston
setup we have ryan and his little
brother Risha they are both students and
they use this setup for gaming and
school work first thing i noticed is the
amount of wasted space on the desk
apparently their action figures are more
important than mouth space why not move
that black and white action figure
somewhere else so that you can move the
keyboard to the left and have some extra
space to move around the mouse like what
kind of games do you even play with that
much mouse space flappy bird the only
source of audio he has are the
Skullcandy hash to wireless headphones I
do have to say this though this is
probably the most complete set up from
this episode but it still qualifies as a
bad setup because of how crowded the
surfaces and the PC there are so many
things wrong with this build first off
the power supply is upside down the fan
has to be facing down so that it pulls
in fresh air the hard drive is installed
backwards because the cables need to be
hooked up from the back side and lastly
what on earth is going on with that
cable management looks like spider-man
is at war with venom inside here it kind
of looks like a 10 year old build this
PC oh wait the cables from the setup
aren't that much better but I do
appreciate the few zip ties that are
holding up the PC cables together the
setup definitely has more care than the
others in this video but thank you Ryan
and we chef for entering last but
definitely not the least is safe and his
neck breaking gaming setup okay so he's
definitely got a larger desk but
probably the worst layout I have seen he
uses the laptop keyboard and the Razer
Naga Mouse to game on his 27-inch
monitor which is on the right side which
means that he's sitting on the left side
and looking at the right I mean don't
get me wrong it's a great neck workout
but it's not that comfortable even if
you use it that monitor as the second
display is just not comfortable
constantly looking over to the right
side the problem here is the desk you
definitely need something that has more
depth the laptop however is beast it has
a 7700 HQ 16 gigs of ram and the gtx
1060 but sadly it's not being utilized
the right way I would switch the laptop
with the monitor and just buy a keyboard
that way you don't have to use the
keyboard on the laptop and this way will
be way more comfortable if you want to
use the monitor as your
display other than that there's not much
going on here we do have some earbuds
for audio and the cables are decent
nothing exciting happening here just a
really weird setup for neck problems
Thank You size for showing us what not
to do and that does it for this episode
of grossed my setup if you guys enjoyed
it and want me to do this every 10
episodes let me know by dropping a like
and if you guys didn't enjoy it feel
free to dislike as well but please be
sure to vote in the comments section on
who has the worst setup because that
person is gonna take home a hundred
dollars in cash I'll announce the
winners on my Twitter account this
weekend then you guys so much for
watching as always I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
