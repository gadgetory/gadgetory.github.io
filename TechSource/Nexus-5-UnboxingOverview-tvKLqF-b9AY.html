Google's newest flagship bow in the
Nexus 5 we picked up that 32 gig model
we are going to unbox it and take a
closer look at it you can choose from
either white or black both which I made
out of Matt however the white one does
have glossy sides if we decide to get
that color and the 16 gig will cost you
350 whereas the 32 will cost just fifty
dollars more because it is a nexus phone
it does come unlock which means you
don't have to sign a contract Google
started a trend last year of selling
exceptional hardware a revolutionary
price and this year is no exception if
you guys are into stock Android phones
then you will love the Nexus 5 so here
inside the box is the phone itself the
texture on the phone is soft to the
touch and feels very similar to that of
the Nexus 7 tablet the phone is also
very lightweight for its size and fuel
study at the same time it definitely
doesn't feel like I'm holding a very
cheap plastic device moving out with the
unboxing you do receive all the standard
paperwork like the warranty and safety
manuals quick tips and quick start guide
and on the bottom of all these you have
your standard accessories the wall
charger and of course your micro USB
cable the Nexus 5 also supports 4G LTE
and a variety of bands which the Nexus
sport did not have so that's a big plus
the Nexus 5 is the fastest android phone
we have used so far if you look at the
bottom of the device you will find your
mono speakers on the left and your
actual microphone on the right and in
between those you have your micro USB
port and on the left side you have your
volume rockers and all the buttons on
the Nexus 5 are made at a ceramic
material which feels a little more
tactile on top we have the earphone jack
and the noise cancelling mic and on a
face of the camera we have the earpiece
speakers up top our usual sensors hidden
under the back slab to the right and a
little to the left is the 1.3 megapixel
front facing camera the power button and
sim tray are located on the right side
of the phone and the back you will find
the 8 megapixel camera with optical
image stabilization which helps
eliminate some of the shake while
filming and improves night shots under
the camera is also the flash and under
that is the nexus logo as we power the
device you can see that the 5-inch
screen and
since five is sharp it has a resolution
of 1920 x 1080 p with 445 pixels per
inch it does have IPS technology so you
a mullet fans might not like the blacks
on the phone but all in all it does look
like a fantastic display which is also
protected with Corning's Gorilla Glass 3
the Nexus 5 is the first device to run
Android KitKat and it does bring along a
couple of improvements we now have touch
less Google now control and all we have
to do is say Google now and it will
start listening this is only available
on the home screen and nowhere else on
the device and they also optimize the
software for performance on older
hardware which does free up some of your
RAM on the Nexus 5 the Nexus 5 also
comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
clock at two point 26 cigarettes
accompanied by the Adreno 330 GPU as
well as two gigs of ram and it does have
wireless charging built in comparing
this to the iphone 5s you can see that
it is bigger but not thinner the iPhone
5s is at seven point six millimeters
while the Nexus 5 is at eight point 59
which is fine since it does have a
bigger screen to me personally five inch
screens are a sweet spot for me it's not
too big nor too small just perfect so
that wraps up the unboxing and overview
overall was really impressed with the
Nexus 5 they did make you an improvement
from the last model it feels and looks
great and the fact that you don't need
to sign a contract to buy this phone at
a very low price is a huge plus the
story behind the Nexus 5 is more about
the software as Google is making things
more user friendly with bigger icons and
more intuitive user interface which is
what i want to see from google i mean if
people want user friendly phones they
automatically go straight to Apple so
Google starts making stock Android as
unified and user friendly as iOS then
things will definitely change for Apple
