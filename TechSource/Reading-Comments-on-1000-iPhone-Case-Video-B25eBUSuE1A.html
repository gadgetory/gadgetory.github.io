thousand dollar iPhone 6s case about a
week ago and I've been getting some
interesting feedback in the comment
section
now normally I don't do these types of
videos but for this case I'm sorry it
has to be done so I've been reading
every single comment you guys been
posting believe it or not on the video
and I picked up the best ones and I'm
gonna share with you guys so let's do
this watch me take a huge steaming dump
and sell it for 750 bucks
people buy anything these days I will
certainly buy that for 750 bucks what
happens in a year when you upgrade the
phone oh god no oh my head hurts oh the
pain
this can be please tell me it isn't so
two silvers made of what so water two
silvers made of who so bottom material
oh the pretentiousness is pail that
one's a good one no one's a good one
come on come on dude dude dude come on
dude it's two pieces dude on come dude
totally chamfered brah dude okay 100%
Khali bowed your knight Dawg dude come
on dude and a lot of more dudes him
below that I'll put the case in a
special glass box with lasers to protect
it
darn honestly this is almost as big of a
scam as bottled water I don't even know
bottled water was a scam I would buy
this I've had a small loan of a million
dollars classic this case or a dual
980ti
okay I'll get the case can I protect me
from a nuke you have to be out of your
damn mind to buy one of those I mean the
iPhone madness
this is sparta if I spend $1,000 on this
case I expect my phone to obtain
intelligence and go to my job for me
drops phone my case I like that one
I could buy a 3d printer get a new
computer to use it with and then 3d
print an exact model of it for about
$200 cheaper I don't give a if this was
made out of Jennifer Lawrence's hymen no
cell phone case is worth $1000 but I
guess if you want to blow your money on
something useless
these are worse things you could buy
Jennifer Lawrence is high maintenance
very creative hmm let's see you can buy
food with $1,000 a cheap car some gas
etc I love I put some gas why not a full
tank of gas the argument that this case
is just for special bunch of people who
can't afford it does not make sense to
me a pound of titanium alloy with a high
Mach just to clarify I'm not hating on
you ed this was a fantastic video and
your cinematography skills are fantastic
keep the videos coming because we love
what you do oh thank you so much man
this phone needs to protect the case if
I spend $1000 on a phone accessory it
better be able to make pizza for me or
some if I sold drugs or was a
professional hitman and didn't care
about money I would order this I love I
have to either be selling drugs or
professional hitman why can't you be
like a doctor or something who makes
actually good money why does this guy
not have 1 million subs
patience young grasshopper I love this
channel but this is the stupidest most
ridiculous waste of money I've ever seen
case looks dope though I mean I only had
to sell to my kids to buy this it was so
worth it I'm usually not a big fan of
new iPhones but this one with the case
and the skiing and the wallpaper won my
heart
what's a skiing there's a cheaper
version for just $700 the aurora edition
that's actually true
you can save 300 bucks i really hope
this video was sponsored just for your
sake head why would i spend $1000 on a
in case obviously was sponsored this are
a super hot prostitute i guess the price
is saying
I'll guy says you've been overpaying for
hot prostitutes is this a troll video
just to put into perspective what one
thousand dollars can buy you check this
out
Titan X GPU one year supply of food one
year tuition to Community College one
year of high-speed Internet 60-inch
television a temporal simplicity
California king-size mattress I rather
into my hands and clapped and spend
$1000 on this I would love to see that
and the last comment just bought it
during graduations so that's it for the
video
I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did
make sure to hit that like button and if
you want to see more types of these I
guess let me know in the comments
section down below like I said it's
usually gonna do these types of videos
but for this specific case video it just
had to be done anyways thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
