today I'm going to look at the new
chrome box from ASOS like Chromebooks
the chrome box is essentially the
Internet and I'll explain what I mean by
that all chrome devices run on Chrome OS
which is a Google's operating system and
because it is a google OS it relies
heavily on Google Apps like Gmail
YouTube Google+ and so forth which
obviously requires the internet to be
used so when you open the chrome box it
comes with a user guide some warranty
information and a quick set-up guide to
help you get started right below that
there is a VESA mount which you can use
to mount your chrome box to your wall or
other compatible services if you choose
right below that are the screws needed
for the mounting it looks like there are
different sizes in here that you can
choose from moving along we have the
power brick which has the Asus logo on
it I mean other than that is pretty much
standard and last but not least we have
the chrome box this is this thing is
actually unbelievably small and very
light you can see here that I can hold
it with pretty much just one hand and
with that question portability is one of
the strongest suit you can probably fit
this in your pocket and take it to your
friend's house without any problems so
this model of the chrome box cost 179
and it comes rocking an Intel Celeron
1.4 gigahertz dual-core processor with 2
gigs of RAM and 16 gigabytes of SSD Asus
also announced two other models
alongside this one which are expected to
launch later this month one of them will
have an Intel Core i7 processor which
will be able to playback 4k videos and
the other will have an intel core i3 and
all models will also have either 2 or 4
gigabytes of ddr3 1600 memory taking a
look at the chrome box you will find a
two-in-one card reader right next to the
Kingston lock port followed by the power
button on the corner of the device and 2
USB 3 ports on the other side on the
back of the chrome box we can see the AC
power connector a gigabyte Ethernet port
additional USB 3 ports on hdmi and
displayport along with a headphone or
microphone port I was impressed by how
fast this thing actually boots up it
literally took about five seconds to
boot up to the user screen and about
half that time to actually power
there's really nothing new about the
operating system it's the same ones that
you find on Chromebooks so instead I
will show you how well the device runs
watching videos in 1080p and playing
games now if you saw our HP Chromebook
11 video then you saw how laggy the
video playback was on that but looking
at the asus chromebox i see nothing but
smooth streaming I even opened up
another video side-by-side here's the
test its power and it seems like it can
handle it without any problems
the chromebox also ran games very well
not even once that any of the games in
choppy overall the experience was very
pleasant for me and if the low-end model
performs this well I can only imagine
what the higher-end models can achieve I
gotta say I'm really impressed at what
this little box can do although you can
access the Chrome store and download any
game that's available you may run into a
few that won't be playable on the Chrome
OS and instead you'll get a message
saying that it's only available on
Windows or OS 10 overall I gotta say I
love the chrome box it's a great way for
me to get more out of my TV and it's a
great substitute from an Apple TV or
Roku which to me are kind of limited in
functionality with a price tag of being
179 bucks I gotta say it's definitely
worth buying one if you love streaming
videos or just aren't satisfied with a
chromecast or Apple TV features we left
a link in the description below if you
guys are interested in checking it out
and I make sure to leave a comment down
below on your thoughts about the chrome
box I always read all of your comments
so I'm interested to hear what you guys
think this is at from tech source and I
will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
