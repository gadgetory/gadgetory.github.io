before I jump into the awesome
time-lapse build I do want to give a
huge thanks to audible for teaming up
with me and sponsoring this video I'm
actually working with them on their
brand new new year a new me campaign to
help you guys achieve your goals faster
in 2018 so if you guys remember a few
months ago I posted on Twitter the list
of goals that I wanted to achieve in
2018 and in order to achieve some of
these goals I've been listening to some
audiobooks from audible specifically
this audiobook from Charles Duhigg
called smarter faster better and it
talks a lot about being productive in
life and business and after I'm done
with that I'm gonna be checking out
unlimited memory and bored and brilliant
and I chose these titles because it's
gonna help me with my personal life and
business which will have a huge impact
on my health and happiness
I do recommend audible and that's
because they have an enormous selection
of audiobooks and audio products on
their platform and the best part is that
you can get a free 30-day trial and a
free audiobook simply by signing up
using the link in the description
section so I want to set my own personal
goal of listening to at least six
audiobooks for 2018 and I want to
challenge you guys to set your own goal
for 2018 as well if you haven't already
I want you to select three audiobooks
that you feel will help you achieve your
goal by using the link in the
description section and audible and I
want you guys to send me a screenshot
using the hashtag new year new me and
I'm gonna be picking my favorite and
I'll be giving that person a free six
month trial on audible so with that said
I hope you guys enjoy this video
and that pretty much wraps up the
time-lapse video let me know what you
guys think of the PC by leaving your
comments down below and if you enjoy the
video tossing a like would be
appreciated also guys don't forget to
send in the screenshots of the three
audio books that you feel will help you
achieve your goals in 2018 by using the
hashtag new year new me I'll be picking
my favorite and I'll be awarding them a
six month free trial on audible once
again you guys can find the link to that
down below thanks again so much for
watching I love your faces
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
