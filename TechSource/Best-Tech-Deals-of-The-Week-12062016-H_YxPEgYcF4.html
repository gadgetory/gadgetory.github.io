coming which means it's time to spend
our hard-earned money that we've been
saving this entire year on friends and
family even though we don't want to
let's be honest rather spend that money
and upgrade our pcs but you know what
it's not about us it's about friends and
family and caring which is why this
entire month we're gonna be focusing on
deals deals and more tech deals to save
you guys a bunch of money for this
holiday season also please make sure to
bookmark deal source dot tech because we
have some exciting new updates coming up
this weekend you guys don't want to miss
out so starting off with some very
limited deals on ebay that are going to
expire very soon first up as an Xbox one
wireless controller going for
thirty-five dollars but keep in mind
that this is refurbished staying on the
same subject the xbox one slim minecraft
bundle is also discounted to two hundred
seventy dollars which already has sold
over 400 units if you guys have been
always wanting to get your friend or
family member and iPad for Christmas now
here's your chance because the
fourth-generation iPad is going for only
a hundred and eighty dollars and this is
a perfect gift for anyone that's never
had an iPad before it sold more than
ninety six percent stock so be quick if
you guys want to snag this for Christmas
the new ps4 slim uncharted 4 bundle is
also on sale for the holidays going for
only two hundred seventy dollars and
speaking of the ps4 the dualshock 4
controller is going for forty four
dollars and it sold over 5000 units
already if you're shopping around for a
solid sound bar this holiday season and
the visio sp3 821 has your name written
all over it it is a refurbished item but
if you can overlook that this is a very
solid sound bar that comes with a
subwoofer only for 110 dollars now keep
in mind that a brand new one goes for
close to 140 so you will be saving
around thirty dollars on this and
finally on ebay is the popular logitech
z 506 surround sound speaker system for
$43 a brand new set will cost you around
seventy dollars so you will be saving
around 27 bucks if you pick up a
refurbished version instead and by the
looks of it it's selling out really
quickly now let's dive into some amazon
deals first up is the popular blue yeti
USB microphone going for $90 which is a
very good price considering that
these are going for a hundred twenty
nine dollars on other sites including
newegg so you will be saving a solid 40
bucks on this microphone which is
actually one of the best plug-and-play
mikes you can buy right now
unfortunately this amazing price is only
available on the ugly vintage white
option speaking of audio gear the
popular m40 X's are also on sale for 80
bucks and then from ice we have a few
options that steelseries rivals 700
gaming mouse is going for 71 dollars and
eighty cents razer diamondback
chromophore forty dollars any popular
logitech g602 gaming wireless mouse also
for 40 bucks i'm personally using the g
900 myself and i'm absolutely loving it
right now and it appears to have a
slight discount as well which kind of
sucks because i pay 250 bucks for mine
which is full price but it's currently
fifteen dollars off and we'll be in
stock mid December last two items on
Amazon are the coarser obsidian 350d
case that's fifteen dollars off and the
alula 87 key mechanical gaming keyboard
for twenty-six dollars twenty-six
dollars for a mechanical gaming keyboard
that's a really good deal even though
it's missing a 10-key finishing up this
episode are some new egg deals first up
is the i5 6600 the locked processor
going for 210 dollars using the promo
code listed on the site and we also have
a few GPU deals as well the power color
are x 480 is going four hundred eighty
dollars and i guess that's pretty much
it i think the other deals expired
already sorry about that now here's a
really solid deal on the new LG gaming
monitor which i just finished making a
video on by the way will be up next week
on the channel and spoil alert by the
way it's awesome the retail on this
thing is seven hundred dollars but its
twenty dollars off on newegg and it
features a hundred forty four Hertz
refresh rate and a 1 millisecond
response time which is perfect for
gaming and you guys have been looking
for gaming ultra-wide monitor then this
one is definitely worth taking a look at
moving on we got the cryo rig h7 cpu
cooler going for thirty bucks the
corsair k70 luxe RGB keyboard with
cherry Browns are going for one hundred
forty dollars and finally the asrock z
170 OC is only 217 dollars after a
mail-in rebate and it's actually the
perfect motherboard for a
black-and-yellow build so that is if all
the deals if you guys are from Canada or
UK make sure to check out the links
