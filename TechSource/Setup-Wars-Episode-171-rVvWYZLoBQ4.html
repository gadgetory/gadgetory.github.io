I've uploaded an episode of setup wars I
don't want you guys to think that I'm
lazy or I forgot about the show there's
actually a good reason I took a week off
of YouTube to visit Vegas for EDC with a
couple of friends for anyone that's been
following me on my personal account on
IG you guys already know that but for
everyone else now you know anyways I'm
back on the grind so you guys can expect

begin some of you guys already know that

learn more visit amaze comm slash tech
source or click the link below kicking
off the episode is Abdul from Saudi
Arabia and the slightly moderate setup
that he uses for gaming the best borders
have been painted and red
and some parts of the handles to stay
consistent with the black and red color
scheme at first glance the setup does
seem a bit cluttered but the fact that
he mounted his monitor against the wall
freed up some extra space otherwise that
wouldn't be in the extra space on the
desk for those collectibles and also the
monitor will be really close to his face
he is using the element Z 88 keyboard
with the g502 Mouse which he drilled a
hole for although I don't know why he
didn't change the lighting on the
keyboard to red to match the rest of the
setup for audio he's only got a headset
which is hanging from the side and
finally his gaming PC which he managed
to squeeze on top of his desk
we got a 7700 K paired with an EVGA GTX
1080 FTW to grab his card so this is his
gaming setup and to the right of that is
the media setup which he uses to watch
movies and game on his ps3 I love that
Abdul is a man of culture I see posters
for Blade Runner better call Saul the
Goodfellas John wick - by the way the
Dolan was awesome and probably my
all-time favorite anime Death Note over
there in the corner great setup and
excellent taste in movies and shows
Thank You Abdul for entering now this
next setup takes the word compact to a
whole new level it looks like he built
this inside a closet definitely not the
best setup for someone who has
claustrophobia andrew is a photographer
and uses this multi set up for video
editing gaming and graphic design you
know building a setup like this in a
limited space requires a desk that not
only provides enough surface area but
also something that doesn't take up all
the space
the Pilsen graphite corner desk does
just that plenty of surface area while
giving Andrew just enough space to
squeeze in and because of the corner
desk he doesn't have to move around as
much to reach things the first set up
has a 2017 27-inch iMac with an apple
keyboard and mouse while the second set
up which I'm guessing is for gaming has
an asus monitor and the Razer Huntsman
elite keyboard with the Naga trinity
mouse and the Firefly mousepad it is a
glass desk so obviously it's not gonna
drill a hole in it for the cables but he
did do a good job managing the rest of
the wires underneath
he basically only used zip ties to tie
the cables and the power strip to the
legs for the first setup he's using a
logitech speakers which are tucked
behind the iMac and the second setup
uses Logitech G 560 speakers okay I get
that there isn't any extra space on the
desk but I would recommend moving the
Logitech speakers somewhere else you can
always make room on the wall for a shelf
and put them on there which will still
give you better sound than hiding them
behind the display I also noticed your
blue Yeti microphone just sitting on the
desk and there is no real place for it
since you are using a glass desk it's a
bit tricky you can always use a desk
mount like this one from newer to mount
your microphone to or here's a pretty
cool hack that you can use you can buy
one of these tiny wall shelves and
install it behind your monitor and hook
up your boom arm to it not only will
this give you more of a reach for the
arm but it also look a lot cleaner since
I won't sit or clamp to your desk the PC
power in the gaming setup is actually
Andrews first ever PC build and it's
rocking the 8700 K 32 gigs of ram and
the EVGA GTX 1080 cable management may
seem atrocious but at least ours are GB
and finally next to the PC is a 2015
MacBook Pro which means he has three
different setups in his tiny room
this is a great example that you don't
need a ton of space to build a set up as
long as you optimize every single space
Thank You Andrea for entering coming in
at number three is bradden with a
somewhat minimalistic setup he's using a
single laser monitor with a ducky 1/2
mini keyboard and he logitech g502 hero
mouse once again we got the Logitech G
560 speakers and Sony headphones for
audio and that's pretty much it on the
surface other than has gaming PC it's
decently expect with an 80 600 K and an
RT X 27 T actually it's packed pretty
nicely some obvious recommendations
would be a hanger for the headphone
instead of just leading him on the desk
like that I would also pick up a few
velcro straps and tie the cables behind
your monitor together so that they
aren't visible and you can even go one
step further and tie the keyboard and
mouse wire to the monitor base and then
wrap those wires behind the monitor with
the rest of the cables also a sleeve to
hide the cables underneath your setup
would look nice if you can't find a
signal rack or something similar to keep
the cables from hanging down
like that it's a fairly simple setup but
it does need some cable tweaking to
improve nonetheless thank you
for entering and number four we have
Dean who makes a return on the show with
an upgraded setup damn that's clean he's
walking a 34 inch ultra wide from LG
that he mounted against the wall with a
channel Raceway to hide the cables going
down
he also drill a hole for both the
keyboard and mouse pad nicely done
I love the dedication to the color
scheme Dean even went ahead and skinned
his Focusrite audio interface and black
carbon fiber to cover the red accents
for audio he's got a pair of audio
engine a 2 plus speakers Andy cursor
void Pro RGB headset which is hanging on
his xbox 1s he does use a 13 inch
MacBook Pro for when he is on the go but
the setup is powered by a beautiful
custom built PC inside the O 11 dynamic
case from Lee and Lee which I did a
razor buildin if you guys remembered
super-clean job with the custom sleeve
cables and extra points for painting the
PC I brackets and the SSD trays you
can't get cleaner than this very
impressive and super clean setup thank
you once again for showing off your
setup last but not least is my boy Zack
returning back to the show with a
revamped setup at his new studio he is
also a winner of the twelfth seal of
approval which he proudly displays in
his studio he made a little video for us
to show off his new setup so let's check
it out
the
so this is a sit and stand set up using
the vivo frame and a tabletop with three
monitors mounted on it and notice how he
mounted the 27 inch monitors on the
sides in order to make them fit I also
love how he managed the cables so he
drill a hole in the wall and installed
some sort of a belt so that the cables
can expand with the desk as he raises or
lowers it super super clean the rest of
the wires are perfectly organized
underneath the desk with zip ties 3m
tape and brackets to keep the wires from
hanging down beautiful work as always
the keyboard and mouse are the same he's
still using the K 70 and the dark core
from coarser but with the addition of
the elgato string Beck one of the more
unusual changes from his previous setup
is the placement of the speakers so he
mounted them sideways against the
cabinet's but he positioned them in the
direction of where he's sitting as
bizarre as that looks it's actually
practical and of course we can't forget
the centerpiece that awesome gaming PC
mounted against the wood themed
wallpaper it's got the same specs as
before we got a 1950 X thread Ripper 64
gigs of ram and two custom painted GTX
1080s so behind his main setup he has a
nother desk setup where he does his
voiceovers and PC builds for his YouTube
channel which you guys should check out
by the way I'll jump a link below
there's a custom stand behind it that he
built to hold his ACF for his gaming
laptop when not in use
I love how Zack kept everything either
black or blue in his studio to stay
consistent with his color scheme it's
always crazy to see how far your setup
has come from the very beginning when
you started off with a cramped desk the
evolution of your setup is definitely
inspirational Zac if I can give you
another seal of approval I would but it
will literally just be the same thing so
instead I'm just giving you another
virtual Seal of Approval congratulations
once again an awfully setup and thanks
again for coming back on the show once
again we give a huge thanks to omae's

this episode as always make sure you
guys comment below on who has the best
desk setup and if you guys like to see
