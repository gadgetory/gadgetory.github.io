unlocking company the fastest and most
affordable way to unlock your phone what
is up you guys it's ed from Texas and
today we are going to take a look at the
new beats solo2 headphones you can pick
one up for 200 bucks in six possible
colors I will leave links in the
description below for those of you that
are interested believe it or not but
this is the cheapest pair of headphones
you can buy from beats so sign wise I'm
not expecting the same quality that
comes with they're more expensive
headphones but we will have to unbox
this and find out I went with the red
model because red and black are my
favorite color combinations and
everything that I own is either in red
or black or both so I try and keep that
thing going for all my equipment so
removing the cover we are greeted with
their usual message that says change the
way you hear sound and below this flap
are the headphones and some accessories
beats decided to use the same headphone
case as their original solos so nothing
new here moving further down you will
find some warranty information the beats
stickers and the headphone jack with
volume control since these are made for
the Apple devices the volume control
feature does not work with Android
devices and fortunately beats also
included their usual carabiner clip
which you can use with the headphone
case so as I said before these are the
cheapest pair of beat headphones you can
buy mostly because they are made of
plastic now if I were to compare these
to the SMS Audio Street by 58 phones I
would definitely say that these
headphones feel more premium even though
both are made out of plastic they come
in a glossy finish and are very light in
weight the cushions are also very soft
some of the softest cushions I have ever
wanted to be honest you can wear these
for hours without realising that they
are on your head something I have not
yet experienced with other headphones
then I mentioned that they are flexible
yep just like the SMS audio headphones
these are built to withstand pretty much
anything the ear cups also allow for
less sound leakage but there is still a
fair amount since these are on on ear
design instead of the over the ear we
don't recommend listening to these at
anything over 70% in some
we're like a library but anywhere else
where there is ambient noise should work
just fine
speaking about sound beats really had
toned down the bass and added more to
the lows and highs the sound as always
sounds crisp one thing to take a note
here is even though these headphones do
not feature active sound isolation they
do an awesome job of getting rid of
noise outside of the ear cups when you
pump the volume up the outside world
becomes completely mute anything over
70% is the sweet range where you can
just mute out the people sitting next to
you in the bus or completely isolate
yourself in the gym I wouldn't buy these
headphones if I was an audiophile or if
I was on a tight budget and wanted to
get something that gave me the most bang
for my buck
but the solo twos do offer great noise
isolation and great audio experience you
can really get lost in your music with
these headphones and if you're looking
for a great pair of workout headphones
then I could definitely recommend these
they are comfortable and well designed
and they are also small enough to be
able to carry around without much hassle
so what do you guys think about the solo
twos is this something you might drop
200 bucks on let me know in the comment
section down below this is at thumbtack
source and I will see you next time
this guy's loaded
ready let's close this
little model banana on the ground
you
let's be true swab face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
