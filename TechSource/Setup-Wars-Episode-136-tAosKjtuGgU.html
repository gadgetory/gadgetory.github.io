you're watching this on the day that it
launched then it would be January 1st
the first day of a brand new year and I
just want to take this time and wish you
guys a very happy new year and I hope
that 2018 becomes the best year yet
for you guys whether you're gonna be
accomplishing your goals that year or at
the very least one step closer to
achieving your goals or dreams I do want
to give each thanks to my loyal
subscribers out there who support me on
every single one of my videos regardless
of the type of content you guys are the
true MVP to this channels growth I think
last month we finished very close to 8
million views and we racked up at least
30,000 subscribers which is insane and I
plan to keep that momentum going
throughout 2018 as well my plan for 2018
is to bring better content for you guys
and also relaunch some of the previous
series that I stopped doing like the
overpriced tech which I know a lot of
you guys keep asking me for PC Wars and
of course the most popular series still
on the channel which is the ultimate
desk setup the last one I did was a
Wolverine setup and it was very awesome
I think it's over a million views now
check it out in case you guys missed it
but I have some really awesome ideas on
the next few desk setups and I'm really
excited to bring those to you guys and
finally I do want to give a huge huge
thanks to every single person who
supported Tamar and her family I created
a GoFundMe and every single person that
contributed you guys are seriously
amazing I really underestimated the
support for my subscribers and from the
bottom of my heart I truly truly
appreciate you guys thank you so much
for the support
long story short tomorrow is one of my
family members in Armenia living in very
poor conditions and I created a GoFundMe
to help support their family and also to
get them through Christmas because you
know I feel really bad I did contribute
to them a very good amount offline via
MoneyGram but I decided to make a
separate GoFundMe and see if my
subscribers can pitch in and help as
well
but if you guys want to check that out
I'll drop a link below it is not
required at all but again I do want to
give a huge huge things you guys have no
idea how amazing that was huge thanks to
every single person that can
I'd love to keep a track and a list of
people who contribute to things like
that so if you do contribute it please
forward me the receipt now I can write
your name down and stuff so anyways I'm
sorry feel very long intro I just
there's some stuff I needed to say
because this is the first year of 2018
but anyways welcome to set up or it's
episode 136 let the set of words finally
begin kicking off the episode is barry
from the philippines and his sick triple
monitor setup that he uses for
productivity and light gaming the first
thing i noticed from the setup is
actually the keyboard and that's hanging
from the wall and i have no idea why i
mean it's nothing crazy i don't know why
it sticks out I guess I've just never
seen it before but anyways he's rocking
to Lenovo monitors that are hooked up
against the wall and we got the late
2013 iMac which is powering the setup
the desk he's using is actually a dining
table and there's definitely a lot going
on there but Barry did a great job
organizing everything he's using the
eraser BlackWidow chroma keyboard that
he uses for gaming apparently while he
uses the logitech k7 50 solar-powered
keyboard for productivity he also has an
apple wireless keyboard that he uses
with the Apple TV he's got a few mice to
choose from the Razer mama chroma for
gaming and the Apple Magic Mouse for
productivity and he's using the eraser
Firefly mousepad excellent work with the
wire management from the keyboard and
mouse pad by the way some other things
on the desk include his echo dot both of
his smartphones and a few Star Wars
figurines for a balance for audio he's
got quite the setup
he's got the Edifier X 600 speaker
system that he mounted against the wall
he's also mounted the 80/20 35
microphone and boom arm against the wall
which is genius and he also has a few
selection of headphones the v-moda m100
crossfades which he uses for music and
gaming and the Bose QuietComfort 20 5s
for when the neighbor's dogs are barking
so let me get the straight you got
headphones just to block out the noise
of the dogs that's pretty badass
speaking of audio he's also using the
LG home theater system for his
entertainment setup which is right
behind his actual setup and over here
he's got the 40 inch Samsung TV hooked
up against the wall which he uses to
watch videos through the Apple TV and
also game on his consoles he's rocking
both ps3 and xbox 360 which are wrapped
in carbon fiber skins unfortunately I
don't have a picture of that K Weismann
is immaculate he's done such a great job
and you guys can tell he spent some time
perfecting this he even has a cable box
underneath here and a UPS for protection
against blackouts
I love Barry's attention to detail
there's some stuff in here that you
probably didn't even notice like adding
cable clips for his XLR cable next to
the audio interface and even cable clips
for the wires on the ground
he's even installed while raceways to
cover up the cables from the
wall-mounted speakers and the TV it
really does seem like Barry cares a lot
about his setup I'm actually very
impressed with this setup Thank You
Barry for entering and if you guys want
to check out more of his stuff I'll drop
a link to his YouTube channel down below
he doesn't upload often but he does have
some quality content that I think you
guys might enjoy next up is Simon from
Canada and his setup for studying gaming
and doing YouTube if reading the
wallpaper wasn't obvious enough he was
going for a minimalistic setup featuring
a single 27-inch monitor from LG that's
hooked up to the Ergo Tron pole mount
and below that he's rocking the poker
60% mechanical keyboard with custom key
caps and the Logitech G 904 audio is
using a pair of audio engine 82 plus
speakers and the Sennheiser HD 598
headphones which are hanging from the
side of the desk speaking of the desk I
kind of like it he's using the anthro
desk sit and stand base with the stained
curtain tabletop for Mike here I'm not a
big fan of wood tabletops as you guys
already know but this actually looks
pretty good
great work with the cable management I
love the use of these Signum rack and
the LED strips and we also have the
Focusrite audio interface attached under
here which he uses with his HD 598
headphones and finally we got the PC
powering it all which is built inside
this tiny cursor 380
case and it features the 4790k and a
single EVGA GTX 1070 with 16 gigs of ram
a very clean and minimalistic setup with
purpose Thank You Simon for entering
sticking on the topic of minimalistic
setups we got Toby coming from Austria
he saved his money for five years in
order to put together to set up from
scratch he is now 16 which means that he
started saving when he was just 11 the
result a setup built for gaming and
editing video featuring an ultra ride
from Samsung the Logitech G 510 keyboard
and the Rho cation mouse
he's also rocking my favourite pair of
speakers in the world the e Luna
eclipsed e 25 s and white which look
awesome by the way he does have a mic
setup with the rode nt1-a that's hooked
up to a boom arm and his Bayer dynamic
DT 770 Pro headphones that are hanging
from underneath the desk pretty good
work with the cable management even
though it doesn't look that good all the
cables are off the ground so I can't
really complain here and finally the PC
powering everything has a 77 in decay
and the MSI GTX 1080 I think the only
thing that I'm impressed about is the
fact that you had this much self-control
to save your money for five freaking
years and damn has it paid off great
work and thank you Toby for entering
Toby number 2 is up next and for some
reason his setup looks very familiar
but I can't really tell if he's been on
the show or not so I decided to include
it anyways toby is from unic germany and
this is his gaming and productivity
setup featuring two HP monitors he's
also got the cherry DW 8000 keyboard and
the mouse combo with the philips
universim boombox
that's pretty much it on a desk I love
that he used some sort of plank to
support the boombox since there wasn't
enough space on his desk that's
interesting another cool modification
that Toby did to his desk was adding
some sort of spacer between his desk
drawer and the table to give it a
levitating effect and actually use that
extra space to throw in some RGB lights
which look very nice by the way it also
looks like Toby is a car enthusiast
judging by the wallpaper and the
collection of cars on the shelf to his
right very clean work underneath the
desk and you even managed to hide your
PC
so that no one can make fun of you I
mean I don't blame you
it's a prebuilt and it's from HP yeah a
very clean and straightforward setup
Thank You Toby number two for entering
and by the way HP if you're watching I
don't hate you if you guys are looking
for a sponsor hit me up
wrapping up the episode is Zack and his
gaming setup featuring a 25 inch monitor
from Acer the Thermaltake Challenger
prime keyboard and the CyberPower gaming
mouse for audio is rocking a toner mic
and the blue fire gaming headset and a
pair of cyber acoustic speakers with a
subwoofer I gotta say for a
twelve-year-old this setup is badass
I mean you got pretty much everything
you need you got speakers headphones a
microphone and a solid gaming rig if I
say so myself
it's running on the r5 1400 and an msi
RX 588 gigabyte variant not bad at all
if a 12 year old can keep a setup this
clean and not have a bunch of wires
sticking all over the place then I
shouldn't see a grown-ass man with
crappy cable management anywhere you
guys have no excuse this is a very
simple cookie cutter setup but it works
and I'm very impressed that you managed
to keep it very clean Thank You Zack for
entering and that pretty much wraps up
this video as always make sure you guys
drop your kukuku let's drop your
comments down below and vote and who you
think has the best best setup and i'll
announce the winners on my social media
platforms again guys I wish you a very
happy new year and I hope that 2018 is
the best year yet
that's pretty much it I'm out of here
thank you so much for watching I love
your faces and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
