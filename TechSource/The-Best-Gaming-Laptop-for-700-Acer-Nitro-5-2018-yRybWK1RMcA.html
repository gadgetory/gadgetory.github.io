are always trying to find the most
performance with the lowest costs the
question is always how much performance
can I get out of a laptop by paying the
least amount possible right now in terms
of just performance for a dollar this is
actually the best laptop for the money
you get the new 8th gen I 580 300 H
processor 8 gigs of ram and the nvidia
gtx 1050 TI for $700 this is currently
the lowest price you can find on a
gaming laptop with these exact specs
it's also exclusively available at Best
Buy and I think it's on sale too which
explains the extra $100 off now I don't
know how long that sells gonna be for
but even for $800 and the specs you're
getting this is a pretty good deal aside
from the specs on paper is a laptop any
good let's start off with the build
which is actually one of the things I
like about the laptop it's got an old
black theme with the faint red accents
for the hinge and a brushed aluminum
look it also doesn't scream gamer which
is good because I prefer a more cleaner
looking laptops instead of the
aggressive gamer look the build itself
is mostly plastic as expected for the
price it was a good amount of flex for
the screen and slight bowing on the
keyboard but nothing out of the ordinary
now the lid doesn't necessarily open
easily with one hand which is what I
would have liked but the hinge itself is
built really well I do like the keyboard
the keys itself are backlit and they're
spaced nicely I'm very picky when it
comes to laptop keyboards sometimes the
right shift key is hard to reach on
other laptops but here it's perfect the
only other key after reach out a little
bit for is the backspace but it's not a
deal-breaker one thing I notice while
typing is that the keys have a
relatively longer travel compared to
other high-end keyboards the trackpad
however is nice it's got windows
precision drivers very accurate no
complaints it's also got a good amount
of port selection on one side we got 2
USB ports with the headphone jack and on
the other side is the SD card reader
HDMI and the USB type-c
the screen is really nice it's 1080p IPS
with great viewing angles it also gets
pretty bright at 2:18 it's so if you're
playing next to a window or any source
of light then you'll be fine I wouldn't
recommend that for color sensitive work
because the panel itself is not that
accurate
now this laptop only comes with a 256
bita says the but it's easy to add more
storage just pop off a few screws and
you get access to the RAM and the SSD
near the back the battery is a 48 watt
hour battery and I'm getting a little
over 4 hours of use with a screen
brightness of 100 nits and the balanced
power plan so depending on what settings
you have the laptop on you'll either get
slightly more or less but expect around
4 hours of solid battery life on this
thing now the speakers are located on
the bottom of the laptop and they're
actually pretty good they get pretty
loud they're nice and bacey with decent
highs for a gaming laptop I was actually
pretty impressed all right let's talk
performance with the 1050 Ti I was able
to game comfortably over 60 fps and
fortnight on high settings typically I
liked the game over an hour just to see
if there's any throttling present but
there is none that I can see the CPU
temps were in the high 80s but it didn't
affect performance
gameplay was smooth and I was getting
anywhere from 60 to 80 FPS consistently
that's also when the fence kick up and
become audible it's nothing too crazy so
if you're playing with headphones on
then it won't bother you now
counter-strike was a different story
because it's a less demanding game so I
was able to hit well over 100 fps and
max settings also there was no
throttling present the CPU remained that
are consistent 3.9 gigahertz under 90
degrees Celsius I also ran a 3d mark
stress test a few times to double-check
and make sure that there isn't any
throttling present and all the numbers
look healthy we got steady clock speeds
and temperatures across the board the
reason why I'm checking for throttling
so much is because last year's model was
known to have thermal throttling issues
with the CPU but for some reason they
fixed it with this year's eighth
generation iteration that's interesting
because the fan design is still the same
now for productivity this laptop is also
really good I was able to render out a
10 minute 4k file in a little over 12
minutes editing the 4k files were pretty
smooth for the most part I did set the
playback to have quality and scrubbing
through the timeline adding color
grading transitions and other effects or
overall a positive experience I didn't
notice any major lagging or stuttering
so the cool thing about the nitro 5
laptop is that it comes with nitro
scents pre-installed this program
basically allows you to control
fans feed on both CPU and GPU so I did
some testing I cranked up the CPU fan to
max and it actually lowered the maximum
temperature on the CPU by a few degrees
in exchange for a much louder fan noise
so that's kind of the trade-off you get
with it cooler temps louder fan noise
but if you are gonna be cranking it up
to max I'd strongly recommend using some
really nice headphones with noise
isolation otherwise you will hear it
increasing the fan speed doesn't
necessarily improve performance all it
does is really lower the temperatures
for both the CPU and GPU in fact I
tested this by rendering out the same 4k
file in Vegas with max fans and there
was no difference in rendering times
so in conclusion for the price and I'm
talking about the $70 price tag this is
a very solid laptop that can be used for
gaming and productivity if you guys can
pick this up for $700 you are getting a
really great deal because there is no
other laptop out there with a 1050 Ti
and an eighth generation processor for
seven hundred bucks you guys can check
it out now for $800 it's still a great
laptop but it is in the tier with other
competitor laptops that come equipped
with a 1050 Ti it really comes down to
your preference at this point
do you like the laptops design if you
like the keyboard layout you like the
battery life and most importantly does
the Nitro 5 offer you the performance
that you're looking for if the answer is
yes to most of those questions then the
Nitro 5 should be on your list to check
out but anyways I pretty much it does it
for this video I'll drop a link below if
you guys want to check it out
thumbs up if you enjoy the video and as
always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
