multiple times a day with variety of
tech products so if you guys live in the
US UK in Canada and want to save money
on your next purchase consider
bookmarking dual source tech and
checking back at least once a day what's
up guys its that from tech source and
welcome to another episode of cool tech
right here on the channel but guys I'm
not gonna lie this time we have some
really cool tech to show off and as
always you can find all the links down
below without wasting more time let's
dive right in so starting up depa soda
we have something I've been using the
past year or so and recently they've
actually added some cool features so
this is us the first smart car charger
that offers a ton of Awesome features
first off it has two reversible USB
ports one on each side not only can you
plug in your USB cable in any direction
but it can also charge phones and
tablets at two times the speed of
average car chargers and that's thanks
to its powerful smart chip that's built
inside so what this device does is it
helps you locate your parked car among
other useful features you simply plug it
in to your car's lighter socket and
download the app on your iPhone or
Android smartphone once you park your
car and shut off the engine the app will
send you a notification stating that the
location was either saved successfully
or not in my experience parking on the
ground or large multi-story parking lots
seemed to be hit or miss sometimes since
GPS works poorly in concrete structures
everywhere else out in the open
especially it works 100% of the time
it's perfect for theme parks shopping
malls stadiums and pretty much any
outdoor event additionally after you get
the notification it will also give you
an option to set a parking timer so
let's say you park next to a meter or
one of those times parking lots well you
can basically set a timer within the app
to notify you so that you don't go over
and end up paying the ticket the locator
is really easy to use and it's fairly
accurate from my past year of using the
unit it does take quite a few seconds to
update the distance as you're walking
but once you do get within 30 feet of
your car the app will let you know
and after that it's a matter of just
looking around until you locate your car
now if the compass doesn't help you out
you can also pull up the last-known
location of your vehicle using the map
as Plan B something they just added
recently was ability to add additional
Zeus units for people that have multiple
cars some other cool features on the app
include a battery monitor which pretty
much keeps track of your battery health
from the past ninety days and finally
there's an option to share your location
with your friends or family that also
haves us installed from my past year
using this I've grown to love it and it
has given me a peace of mind it's
definitely a must-have if any of you
guys on a car this next item is perfect
for anyone that's in school or someone
who writes a lot this is the wave smart
notebook and what this thing does will
impress you at first glance it looks
like a regular notebook but it's far
from it the best feature about this
notebook is that you can erase
everything in it by throwing it in the
microwave let's say you're running out
of pages or you simply want to start
over with a fresh notebook well all you
have to do is fill up a mug with some
water put the notebook in the microwave
and place the mug on top of the notebook
after about a minute take out the
notebook flip it on its other side and
place the mug back on for another full
minute once the wave logo transitions
from blue to white that means it's time
to take it out as you can see here none
of my drawings are on any of the pages
and they've all been erased now do keep
in mind that although this is very
effective you will still get some
leftover lines from previous drawings or
notes it all depends on how hard you
press while writing or how deep it is
inside the notebook the deeper it is the
more lines will be visible you can also
manually erase them with the other end
of this pen which comes with a notebook
now this isn't a regular eraser guys
it's specifically made for this notebook
and I believe they use some heat
sensitive technology to make this happen
it doesn't even stop there you can also
scan each page using the app on your
smart phone and it will automatically
save and send that picture to wherever
you want if you pay attention to the
bottom of each page you will find a set
of icons well basically you can
configure each icon to a specific
location within the app for example if
the rocket logo is checked
I want the images to be sent to my
Dropbox account and let's say if the
diamond icon is checked I want the image
sent to my iCloud
and so on the scanning isn't always
accurate and sometimes it would take me
a few minutes to scan a page but when it
does work it's awesome the image quality
also suffers a bit when being
transferred over but that's to be
expected
it's almost impossible to transfer over
the original image and that pretty much
goes for anything but it's good enough
to see what you have written or drawn on
the notebook the wave notebook is far
from perfect but for being first of its
kind and only around $25 I think it's an
excellent item for anyone who goes to
school next up we have Felix and it
pretty much does an awesome job holding
up your tablet it comes in a variety of
colors and what I really like about this
is the fact that you can adjust the
angle by sliding it up or down it's very
easy this here is a nine point seven
inch iPad air 2 and it's holding up just
fine
even at landscape mode so I believe this
would work with any tablet on there 11
inches if you're going to use them in
landscape mode now if you're going to be
using a tablet in vertical mode then it
can support practically any size one
thing to keep in mind is that the hands
are not as wide so if you have a tablet
that has a very bulky case on it then
unfortunately it won't work if you have
a very thin bumper or no case at all
then it will work just fine if you're
looking for an awesome tablet holder for
other ten bucks and this is something I
highly recommend next up we have a very
simple gadget that is very useful to
have regardless of who you are this here
is a six in one charging cable keychain
so there are two micro USBs one
Lightning one mini USB one type-c and a
regular USB cable this is perfect for
anyone who has multiple devices so
instead of having to carry around two or
three different cables you can
substitute them for this the regular USB
can be used to either charge your
devices or transfer data now let us come
with a clip so you can hook it up to
your keychain making it the perfect
all-in-one travel charging and syncing
cable speaking of traveling this next
one is now my official travel mouse that
I carry around with me as most of you
guys know I hate using a trackpad on
laptops because of the inconvenience and
I also hate carrying around a full size
Mouse well this changes today because
this miniature optical USB mouse is all
I need
I'm actually surprised at how well this
thing works it's extremely responsive
with no lag and it gets
job done it literally performs like a
full-size Mouse the fact that it's
extremely tiny and features a
retractable cable is perfect for travel
now obviously I wouldn't pull this out
and start playing cs:go in tournaments
but for around $5 and regular everyday
tasks this thing is a lifesaver
last but not least we have a smart lab
with a built-in speaker I'm just gonna
start off by saying the sound quality
isn't the best on this it's lacking bass
and clarity however it does get pretty
loud but the reason I'm featuring this
in the video is because it's pretty cool
tapping on the speaker will cycle
through five different colors and doing
a long press will give you the option to
select the brightness level other than
that there's really nothing else that
stands out in the front of the speaker
you get the usual media buttons and
behind that you can find a micro SD card
slot auxilary and charging port here's a
quick sound sample in case you're
interested
but that'll do for this episode as
always if you guys enjoy these monthly
cool tech videos please hit that like
button to show your support
let's see if you can get this video up
to ten thousand likes that would be
amazing
as always if you guys are interested in
