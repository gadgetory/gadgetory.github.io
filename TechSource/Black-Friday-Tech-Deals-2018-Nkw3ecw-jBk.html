guys and if you're smart enough you'll
skip those ridiculous lines outside and
you will buy your tech online like the
rest of us in this video I'm gonna go
over some awesome deals on some of my
favorite tech out there and I'm also
gonna be doing a cyber monday deals
video which you guys can expect any
couple days as well so stick around for
that
so kicking off the episode we're gonna
start off with the Colgate smart
electric toothbrush believe it or not
I've been brushing my teeth with the
Colgate electric toothbrush for the past
two years so when they reached out to
sponsor this segment of the video I had
no problem with it so what makes this
smart toothbrush so smart is that a maps
your mouth using these smart sensors and
it keeps track of every tooth as you
brush it works with the Colgate Connect
app which is available on both iOS and
Android and through here you can get
feedback on how and where your brushing
technique needs work this is a really
cool because you can actually see the
exact spots that you missed while
brushing and did you guys know that the
average person only brushes around 60
percent of their mouth I didn't believe
that number until I started using the
toothbrush and check this out guys my
first my very first brush I got 65
percent of the surface covered so that
number is actually pretty accurate so
with the e-1 toothbrush you can finally
get a complete brush it even has games
for the little ones to help form good
brushing habits so it's perfect for kids
and adults the toothbrush itself is very
sleek and lightweight that it comes with
two brush heads which can be easily
replaced another thing I would like
about the e1 toothbrush is that a store
is 30 days of brushing in the app so you
don't have to constantly have the phone
in front of you while you're brushing
your teeth you can just see it with your
app and then check it whenever you want
if you guys are still using the regular
toothbrush I think it's time to finally
upgrade and switch to an electric
toothbrush and I think the e one from
Colgate is an awesome buy especially on
Black Friday so definitely check it out
if you guys are interested I'll drop a
link to it down below next up on the
list is a gaming PC from iBUYPOWER
now I always recommend building over
buying a prebuilt but if you're gonna
buy a prebuilt this is the only time I
recommend it because I buy power is
having some crazy deals on the website
like their gaming ready system which
comes with an i-5 8400
eight gigs of ram and the msi gtx 1060
the system is going for $7.99 right now
for Black Friday which is a really great
deal because I put together a similar
spec PC and it came out to around eight
hundred and sixty dollars without a CD
key and no keyboard and mouse so if you
guys do add that to the total it will be
well over nine hundred dollars so in
this case you're saving at least a
hundred dollars on the iBUYPOWER PC
don't forget that you guys still get the
standard three year warranty on these
you get three years labor and one of
your parts should anything go wrong with
your PC now the other power PC itself
doesn't look bad it's a pretty clean
build I mean obviously you can split it
up by adding some extension cables later
down the line but it's not a bad looking
PC you're definitely not getting a
Frankenstein PC with a bunch of random
parts in terms of performance the GTX
1060 can get you over 60 FPS across most
triple-a titles and high settings
playing games like black ops pipe g4
Knight you name it there's one thing I
do want to mention about the PC and that
is feature expandability
if you guys want to upgrade the cpu to
an unlocked processor layer down the
line unfortunately you can't because
this is a lock chipset so unfortunately
you do have to swap out the motherboard
and the CPU if you want to upgrade but
the good news is that it is a mid tower
chassis so will support up to a full ATX
motherboard should you upgrade you also
get a really good looking case it's very
similar to the NZXT s340 you get the
tempered all glass side panel with RGB
lighting in the front which also has
this brushed aluminum look to it which i
think looks pretty cool well yeah if you
guys are saving your hard-earned money
and looking to buy a prebuilt gaming PC
then make sure to check them out they're
gaming ready systems ship out the same
day and have free 2-day delivery so you
can start gaming as soon as possible
next up on the list is the popular dream
screen I'm sure most of you already have
seen this on YouTube but for those who
haven't
it's basically a backlighting kit for
your TV they recently came out with a 4k
TV option and let's just say I love this
thing it's super easy to setup just hook
up the LED strips behind your TV and
using the hub connect the strips and the
HDMI cable to your TV finally you'll
need to download the app and sync the
lights together and through here you can
control the lights behind the TV
manually always set it to either video
or music mode now if you put it on video
mode it will do its best to match the
colors of whatever you're watching to
reflect on the LED strips which looks
really cool this also works with gaming
also and pretty much anything that has
an HDMI cable you plug it straight into
the HDMI port on the hub and you're good
to go
alternatively you can set it to music
and the lights will change according to
the beat of the music that you're
listening to I think it's a pretty cool
piece of text not only spice up the TV
but also the room altogether they do
have a pretty cool deal for Black Friday
so check it out if you guys are
interested last but not least we got
some good old PC parts for those of you
that are looking to spiff up your
current PC or build a new one coursers
have really black friday events starting
on november 22nd on a lot of parts
starting with some of the popular cases
like the - ATX RGB which is a very clean
micro ATX case with a tempered side
panel and two included RGB fans I'm
showing the white one in the video
because I don't have the black one but
the cell is only on the black version of
the - ATX the spec Omega RGB is also on
sale which you probably remember from my
venom gaming PC build I did for setup
makeover season - for some reason that
video they didn't hit everyone sub box
so drop a link below if you guys somehow
missed it we also got power supply deals
on the CX and our MX lineup including
the all-white RM 850 X which is going in
big red by the way coming very soon we
also got some coolers the H 100 I D 150
I and the 115 I Pro RGB which is a 280
millimeter AIO with RGB fans
speaking of RGB fans the ll1 20s from
coarser the single and triple pax are on
sale I don't have any 120 s on hand so
I'm showing you guys this but it's exact
same fan but the 120 millimeter version
instead but yeah I'll drop the full list
of course to coursers Black Friday event

out and that's pretty much it for my
Black Friday video I hope you guys
