here we go again
g2a is your one-stop shop for extremely
cheap CD keys for any game out there
never pay full price again for your
favorite games guys check it out by
clicking on the link down below what's
up guys is that back again from tech
source and as you can see I am finally
situated in my new place you guys
somehow missed my home tour you guys can
check it out by clicking on the link
somewhere above many ways I reached out
to Twitter once again and asked you guys
to ask me some questions and here they
are how are you I'm actually doing
really well thank you so much for asking
I'm well rested got a lot of work done
the past few days as you can see I'm
back to work and answering some
questions familiar guys better question
is how are you my friend
is it easy for you to edit a video easy
yes time-consuming also yes what's your
most expensive purchase and tech other
than your camera that's an easy one that
goes to the atomic Shogun which is
currently hooked up to the gh4 and you
guys can find the link to everything
including my full gear list down below
if anyone is interested can you give me
tips on how I grow my tech channel like
you please so I talked a little bit
about this and my previous ask me videos
this topic always seems to come up but
focus on consistency content and quality
not so much on the quality but more on
the content and your consistency does
matter if you're shooting in a K or just
in 1080p if your content is enjoyable to
watch people subscribe to your channel
and they will watch your videos when
growing your channel did you find there
was one video that completely took off
or just consistency actually yeah when I
first started doing setup wars the
amount of feedback was insane like the
graph of the channel was like this was
like going up and that's kind of why I
stuck to it and continue to do that
every single Monday because a lot of
guys love watching that stuff what is
your favorite part about doing YouTube
the best part about doing YouTube hands
them goes to the feedback I get for my
videos from you guys watching them but
the second most favorite thing I would
have to say by far is the amount of
sleep I get because I don't have to wake
up at a certain time I get to sleep in
so I usually wake up around
and sometimes 10 a.m. if I want to wake
up early to get videos done but sleep is
definitely one of my favorite things
about doing YouTube what's your all-time
favorite game on any console and why I
didn't answer my most favorite game of
all time which is Super Smash Bros on 64
but I'm gonna talk about the ps4 since
that's my current the console the best
game I've ever played definitely goes to
the Final Fantasy series
more specifically 13 the first and
second one the third one sucked very
disappointed and then out up and say
Kingdom Hearts is also on my favorites
just say hi to me well hello there
geesh new VDOT you how are you doing can
I be in your video you can be my video
unfortunately but your question can have
you ever found doing YouTube difficult
no YouTube is not difficult maybe
starting out yeah difficult but once you
get the ball rolling and you have the
momentum going then it's actually quite
easy to keep pumping out content how
many subscribers did you have when you
realize you could make a career out of
youtube that's actually a really good
question and I think I realized that
around the 10,000 subscriber mark I
would say do you have one video that you
are really proud of that's a really good
question Simon thank you for asking the
one video I'm really proud of the only
thing that really sticks to my head is
the EXCI on PC build I did for the month
of August leave a link down below if you
guys want to check that out but I'm
really happy with the way that turned
out I think I was actually the first PC
build video I did or I actually started
using the black borders to make it more
cinematic and I was happy back I also
spent a lot of hours on the color
grading so yeah definitely happy with
that one you're always putting up the
best PC videos would you ever show us
your gaming skills ever I am excited to
see them
funny story actually me and Bob opened
up a gaming channel like a few years ago
and I was like 700 subscribers a holy
building down below you guys when I
checked that out but I'm actually really
interested and maybe opening up a gaming
channel I'll have a gameplay type video
on tech source and I'll see how would
you guys think about that so keep an eye
out for that maybe in a month or so what
are your next purchase is going to be in
terms of camera equipments to improve
the quality of your channel that's also
a great question
Thank You Tobias you know I've been
looking at different cameras like the
Sony a7r - I think that's what it's
called the footage on that looks really
crispy if I'm gonna upgrade that's the
only camera that's probably gonna be the
final camera I'm going to upgrade
sometime next year the huge four is fine
now I mean I'm really happy with the
quality I'm getting from that but I will
never spend over six or seven thousand
on a camera because I think it's
overkill I think when it comes to
success of a channel I think that
content is more important than the
actual quality of your videos I'll never
spend like ten thousand on ff7 just
because I don't need to that's overkill
for YouTube on a skill on nine - chicken
what is your favorite color of the
alphabet I'm gonna have to see mustard
do you like Dragon Ball Z and/or you be
oh that's from my good friend Joe ow I
still don't know how to pronounce your
name man you gotta tell me how to
pronounce your name what kind of a
question is that though I mean I'm not
eight years old I'm like I used to love
you Bo when I was like in middle school
I used to be a freak collecting so many
of those cars and dueling and oh geez
I love DBZ and I will continue to love
DBZ until the day I die how did you
learn about computers
honestly trial and error I've been
building pcs for a good five years of my
life I would say and even till today
honestly I'm still learning things about
building pcs I'm not perfect but that's
basically how I learned watch a lot of
videos a lot of tutorial guides and just
hands-on lots and lots of hands-on why
did you switch to the s340 from the hz4
40 I think you might the aged for 40 but
yeah I mean there's three
that it just looks so much clean I'm
sorry - before tea is nice but I love
the s340 look plus it's also a lot more
compact but I would make that decision
any other day of the week do you plan on
expansion with your channel in the
future like new series that's actually a
good question I've been thinking about
adding a new series right basically show
you guys some really cool or not cool
but really great deals on either tech or
games or even like PC parts stuff like
that and I can bring it to you weekly
but still kind of debating if I should
really do that or not let me know if you
guys want to see stuff like that Xbox
one or ps4 the Wii U non tech related
but what are some of your favorite anime
assuming you do watch anime H come on
who doesn't watch anime DBZ definitely
number one has to be on everyone's list
then watch anime
I did like glitch until they went into
the bounty saga I was complete crap and
I stopped watching it I love Death Note
series they only had that two seasons
but awesome anime I definitely recommend
it to anyone and also attack on Titan
those are my top four I was wondering if
your previous job allowed you to fund
your YouTube dream or if you had the
money to begin with absolutely not I had
a full time job and 50% of what I made
got sunk into this YouTube channel it's
a huge investment if you or anyone else
is starting a channel especially the
tech channel it's very very expensive so
that's for the questions thank you guys
so much for sending them and I will do
this every single month so make sure you
guys are following me on Twitter because
that is where I will reach out and ask
you guys to send in your questions with
the hashtag ask Edgar there are a lot of
questions I did not answer because I've
actually answered them in my previous
videos but I'll leave a playlist linked
to my previous ask me down below if you
guys want to check that out but anyways
that's it thank you so much for watching
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
