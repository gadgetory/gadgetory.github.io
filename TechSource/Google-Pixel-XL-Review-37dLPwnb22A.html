today we are reviewing the Google pixel
XL starting off with the specs the
device is equipped with a Snapdragon 820
one processor four gigs of ram a 12
point three megapixel rear camera and an
eight megapixel front camera and the
options of 32 gig or 128 gig of storage
the pixel XL has a 5.5 inch quad HD
AMOLED panel and three thousand four
hundred and fifty million of our battery
beginning with the design the pixel XL
is housed in a minimal body that
showcases little flair it is mostly made
of aluminum with a screen and upper
portion of the back covered and Gorilla
Glass 4 it is much more durable than an
old glass phone but doesn't have the
same premium look and feel the phone
comes in a black white or blue finish
but if those aren't your style you can
grab a skin from the brand like I have
in this video I will drop a link to it
down below if you guys are interested
water resistant isn't absent from the
pixel XL but it is surprisingly
lackluster the official rating is I p53
meaning the device is barely resistant
to water and dust being able to
withstand nothing more than raindrops
Google's reasoning for this choice is
that they simply ran out of time this
would have been fine if the phone didn't
come at a premium starting at 769 in the
US the 2560 x 1440 p resolution display
is pretty much was to be expected out of
a flagship device it has an excellent
pixel density at five-thirty for ppi and
showcases very vibrant colors they are
very accurate as well not to over
saturated in any regard but still
vibrant viewing angles are also great so
color shifting shouldn't be too much of
an issue the bottom of the pixel XL has
a USB type-c port a single speaker and
microphone this is a step backwards from
last year's flagship the Nexus 6p which
had dual front-facing speakers the audio
quality is mediocre at best and doesn't
make for the best all-around media
consumption experience due to a somewhat
distorted sound especially at high
volumes in fact here is a quick test
previous Nexus devices haven't always
been known for having the best cameras
google says the pixel and pixel XL have
the best cameras on a smartphone and it
shows the twelve point three megapixel
shooter takes sharp and vibrant images
photo show great detail and a lot of
light thanks to the one point 55 micron
pixel size and the f 2 point 0 aperture
4k video is also very pleasing remaining
crisp and capturing accurate colors
especially with the electronic image
stabilization factored in the pixel XL
makes for a great on-the-go video
shooter the stabilization system works
for the most part better than what is on
most other smartphones but a jitter
effect can be noticed when you try to
pan which is quite unfortunate the
megapixel front camera also performs
pretty well it's not as wide as the
front camera on the Samsung phones but
it's still adequate the balance of color
and exposure are also very accurate
remaining consistent between each shot
the battery life on the pixel XL
exceeded my expectations the 3450
million of our battery was able to last
an entire day of usage without giving
out I'm averaging around five hours of
on-screen time without needing to charge
the phone during the day this comes from
the usual routine of web browsing
checking emails and communicating over
social media and text messaging of
course both phones also offer fast
charging which can provide up to an
additional seven hours of use with just
15 minutes of charging that's pretty
insane of course this phone will be best
characterized by the stock Android
experience google has fitted it with the
new pixel launcher and extra software
not seen on other devices the most
notable of these is the Google assistant
which will provide answers to every day
questions as well as perform other tasks
such as playing music or quickly
searching your photo library pixel
owners are also granted unlimited
storage of full resolution images on
Google photos a first for any
android-based smartphone the overall
experience with stock Android nougat is
very pleasing due to its consistent
see an overall speed when using the
device the Google pixel is definitely a
smartphone that anyone upgrading should
take note in as it offers one of the
smoothest versions of Android and will
receive updates first compared to other
flagships the pixel provides a polished
and functional smartphone experience
both in the hardware and software from
the solid build quality grade camera and
the flagship specs keeping that in mind
the poor audio quality and the lack of
real waterproofing capabilities are the
only two main gripes I have with this
device especially at this price point
but that pretty much sums up my review
of the Google pixel XL if you guys enjoy
my reviews make sure to leave a like
these do take a lot of time to create
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
