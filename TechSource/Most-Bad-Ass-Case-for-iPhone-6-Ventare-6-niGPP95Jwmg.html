have two really awesome cases to share
with you today we have the drago ventura
aluminum bumper and the tigress shell
stand case from the company track out
design let's start off by looking at the
tiger shell stand so this is a
polycarbonate snap-on case for the
iPhone 6 or 6 plus it's super
lightweight weighing at only 28 grams
and it will protect your phone from
drops or impacts unless you drop it
face-first on bumpy surfaces the reason
why this case is so great is the fact
that it has hidden kickstands but that's
not even the best part
the best part is how the kickstand
actually works so they snap together
with magnets and there are two positions
you can adjust it to first position is
at a vertical angle which is ideal if
you're faced timing with someone or
reading an article on some website
second position is landscape ideal for
watching videos or movies you can also
adjust the steepness of the angle and
have your phone lay back slightly more
you can still position it horizontally
in this mode as well if you like now the
kickstand doesn't interfere with the
phone or add any additional bulkiness to
the case and easily snaps back into
place when you are done but yeah a very
clever and neat case for those of you
that constantly watch videos or movies
on your smart phone all right now let's
take a look at the Ventura aluminum
bumper case for the iPhone 6 plus
so dracco design is a company based in
Taiwan that focuses on creating platinum
accessories and cases their philosophy
is to create accessories that are unique
in appearance and solid in performance
which by looking at this case you can
probably already tell so inside the
packaging you will receive the aluminum
bumper case and a small plastic bag
inside the bag is the hex screw driver
which is needed to install the case
there's also an instruction brochure
that will help you with the installation
but I will be going over that in the
video and lastly we have two extra
rubber mounts and screws along with the
vibrates which the aluminum bumper is
stunning it has a beautiful curved
design with flat edges that will help
with gripping the phone so it's less
likely to slip from your hands inside
the case are for shock absorbers located
on all four corners of the case which
will help absorb impact and protect your
phone from
scratches the case is also made out of
aircraft-grade aluminum which is CNC
machine for precision so taking a look
around the case we can find the aluminum
covered volume buttons located on the
left side with an opening for the
vibrate switch on the opposite side is
where the power button location is and
on the bottom there are cutouts for the
headphone jack charging port and
speakers installation is super easy just
remove the two screws located on the
bottom of the case and remove the rail
after that you have to place the vibrate
switch in the cutout right above the
volume buttons and slide in your phone
gently now make sure your phone is on
vibrate as it does make the installation
process a lot easier once it's all the
way in install the bottom bumper and you
are ready to go you know often times I
come across companies that develop
amazing premium cases but at the expense
of functionality it looks great on the
outside but it limits your use with the
phone just like the overpriced products
at element case the dracco design Ventor
case is the exception not only does it
look and feel premium but the case
doesn't interfere with your experience
the volume buttons are responsive and
really easy to press and same goes for
the power button not only do the sides
have a non-slip grip design but they are
also flat which makes it super easy to
grip the phone making it less prone to
drops the vibrate switch is also easy to
use in fact it's actually more
convenient using a switch than before
since it's sticking out a little more
the cutouts are also large enough to fit
even third-party chargers and earphones
which is a huge relief since I use my
beats along with a few power banks every
day on my 6 plus I've been using this
case for over a week now when I didn't
witness any dropped calls or poor
reception so you can rest easy if you're
worried about the bumper interfering
with your calls I'm also really
surprised how light the case is weighing
only 29 grams I can't even tell the
difference as good-looking as this case
is it still offers some protection the
bumper will protect the phone from
damages on the outside and the shock
absorbing pads will protect the phone
against scratches and impacts from the
inside the bumper is also slightly
raised on the front so even if you do
manage to drop it face-first your phone
will still be protected given that the
surface is flat and not bumpy the one
minor issue I have with the case is that
it doesn't solve the camera protruding
problem and if you like me that has
major OCD then this can really bar
but other than that minor problem this
is a phenomenal case in fact I already
dish my last case and I'm using this
permanently I can go on record and say
that this is the best looking case that
I've ever used and I've used many in the
past add some dope looking skins from
slick wraps and you have yourself a
device that will surely turn heads
anyways that's it for the video if you
guys enjoyed it feel free to hit that
like button and if you're interested in
checking out their amazing cases then I
will leave a link below to their website
they have a bunch of different colors
and other cases for different
smartphones and they even have some
pretty badass accessories as well I'll
also leave a link to slick raps if you
guys want to get yourself some badass
skins on your smartphone but anyways
thanks again for watching this is that
from tech source I will see you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
