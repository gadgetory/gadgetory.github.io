I thought I'd make a quick video and
give away some tech now I know it's been
a while since I've done a dedicated
video on just giving away some stuff so
I think it's about time so this company
called das reached out to me and asked
if they can sponsor a giveaway of a
hundred of their Bluetooth speakers and
my first reaction was what 100 of these
or one of these they want to give away a
hundred of their das touch wireless
Bluetooth speakers and if you guys
recall over a year ago I featured these
speakers and my cool tech on their 50
and since then I've been using it around
my home it's currently the number one
bestseller on Amazon and it comes in a
variety of colors but the best thing I
love about the speakers is this sound
quality you guys get crisp eyes with a
deep bass and not only does it get
extremely loud but the battery life is
also amazing it easily gets up to 12
hours of play time with its twenty two
hundred million power battery just for
today it's been featured as the deal of
the day and it's actually going for only
$24 which is a steal so if you guys want
to pick one up as a gift for someone
then now's the chance so here are the
requirements to enter for the giveaway
and actually you guys get two chances of
winning I'll be giving away 50 of these
speakers on my youtube channel for my
subscribers only and another 50 on the
nice app so for my YouTube audience all
you guys have to do is drop it comments
down below and let me know which color
speaker you guys want it does come in
several different colors and also you
guys can drop a like it's not mandatory
but if you do leave one that would be
awesome
on the night's app you can simply go
over to the giveaway tab and enter the
daus giveaway from there the winners are
nice are chosen based on who has the
most activity so basically if you watch
a lot of videos leave comments or add
products to your wish list the higher
your chances are of winning essentially
the nice app rewards people who are
active on the app but anyways I'll drop
a link to the app below it is free to
download and you guys can enter once on
YouTube and one more on the app if you
like the winners from the YouTube
comments will be announced on my Twitter
account at the end of September so
September 30th make sure you guys are
following me there because once I
announce the winner they will have 24
hours to claim their prize before I
select any other
winner and winners from the nice app

because we will have your email address

reaching out and sponsoring this video

enters I think you guys much watching
