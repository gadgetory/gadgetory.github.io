sponsoring our trip to CES 2017 if
you're looking to spice up your device
with the best skins out there then the
brand is where it's at not only do they
provide the most precise fit out there
but they offer a variety of colors and
materials to choose from for tons of
products out there if you guys are
interested in spicing up your device
make sure to visit them by clicking on
the link below huawei is known
internationally as a big smartphone
manufacturer however they aren't as
popular in the US and that's because
that wasn't their focus but now they
have their sights for the US huawei in
veiled their mate nine here at CES which
retails for around six hundred dollars
and will be available for purchase on
January sixth this phone is huge coming
in at five point nine inches but
surprisingly it doesn't feel that way
the overall footprint is identical to
the iPhone 7 plus which has a smaller
screen size it does have a resolution of
1920 by 1080 but the LCD panel is very
bright with great viewing angles I
personally prefer lower resolution
displays anyways because it impacts
battery life my first impressions of
this phone are mostly positive the
unibody metal construction feels really
nice in the hand and the combination of
the curves and chamfers give off a
premium look and feel powering the may 9
is Huawei's carrying a 960 SOC which is
an octa-core CPU and it also has an
eighth cord GPU as well in short this
thing is a beast
the main ID has one of the most powerful
CPUs in a smart phone multitasking was
also buttery smooth without lag mostly
thanks to the 4 gigs of RAM but for my
time using the device it didn't stutter
or lag one bit however I will be doing a
full review of this unit so be sure to
stick around for that
just like the mate lineup this too comes
equipped with a giant battery 4000
million power to be exact which is set
to give you two days of moderate use on
a full charge
that's pretty damn impressive the rear
camera on the main nine seems impressive
on paper with a dual 20 and 12 megapixel
shooter and an F 2.2 aperture it's able
to shoot in 4k resolution up to 30 FPS
while the 8 megapixel front-facing
camera can shoot up to 1080 only
low-light performance on the other hand
isn't the best from what I can see
compared to other more expensive
flagships but for this price point it
actually
very well but there will definitely be
more samples in my review later on the
main nine comes out of the box with
Android seven nougat however they
integrated their newest EMU i-5 on top
personally I would still prefer stock
Android on any smartphone but their skin
on the meat nine looks very clean while
we claims their skin actually keeps the
phone running smooth by analyzing and
adapting to the user's usage behaviors
which is pretty interesting in
conclusion the meat 9 looks very
promising
overall it's definitely an upgrade from
the mate 8 and I feel like Huawei is
headed in the right direction now that
their marketing is focused on the US as
well I can see great things happening
from Huawei in the coming years thank
you guys so much watching if you guys
interested in review make sure to leave
a like and I'll see you in the next
