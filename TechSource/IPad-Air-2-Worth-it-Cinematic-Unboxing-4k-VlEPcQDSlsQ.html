Texas and in this video we are going to
be taking a look at apple's ipad air 2
the second generation one before we get
into the cinematic unboxing i wanted to
go over a brief overview of the ipad or
second generation and as some of the
questions you guys might have like is it
really worth upgrading my perfectly fine
I've had to get the second generation
one on what benefits can I hope to see
from getting the newest one and
hopefully I can answer some of those so
let's get to it alright guys so the key
differences between the ipad air and the
iPad air 2 our speed security and camera
quality let's dive in and see what the
actual differences are let's start with
security the ipad air 2 come sporting
apples touch ID sensor which if you
didn't know is basically a fingerprint
scanner now this is definitely a welcome
addition and takes away the pain of
having to type in your passcode every
time you want to use your ipad and it
even works with some apps like amazon
and allows you to validate your identity
without having to log in but this to me
is not enough to get me to upgrade to
the ipad air 2 now let's talk about the
second main difference speed now this is
where Apple through around some crazy
numbers they claim that with their new
a8x chip they can achieve more than
double the graphics performance and
forty percent more CPU performance when
compared to the first generation iPad
Air's chip the a7 something else that
comes bundled in the a8x chip
motion-tracking sweet is a barometer
which is cool I guess I mean who really
needs their tablet to be able to track
their elevation seriously just imagine
seeing someone running with this thing
so that it can track how many steps you
climb but in all seriousness I guess the
barometer could be useful if some
developers start making games and apps I
can take advantage of the sensor but for
now the barometer in the iPad just seems
like a gimmick now we do not have an
iPad air first generation in the office
so we can't validate these numbers but
I'm sure there will be plenty of
youtubers and websites reporting on this
so if you're curious just do a quick
google search and something's bound to
pop up and finally the last major
difference the camera now I personally
do not know anyone who uses a tablet
take pictures but I have seen people who
do so this could be important to some of
you the new iPad air 2 comes with a 8
megapixel iSight camera
which is supposed to be a lot better
than the 5 megapixel camera included on
the first generation ipad air this mega
pixel jump plus some added features like
burst mode and slo-mo video are pretty
much the only upgrades to the camera on
the ipad air 2 and again we do not have
a first generation ipad air in house so
we cannot compare image quality between
the two but hey if you are interested in
some ipad air 2 camera tests let us know
we will be sure to get on it of course
it wouldn't be an apple product if they
didn't make it thinner and they did by
1.4 millimeters but of course by doing
this they cut the battery size and
sacrificed in battery life so should you
buy your upgrade to the ipad air 2 and
the answer is it depends if you don't
have an ipad currently and would like to
have one then the ipad air 2 is a great
place to start but on the other hand in
that same situation you could go to ebay
and get the ipad air 1 which is probably
much less and you can save some cash and
then my opinion if you already have the
first generation ipad air you shouldn't
go out and buy the second generation
ipad air unless you need to have the
latest and greatest in technology there
is really no benefit of going out and
giving extra cash for the ipad air 2 and
the to those of you who have pre ipad
air ipads basically the older
generations well my would give you i
would give the same advice as i did a
scenario one which is go for it i mean
if you don't really need a new features
you might as well get the ipad air first
generation for much cheaper and save
some cash but i mean if you have the
extra money you don't really care i mean
i don't see why you couldn't go with the
second generation but yeah that's what I
think alright guys so without any more
hesitation let's get to the cinematic
unboxing
