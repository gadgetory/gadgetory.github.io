source and in this video I'm gonna be
going over 25 tips and tricks to help
you get the most out of your iPhone 10
right off the bat if you want to quickly
glance at your lock screen or check your
notifications you can single tap on the
screen to wake the device Android users
have had something like this for years
but this is the first time for iPhone
speaking of the lock screen obviously
one of the biggest new features on the
iPhone X is face ID which is how you
unlock the device now it does work
pretty quickly and day to day use but if
you want it to recognize your face even
faster you can go into your settings
face ID and passcode and turn off
require attention for face ID this will
make it so that your eyes don't
necessarily have to be looking directly
at a device to unlock which should make
unlocking a little quicker and easier
and it might also help if you are
wearing sunglasses but keep in mind that
disabling this feature will be less
secure also from the lock screen if you
receive a notification and just want to
check who it's from without fully
unlocking the device or opening the app
and face ID misses you on the first try
you can actually get face ID to try
again by swiping the home bar just a bit
once face ID recognizes you you'll now
be able to check who the notification as
from with the lack of a physical home
button swiping up from the bottom acts
as the home gesture from any screen now
and tapping the home button used to be
how you finished editing the home screen
you can tap done in the top right corner
now but if reaching that is a bit of a
stretch you can also swipe up from the
bottom when you are finished as well on
the iPhone X launching the app switcher
can be done using a couple different new
gestures some which might work a little
better for you than others for example
you can swipe up from the bottom and
hold for a second until the phone
vibrates but if you're having trouble
nailing that down you can also swipe up
then to the right which can be a little
easier you can also swipe up from the
bottom left corner and diagonally
towards the right which also brings up
the apps which are pretty quickly in
order to quit any app you currently have
open it's now a two-step process you
first have to tap and hold on any app
until you see the red minus button in
the top left corner you can then tap
that button to quit any of the apps or
use the old method and swipe them away
what I found really cool about this
feature
you can actually tap in the same exact
location multiple times until all the
apps are closed to switch between apps
you can also just swipe left and right
on the bottom of the screen and near the
home button and you can do this within
any app that's open you can also do it
from the home screen which will bring up
the most recent app you had opened and
if you need to quickly switch between
two different apps back and forth a few
times you can use this method as your
most recently used app is constantly
reset so for example you can flip
between calculator and notes as long as
you're interacting with each app one
after the other along with all the new
swiping gestures there's also a few new
button combinations on the iPhone X a
single press of the side button will
still sleep and wake the device but
since there is no more dedicated home
button a long press of the side button
is how you launch Siri to power off the
device you can hold either the volume up
or volume down button along with the
side button which will bring up the
slide to power off alternatively you can
power down the device by going to
Settings General and at the very bottom
you will see an option to shut down if
you ever find yourself in an emergency
situation you can activate SOS mode by
holding down either of the volume
buttons and the side button for more
than three seconds you can also activate
SOS mode by quickly pressing the side
button five times from any screen this
kicks your phone back to the lock screen
and the Sables face ID as well to take a
screenshot the method is the same as
previous iPhones just hold the side
button and the volume up button together
your screen shot will be down in the
bottom left corner and from there you
can tap on it to edit save or delete it
if you ever run into issues with your
iPhone X I need to force it to power off
you can accomplish this by pressing the
volume button up then the volume down
button or vice versa and then holding a
side button for about 12 seconds this
will force the iPhone to shut down and
allow you to restart if you ever need to
put the iPhone into DFU mode to restore
it in iTunes first make sure the device
is connected to your computer via the
lightning cable and then force it to
power off after the screen goes black
press and hold the volume button down
and the side button for about 5 seconds
and then after 5 seconds release the
side button but keep holding the volume
down button after a few seconds iTunes
should tell you that the iPhone is in
the fu mode and you are ready to restore
the new 5.8 inch all that display on the
iPhone X is really nice but at that size
the aspect ratio is an unusual nineteen
point five by nine and because of this
videos tend to play with black bars on
either side and you don't always get to
take advantage of that big screen but
you can stretch videos to fill the
screen by zooming in the edge of the
video does get cut off a bit but at
least you get to use the entire screen
real estate when watching videos also
when in landscape mode the home bar
moves to the bottom edge of the screen
rather than the usual bottom edge of the
screen in portrait mode and swiping up
will bring you back home even with that
notch at the top of the screen you can
still tap the top edge of the display to
quickly scroll to the top of any page
just like any other iPhone the tablet
screen is also where you can access the
Notification Center pulling down from
anywhere in the middle or left corner of
the screen will bring that down and you
can view any notifications you have
pulling down from the top-right corner
of the screen on the other hand is how
you can access control center and you'll
notice that inside the control center is
where you'll find a battery percentage
there's no longer any way to get it to
display in the status bar like before
which is a little inconvenient so inside
a control center you can 3d touch on
many of the icons to expand them and get
more options for example you can adjust
the brightness of the flashlight
automatically set timers enable night
shift or true tone all directly inside
the control center you can also
completely customize the icons in a
control center and add more icons from
other apps or you can even just gain
access to some of your frequently used
options to do this go into the settings
then the control center and from here
you can reorder the icons delete some of
the default ones or add anything new one
thing I do recommend adding to the
control center is screen recording with
that added you can now record anything
on your iPhone screen and when you're
done just tap on the red button at the
top left corner and the recording will
automatically be saved to your camera
roll even though the iPhone X is quite a
bit smaller than the iPhone 8 plus it
can still sometimes be tough to reach
the top corners of the screen especially
control center luckily you can enable
the reach ability feature from the
iPhone 8 plus on the iPhone 10 to do
this just go into the settings then the
general and accessibility tab and you
turn that on over here once you're done
you can simply swipe down on the home
bar and your screen will shift down to
allow you to reach the top this is super
helpful for gaining access to the
Notification Center and the control
center as you will now just need to
swipe down from about halfway up the
screen to get them rather than reaching
all the way to the top it might take
some getting used to but after you
master it it does become easy to use and
finally if you ever find yourself having
a hard time adjusting to some of the new
swiping gestures on the iPhone X you can
sort of get back the older home button
from previous iPhones using the
assistive touch under Settings General
and accessibility you can turn on
assistive touch which will add a new
on-screen button you can also customize
the button with a lot of different
options for example you can have a
single tap to be your home button and a
double tap for multitasking and a long
press for Siri and that will pretty much
give you the same feel as the old home
button what's also cool is that you can
also move the assistive touch button
anywhere on the screen for better access
to it and that pretty much wraps up this
video on my 25 tips and tricks to help
you get the most out of your iPhone 10
