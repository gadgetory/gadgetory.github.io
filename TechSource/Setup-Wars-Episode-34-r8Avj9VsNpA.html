wars if you're watching this video your
plaque is ready to go as I promised
winning the seal of approval you get the
prize money the plaque and then a
t-shirt so once the t-shirt is printed
out I'll go ahead and send it out along
with this plaque so once again I want to
congratulate you what's up guys it's
that back again from Texas and welcome
to setup wars episode 34 will you submit
your desk setup to get featured on the
channel now if you guys have been
following me on Twitter of the weekend I
posted a tweet stating that I'm no
longer accepting submissions or setup
wars because of obvious reasons I am
buried in submissions and I think you'll
take me about a year to go through all
of these submissions that I have so far
so to remedy this I'm gonna try and put
out two or even three episodes of setup
wars every single week it just depends
on how much time I have once I go
through all of these setups
I will reopen setup wars and you guys
can submit your desk setup but currently
that's what's happening and you guys can
follow me on Twitter and Instagram if
you guys want more updates but yeah with
all that said and done let the set up
wars begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always everyone's gear for the setups
will be linked down below along with
anything I recommend in this episode so
with that said here are your 5 lucky
contestants we have Jim Michael Riley
Tim and Tony congratulations for making
it to set up for its episode 34 first up
is Jim with a triple display setup we
have three Lenovo 23 inch monitors a
thermal tape poseidon z RGB keyboard and
the popular Logitech g600 2 mouse on top
of the courser extended mousepad some of
the stuff we have on the desk consists
of a pink lift glow stash a bumblebee
transformer figurine and a pair of flesh
pro media speakers clip clip uh I don't
know excellent work with cable
management I like the fact that you
attach the LED remote on the roof of the
desk as well as drilling a hole for your
keyboard wire a very clean setup with
some minor additions that add spice to
your overall setup nonetheless thank you
Jim for entering Michael is next up with
a
so we have a Productivity setup and I
get asked this before why I assume it's
a Productivity set up because of Apple
products well because who to help games
on a Mac let's be real the main purpose
of Apple products are for productivity
sure you can do some light gaming on
them but it's not a gaming setup so we
have to ace or 27 inch monitors being
powered by a 2013 Mac Pro with a
wireless Apple keyboard and trackpad and
a Mad Catz rat 9 Mouse also no desk we
have a pair of bose companion 20
speakers and some taotronics RGB LED
strips to add a little spice holy mother
of cable management such a splendid job
with all of those wires everything is
neatly wrapped and zip tied it seems
like I've actually mentioned this before
but if you decide to remove or add a
device it's going to be really annoying
to redo the cables since you have it zip
tied so I would suggest a velcro strap
instead but if you're confident that you
won't be changing this any time soon
then it's all good I would also
recommend a cable box to hide those
power strips on the bottom if you really
want to clean things up although I don't
know how I feel about your setup being
in front of a heater I'm almost positive
you don't use it otherwise it would
cause some serious damage to your PC and
cables but overall a very awesome setup
thank you Michael for entering Riley is
next up at number three we have two
different BenQ monitors at 24 inches a
Logitech g7 10 Plus keyboard and a final
Mouse 2015 paired with a mecco
Mouse bungee also on the desk you have a
pair of Logitech G 430 s's and a Mophie
Juice Pack cables aren't visible so I
can't really give you any
recommendations but I do like those
shelves against the backside of the
table it's a pretty cool place to hide
some of the stuff that you're not using
powering the set up is a 4790k clock to
four point four and a GTX 970 inside the
Magnificent H 440 case so a few things I
would recommend it seems like your setup
would work really well with a Gambia's
headphone hangar since you can just hook
it up to the corner of your monitor also
what's with the second mouse pad if
using that as some sort of a palm rest I
guess I can understand but otherwise
that and that fake revolver of yours is
taking up extra
bass other than a few minor tweaks you
have a great setup Thank You Riley for
entering tim is next up with to Asus 28
inch monitors on top of the Alex add-on
unit from Ikea that I've recommended
countless times in the past I mean you
really get the best of both worlds two
drawers to put stuff in and some space
in the middle to store something like a
laptop or audio interface on the desk we
have a logitech k310 and then Logitech T
400 touch Mouse
kala banishment is great I can see that
you made good use of that IKEA Signum
rack and under that is a pair of
headphones I can also see that you're a
huge console gamer with stacks and
stacks of ps3 and ps4 games along with
some collectibles
it doesn't even stop there we have some
custom ps4 controllers and a wall of I'm
guessing your favorite movies this
actually gave me a really good idea
thank you Tim every time I see phones
lying flat on tables I always recommend
phone stands for several reasons one it
prevents the desk and phone from being
scratched as you place it down countless
times throughout the day and two it's
more convenient looking directly at it
in a vertical standpoint when you get
notifications but overall a really great
gaming room setup thank you Tim for
entering me last but not least we have
Tony with a custom made desk set up we
have a 28 inch Acer monitor on the
bottom with a 24 inch Asus display on
top as an overhead on the desk we have a
corsair k70 5 RGB keyboard and an M 65
mouse with a pair of Harman Kardon Sam
sticks and a blue snowball mic that's
actually the same chair that Bob used
for his setup for those of you longtime
subscribers out there cable management
is awesome and I feel like building a
custom desk you get an advantage since
you can build one that makes managing
wires very easy so Tony started from
scratch and slowly built his dream desk
against that awesome red wall of his and
the other room he attached a plate
against a wall and hooked up his
wireless router and modem too which is a
genius idea powering this beast of a set
up is a custom PC inside yet another
white H 440 case running on a 4770
paired with two gtx 970 s and sli
honestly this has the potential of
winning my setup wars seal of approval
if I want for a few things but is pretty
damn close I noticed you use earbuds and
just leave them on your desk so I would
recommend some cable drops which you can
hook up to the front of your desk or
somewhere nearby to hold
earbuds in place for easy access oh
that's it was just there by accident I
also think an extended mousepad and
white would really clean up the setup
since you have that white armrest but
other than those minor mods I think your
setup is awesome as is
thank you Tony for entering sets for
