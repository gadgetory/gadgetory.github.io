and today we're going to be talking
about this pretty cool web browser
called Mac's 10 and also huge thanks to
them for sponsoring this video all right
so let's jump right into it so max 10 is
a 13 year old brand that's been making
browsers since the start
after a decade their company evolved
into Mac's 10 which is a multi-platform
browser that's fast secure and easy to
use
Maxton has now built MX 5 to upgrade
their browser into an information
assistant and take the user experience
to a whole new exciting level MX 5 is
basically a one-stop browser to give you
all the information you need
it was completely redone and features a
new dual core design that switches
between the two cores based on the
website you're on compared to before MX
5 now looks extremely sleek and modern
info box is a new key feature in MX 5
it's basically simple and easy to use
way to store anything you find online by
clicking on this little button you get a
pop-up with a few things you can do you
can save any page to your bookmarks or
you can even save an entire website to
view later by using a web content option
with a snapshot function you can take
screenshots of anything and either save
it to your computer or to your info box
home page info box is similar to
Evernote in a sense that you can have
everything you need on there and you can
organize your info in any way you want
also similar to Evernote you can take
notes and organize it accordingly info
box is also in the cloud so you can
access it in your MX 5 browser on
Windows Mac or your mobile device that's
pretty much infobox it's basically your
second brain to help you remember
whatever contents and information you
see in the browser you can filter
collect and process with it anytime and
anywhere
another feature with MX 5 is pass keeper
which is actually one of my favorites
now in pass keeper you can save all of
your accounts passwords safely so if you
ever forget them in the future you can
simply go back and find them this is
perfect if you have tons of different
accounts and can keep track of all your
passwords path keeper is the perfect
home page to view all of your accounts
and password safely in an organized
fashion so you can never forget your
password again
oh and also past keeper uses aes-256 and
additional multiple encryption methods
to ensure your passwords are stored
securely also with UML you can create a
shadow email account when you set it up
you pick your new shadow email so let's
say you go to make an account on a
website you can actually use this shadow
email instead with this new feature you
get all your real emails forwarded to
your actual email account but all the
spam emails will go to your shadow email
by entering your shadow email into
websites that actually protects you from
all personal info or your real email
from getting leaked but you still
receive the mail you want at your real
email address there's also a night mode
feature where your screen will dim
whenever you want it to this is much
easier on your eyes when you are
browsing at night and you can actually
also configure this to automatically
enable and disable at certain times with
splitview you can cut the screen into
two parts and browse two pages at the
same time which is perfect for
multitasking source sniffer is another
one of my favorites it automatically
finds all audio photos or even video on
the web page you are currently on and
actually gives you the ability to
download them also with mx-5 ad blocker
actually comes pre-installed to natively
bring you a non disturb browsing
experience and finally you can also
customize Mouse gestures to do whatever
you want making your browsing experience
customized to your liking mx-5 certainly
has a lot of great features and I see
myself using it more and more as I get
more comfortable with them but if you
guys want to give it a shot you guys can
visit Maxton comm or click on the link
down below again everything is
completely free and you guys have
nothing to lose so definitely give it a
shot and who knows maybe it'll be your
main browser but they'll go for this
video thing you guys so much for
watching as always I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
