coverage is cell cashier com they
compared iPhone prices on the internet
and give you a quick coat and the most
cash for your iPhone so go ahead and
check them out it's simple fast and
secure what is up you guys it's ed back
again from Texas and I am here to do a
complete comparison between the iPhone 6
and the iPhone 5s ever since the release
of the iPhone 4 people have been asking
for a bigger screen and now that the 6
and 6-plus have been released we will be
comparing them to its predecessor the
iPhone 5s so with that said let's start
off by looking at the specs of both
phones so the iPhone 6 has an a8 chip
running on a dual-core 1.7 gigahertz
processor with 1 gigs of RAM the iPhone
5s has an a7 chip running on a dual-core
1.3 gigahertz processor also with 1 gigs
of RAM you can pick up the iPhone 6 in
two space grey white or gold and it's
only available in either 16 64 or 128
gigabytes of storage space
the iPhone 5s on the other hand is
available in 16 32 and 64 gigabytes with
the same color options when it comes to
battery life the iPhone 6 has a 1810
milliamp battery and the iPhone 5s has a
1560 milliamp battery but what the hell
does all that mean well according to
Apple the iPhone 6 has 14 hours talktime
10 hours for internet use on LTE and 11
hours on Wi-Fi as well as 11 hours of
video playback and up to 50 hours of
audio playback the 5s can last up to 10
hours of talktime 10 hours of Internet
use on LTE or Wi-Fi 10 hours of video
playback and up to 40 hours of audio
playback Apple finally made the jump to
figure screen phones something that a
lot of people have been wanting ever
since the release of the iPhone 4 well
with the iPhone 6 people got what they
wanted a larger screen to work with
iPhone 6 has a 4.7 retina IPS display
with a resolution of 1334 by 750 and
that is a pixel per inch count of 326
the iPhone 5s on the other hand has a
4-inch
IPS display with a resolution of 11 36
by 640 with the same PPI as this
it may not look like a big difference on
paper but it is really noticeable when
holding it in your hand with someone who
has large hands like myself I can
definitely use the phone one-handed
although I do need to tilt the phone
just a little to access the top for
notifications I can't quite reach it
comfortably even though I'm right-handed
I prefer to use my phones with my left
hand instead which is pretty weird
actually and this kind of annoys me a
little bit when accessing the power
button since I do have to reposition my
hand in order to access it people that
use the right hand won't have any
problems since it comes naturally
however people with tiny hands may need
to do a little more work to access the
top and maybe even the side button the
viewing angle is also amazing no matter
how you view the screen it will always
be the same now this can be a good thing
or a bad thing the good thing is that if
you want to show a video to your friends
they can all gather around and get the
same experience no matter where they
stand
bad thing is you have to be careful what
you're watching in public since people
can easily see your screen so what about
speakers it doesn't look like Apple has
improved their speakers but we still
wanted to test them out and hear how
well it sounds on the new iPhone 6
compared to the iPhone 5s so here's a
quick demo on maximum volume
it stands 12 feet tall with razor-sharp
claws as how you letter for the weapons
of fallen warrior laws the firstborn of
each of the great leaders
a lady enjoys elegant costumes
Oh single-handedly Apple is notorious
for having thin smartphones the iPhone 6
is no exception it's thinner than the
iPhone 5s coming in at six point nine
millimeters whereas the iPhone 5s is
measured at seven point six millimeters
now terms of design the iPhone 6 has a
more circular design it feels really
smooth and it's rounded on the edges
making it natural to hold however it
does make the phone more slippery
compared to the flat edge of the iPhone
5s which is much easier to hold on to a
few things that have been changed from
the 5s are the sight volume buttons they
are no longer circular and the home
button from the top has been moved to
the right side because of the bigger
screen also on the right side Apple kept
the same SIM tray on the bottom of the
phones you will find a headphone port
lightning connector microphone and the
speakers on the front of the phones you
will find the front-facing camera the
speaker grille and the phone sensors as
always with the new iteration of the
iPhone there has to be a better camera
but how much of a difference is it
really well we actually did a complete
comparison comparing the picture and
video quality of both phones that you
can check out here in case you missed it
but on with the comparison the iPhone 6
has a new 8 megapixel iSight camera with
an aperture of 2.2 unlike the 6 plus
that has optical image stabilization the
6 remains at digital the 5s also has an
8 megapixel camera with the same
aperture and both can shoot in different
speeds of slow motion the front-facing
cameras haven't changed much at all they
are both sitting at 1.2 megapixel with
720p video recording taking a look at
the camera interface you can see pretty
much the same layout one thing I
absolutely love about the iPhone is that
all the options are on the screen and
you don't have to enter a different menu
to change the settings so starting from
the top we have the panoramic feature
moving down we have the square mode
which basically shoots the image in a
perfect square kind of self-explanatory
there we also have a regular photos
video mode slow motion and time-lapse
depending on what mode you are on there
will be additional options to the left
of the screen like swapping to the
front-facing camera
adding a timer for your photos to
in HDR and enabling or disabling the
flash also above the capture button
there is a filter that you can use to
kind of change up the theme of your
pictures if you choose to here are just
a few samples that we took from our 6 vs
5's camera comparison and like I said if
you want to watch the whole thing I will
leave a link in the description section
down below well that pretty much
concludes the comparison between the
iPhone 6 and the 5s the question that
everyone is thinking is it worth the
upgrade from a previous iPhone well if
you've been waiting for a bigger screen
since the iPhone 4 and if your phone is
too small for you then I would
definitely say yes the screen alone
would have been enough for me to upgrade
but the fact that iPhone 6 now has Apple
pay made the decision really easy for me
however if you have an Android phone and
I'm thinking about switching the answer
isn't that easy and it involves a lot of
factors I would suggest you to consider
all the factors before switching anyways
thanks for watching the video I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if so please
leave a like or a dislike as it does
help a channel a lot and if you want to
see another comparison done let me know

next video in the comment section down
