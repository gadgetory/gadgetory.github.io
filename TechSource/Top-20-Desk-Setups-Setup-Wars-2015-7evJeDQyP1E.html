set up boards this past year and what a
better way to end the year than to go
over 20 of my favorite pics from 2015
let's do this
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below let's
begin with episode 1 the setup that
started it all the first ever winner of
set-up wars which went to expert on
awesome black and red set up with 324
inch a suits martyrs I also really liked
the way the monitor riser blends in
nicely with the gear dropping straight
to episode 4 we are Raven ro with the
first ever man cave I really love this
setup because of its atmosphere I felt
like dropping everything I was doing and
just started gaming it really looks like
a cool place to chill and hang out with
friends the only thing that's missing is
a second PC setup for co-op play from
episode 7 caliber not only one with this
amazing triple display setup but also
gets my pick for the top 20 setups of
2015 simply because of the combination
of the desk the PC case and the fact
that he went with the Samsung sync
master multi display system instead of
picking up three individual monitors
Kayle management isn't the best but
everything else I really liked mark from
episode 10 easily gets to be in this
video it's one of the very few black and
white builds that I really enjoyed the
color coordination was off of the charts
great gear choices clean cable
management and the PC he was rocking was
beast the only thing I didn't like was
that random GPU just sitting in the
middle of the desk but everything else
was really pleasing to my eyeballs
who could forget valve from episode 13
easily one of the most unique setups
I've ever seen on setup wars I can't
help but to feel calm and relaxed
looking at this nature-themed setup the
wallpaper in the back plus the green
LEDs and the gaming gear really blend
well together the wallpaper on the
monitors and the green LEDs also blend
perfectly together with this entire set
up winning episode 13 was an easy task
although Aalto didn't end up winning
episode
17 LG addition I really liked his music
production setup and even though I
didn't recognize half of the gear and
equipment he used everything was so damn
organized and very clean from the
symmetry to the acoustic foams on the
walls to the cable management and the
way his desk was set up I mean
everything was flawless and if it were
up to me I would have given him the
ultrawide monitor easily of course we
all know who won episode 17 our shishun
his brother Manish made history on setup
Wars to not only receive the very first
setup war seal of approval but also end
up winning a brand new LG ultrawide
monitor for this amazing custom made
desk that they both had made in 40 days
if he just custom made logos with
built-in LEDs and the drawers have their
very own dedicated power outlets with
great cable management not only did they
win the set-up wars LG sponsored edition
but they also want the LG cardboard
dream setup edition and here's a quick
update of their setup that he actually
sent me a few days ago winner of episode
18 and my favorite setup as well is
Abdul with his breathtaking man cave
full of nerdgasm agir multiple gaming
setups across the gaming room with
enough LEDs that make any wave look like
a boring chuck-e-cheese party definitely
a really dope place to chill friends and
game all night
episode 19 was a triple monitor edition
which Yazeed ended up winning with a
unanimous decision I mean do I really
need to say any more just look at this
setup this is the best black and red
setup that I have seen on setup wars the
color coordination symmetry and cable
management easily gave Yazzie to win for
episode 19 oh let's not forget about
that beast PC episode 20 was my favorite
episode of all time not just because I
co-hosted with snowy but because to the
set ups from there were my favorite as
well I even was the runner up with an
amazing quad display black and red set
up with the Logitech racing gear set and
glossy with a beautiful triple display
setup the chrome on underarms combined
with the glossy table really made this
setup shine no pun intended
no wonder at one episode 24 episode 21
Caleb ended up taking the win with an
interesting black and green setup I
definitely haven't seen speakers quite
that size on a desk before but I think
the custom PC is actually the one who
stole the show a gorgeous black and
green custom loo build with a freaking
fan inside the power supply which is
blowing air into the case I don't even
know how he did that
who could forget episode 24 we had some
really amazing setups Shawn from
prostate gaming is no stranger to setup
wars he was featured before as a special
guest
but in episode 24 he was a contestant an
amazing white team set up with three
issues 23 inch monitors and a samsung 4k
smart TV above for console gaming I mean
this dude even has dragon balls in his
badass PC and he still didn't end up
winning that episode which should say
something
in fact the winner of episode 24 went to
none other than mahmud with a very clean
and sexy triple display setup Mahmood
was really close to receiving the setup
or seal of approval if it weren't for a
few things but nonetheless this setup is
out of the world the white backdrop and
the desk itself really contributed to
this elegant setup one of the few things
that turned me up was the stock CPU
cooler in that PC build of his Harry was
my top pick for episode 25 with that
quad display setup also having the ROG
logo was a huge plus an awesome black
and white gaming setup with great cable
management other than having a headset
on his table this was a pretty easy
decision for me for episode 27 Falco
ended up taking the win for having a
very clean white setup those extremely
thin bezels are what did it for me along
with that awesome monitor riser there
are other things that contributed to the
wind like having a micro SD card reader
mounted in the middle the white speakers
on both sides and the wireless keyboard
and mouse it's really rare that I enjoy
an Apple based productivity setup simply
because there's nothing cool or unique
about it but an episode 29 I really
liked Sebastian's setup I can't quite
figure out the real reason but maybe
it's the combination of minimalism the
cable management and that view I think
all those aspects from the set up came
together any perfect balance catching up
to the most recent episode of setup wars
on episode 30 Hyrule not only took the
win but also received a second ever
setup board seal of approval for many
reasons the very clean color-coordinated
organized setup with exceptional cable
management and that amazing water-cooled
PC to put it simply I had no reason not
to give him the seal of approval
my man Martin came in a very close
second with his impressive ultra white
setup I have not seen cable management
quite like this before and I can really
tell he spend lots of
- setup and that's one of the reasons
why he deserves to be on my top 20 list
and finally we are back to the most
recent set of boards video and the last
one for 2015
my favorite setup by far goes to Julian
with that amazing view lots of people
think it's fake because it looks
stunning but if you guys pay attention
to what's outside you can see that the
view changes from each angle also having
a projector that doubles as blinds
really made my decision easy and just by
glancing in the comments section Julian
will most likely be the winner of
episode 31 so that's it for the top 20
setups of 2015 from setup wars for 2016
would you guys like me to do a top 5
setups every three months if so let me
know by dropping a comment down below I
