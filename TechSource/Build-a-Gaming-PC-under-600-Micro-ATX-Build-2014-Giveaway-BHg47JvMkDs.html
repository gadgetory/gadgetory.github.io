and today I have a very special video to
share with all of you a lot of you been
constantly asking me to build a budget
gaming PC and do a video on it so I
finally gave it and decided to do one
the best part about this is that I'm
actually going to give this away to one
lucky person and I wanted to give a big
shout out to MS tak for pitching in and
really helping us make this giveaway
possible I will give you guys more info
on the giveaway on the next video but
for now let's take a quick look at the
parts that we chose for this build and
you guys can also find the part list in
the description down below so let's
start off by taking a look at the case
since we are going for a budget mini ATX
build we had to go with a very small
case with a low cost and that's why we
chose the HEC vigilant's micro ATX case
it's far from the best looking case out
there but for the price of only 25 bucks
we really couldn't pass it up honestly
it doesn't look that bad the case is
black with some minor red accents which
makes it stand out a little bit the
buttons on the front of the case however
are way too big for my taste and I would
have liked to see the i/o panel closer
to the top of the case but since it's a
very small Tower
I would assume it'd be ok to place it on
the table for easier access popping the
side panel out we can see that there is
plenty of space to work with however
with some negatives first off the power
supply has to be mounted on the top of
the case which is kind of old-school and
the drive bays cannot be removed which
kind of sucks if you don't end up using
them it would have been nice if it was
removable for more airflow in the case
the back of the tower however is pretty
standard you have your 4 expansion slots
and an air duct which can fit a hundred
20 millimeter fan if you choose to
replace the stock one overall it's a
great case for only $24.99 and since
this is a budget gaming PC I can't
complain so for the CPU we chose the AMD
FX 6300 because of its super low price
it comes with 6 cores and for the price
that's incredible you can also easily
overclock this bad boy up to 4 point 1
gigahertz although if you choose to go
that route I recommend you getting an
aftermarket CPU cooler just to keep the
temperatures down this is the
best bang for your buck CPU you can
currently buy it if you're building a
budget gaming PC then this is the
processor you want to go with hands down
for the motherboard we went with the
Asus m5 I'm just gonna call it m5
because that's a bunch of letters in
there
this board is an excellent choice if
you're working on a budget PC build and
for the price of 50 bucks it comes with
a lot of features it has a very solid
build it handles overclocking very well
and it can support up to 16 gigs of ram
the motherboard also has six three gigs
per second SATA ports two PCIe one slots
and a one PCI 16 slot overall this is a
really great motherboard for the price
and it's perfect for a micro ATX gaming
PC low price and a trusted brand is why
we went with the Kingston Ram sticks a
gigabytes is all we need for this PC and
with a memory of 1600 megahertz it
should be plenty for gaming we went with
two sticks of four gigabytes each to run
it in dual channel which will increase
its performance on to the GPU
we chose the gtx 750ti because of its
cost to performance ratio with GPUs
nowadays it seems like the higher the
price the less the performance boost you
get this graphics card will allow you
play games like Diablo 3 and Call of
Duty ghosts without any problems will
the max out all games obviously not but
the graphics will be better the current
consoles the card has 640 cuda cores and
comes clocked at a 1202 megahertz which
is blazing fast and with its 2 gigabytes
of gddr5 memory it should provide for
some very smooth gaming for the port's
it has two DVI and one mini HDMI but you
don't have to worry about that because
it does come with a DVI to VGA adapter
along with a mini HDMI to HDMI cable for
convenience this is definitely the card
to get if you're looking to build a
budget gaming PC for the power supply we
had to go with a brand we trust and
we've been using core Center PC use for
all of our builds and the reliability is
one of the best you can buy 430 watts is
plenty of power for this build and for
future expansion and this is the bronze
certified as well which means it will
provide power efficiency reducing the
heat in your computer system and
prolonging its life if you wanted thrown
another $10 on top you can get
modular version instead which should
keep things a bit cleaner with cable
management but for the sake of not
passing a budget for the video this will
do for now
for storage we went with a 500 gigabyte
Seagate hard drive because that's plenty
of space at least for us that is and
7200 rpm is plenty of speed especially
since we're not going to be working with
large files in the future it is possible
to add an SSD or an additional hard
drive if needed last but not least we
have to have an operating system a lot
of people disregard this part when it
comes to builds for some reason you need
an operating system to run your PC so
included in your build so we went with
Windows 7 because honestly I wasn't a
fan of 8.1 I know they are bringing the
Start menu back but for now I'm just
gonna stick with Windows 7
not to mention that won't be keeping
this for long because of the giveaway
anyways
so these are the parts we went with for
a micro ATX gaming build and if you guys
are on a budget I would strongly
recommend getting these parts the only
thing you might want to change if you
have some extra money it's probably the
case for something that looks better or
has more features but this is pretty
much a solid build as it is some other
optional parts that we threw in here for
the giveaway include a 21.5 inch monitor
from Acer a Microsoft Sidewinder x4
keyboard and a Rosewill wireless PCI
adapter so you guys can connect to the
internet wherever you are so that wraps
up the video make sure you guys hit that
subscribe button so you can get notified
when we upload the second part of this
video where we will be running
benchmarks and intense games on this PC
and see how well it performs as well as
give you guys instructions on how to
enter to win this PC thanks for watching
and I will see you in the next video
