in this video we're gonna be taking a
look at the new LG 32 G KB 850 you know
I'm just gonna call it the 850 G it's a
new 1440p g-sync monitor that has an
achievable refresh rate of 165 Hertz I
really enjoyed my time with it the past
few weeks and I thought some of you
would be interested in something like
this so let's start off with B specs
like I said it's a 1440p panel and it
has a refresh rate of 144 Hertz out of
the box but it is overclockable 265
Hertz it's not an ultra wide which was a
little weird at first because I've been
using the 38 you see 99 from LG for a
while now but I would say I adjusted to
the 16 by 9 aspect ratio fairly quickly
it also has a 5 millisecond response
time and it gets really bright at 315
it's so the monitor actually has a VA
panel which offers pretty good colors
but when looking at the screen from
sharp angles I did notice a slight color
shift I mean a VA panel is technically
better than a TN panel when it comes to
colors but if fall short when compared
to an IPS display there is no noticeable
backlight bleed which is great and the
bezels around the panel are reasonably
thin that 8 millimeters all around I
tested the panel with a spider 5 device
which is a professional monitor
calibration tool and the results are as
follows so the panel is capable of
displaying 97% of srgb 74% of the ntsc
and 78% of Adobe RGB not the highest of
numbers but being a VA panel that was
expected with the hue adjustments
through the spider utility I was
comfortable enough with the colors to
use in post-production so the monitor
stand is made out of plastic and it has
this V shape to it which as this
aggressive look and I've noticed this
across most gaming monitors along with
the overused black and red color scheme
with a click of a button you can remove
the stand to reveal a standard base
amount but what the included stand we do
get a good amount of adjustment
the back of the monitor has a black
matte plastic construction which feels
very cheap but it doesn't really matter
since you're not gonna be looking at it
all the time I do have to say that the
monitor doesn't wobble while I'm typing
so the construction might look cheap but
it's built really well the back is also
where you will find this RGB ring
something new that LG is doing this year
on some other monitor lineups at first I
thought it was a gimmick I mean why
would you add RGB lights behind a
monitor but when you actually put this
against the white wall it gives off a
light ambient effect behind your setup
which is nice because you don't have to
go out and buy extra RGB strips this can
be controlled by the wheel underneath
the front of the screen you can change
the brightness as well as cycled through
the different colors by pressing in
there's red green Cayenne magenta we
also got white daylight and dynamic
which cycles through all the colors and
also got a few other color options next
to the wheel is where you'll find a
joystick and this is how you navigate
through the menu just like the previous
monitors from LG it's very easy to
navigate and this is where you're able
to see your current settings switch
through different profiles fine-tune
settings like brightness contrast color
temperature you can even add a crosshair
to the center of the screen and most
importantly overclock a display to 165
Hertz which of course is what I did
immediately out of the box the i/o is
also on the back and we get a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack which no one
should be using at this point we also
got an HDMI 1.4 port DisplayPort 1.2 and
2 USB 3.0 ports all right let's give
into the actual usage it's hard to say
if I actually saw a noticeable
difference between 144 Hertz and a 165
Hertz panel or if it was just a placebo
I mean there's definitely more of a
difference when you're coming from a 60
Hertz panel to 144 hurts but 144 to 165
it's not so obvious even doing basic
things like browsing the internet was a
lot snappier coming from the 60 Hertz
panel that I've been using at home
playing games on ass monitor is awesome
as expected especially if you have a
high end GPU that can max games now if
you can't take advantage of 165 frames
with a 2560 by 1440 P resolution then
this monitor is not
for you it would be a complete waste of
money especially considering that this
is going for $800 it's not cheap and
it's not for everyone I said who's this
monitor for exactly well I would say
it's for those PC enthusiasts out there
looking for a well-built solid gaming
monitor with all the bells and whistles
someone who's not looking for an
ultra-wide monitor and someone who
doesn't care about any color sensitive
work it's a beast gaming monitor and
that's pretty much it Oh
it also has RGB lights in the back there
one time I need 32 inch gaming monitors
out there with 165 first refresh rate
and gsync and because of those specs
it is a premium price now if you guys
want to save money there are alternative
versions that actually have smaller
sizes with a hundred sixty five minutes
of fresh rate and gsync which I will
link below because the $800 to me
honestly is still a little steep anyways
that wraps up my review of the LG 850 G
gaming monitor if this was at all
helpful to you guys and you want to
support the channel passing a like would
be awesome and if you didn't like the
video please leave a dislike I'll jump a
link to the monitor down below if you
guys want to check it out as always I
love your faces I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
