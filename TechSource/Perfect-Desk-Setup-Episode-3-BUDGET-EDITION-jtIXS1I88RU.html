I guess that's subjective to everyone a
setup is perfect if it meets your needs
and has purpose a perfect setup for one
person may not be perfect for another
also it doesn't have to be expensive
which is why I'm focusing on a budget
setup for this episode
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the
perfect desk setup episode three
surprise is a black and red gaming setup
with budget in mind now I did spend
months researching to find the best
products for each category to not break
the bank so everything I mentioned in
this video will be linked down below in
the order that they appear also guys
everything in this setup will be given
away except the table to my subscribers
so if you want to know what to do to
enter make sure to stick around till the
end of this video but with that said
let's start with the PC that's powering
this setup but the $450 budget build
featuring the I 360 180 TX 1060 which is
capable of running most triple-a titles
over 60 fps in high settings but there
will be a build guide as well as
benchmarks on this PC on my cousins
channel so if you guys want to check
that out I'll drop a link to it down
below the desk is the popular linman
from ikea and although there is plenty
of space to keep the PC on the table I
decided to keep it underneath it for a
much cleaner look after all it doesn't
have a clear side panel anyways the
display is from sceptre and it's a 22
inch 1080p monitor that goes for only
$70 now that is an awesome deal not only
is it racer compatible but it also comes
with an HDMI port and it's also perfect
for gaming since we do get a 60 Hertz
refresh rate on a TN panel there's
nothing else out there that comes close
for this price so I have the monitor
sitting on a riser from Satechi for two
reasons one it provides extra space
underneath to store some items like a
laptop tablet or other flat devices and
two it comes with four USB 3.0
pass-through ports and audio jacks so
instead of connecting your devices to
your PC you can plug them straight to
the monitor riser for convenience things
like connecting a USB flash drive for
example is extremely convenient now for
the peripherals it was a bit tricky
because I wanted to find a solid
mechanical
keyboard that would not only match the
setup but it would also break the bank
as well ultimately my research led me to
the Gambia's Hermes keyboard and mouse
combo which actually I featured in my
cool tech of this summer video so if you
want to learn more about these make sure
to watch the video linked below
so the keyboard features cherry MX red
equivalent switches with anti-ghosting
and it comes with a Windows lock key as
well for gaming the mouse on either
hands features a 3500 DPI sensor and RGB
lighting via their software it's a very
comfortable Mouse a small footprint
makes it very easy to grab and lift and
glide smoothly across the mousepad
speaking of which for the mousepad I
picked up a dope looking black and red
one from enhanced which covers most of
the desk and provides some extra cushion
for the wrists while typing for audio I
went with 2 options a pair of Marvel
speakers and a gaming headset from the
excellent the speakers are cool and
provides decent sound and that's pretty
much it to be honest it's expecting
incredible sound and a heavy bass then
these are definitely not it remember
this is a budget setup so I had to spend
as little as possible for each product
category the Marvel speakers happen to
be one of the best for only around 15
dollars the be excellent gaming headset
on the other hand is great for around
$20 you get a solid and comfortable
gaming headset with a built-in
microphone it has large cushions around
the headband and the ear cups are large
enough to fit around most ears which
also provides great noise isolation it's
very lightweight and the sound is
actually crisp and clear to my
surprising but not much else you can ask
for from a gaming headset that cost
around $20 so when I'm not using the
headset I have it hanging in the back of
the martyr on a headphone hook that I
picked up from Amazon for only $10 it's
a cheaper way to keep them off the desk
and away from sites when I'm not using
them I did do some minor modifications
to the desk like drilling a hole
throughout the keyboard and mouse wire
through as well as installing a pencil
drawer underneath it's a great way to
clean up the surface of the desk and
keep things hidden away until you need
to use them for example I have my power
bank in here some charging cables and
even a laptop the final modification was
this gooseneck from easy account and
it's a great way to hold up your
smartphone or tablet
I decided to hook up my iPad air 2 and
use it as a second display it's more for
watching videos or checking out
feed while I'm busy using the main
monitor for work or gaming what's
awesome about to do snack is that you
can practically bend it in any direction
you want so if your desk is cluttered or
maybe it's very small and don't have
space for a tablet or a smartphone
holder then consider putting this up
instead it's a lot better of course I
have some debounce games on the tablet
so that it matches the overall theme of
this set up but if you guys want to pimp
up your device with some skins be sure
to visit the first link down below
finally let's take a look at cable
management so since the PC is located on
the ground it's a lot easier to group up
all the wires into a cable sleeve and
run them down into a cable box which has
the power strip inside no need for
velcro straps or 3m tape now the PCU is
on the desk it would be a different
story overall this is a very functional
and budget-friendly gaming setup and I
really hope you guys enjoyed it these
videos do take months to set up and plan
so I hope the wait was worth it
