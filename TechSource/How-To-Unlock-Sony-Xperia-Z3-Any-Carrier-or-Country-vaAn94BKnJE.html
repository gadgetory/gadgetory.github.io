to show you the process of locking your
sony xperia z3 smartphone so you can use
it with any carrier or country for this
demonstration I will be using my locked
t-mobile Xperia z3 and unlock it so I
can use it on my AT&amp;amp;T network but you
can use this video as a guide for any
carrier so first off we need to get the
unlock code to start the unlocking
process one of the best and most
trusting websites that I use to get all
my lock codes is the unlocking company
comm because the prices are unbeatable
and their customer service is the best
in the market so head on over to the
unlocking company comm and select your
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop down list and on the next
page go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is t-mobile before
we continue we do need the IMEI number
of the phone and the way you look that
up on your phone is to open up the dial
pad and enter in star pound zero six
pound once the phone displays the IMEI
number you have to go back on the
website and enter that in once
everything is filled out select get a
locking code and that will take you to
the final screen where you have to check
out after checking out they will email
you the unlock code the price and
delivery time of your code varies by
phone but don't worry because they do
deliver their codes much faster than any
other unlocking website so before we
continue make sure that the phone is
powered off next remove the flap on the
left side of your phone to gain access
to the SIM tray then go ahead and pull
out the SIM tray and insert in the SIM
card that you wish to use with the phone
I want to use the z3 with my AT&amp;amp;T
network so I am putting in my AT&amp;amp;T SIM
card in the phone if the SIM card has a
different size and you have to adjust it
in order for it to fit I have left a
link in the description section to show
you how that's done so after you insert
your sim in the phone go ahead and power
the phone back on once the phone boots
up a prompt will appear asking you to
enter in the lock code after entering in
the lock code that you receive from the
locking company your phone will take you
straight to the home screen and your
phone will be permanently unlocked as
you can see here I'm using my t-mobile
Xperia z3 on my AT&amp;amp;T network so that's
how you unlock your Sony Xperia z3
smartphone if this video helped you guys
