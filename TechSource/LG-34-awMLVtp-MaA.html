what's up guys it's ed from tech source
and this is the review of the 34 UC 97
monitor from LG now a few weeks ago I
reviewed its little brother the 34 um 67
which was mainly targeted towards gamers
because of its freesync technology and
2560 by 1080 P resolution which is not
only a lot easier on the graphics card
but also more affordable if you want to
check the review of that you can click
on the monitor or check the link in the
description section down below
however LG was kind enough to send me
their UC 97 model which is actually
targeted for both productivity and non
hardcore gamers as well with a beautiful
34 inch IPS display and a resolution of
34 40 by 1440 along with a slight curve
you'll be sure to have an immersive
experience while gaming and watching
movies you'll also fall in love with the
amount of horizontal pixels it has
making your workflow so much easier and
editing really fun for most people so
when you open the box you will find
several items besides the usual power
cable needed to power the monitor LG has
also included a very short DisplayPort
cable along with an HDMI cable I've also
noticed that all the cables are in white
well at least my model is which is
definitely a nice change from the usual
black cables you'll also get the base
stand and the neck piece which are both
in Chrome definitely a nice improvement
from the plastic stand and installation
is super easy just tighten two screws in
the bottom of the base and two more on
the back of the panel and you are set to
go he also threw in this neat little
plastic chrome looking cap to cover the
screws which kind of cleans up the
overall look the frame of the monitor is
also made out of plastic with a chrome
look to match the stand
however the stand won't give you much
versatility like always the only thing
you can do with it is tilt which to me
is actually plenty now even though the
monitor doesn't include a VESA mount
option they did include a mountable
bracket which allows the monitor to be
wall-mounted for those of you cool
people that don't like using stands you
also get a plastic cover for the i/o
ports on the back although it will make
accessing the ports a little
inconvenient for some that constantly
connect cables in the back
but overall a really nice addition to
keep things clean it seems like LG has
really put in some thought on the
overall aesthetics of this monitor so I
give them a huge thumbs up on that like
the previous model the navigation
control is in the form of a joystick
which again is my preferred method of
navigation and it's really easy to
access right from the center underneath
the monitor on both sides you will see
the speakers which surprisingly sound
really good compared to other built-in
speakers that I've come across and for
the i/o we have two HDMI ports one
DisplayPort and for Mac users we have
two Thunderbolt 2 ports that support
daisy chaining and two USB 3.0 ports you
will also be able to utilize the
monitors 60 Hertz refresh rate via the
HDMI the display port and the
Thunderbolt 2 ports as well so the
screen has a semi matte finish this time
around which provides a great balance
between color and contrast as well as
anti glare the bezels are also the same
from the um 95 really really thin and
perhaps the biggest change of them all
is the slight curve so how does the
curve affect the experience of the
monitor well when you look directly at a
flat widescreen monitor the colors and
objects get distorted slightly as you
move your eyes away from the center and
towards the edge of the display well
with this curved display the distance
between the monitor and your eyes remain
the same as you turn your head giving
you less visual distortion and a natural
feeling since we sit so close to our
monitors the experience you get from
sitting directly in front of a curved
display is noticeable and truly
immersive you will definitely enjoy
watching movies on this monitor and if
you're a gamer like me then you can
definitely appreciate the extra screen
real estate provided by the 21 by 9
aspect ratio gaming is wicked sharp and
smooth on the 60 Hertz refresh rate and
5 milliseconds response time display as
I said before it's not for hardcore
competitor gamers since they are
probably used to 120 and even 144 Hertz
displays but this will surely satisfy
the rest of us the fact that the bezels
are so thin makes it that much easier
for you to get lost in your game and a
truly immersive experience at that now
because this isn't a TN panel there will
be slightly more motion blur however
personally it hasn't been to a point
where it's noticeable enough
to distract me from my gaming experience
now for productivity I can't get over
how amazing this monitor is for
productivity
honestly the amount of horizontal pixels
makes me very happy as a youtuber this
made my editing sessions so much easier
and fun and yes I actually am looking
forward to editing a video now and it's
become more of a hobby now than a task
the monitor also supports srgb over 99%
reproducing beautiful vivid true-to-life
colors which makes this monitor a must
for graphic designers and photographers
overall this monitor gets a solid 10 out
of 10 for me I can't find a single thing
I dislike about it
the only minor change I wouldn't mind
seeing is having a black back panel
instead of the champagne color so that
it would match the overall theme of the
monitor and also my desk and also a 120
Hertz for fresh wait would be really
nice but that's just nitpicking and
other than that this is a very solid
monitor this is a really good example of
you get what you pay for and LG has done
it again by building another fantastic
monitor aimed for gaming and
productivity if you guys are interested
in checking this out I will leave links
below for this model along with the
other one I did recently on and if you
enjoyed this video please hit that like
button as it does help the channel a lot
and let me know what you guys think
about the monitor by dropping a comment
down below I'm interested in hearing
your thoughts anyways thanks again for
watching this is that from tech source
and as always I will see you in the next
