and welcome to the video most of you
guys have been waiting for the top 5
budget microphones under 50 bucks I will
be doing a mic test later in the video
but let's go ahead and unbox these real
quick you guys can also find everything
listed in the video down below in the
description section so starting off is
the toner mic that goes for 17 bucks
which is the cheapest condenser mic in
the video it does have a 3.5 millimeter
jack which means that all you have to do
is plug it in and start recording it
also comes with a tiny tripod to hold
the mic and position it at an angle
that's comfortable next up we have the
newer studio mic and this one comes with
an XLR to 3.5 millimeter cable a foam
cover shock mount and adapter and
finally the mic itself with a
gold-plated windscreen
if gold isn't really your color or
messes with your setups team then you
can just slap the foam cover on it and
you are set at number 3 we have the
Florian condenser mic which surprisingly
looks very similar to the newer mic but
instead you get a different color in the
box you get a USB adapter which has
inputs for both mic and headsets any
foam cover another XLR to 3.5 millimeter
cable a shock mount and the mic itself
with a blue body and silver windscreen
and number four we have one of the most
popular mics in the tech community the
blue snowball ice microphone everyone
and their mothers seem to make a big
fuss about this but I will get to the
bottom of this and figure out if this is
really one of the best budget mics out
there so in the box you will find the
headpiece which is surprisingly heavier
than I imagined in the other box you'll
find a QuickStart guide the USB cable
needed to power and connect the mic and
a tiny aluminum tripod which is
connected to the headpiece I'm
personally not a fan of a tiny tripods
because when it comes to voice recording
you can't really adjust the height
meaning you either need to raise the
desk itself or place it high enough so
that it's right in front of your mouth I
much prefer mounting the mics on a boom
arm so that not only it stays off your
desk but you can also position it at the
perfect angle for voiceovers
luckily the boom arm that I'm using for
my personal audio setup is compatible
with all the mics in this video ex
the toner and I will leave a link below
if anyone is interested in checking it
out and finally the last mic is actually
a lavalier mic from Hassan Iser that's
compatible with iPhones Androids
and even tablets so here's I'm going to
be testing the microphones I will hook
up the condenser mics to my audio rig as
if I'm going to do an actual voiceover
for one of my videos and I'll do a
voiceover by connecting the mic to my
audio interface and I'll do another
voice over using the 3.5 millimeter
cable that came with the mic the reason
why I want to show you guys the
difference between both of them because
there is a huge difference between
connecting the microphone to your audio
interface or connecting it to your PC
I'm also going to be showing you guys
with editing and without editing so you
guys can really hear the difference in
quality as far as the snowball and tone
our mic I can only connect them straight
into the PC since they don't have XLR
connections and the lavalier mic is only
compatible at smartphones and tablets so
I will use my iPhone 6 as plus to do the
mic test what's up guys is that from
Jack's source and I'm talking directly
at the toner mic and this is without
removing the background noise what's up
guys it's that from tech source and I'm
talking directly at the toner mic and
this is with the removal of the
background noise what's up guys is that
from tech source and I'm talking
directly in the Floriade mic and this is
without removing the background noise
what's up guys is that from tech source
and I'm talking directly in the flurry
on mic and this is with the background
noise removed what's up guys it's ad
from tech source and this is what it
sounds like when I hook up the Florian
mic directly into my focus right audio
interface and this is without any
editing what's up guys is that from tech
source and I'm talking directly at the
newer mic and this is without the
removal of the background noise what's
up guys is that from tech source and I'm
talking directly at the newer mic and
this is with the removal of the
background noise what's up guys is that
from tech source and I'm talking
directly at the newer mic hooked up to
my focus right audio interface and once
again this is without any editing what's
up guys it's that from tech source and
I'm talking directly at the blue
snowball mic and this is without
removing the background noise what's up
guys it's that from tech source and I'm
talking directly at the blue Yeti mic
with the removal of the background no
what's up guys is that from tech source
and I'm talking directly at the iPhone
6s plus without any editing or without
any microphones hooked up what's up guys
is that from tech source and I'm talking
with the mic hooked up on my shirt and
once again this is without any editing
and finally to give you guys a
comparison to the microphone I use for
all my voiceovers this is what it sounds
like without any editing so right off
the bat you guys can tell whatever mic I
connected to my audio interface sounded
way better that's kind of the point
these things are created to enhance the
overall sound quality honestly if we're
up to me I would save up for the
Focusrite audio bundle you get the mic
audio interface and a pair of headphones
for only 210 bucks and this will be the
last thing you purchased in terms of
voiceover audio if you're gonna be
upgrading audio upgrade once and be done
with it I think I had this since 50,000
subscribers which was over two years ago
and it's still kicking ass but this is a
budget mic video so obviously if you're
watching this then you most likely don't
have that kind of money or don't want to
spend that kind of money in audio
equipment so based on this video and the
audio samples this is the list of
microphones from best quality to the
worst well there you have it the best
sounding mic goes to the blue snowball
without without an audio interface so if
you guys are looking for a purely
plug-and-play
simple straightforward microphone under
50 bucks that doesn't require any
editing or running it that nonsense this
is your best option on the 50 bucks
hands down but if you're like me and
always want to step up your audio game
and want your videos to have crispy
sound I strongly suggest picking up an
XLR microphone that way you could hook
it up to an audio interface and that'll
get you the best possible audio compared
to just plugging it straight into your
PC for example if you pick up the
florian mic and hook it up to an audio
interface the audio you get will sound
way better than the snowball mic but it
will cost you it just depends on how
much you willing to spend
if your bank account will allow it so
before I end this video I want to give
you huge things to dot tech domain for
making this video possible if you guys
haven't heard I've acquired a new domain
name if you type in Edgar dot tech it
will take you straight to my youtube
channel not only is the URL shorter but
it looks a lot cleaner and honestly more
professional if you're going to put it
on business cards or email signatures
and stuff like that I also mentioned
before how consumer Technology
Association which is the parent company
one of the largest tech events the
Consumer Electronics Show
aka CES has now migrated their website
to CTA tech from the old to character
domain name seee org dot tech domains
are continuing to attract attention from
various power plays in the tech and
startup industry in fact you're the
latest to join the bandwagon a few my
youtube buddies have also switched to
this like Austin Evans for Austin tech
and Tom Esposito for dumb tech so if you
guys have a startup company or even a
YouTube channel and want your own unique
dot tech domain for only $4.99 then make
sure to use the coupon code tech ed gur
on wwg attack but look for the video
