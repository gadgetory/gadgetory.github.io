coverage is cell cashier calm they
compare iPhone prices on the internet
and give you a quick coat and the most
cash for your iphone so go ahead and
check them out it's simple fast and
secure now that Apple has made the jump
to bigger screen phones how will the
iphone 6 compared to its biggest
competitor the samsung galaxy s5 well in
this video i'm going to be putting these
two phones against each other and find
out this is at from texas and this is
the in-depth comparison between the
iphone 6 and galaxy s5
so let's start the video off by looking
at some specs the iPhone 6 has an a a
chip running on a dual-core 1.5
gigahertz processor with one gigs of ram
the galaxy s5 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon
801 chip running on a quad core 2.4
gigahertz processor with two gigs of ram
it also has an Adreno 330 GPU you can
pick up the iphone 6 in either space
grey white or gold and it's only
available in either 1664 or 120
gigabytes of storage space whereas the
galaxy s5 comes in black white gold and
blue and it's only available in 16 or 32
gigabytes which can be expanded up to an
additional 120 gigabytes of space via SD
card when it comes to battery life the
iPhone 6 has an 18 10 million battery
and the galaxy s5 has a 2800 milliamp
battery but what do those numbers
actually mean well according to apple
the iphone 6 can last up to 14 hours of
talktime 11 hours of web browsing on
Wi-Fi as well as 11 hours of video
playback the galaxy s5 on the other hand
can last up to 21 hours of talktime 10
hours of web browsing over Wi-Fi and 13
hours of video playback so Apple finally
made the jump to bigger screen phones
something that a lot of people have been
wanting ever since the release of the
iphone 4 well with the iphone 6 people
got what they wanted a larger screen to
work with the iphone 6 has a 4.7 retina
IPS display with a resolution of 13 34 x
750 which is a pixel per inch count of
326 ds5 on the other hand is rocking a
5.1 inch super amoled 1080p display with
a ppi of 432 so there is definitely a
noticeable difference between the two
displays but how do the pictures look
when comparing them with each other well
here are a few samples I pulled up on
each phone these are the same exact
picture that you are seeing on both
phones I'm not sure if you can tell but
it looks like the s5 definitely has a
bit more contrast than the six the
yellow flower is more yellow on the s5
screen than it is on the iphone 6 same
thing here with the red roses however if
you look very closely on the s5 screen
you can see lighter spots all over the
rose whereas the picture on the 6 is
just one constant red color the Super
AMOLED display on the s5 is definitely a
nice feature and with it you get truer
to life picture
now let's take a quick look at the
blacks on each phone right off the bat I
can tell that the iPhone 6 has a darker
and more natural-looking black than the
s5 and I can tell you that the editing
of this video does not affect the colors
at all the viewing angle is also
important because you are not always
looking straight at your phone at a
90-degree angle so by measuring each
display at an angle of 45 degrees and
calculating the percent by which each
aspect has altered from its normal
reading we can find out which display
has a better viewing angle well these
are the results for the iphone 6 in the
galaxy s5 where lower is better looking
at the chart it's pretty clear that the
viewing angle is best on the galaxy s5
but i'll let you guys with the judge on
that from this quick demo here
so for speakers the iPhone 6 has those
located on the bottom just like the 5s
however the galaxy s5 has them in the
back I'm sure everyone would prefer them
to be in the front of the phone like the
m8 but we can't always get what we want
but anyways here is a quick demo of both
phones with maximum volume the zoom
recorder that I used to pick up the
sound is also placed equal distances
from each phone for a fair test graduate
with honors you with all your shedding I
don't shut this is a party for scare
students I am asked a student I need for
scare students who actually you know
never chance just wait hotshot I'm gonna
scare circles around you this heart
vol.i let's keep a dream journal I'm a
dance major and I'm not not exactly the
scariest group in the world with someone
who has large hands like myself I can
definitely use the iphone 6 one-handed I
can reach across the phone with ease
however I do need to tilt the phone just
a little to access the top for
notifications I can't quite reach it
comfortably even though I'm right-handed
I prefer to use my phones with my left
hand instead which is actually pretty
weird and this kind of annoys me a
little bit when accessing the power
button since I do have to reposition my
hand in order to access it people that
use the right hand won't have any
problems since it does come naturally
however the iphone 6 does have this
pretty cool feature where you can double
tap the home button which brings all the
apps closer to the bottom which enrich
and makes it easier to reach but that
still doesn't solve the problem if I
need to reach the notifications the
galaxy s5 on the other hand yeah it
definitely needs a little more
adjustment to use I cannot reach the top
at all and the power button is that much
harder to press I should really consider
using the phone put my right hand to
avoid this problem now in terms of
design the iPhone 6 has a more circular
design it feels really smooth and it's
rounded on the edges really reminiscent
of the HTC One m8 however it does make
the phone more slippery compared to the
flat plastic edges of the galaxy s5
which is a lot easier to hold and a lot
less prone to drops Apple is notorious
for having thin smartphones the iphone 6
is no exception it's thinner than the
iphone 5s coming in at six point nine
millimeters whereas the s5s thickness
measures at 8.1 millimeters so looking
at the left side of the phones you will
find the volume rockers on both devices
along with the vibrate switch on the
iphone 6 on the opposite side we have
both power buttons and the SIM tray for
the iphone 6 now on the bottom of the
phones is the charging port and
microphone the six also has its speakers
and headphone port on the bottom whereas
the s5 has its headphone jack on the top
ps5 also has an IR blaster up top with a
noise cancelling mic
on the face of the phone is where the
front-facing cameras are located the
speaker grills and these sensors however
the iphone 6 still does not have a
notification light whereas the s5 does
come on Apple the iPhone 6 has a new 8
megapixel iSight camera with an aperture
of 2.2 unlike the 6 plus that has
optical image stabilization the six
remains at digital here are also some
notable camera features on the iPhone 6
now yes 5 has a 16 megapixel camera with
an aperture of 2.2 as well and some
notable camera features includes iOS
control digital image stabilization and
night mode for front-facing cameras the
iPhone 6 has a 1.2 megapixel camera
while the s5 is at 2.1 megapixels the
camera interface on the s5 is pretty
cluttered compared to the iphone 6 there
are just a lot more options that you can
choose from I personally would have
preferred a much cleaner interface
though so most of these options are
pretty obvious by looking at the symbols
but when you click on the gear on the
bottom left an entire array of options
pop up including options to change the
pixels for the pictures adding gridlines
if you want that perfect shot adjusting
the exposure changing the video mode for
slow motion and even swapping to 4k
video among a bunch of other options now
if you hit mode you can switch the mode
of the camera to panoramic multiple
shots in one picture and even access to
the dual camera feature I honestly think
that the average user will not use most
of these settings and I prefer a much
more simple menu like the iPhone 6 super
user friendly less cluttered and still
has a bunch of cool settings you can
choose from for example the panoramic
mode square mode regular photos regular
video slow motion which you can adjust
to either 240 or 120 fps and time lapse
there is also a hidden feature that you
probably won't know about until you try
it out but if you tap on the screen you
can adjust the exposure in different
lighting scenarios you also have access
to a timer which was added on for iOS 8
options for HDR and flash as well as far
as custom images are concerned the only
thing that stock iOS 8 offers is the
filter option on the top right of the
screen in here you can change the theme
of your picture slightly again it's not
the best camera for pro photographers
but it
do for the majority of people including
myself that don't really care for those
extra features so here are just a few
samples we took from our six vs s5
camera comparison and if you guys want
to watch the whole video I will leave a
link in the description section down
below well that concludes the comparison
between the iphone 6 and the galaxy s5 i
