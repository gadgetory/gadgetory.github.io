Texas and welcome to cool tech under 50
for the month of October I basically do
these every single month and if you guys
are new to the series and somehow miss
my previous episodes I'll go and drop a
link to the playlist down below so if
you guys have time definitely check them
out because I went over some pretty cool
tech items in the past few months but
but all that said let's start the show
all right so starting things off are
these titanium lightning cables from
fuse chicken there's a smaller version
called the Titan loop which is meant to
be used with your keys and a much larger
option called a Titan which is meant for
in-home use it's basically what the name
implies a lightning cable made out of
titanium that you can carry around with
you by hooking it to your keys you don't
ever have to buy new lightning cables
anymore because this is practically
indestructible and it's always attached
to your keys so you won't lose them
the tine is much longer a 39 inch or 1
meter lightning cable that's virtually
indestructible
my dog snow always ends up chewing our
cables at home if you guys have pets
then you probably feel the same way I do
when that happens the Titan is the
solution to all of our problems
since we're on the topic of keys I have
some really cool stuff to share with you
guys these next set of items work with
your keys now let's face it we all have
them but most of us disregard one of the
most important things we carry around
all day this first item is called the
orbit key and it holds all of your keys
neatly inside it carries anywhere from 2
to 7 keys and this is a really great way
to organize them and keep them hidden
inside when they are not in use which
means that they won't end up scratching
your phone or other devices if you put
them together inside your pocket your
purse or even backpack I just slide one
of the keys out when I need to use it
and slide them back in when I'm done
they also have additional add-ons that
you can purchase separately like a
bottle opener or an 8 gigabyte flash
drive which are both compatible with the
orbit key this is a really nice way to
clean up your entire key set this last
item is a really simple one but it's
really cool most regular key rings are
difficult to pry open well with the
freaky all you have to do is press down
on one end and it basically opens up and
you're ready to slide in your keys the
freaky also comes with three smaller
rings as a bonus
next up is a portable on-the-go micro
USB flash drive for the Android devices
if you guys find yourself running out of
space on your smartphone or Android
devices and find it really inconvenient
to keep swapping the tiny micro SD cards
in and out then this is the solution
you're looking for you can hook it up to
your keychain and pop it out anytime you
need to transfer music movies photos or
other files to your Android device or
vice versa on one side is the USB 3.0
that connects to your PC so you can
transfer files and the other side it has
the micro USB connection it's really
convenient in the sense that you don't
have to remove any back plates for most
Android phones
I mentioned the brand many times on the
channel before but I've never actually
featured their skins and my cool tech
videos as one of the items which is why
I'm officially including them not only
does the brand offer the best looking
skins you can get anywhere but they also
offer the most precise fitted skins in
the planet their skins for smartwatches
consoles laptops and more with a variety
of skin types to choose from so if you
guys want to pimp out your devices and
make them stand out then you definitely
need to check them out I'll go to leave
a link down below for anyone that's
interested this next item is a very
interesting one this is called ditto and
it's compatible with both Android and
iOS the idea behind this little guy is
to simplify your life we are so consumed
by media that we are oblivious of our
surroundings most of the time that's
where ditto comes in its purpose is to
free you from worrying about your
smartphone so you can focus on other
things there are no button switches or
cables just this you can clip it on your
shirt put it in your pocket or use the
included wrist strap when you get a
notification it vibrates you can use the
app and customize the notifications that
matter to you so that data will vibrate
when someone you have added to your
favorites list is trying to reach you
that goes for text calls and emails you
can also customize the vibrations to
your liking by setting the vibrate
patterns for phone calls texts and other
notifications what's awesome about ditto
is that it works with third-party apps
as well like Facebook Instagram snapchat
and more
additionally data will vibrate letting
you know if you left your smartphone
behind which I find is an awesome
feature it comes in white black and a
clear option and the fact that it will
notify me if I leave my phone behind is
amazing enough that I have this clipped
on to my wallet at all times this next
item is quite possibly the best pair of
Bluetooth earphones that you can
currently buy on the
thirty dollars these are the Empire
Swift Bluetooth 4.0 earphones the a
sweat proof and are perfect for fitness
junkies and great for travel as well
they'll get you up to 5 hours of talking
or playing time and 185 hours of standby
so I've used these earphones when going
to the gym the past few weeks and
experienced no disconnect or lag the
wireless signal is rock-solid and these
earphones fit really snug into my ears
blocking majority of the outside noise
additionally you can pull out the ear
hooks if you choose to and use them as
regular earbuds if the comfort level
just isn't there for you otherwise you
may need to wear them a few times just
to adjust to them if you are new to the
sport style ear hook design earphones
the sound quality is also really great
for the price regardless of the type of
music you are listening to you can
expect very clear and crisp sound the
bass is pretty flat but then again these
earphones are just under 30 bucks and
the I damn well worth it so on one side
you have the volume controls along with
the microphone and on the other earbud
you can find the micro USB port needed
to charge the earphones it doesn't come
with an earphone bag but you do get two
sizes of ear buds and ear hooks but I
also go to leave a link down below to
some pretty cool earphone cases if
anyone is interested this next item is
called a gatekeeper and it's basically a
lock for your PC simply insert the USB
key into your Windows PC or Mac and then
download the program onto your computer
now every time you walk away from your
computer it will automatically lock
itself and if you return it will
automatically unlock this is perfect for
students or anyone that works in an
office and wants to protect their
privacy and information on their
computers you can also adjust the lock
distance for the gatekeeper depending on
how far you want to be before the PC
actually locks itself
these next few items are pretty
straightforward first up is this
two-in-one lightning and micro USB cable
now I feature something similar on my
desk tour in case you guys missed it but
you can use it as a lightning cable and
then pop the cover up when you need a
micro USB cable next up is this hard
cover case for Western Digital my
passport hard drives it's from a company
called kanka and they have a bunch of
other really cool cases to protect your
external drives
I personally store my assess these in
here that I use for my Thomas Shogun but
it also has dedicated slots for standard
and micro SD cards as well which i think
is pretty cool the first pair of
headphones are featuring this video are
from soundbot the company that makes
awesome bluetooth speakers these are the
SB 270 blue
headphones with a built-in mic it will
get you up to 12 hours of talk time and
music playback these are extremely
lightweight and flexible headphones
making it perfect for traveling on the
right ear cup you'll find the power
button microUSB port audio jack
microphone and volume controls and
additionally these are touch sensitive
as well depending on the direction
running your finger down or across the
surface of the ear cup will either
adjust the volume or skip the track
you're listening to their cups are
extremely soft but since they are
designed to rest on your ear the sound
leakage is noticeable and noise
isolation will be very minimal as always
these last set of items are for my
gamers so first up you have the red
dragon keyboard and mouse combo this is
the s102 gaming keyboard now although it
looks mechanical it actually has
membrane key switches its features
splash proof keys along with
interchangeable WASD and arrow keys
along with an option to disable the
Windows key for gaming it also features
five programmable macro keys along with
a dedicated button for recording
gameplay so you guys don't have to
sacrifice your other keys the XL gaming
keyboard comes with seven backlight LED
options that you can cycle through with
a dedicated led button it also comes
with anti-ghosting for up to 26 keys
it's actually required to type on very
comparable due to the amazing support at
the wrist rest which is also removable
the gaming mouse on the other hand
features seven programmable buttons and
seven LED color options along with four
dpi settings up to 3000 dpi the mouse
has an ergonomic symmetrical design
which is great for left-handed users as
well and it's especially great for
gaming the mouse is really easy to slide
on mouse pads and it's very responsive
which makes it a great choice for FPS
games an awesome mousepad I recently
picked up for my setup is this extended
one from reflex labs my last mousepad
had too many texts and logos on it
whereas this one is so much cleaner it
has red borders and a subtle logo on the
top left which works so well with any
black and red theme last item on the
list is his gaming headset from dark
iron this is the ovine gaming headset
and it's compatible with pcs and
consoles since it connects via a 3.5
millimeter jack it's great for gaming
and music because of the clear sound and
deep bass it offers it features a
rotating mic and it's extremely light
and flexible if you guys are looking for
an awesome gaming headset under 25 bucks
you can't go wrong with these they also
have a bunch of other color options as
well if read
