to show you the process of locking your
HTC One m9 so you can use it with any
carrier or country for this
demonstration I will be using my locked
m9 and unlock it so I can use it on my
t-mobile network but you can use this
video as a guide for any carrier so
first off we need to get the unlock code
to start the unlocking process one of
the best and most trusting websites that
I used to get my lock codes is the
unlocking company comm because their
prices are unbeatable and the customer
service is actually the best in the
market so head on over to the unlocking
company comm and select your phone
manufacturer and the phone model from
the drop down list and on the next page
go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is AT&amp;amp;T so before
we continue we do need the IMEI number
of the phone and the way you look that
up on your phone is to open up the dial
pad and enter in star pound zero six
pound once the phone displays the IMEI
number you have to go back on the
website and enter that in once
everything is filled out select get
unlocking code and I will take you to
the final screen where you have to check
out and after checking out they will
email you the unlock code the price and
delivery time of your code varies by
phone but don't worry because their
prices are the cheapest in the market
and the delivery times are the fastest
as well once you receive your unlock
code from the locking company comm it's
time to unlock your phone but before we
continue make sure that the phone is
powered off go ahead and remove the SIM
tray located on the side of your phone
and insert in the SIM card that you want
to use with the phone I want to use the
m9 on my t-mobile network so I am
putting in my t-mobile SIM card after
the SIM card is on the tray go ahead and
slide it back inside the phone and power
on the device once the phone boots up it
will display a network lock message
which is fine you don't have to worry
once you leave the lock screen however a
prompt will appear asking you for the
sim network unlock pin this is where you
enter in the lock code that you received
from the unlocking company so after
inputting in the code and hitting ok
another prompt will appear stating that
the unlock was successful and all you
need to do is hit OK one more time to
reboot the phone once the phone
completely boots up to the lock screen
you are done and your phone is now
permanent
the unlocked as you can see here I'm
using my AT&amp;amp;T HTC One m9 on my t-mobile
network so that's how you unlock your
HTC One m9 for any carrier or country if
