I'll drop a link down below to their
channel alright so here are your five
chosen for this week we have Jacob Jairo
Kenneth Martin and Landon
congratulations for making it into setup
wars episode 30 by the way everyone's
gear will be linked down below if anyone
is interested first up we have Jacob
with a try display setup hooked up to an
agro tech monitor arm we have three Asus
24-inch monitors a mad cat strike seven
keyboard and a few selection of mice a
Logitech g600 a Hama you rage mouse and
a Mad Catz fly five fly stick on the
left side we have a pair of Razer black
shark headphones and we also have a blue
snowball mic for recording audio keyhole
management is pretty good for the most
part although I would clean up the wires
on the right side a little bit but
overall great work you have a bunch of
stuff on your desk and we know that I'm
not quite sure why you need two
different types of mice but hey I get it
you like variety what you can do with
that headset though is to hang it under
your desk closer to your PC using the
anchor so that way you not only have one
less item on your desk but you don't
have a cable running over it but other
than that a pretty dope setup indeed
Jacob thank you for entering Hiero is
next up with an interesting setup we
have two asus monitors a 27-inch 1440p
monitor as primary and a 23 point 8 inch
1080p in vertical mode which he uses for
coding on the desk we have the corsair
k70 RGB keyboard with custom vortex
white key caps to the side of that we
have a logitech g502 mouse on top of the
white glorious extended mouse pad which
you have magically kept clean also on
the desk we have a pair of JBL speakers
and a HyperX cloud headset and white
also I love how you kept the black and
white theme consistent excellent work
with cable management as well
everything is neatly wrapped and kept
off the ground also I think your cat is
plotting something after the left side
we have a setup for console gaming a ps4
hooked up to a 32 inch LG TV and a pair
of astro a 50 s hanging from the
Silverstone aluminum headphone stand I
haven't forgot about that stick PC
though I mean look at this Wow
we have a 5820k clocked at 4.5 gigahertz
and EVGA 980ti superclocked Edition 16
gigabytes of ddr4 ram at 26 66 megahertz
in a gorgeous custom loop with black and
white cables and painted parts what a
beauty you know what guys it's been a
while I don't have a single reason why
this guy doesn't deserve the set-up
boards seal of approval the organisation
symmetry cleanliness of the desk and
even the mousepad
plus the amazing color coordination and
attention to detail ladies and gentlemen
the second ever setup wars seal of
approval goes to Jairo congratulations
dude
hell even a console is skin to match the
setup those of you who are new to the
series the seal of approval has only
been given out one other time and I
think that was on episode 17 but I do
have to emphasize that receiving the
seal is extremely rare and I don't give
it out easily so receiving I set upwards
seal of approval you get a prize hundred
dollars in cash you get a choice of a
tech source branded t-shirt and also a
custom-made one-of-a-kind plaque
congratulating you on winning such an
achievement
so Jairo if you're watching this go
ahead and email set up boards and claim
your prize my friend well deserved
so moving on with the show at number
three we have Kenneth with a quad
display set up a 40 inch samsung tv up
top hooked up to the Xbox one and below
that we have a set of three asus 24 inch
monitors on the desk we have a bunch of
stuff a steel series apex gaming
keyboard Razer Taipan Mouse and an
enormous sound bar in the middle of the
setup really we also have a pair of
Razer Black Shark headphones off to the
left side and a bunch of remotes on the
right cable management can definitely be
spiffed up a bit with some velcro straps
or wraps and you can definitely free up
some
space on your desk if you pick up a
drawer and install it under your desk if
there is room that is you will have lots
of space in there to store your remotes
and even room for the Apple TV I know a
lot of you guys are probably sick of me
mentioning the drawer but you got to
realize that there are thousands of new
subscribers on a channel so there are
probably new people watching the show
even as we speak so every time I see the
opportunity I will mention it of course
the headphone hangar wouldn't hurt
either and if this was my setup I would
definitely mount that sound bar
underneath the TV on the wall instead of
having it sit in the middle of the desk
especially that close to you this setup
has great potential once you fix a few
things but nonetheless Thank You Kenneth
for entering next up is Landon with a
minimalistic setup 225 inch HP monitors
a poker mechanical keyboard and a
courser m65 RGB Mouse talk about
minimalism you can probably fit that
keyboard in your pocket off the right
side of the table we have a pair of
astro a40 s and beneath the table is a
Bose sound och3 speaker excellent work
with cable management I see zip ties
keeping your wires together and off of
the ground the custom PC on the other
hand is running on a 5820k and an asus
strix 980 GPU but a little too much red
in there even for my taste I would hate
to see that glossy table of yours being
scratched so perhaps picking up a black
and red mouse pad to match your theme
and protect your gear but other than
that I have nothing else to say very
clean setup Thank You Landon for
entering last but not least we have
Martin with an ultra white setup we have
a 34 inch LG ultrawide monitor hooked up
to the silverstone arm and on the desk
we have a Logitech k-8 hundred keyboard
and g9 mouse on top of the huge may tech
Genesis mouse pad also notice we have a
pair of creative t20 speakers a dock for
charging Xbox 360 controllers and all
the way on the Left we have an audio
mixer excellent work with cable
management Wow now that is a very clean
job showing behind your setup takes a
lot of guts I give you props for that
Martin even the PC cables are wrapped
neatly inside and outside we have a
4790k GTX 780 and a Noctua NHD 14 CPU
cooler inside the courser 350 d case I
also just noticed that you attached an
SD card reader behind your monitor very
clever and the
that's actually a really smart place to
put one and lastly we have a logitech
g27 wheel for them racing games after
all you have to take advantage of that
ultra wide very clean and organized set
up overall Martin thank you for entering
so before we move on to the main event
make sure you guys drop your comments
down below and vote on who has the best
desk setup and as always that allows the
winner on Sunday on my Twitter and
Instagram accounts so make sure you guys
are following me there all right so now
the amici is gonna be showing off his
sexy setup Dimitri go ahead and take it
away man hey guys this is Dimitri with
hardware canucks and thanks to Ed for
having me on the show welcome to my
setup first let's start with on the desk
and I'm a dual monitor guy these are
Acer xB 270 hu g-sync monitors with
1440p resolution and aside from the
nasty glossy finish on the frame and the
base these are actually fantastic for
productivity in gaming and everything I
produced for Haruka knucks goes through
these pixels first now notice I don't
have any speakers on my setup that's
because my ears have been sort of
spoiled by the wonderful HD 800 made by
Sennheiser that powers pretty much all
of my audio needs but for gaming I use
the Game one headset with an open back
design for directional cues and it has a
fantastic microphone speaking of the
microphone here's my five year old audio
technica 2035 now this thing goes
wherever I go for voice overs and it's
connected to the scarlett 2i2 interface
which sits beside the O two headphone
amplifier that does a decent job of
powering the HD 800 headphones my mouse
of choice for now is a Zoe FK one with
fantastic tracking and if any of you are
csgo fans this mouse has improved my aim
by lot beside it as a cooler master no
attached tkl keyboard which is compact
super simple and tough with my favorite
keyboard switch the top row capacitive
highly recommended
my desk companion is this Trabant toy
car and it's a slow as in toy as in real
life and you just gotta have a plant as
well to bring out some green within all
this tech and fun fact it sits on top of
my power button so powering this entire
setup and my life basically is a
recently built
the editing PC based on the latest Intel
skylake platform with an i7 processor 16
gigabytes of RAM for now but soon to be
64 gigabytes with dual gtx 980ti s-- and
only solid-state drives which makes
editing very pleasing and it's all
housed inside this beautiful aluminum
fantex evolved ATX enclosure which also
adds a really nice workstation vibe to
it i sit on this thing for most of my
day the verdict year SL 4000 chair and
that looks aside it's actually very
comfortable and helps with my posture
when I'm going for that eight-hour
editing marathon beside the editing then
is my shaft that gives me enough surface
area which is very needed for organising
upcoming videos and builds and believe
it or not actually gives a dynamic
background when I'm filming right in
front of it I'm a bit of a mouse
collector so here's where they sit along
with some my other gaming gear and so
this side of the office is basically
full that acts as open storage and
backdrop at the same time swinging
things on to the other wall it's plain
white with my dual lights and a simple
tabletop this one's glossy for getting
those cool reflection shots but I love
this setup that grants me all the
maneuverability that I want and so
that's basically it thanks to Edgar for
featuring my setup I hope you enjoyed so
that's it for this week's episode of
setup wars you guys enjoyed it make sure
to hit that like button and a huge
thanks to Dimitri for being on the show
