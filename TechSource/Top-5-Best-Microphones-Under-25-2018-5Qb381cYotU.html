welcome back to another top 5 video here
on the channel I know it's been a while
but I wouldn't be focusing on the best
plug-and-play microphones under $25 and
I've actually scoured Amazon and I found
that the highest rated microphones under
25 bucks and I purchased them my selves
none of this is sponsored here's a
screenshot of the purchase order I also
want to make it clear to you guys that
these samples you here in this video
coming from the microphones may not be
the same from your end because of
several reasons for example using cheap
headphones or crappy sounding speakers
the audio input coming from microphones
also might be their friend and that
depends on what device you use to record
on for example recording on a desktop PC
it's gonna sound better compared to a
laptop or a tablet that's because of the
sound cards or the onboard audio so to
make this comparison as fair as possible
I'm gonna record all these microphones
from my desktop PC back at home and
they're gonna be about 6 inches from my
mouth in front of the keyboard so be
pretty much like this alright so with
that said let's start off with a clear
microphone which can be used with the
ps4 and PC it comes with a built-in
adjustable stand with a gain control
wheel and also a mute switch on the top
of the neck the black and red design
might be a deal-breaker for some people
if they're set up heavily relies on a
specific color scheme but other than
that it's a solid mic for the price next
up is the fie fine which is a USB plug
and play microphone
it comes with a tiny metal tripod that
lets you only adjust the tilt angle and
also comes with a removable windscreen
the neutral color of the mic makes it
perfect for most setups and the sound
quality is very clear and crisp in fact
you can even use this microphone to do
voiceovers or a semi-professional audio
work in the right environment next up on
the list is the toner microphone which
for some reason is very popular on
Amazon
it comes with a tripod that lets you
adjust the tilt angle and a long red
cable with a 3.5 millimeter jack the mic
has decent quality it's definitely not
the best from the list it does a great
job blocking out the background noise in
fact it does such a great job blocking
out the noise that it has trouble
picking up all the sound
so if you talk very low or if the
microphone is far from your mouth it's
gonna sound like you're skipping some
words but the price it's decent alright
so next up is the sum gut now this is a
generic BM 800 microfilm that gets
rebranded by other Chinese companies
however this one is the highest rated
and the lowest price it does come with
the immovable windscreen shock mount and
an XLR to 3.5 millimeter jack now the
downside of this microphone is that it
doesn't come with a stand or a boom arm
making this less attractive and kind of
defeats the purpose of casting on there
$25.00 since you have to buy a stand for
it
there is one out there that cost less
than $10 and it works with this
microphone and I'll drop a link below if
you guys wanna check it out now the
quality also isn't the best because of
the 3.5 milimeter connection anytime you
switch from XLR to 3.5 millimeter the
audio quality suffers greatly and just
for comparison here's the same
microphone test however this time I'm
using an XLR cable and I plugged it into
my euphoria audio interface you guys can
tell the huge difference in audio
quality if you really want the best
audio you have to use an audio interface
and a microphone with an XLR output and
last but certainly not least we have the
e Barre USB microphone it's easily the
worst sounding microphone from the list
however for only $8 it's meant to be a
cheap solution to microphones
it's perfect for laptops and travel due
to the small compact size obviously I
don't recommend it for gaming or any
serious audio work this microphone is
perfect for people who just need a
microphone and don't really care about
the quality of it iso based on the sound
recording here is the list of the best
sounding microphone
- the worst sounding microphone the FIH
fine hands-down sounds the best coming
in a little on there 25 dollars in fact
I'm using this microphone to record this
segment of the video following up is the
sun-god with the audio interface
connection then we got the clear
microphone and then after that we got
the sun-god microphone but this time
without the audio interface so we're
using the XLR to 3.5 millimeter cable
and then in fifth place we got the toner
microphone and last but not least the e
berry which is the worst like I said
however for the price it does get the
job
it's over all the fee fine is the best
sounding microphone it comes at a stand
no audio interface needed just simply
plug and play for under 25 bucks this is
the best sounding microphone you can
currently buy now if you guys are really
serious about your audio then I strongly
recommend picking up the yuphoria I use
it in my own setup it costs 30 bucks and
if you combine this with any XLR
microphone your audio is gonna sound
much better than any plug-and-play
microphone out there I'll drop a link to
a few microphones I personally recommend
that cost a little more but sound much
better when using an audio interface I
also drop a boom arm which is
recommended for the XLR type microphones
because you want to get it as close as
possible to your mouth and also a link
to all the microphones featured in this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it let me
know by dropping a like if you guys want
to see more videos like these and let me
know in the comment section below what
other top 5 video I should focus on and
what budget I should stay on there
thanks again for watching I love your
faces and I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
