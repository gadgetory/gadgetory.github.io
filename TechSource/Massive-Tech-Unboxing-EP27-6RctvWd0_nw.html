Texas ladies and gentlemen welcome to
another unboxing episode of what's in
the box I'm gonna redo that intro
actually what's weird is that from Texas
welcome back to another episode of
what's in the box today I'm very very
excited this is actually gonna be one of
the best unboxings if not the best
unboxing episode on this channel and I'm
excited for a few things and you guys
will see what I'm talking about
so a few weeks ago one of my subscribers
reached out to me and he's like yo n I
want to build a gaming PC but I have no
clue what the hell I'm doing can I give
you some money and you build it for me i
me the word on the street is you got
some of the best builds on YouTube and
I'm like well I may know a few things
about building some sexy pcs so I told
Diego what you got bro let's see what
your parts list is so he sent me over a
parts list I took a look at it I was
like alright that's pretty dope but I'm
gonna change some things up again so me
being you know me I changed around the
parts a bit out of that tech sort of
spice that you guys know and love and I
came up with a much better parts list
for his budget I think his budgets
around $4,000 so yeah some of these
parts in and these boxes are for his PC
so I'm very excited to be building Diego
a PC so I think that's the longest intro
ever holy crap let's open some boxes up
I'm gonna start off with this one from
Amazon since it is the closest to me
move that out of the way so you guys can
see something okay so technically this
was not supposed to be part of the
episode because I was going to put this
aside I don't know how to explain it
this is this is for Halloween nights I'm
going away for the weekend in San Diego
yeah this is this is definitely not
YouTube's friendly incoming the
monetization but anyways I'm not gonna
really go into much detail you guys can
put tuned two together what's gonna go
down this weekend literally like in two
days use the paddle paddle spring my
costume for Halloween by the way I know
you guys are dying to ask me is gonna be
let me get the Hat I'm gonna be the
cable management police officer that's
the lamest thing or visit you know I'm
gonna continue on the unboxing with this
so yeah just let's just do it
aha the first components for the build
ladies and gentlemen we've got the asus
sli bridge
you guys can already be deuce how many
GPUs are gonna be using Microsoft
Windows 64 bit CD key Windows 10
obviously alright next box is from DJI
technology I think they're gonna be
sending me a laptop I'm very excited to
check it out the DJI Google's the DJI
goggles are sent to me which means in
the other package is probably a drone oh
my god look at this beauty so apparently
with these goggles you can see your
drone in real time instead of looking at
an iPad or your smart phone or something
like that I think I think that's what
this for what this is for but I could be
wrong I feel like you need to connect
this to something and powered on somehow
here is the other part of the headset
what the heck is this some virtual
reality thing going on over here
so okay I think you connect this piece
to the headset like this yep
snaps in place and then you put this on
your head you put it on you lure it wow
this is really nice this is comfortable
whoa uh yeah I don't really know the
actual function for these which is why
they sent it over so I can take a look
at huge thanks to DJI for sending in
their goggles put this back in the box
and open up the other egi package
because I didn't get to from them the
Matic pro guys I've always wanted a
maverick pro honestly and this is a
dream come true christmas has come early
for Edgar ah oh my god this box is tiny
as hell I know that the Mavic Pro is
actually tiny probably as small as drone
out there and they're not expected to be
this small the packaging is even small
so I can only imagine how small the
actual drone is no way this is it
is this what the heck all right what's
in here it's like a little suitcase I'm
legit still shocked that this is all
rights check inside here this is a
really nice little carrying pouch that
they provided got brochures we've got a
belt don't know what that is we've got
this is the remotes okay alright we've
got a charging dock I think that's what
that is we got some more cables power
adapters USB stuff whatever it is boring
stuff oh these are I'm guessing yep
these are the fins okay let's do see you
I check this out again because this is
insane how tiny these things it
literally fits in your hand on your hand
see this is what I'm talking about I
don't even know English oh oh look at
that
let me show that again it snaps open
like that that is sick
all this thing's a transformer okay so
check this out guys
so first you open these up flip it over
and then you open up these Wow that is
sick this is it guys this is the drone
this is awesome Wow
I used to kind of get over how small
this thing is but yeah you guys can tell
I'm very excited to check this thing out
Wow I love it thank you so much DG is
gonna be an awesome video I can't wait
to play around with this alright moving
on to some new egg goodies oh look at
that we have a $30 gift card for
hellofresh by the way if you guys want
this I guess you can take it first
person to redeem it it's yours I'm not
gonna use it yeah
have at it so in this package we have
ladies and gentlemen do you skill transy
ramp sticks I think these are 32 gigs
straight at 32 hundred megahertz RGB RAM
sticks so here's the thing originally
was supposed to be eight gigs but
because the motherboard has I believe
four RAM slots we kind of want to occupy
all of it that way it looks nice instead
of getting two RAM sticks it was gonna
not only look bad but also g.skill
doesn't have four gigabyte sticks in RGB
the lowest per gig stick is eight gigs
unfortunately so 16 gigs would look ugly
so my man diego had to upgrade to 32
gigs which he was cool with yet a huge
budget anyways so yeah why not oh by the
way the processor we're going with is
none other than the brand-new 8700 k we
actually had to wait a while to get this
in stock before we can order the rest of
the parts because originally it was
supposed to be 7700 k but then this got
announced so I told the ego you know
it'll be better if you wait a few more
weeks so we ended up waiting a month and
then we finally had to pay $300 more to
get this early on eBay because
everywhere else that was still sold out
and my boy Diego was getting impatient I
was getting impatient so yeah it was
worth the wait I hope actually it open
up this one because I know what this one
is this is from D brand because this is
there
Packaging as always can't forget that
okay I don't know why they send the
orange skins this was kind of a few
months old this is for the thread Ripper
build I was doing I was gonna cut a
piece of this for the power supply since
I messed up on the original one but
whatever it's all good in the hood
now these skins however are gonna be for
the PlayStation 4 Pro member I told you
guys that and the vlog so they're
finally here it's gonna be a black &amp;amp; red
kind of color scheme what did you expect
and in case people are wondering I do
build for subscribers if they have a
certain budget in mind I'm only taking
requests if the total price of the PC is
more than $2,500 so yeah shoot me an
email and we can schedule your next
build if you're interested oh yes this
is my gun stuff so I don't know if you
guys are following me on Instagram my
personal Instagram account but recently
I've been going to the gun range a lot
and I think that's my new hobby on the
side instead of YouTube and other things
so I do have a gun it's a xd9 I believe
from Springfield actually let me show
you yes what if you want to browse the
Internet like you are at a different
country
maybe you're booking a flight or hotel
and want to check local pricing to get
around the unfair location based pricing
well that's where Tunnel bear comes in
handy they're easy to use VPN gives you
the option to browse the internet from
20 countries just select a country in
the app turn tunnel bear on and watch as
your bear tunnels your internet
connection
right now when you visit mlb.com slash
tech stores you'll get five hundred
megabytes of free monthly data with no
credit card required so this is the xd9
I picked up I think four or five months
ago I don't remember from Springfield I
got a pretty good deal on it it's a
9-millimeter pistol nothing too crazy
originally I got it for self-defense for
home invasion reasons of course because
I moved into my new home also I'm not a
gun guy at all I don't believe in guns I
don't believe in gun violence I still
strongly believe that there should be a
lot there to limit the purchase of
weapons for each individual I think each
person should have maybe
a limit of one or two in that house I
figured working really hard every single
week making videos this is a really nice
way to just let go of all that stress so
yeah it's a pretty cool hobby and I
start I'm starting to invest a lot more
into it time and gear and stuff like
that which is why I picked up a few
things so the first thing I picked up is
the up Lula magazine loader and this is
an absolute must for anyone that's going
to a gun range sadly I found out about
this very late basically helps you load
the ammo inside your clips a lot quicker
so basically how this works is let me
get my ammo clip out I think this goes
over like here so okay basically put
this over you press this down you push
the magazine loader in you push it down
you load your ammo you let it go and
then rinse and repeat boom boom rinse
and repeat until you have a full clip
obviously I'm not going to show you guys
on camera because we're getting slightly
off-topic this is a tech channel a lot
of gun channel and also this might not
be advertiser friendly so at this point
I'm sure this is my demonetised
but I will show you a few of the things
that I did pick up this is a military
themed ammo can for my ammo and then
anything else that I'm gonna take with
me for example the magazine clip that
snaps in it's just an MP and last but
not least a pair of headphones oh I'm
actually missing my sunglasses
I ordered clear glasses as well for the
range but I'm guessing that's gonna come
later they do provide obviously
headphones and glasses at the range but
I don't know how often they clean that
and I'm a germaphobe so I'd rather just
bring my own and then I got these which
are one of the best rated in Amazon
let's try them out actually whoa that
clamping power though the noise
isolation you guys it is absolute
silence I can't even hear myself speak
wow this is crazy
yeah it's very loud in the gun range in
case you guys don't know investing in
some really high-quality headphone gear
health
keep your hearing for a long time so
anyways moving on its put the subside is
a fit note those nuts
oh yeah drop a link below for those in
case you or maybe you have a relative or
your dad that it often goes to the gun
range this would be some pretty dope
gifts for them put the upcoming holidays
anyways moving on what the heck is this
scrapped artist permanent but oh oh that
threw me off guard
okay okay so yeah here are the good
stuff the shrink z2 7ee motherboard this
is the one we're using for Diego's build
we're also gonna be tossing in two one
terabyte 850 Evo's in raid 0 of course
we also got some a blue matte vinyl
skins did I say that right vinyl I used
to save inial but you guys keep like
blaming me in the comment section so I
finally got it correct so oh very nice
you got some blue skins we're gonna wrap
up a few things obviously we're gonna
wrap up the black SSDs from Samsung and
a few other things like the power supply
it is a texture was built after all I
got I got add those spices in there you
know alright we got two more boxes what
isn't this one though oh great my worst
enemy Oh popcorn is this popcorn really
I got an idea
oh no at that finally an idea of mine
that didn't completely fail oh my god
this thing looks sick so this is the
cooler we're gonna be going with I do a
lot of builds using AIO coolers guys
whether it's cooler master or a Corsair
or even NZXT but I want to try something
a little different this is an all-in-one
liquid cooling situation it's got a
radiator in there it's got even a pump
this is from Swift tech this is their H
240 X 2 what that why is it in red just
better not be in red
I ordered a blue one
okay the liquid is clear you guys can
see right the the liquid is clear on
this but why the hell is it show red
don't tell me I'm supposed to add my own
dye this is supposed to come prepared
okay so apparently you're supposed to
add in your own dye
sneaky Swift Tech over there and you
almost see me crying so yeah this is
gonna be an interesting build to say the
least even though fans come pre apply
like there's nothing you need to do
other than install it on the CPU bracket
and add your dye in so yeah very stoked
to try this out and check out the temps
on the e 700 K because we are gonna be
overclocking as always ladies and
gentlemen the last box for this episode
