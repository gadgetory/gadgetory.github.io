episode so on Amazon you can find a
bitfenix tower for 50 bucks which is
available in white and red and also
black and blue a two terabyte my
passport external hard drive is going
for $75 for a limited time and it says
that it's for the Xbox one but it can
actually be used for the mac and pc as
well the Logitech G 230 drop in price
again by 20 bucks and the Asus 28 inch
4k monitor with a one millisecond
response time is going for five hundred
and twenty dollars not much of a
discount but still a deal regardless
speaking of Asus the final deal on
amazon is a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 p gaming
monitor with a 144 hurts refresh rate
and a 1 millisecond response time that
also features free sync and that's going
for three hundred ninety dollars this is
one of the best deals currently in this
episode jumping to newegg real quick you

that's going for only a hundred dollars
and i am the a-10 7870 k cpu bundle that
comes with a gigabyte f 2 88 x board and
16 gigabytes of ram from courser all for
two hundred forty dollars so if you've
been wanting to start on a fresh new
budget bills that this is definitely a
nice start keep in mind that the 7870 k
has an integrated graphics chip so you
technically don't need to buy a separate
graphics card but just don't expect to
do any hardcore gaming with it and
finally on newegg the msi gtx 960 has
dropped its price again down to 145
dollars with a twenty-dollar mail-in
rebate on newegg flash there's a 28 inch
4k monitor that's going for 279 dollars
which is the lowest you will find on a
4k monitor of that size I mean sure it's
from an unknown manufacturer but that
price though the ozzy ok be 5050 you
keyboard is going for only twenty
dollars that comes at three backlit LED
options red blue and purple and finally
you can find the refurbished
coolermaster hyper 212

right now which has sold over seventy
seven percent units already if you guys
miss the amazing deal on the 6700 k from
last week's episode its back on ebay for
two hundred eighty dollars the full
retail price on the cpu is 350 bucks
just by checking newegg and amazon so
you are definitely saving a few pennies
buying it from ebay i haven't done a TV
deal in a while well now you guys can
get a 40 inch 1080p smart TV for only
two hundred eighty bucks not a bad deal
at all you guys remember to mackay see
our four speakers that keep popping up
in setup Wars well now you guys can pick
one up for 115 bucks only on adorama

so you would be saving around $35
