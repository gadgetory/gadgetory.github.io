source and in this video we are going to
be taking a look at the new Bluetooth
keyboard from Logitech the K or 80 now I
usually don't get excited for Bluetooth
keyboards but this one has a neat little
feature built in that really stood out
to me unboxing the package you get the
keyboard itself and some documentation
and that's pretty much it now if you
haven't guessed by now the feature that
I was talking about a little earlier is
this knob it allows you to switch in
between three Bluetooth enabled devices
with ease but more on that later this
keyboard does come with batteries so
when you take it out of the package
you're ready to go and there is no need
to run out and get some which is always
nice on the back there is also the power
switch which i think is a great location
for it so you won't accidentally switch
it on or off when you're using the
keyboard prepare the keyboard with your
device all you have to do is hold either
the PC button for PCs or Android devices
or the I button for iOS devices for
three seconds add three seconds a blue
light will start blinking letting you
know that the keyboard is ready to be
paired all you do then is go into your
Bluetooth settings menu and click the
Logitech Keyboard option and that's it
with this keyboard you get a nice amount
of control over your device like being
able to go back home access Siri
multitask play or pause music and even
change the phone's value now on to the
important part the keyboard I have to
say it feels pretty good just enough
tactile feedback to make typing
enjoyable now don't expect a gaming
keyboard when you buy this but it's
perfect for typing it's as easy to pair
your Android phone as well switch the
knob to the number you want your phone
assigned to hold a PC button click
Logitech keyboard and then confirm the
code by typing it on the keyboard and
hitting Enter
now you can easily use both iOS and
Android with this keyboard just by
switching through the three options with
the knob this keyboard works great with
Android as well there is no lag and it
features a lot of actual control over
the device right from the keyboard you
can go home access Google now take a
screenshot and much more
now I wanted to see just how much
devices I can fit onto this keyboard and
I managed to get up to three modern size
smartphones to fit in the groove
which is great since the knob supports
up to three different devices again it
couldn't be easier to switch in between
all these devices something to note here
are the rubber feet located at the
bottom of the keyboard
they are extremely grippy and thick this
is important for a keyboard when you're
using it you really have to be pushing
it to be able to make the keyboard notch
a little you shouldn't have any problems
at all with typing on this keyboard well
that is it guys the best multi Bluetooth
keyboard you can buy and only just that
50 bucks
it does also come in a white color in
this video I used it with phones but
there is no reason you can't hook it up
to your computers or anything really
that has Bluetooth and just have one
keyboard for your whole house if you
