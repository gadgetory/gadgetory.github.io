had full of tech that I don't use
anymore well I decided to sell most of
it so if you're watching this video I
have fully restocked the store tab on
deal store tech where you can find 20%
off everything that I'm selling now
these are all either brand-new and
sealed or in mint condition I've only
used a few of these in like one video
and decided to put it back in the box
there's also a few items that are
actually used and you will know which
ones since I label the conditions on all
of them you can even ask for an
autograph or a note when you check out
either on the box or the actual product
just make sure to clarify that in the
notes before you check out everything
else free shipping and it's only
available in the US unfortunately just
because I don't want to deal with import
fees and customs you guys can even check
the links for the original products as
well so you can compare prices but
anyways if you're interested check out
the store tab on the old stores tech and
I'll drop a link to them down below
starting off the show we have a 28 inch
4k monitor from Asus that is currently
$40 off and it's excellent for
productivity since you can take
advantage of the enormous real estate it
offers and it's also not bad for gaming
it does have a 1 millisecond response
time and a 60 Hertz refresh rate which
can be easily overclocked to 75 Hertz at
least and I know this because I did that
to mine a while back if you're looking
around for a compact power band the
ravpower 6700 million of our charger is
a good buy since there's only $16 and
you can even choose from three different
colors the popular UE mega boom wireless
speaker is going for $60 off right now
which is set to be one of the best
high-end Bluetooth speakers available
right now it's extremely loud with
incredible bass in a range is a hundred
feet which is insane but the coolest
feature I think is the multi host which
allows you to play songs from two
Bluetooth devices so your friend can
join and play songs from their phone as
well if you can find a gtx 1070 under
$400 and you should probably jump on
that deal because it's pretty rare to
find i came across two gigabyte gtx 1070
that's going for only 380 dollars that's
not a bad deal the corsair k70 luxe RGB
is only $12 off but nonetheless it's
still a deal considering it's going for
the full price on a new egg if you live
under a rock and there are no buy GTA 5
or if you're too broke before to pay the
full $60 well
your chance since it's 50% off right now
on Amazon and finally on Amazon we got a
pretty decent deal on the logitech g4 or
three prodigy gaming mouse it features
six programmable buttons and RGB
lighting we got a few pretty good deals
on eBay one of which is the new 7700 K
Cabul 8 processor which has sold over
1200 units already and it's going for
three hundred and ten dollars so if you
guys want to jump to the new platform
right now now's the time because you
won't find this processor cheaper
anywhere else if you never try that VR
open why they get into VR for a while
now then this deal might be for you it's
the new Samsung gear VR and it's 51
percent off going for only $49 however
it's sold more than 75 percent already
so be sure to jump on this if you are
interested I'm pretty sure this deal is
gonna expire by the time you're watching
but I figured I would throw it in here
just in case you guys can get a
refurbished ps4 for only 230 dollars
which is a $70 difference compared to
buying a brand-new one
and finally on eBay we got a solid
mechanical gaming keyboard and mouse
combo from Gambia's I actually featured
this in my cool tech video a few months
back and still recommend this even till
today most mechanical gaming keyboard
start around 50 bucks so the fact that
you can get that in a solid gaming mouse
for under 50 is a crazy deal the same
gigabyte gtx 1070 is also a new egg but
for $385 after a mail-in rebate however
you do get a free copy of honor or the
new Ghost Recon game if you purchase it
on here for those of you who are on a
budget the XFX rx 480 is a really good
deal considering it's only going for
$170 after a male and rebate and finally
if you got the new gigabyte or s Z 27 I
don't even know what the hell am I
saying the new gigabyte RS z2 7 the ex
gaming 5 motherboard for the new cab you
lake platform it's going 465 bucks after
a mail-in rebate but the sale ends in
four days
guys I strongly recommend bookmarking
deal stores tech because not only do you
see the same deals on the video on the
website as well but we do update it
constantly each day so there are deals
that are only available for a limited
amount of time like the Sennheiser HD
460 ones which were going for $40 and
even a solid asus rog Strix z2 70 board
that was on sale for $190 so
unfortunately these are not available
but they were on deal source for the
past few days deals like these are
always going out of stock so instead of
waiting a week to watch my video it's a
much better idea to check back on the
website each day because you will come
across some really amazing deals that
are available for a limited time only
once again guys I'll drop a link to my
website deal stores Tech is very easy to
remember
consider bookmarking it and maybe
checking back daily or even a few times
a week thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
