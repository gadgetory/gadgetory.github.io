is happy Monday I hope you guys are
having a fantastic day it is a brand new
week which means we have new
opportunities ahead of us but anyways
welcome to setup wars episode 76 where
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the show so if you guys want
to participate make sure to watch the
video linked below let us set up wars
begin
if you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2a
comm because they have the cheapest CD
keys available for pretty much any game
I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out so as always
you guys can find the gear for everyone
setups link down below in case you guys
are interested but here are your five
contestants for this week we have Jay
Luke Manuel Marty and storm
let's begin the show starting off the
episode strong is Jay and his gaming
rooms set up and just by glancing at
this picture I can already tell he is a
big fan of consoles
he's even rocking a custom painted NES
over there next to the Phantom 3 drone
but let's take a look at his main PC
setup so he has two 29-inch ultra wide
monitors hooked up to a stand and we
know that we have the Razer Leviathan
sound bar by the way the desk he is
using consists of three separate IKEA
desks the Lindman corner table for the
centerpiece followed by two lemon table
tops with support from two Alex shores
but moving on so we kind of stuck with
his white and green theme by going with
Razer gear he has a BlackWidow chroma
keyboard DeathAdder chroma Mouse hooked
up to the Razer Bungie and all of that
is resting on the Goliath this extended
mouse pad instead of drilling a hole
through the desk for the keyboard and
mouse Jay decided to route them off to
the right side and they just kind of
disappear afterwards but look at this
cable management just look at it I'll
leave this here for a few seconds Jay
did such an excellent job keeping them
behind the desk bundle together that you
can't even see a single wire hanging
down a plus quality work here also on a
desk we have a blue snowball mic and a
set of consoles the NES on the left side
and the Xbox one paired with the Turtle
Beach four 20x headphones Jay is such a
boss that he has one TV for each console
because you know that's how he rolls the
PC that's running this setup has a 6600
and a GTX 970 but what can I say the
symmetry is perfect attention to detail
is spot-on and everything is so damn
clean excellent setup Thank You Jay for
entering Skywalker is next up with
another impressive and very clean setup
we have a 27-inch gaming monitor from
Dell in between
standard 27-inch monitors which appears
to be mounted against the desk itself
which by the way is custom made below
that we have another set of razor gear
the BlackWidow chroma naga chroma and
the glorious extended mousepad from
Corsair he also has a monitor riser or
something similar near the keyboard
which he is using to keep some stuff
under as well as hiding a bunch of
cables very clever near the top he has
some shelves which holds his ps4 console
ashtray 50s and a few routers I gotta
say I love the placement of your mic
it's very subtle and doesn't get in the
way of anything cable management is also
excellent looks like there is some sort
of cable box near the bottom holding the
power strip and he even wrapped the
cables in a sleeve job well done
and finally the PC does pushing all of
these pixels is running on a 6700 K and
2 980 T is in SLI
it looks like we have our first rainbow
themed PC build on set upwards I gotta
give you some credit for trying
something this bold a very creative and
clean setup indeed Thank You Luke for
entering at number three we have Manuel
with a white and black setup he's
rocking the 34 inch lg ultra ride which
is hooked up to the new star monitor arm
and below that we have the Logitech G
510 keyboard and G 602 Mouse sandwiching
the monitors are a pair of Edifier
speakers and that's pretty much it on
the desk
besides the PC itself it does have the
4770k and two gtx 970 s and sli cable
management seems to be under control
thanks to the net that's holding up the
cables that comes with the ikea backhand
desk which by the way this desk is also
height adjustable I can see that the
cables are also wrapped in a sleeve and
so are the PC wires so good job there
I'm definitely diggin the atmosphere I
get this really chill vibe and I don't
know if it's coming from the furniture
in the room or the lighting or maybe
everything combined but overall a very
clean and beautiful setup Thank You
Manuel for entering marty mcfly is next
up with our first MacBook setup of the
episode I just have to say this for all
my Mac users watching this video you
guys have some of the cleanest setups
I've seen on setup wars connected to the
15-inch MacBook retina is the 27-inch
Acer quad HD monitor and below that he
is rocking both keyboard and magic
trackpad from Apple and we also have a
piano keyboard as well there's quite a
few things on the desk but he managed to
keep most of his setups symmetrical two
guitars mounted against the wall two
speakers two pairs of headphones we have
a blue Yeti Michael amp on the other
side and finally two other items and
near the back one of which is a signed
football from the 2012 Rose Bowl game
I'm sure the tablet is just there for
show but I would buy a slidable drawer
for underneath your desk where you can
store that in the cable management game
is also pretty strong the use of cable
sleeves on both sides are present and
there doesn't seem to be any cables
hanging down except for that piano thing
I don't I don't know if that's called
I'm sorry also down here we have a third
pair of headphones this one is the beats
solo and then on the opposite side if
you have a USB 3 hub for easy access a
very nice setup Marty thank you for
entering last but not least we have
storm with another triple monitor setup
I don't know what it is with the red
wall but it just makes everything stand
out I love seeing white and black
objects against a red background the
contrast is amazing by the way the
picture frame and shelves are not
straight and it's affecting my OCD
already hit that like button if you guys
are triggered - so he's got a 29 inch
ultra light in between - 23 inch LG
monitors and all three of them are
hooked up on the wall he also has the
Mad Catz v7 keyboard and Mad Catz rat 5
Mouse and there's a hole drilled inside
the desk for the cables a hanger for the
Astro a40 s would be nice to keep the
surface area clean and perhaps a red
mouse pad to keep that contrast more
consistent throughout your setup I did
leave a link to a few of them down below
in case you are interested I gotta say
the placement of your boom arm is
fantastic it doesn't get in the way of
anything and then reach when you need to
use it the PC which is dangerously
sitting on top of - IKEA shelves has a
47 70 and a gtx 750ti
I really hope you secure those shelves
because it would suck if that piece you
were to drop I gotta give you points for
not only keeping your setup consistent
with the color scheme but your entire
room as well I see that coca-cola
refrigerator and the toy car near the
back and of course we can't skip this
awesome Deadpool poster cable management
isn't bad I mean you did try to keep all
the wires off of the ground but
kinda looks a bit messy with those zip
ties sticking out I will definitely pick
up a flat power strip and hook it up
underneath your desk and connect
everything to it all you need is a cable
raceway to help with the cables and SIM
3m tape which I will link below as well
it's definitely a great setup with some
minor tweaks Thank You storm for
entering so that is it for this episode
guys thank you so much for watching make
sure you drop your comments down below
and vote on who you think has the best
desk setup as always I'll announce the
winners on my social media accounts
during the weekend thank you again so
much for watching leave a like if you
enjoy setup wars and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
