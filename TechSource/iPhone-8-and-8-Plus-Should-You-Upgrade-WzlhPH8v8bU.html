to my quicken boxing and comparison
between the iPhone 8 plus and the iPhone
8 also with a giveaway near the end also
at the end of the video I'll be sharing
my honest opinion if you guys should
really upgrade to the eighth plus or I'm
also kind of kind of compared to my
current main driver which is the iPhone
7 plus alright so let's get these out of
their boxes it's pretty straightforward
to get the same stuff that you would get
from the iPhone 7 and 7 plus the phone
is on top and underneath you get the
accessories the usual 3.5 millimeter
jack adapter and below that you get the
charging cable and the power brick in
terms of design everything is pretty
much the same coming from the 7 and 7
plus accept the fact that they now have
glass for the front and back and with
that glass change you also get wireless
charging and since it does have a glass
back it is a fingerprint magnet so I do
recommend picking up a skin or even a
case to protect it in the case I'm using
in this video is from tech 21 they do
offer a variety of clean looking cases
that protect your iPhone from drops up
to 10 feet
I like these cases because the designs
are minimalistic and they don't add any
bulk to your phone also the buttons are
very easy to press and the cutouts are
large enough that they don't block out
any ports so you don't have to worry
about plugging in third-party
accessories if you guys want to check
them out I'll drop a link to these below
as well there's also a difference in
battery life and surprisingly it's a
downgrade depending on how you look at
it the iPhone 8 and 8 plus will have
smaller batteries than their
predecessors however Apple stated that
they will last about the same this
probably means the battery optimization
through software has improved allowing
you to get these same battery life on
both devices either way I was expecting
some upgrades these phones are supposed
to be the upgrades of the iPhone 7 and 7
plus but instead we get a smaller
battery that's supposed to last around
the same time according to the website
which is kind of lame to be honest
also not to mention that the 8 and 8
plus are heavier and larger I'm not even
joking it's on the actual website but
you don't see Apple mentioning that in
their
notes are iPhone 8 and A+ are not only
thicker now but they're also heavier I
mean at least it's faster it is
featuring the new a11 Bionic chip and
the m11 motion coprocessor and based on
benchmarks it completely destroys the
note 8 and d1 + 5 which are the top
competing Android devices for Geekbench
4 and just to give you guys an idea the
baseline score of four thousand on
Geekbench 4 equates to an Intel Core i7
6600 you and the iPhone 8 + a+ scored
more than double that while the actual
size and weight are slightly bigger on
the new iPhones the resolution remained
the same the camera also got a nice bump
it's actually featuring a new sensor and
although the specs look identical on
paper the quality of the images have
been improved first up on the list is
the dynamic range you guys can
definitely tell from this picture the
foreground is much darker than the
background on these 7 plus or as it's
more balanced on the 8 plus I feel like
the exposure is balanced very well there
was one thing I don't like about the 8 +
8 + and that's actually the saturation
you can obviously tell the difference
between the two the 8 + 8 + have more
saturation in their pictures the colors
are more vibrant and they pop whereas
the 7 + 7 + have more true-to-life
colors which is actually what I
personally prefer also if you pay
attention to the grass in this picture
you can see that the 8th + has slightly
warmer colors compared to the cooler
side of these 7 + lo a performance has
also been improved slightly you can
still see some grain from the 8 but it's
not as much compared to these 7 I also
like the flash on the 8 + it doesn't
over expose the shot like it does in
these 7 + the front facing camera on
both phones do look similar except once
again the 8 + has slightly more
saturation and now they can actually
shoot up to 4k resolution at 60 fps and
slo-mo video had 240 FPS in 1080p that's
pretty cool the 7 + 7 + could also shoot
in slow-mo at 240 FPS but only in 720p
one thing that is new for photos is
their new portrait lighting which is a
fancy term for filters you can basically
take a picture and give the image and
effect to replicate
in lighting scenarios if you ask me it's
a gimmick just like live photo was I
mean the difference is very miniscule
and I guarantee almost no one is gonna
use it after a few months he also
introduced a new true tone display which
essentially changes the white point of
the display and adjust the brightness to
compensate for the lighting in the
environment what this means is that if
you're in a room with warm lighting the
screen will adjust with the temperature
of the room if you guys pay close
attention over here you can see the
brightness and the color temperature
change on the screen and finally the
phones are both still water-resistant
rated at ip67 meaning you can submerge
the iPhone in one meter for three point
three feet of water for about thirty
minutes
and speaking of water resistance so I'm
actually heading out to a cruise on the
25th to the Caribbean and there's gonna
be a lot of thunderstorms and rain I'm
sure because of Hurricane Maria and I'm
gonna be taking the iPhone 8 plus with
me because I'm sure you guys noticed
there was an audible app on the phone
and that's because I'm gonna be using it
on the trip so I my flight to Florida
and back I'm actually gonna be listening
to my favorite show Game of Thrones I'm
currently on book number two and if you
guys are a fan of the show on HBO just
like me I strongly recommend checking it
out especially since we have to wait a
while for season seven there's a lot of
stuff that they leave out on the show so
it's interesting to learn more about the
backstory and scenes that they never
showed this video is brought to you by
audible and because of that they are
giving my viewers a free audiobook with

this entire next week I'm gonna be
flying and cruising with audible so let
me know in the comment section below
what you guys love to listen to audible
the iPhone 8 and 8 plus have some decent
upgrades but let's be real this is
technically the 7s and 7s plus I would
definitely stick around for the iPhone X
or go with the Android route however if
you don't like the iPhone X or
you know pretty much made up your mind
and you much rather keep the home button
and if you want a faster iPhone with
some updated video features like slow-mo
at 240fps
and an improved camera sensor then sure
go out and throw your money at Apple if
you really are invested in iOS but for
me personally I think I'm gonna hold off
for the iPhone X just because the eight
or eight plus honestly better impress me
and I'm gonna wait and see what the
iPhone X is about before I decide on my
main driver all right so now for the
giveaway if you want to enter for a
chance to win one of these two phones
I'm actually keeping the rose gold I'm
giving away a silver silver and Space
Gray iPhone eight plus two to lucky
