today I'm going to show you how to
unlock your Motorola MOTO X for all
countries regardless of what carrier you
have unlocking your phone allows you to
use your phone with other networks and
the process is completely safe and does
not harm your phone in any way so first
off we need to get unlock code for the
phone before we proceed with the
unlocking procedure I personally use the
unlocking company for all my devices
because not only are they the largest
unlocking company to date but they also
unlock almost every gsm model ever made
and on top of all that they have the
lowest prices available in the market
with 24/7 customer support so to
demonstrate the process I'm going to use
the AT&amp;amp;T version and unlock it so I can
use it on my t-mobile network like I
said earlier it's the same exact steps
for all countries and carriers worldwide
so the next step is to head on over to
the unlocking company comm and select
your manufacturer and phone model from
the drop-down list
Motorola is the manufacturer and the
model is the Moto X and once you do that
select get unlocking code which takes
you to the next step which is to select
what country you purchase the phone from
as well as the carrier of the phone this
is the carrier that the phone is
originally purchased from in my case
it's a TMT you will need the phone's
IMEI number to continue and I'm going to
show you how to look it up on your phone
that's actually really simple you
basically go to your dial pad and you
enter in star pound zero six pound and
the code will immediately show up and
you will need to enter that on a website
to continue make sure you select the
correct currency for your country before
moving on
once you select get a locking code and
purchases securely with PayPal they will
email you the code the price and time
vary depending on the phone but they do
guarantee that you are getting the
lowest price and the fastest delivery
times currently in the market once you
receive your code via email it's time to
unlock your device turn on your phone
and remove the SIM tray you can use
either a paperclip or something else
with a sharp end to do this once the
tray is removed insert your SIM card in
the tray however please note that if
your SIM card is too big or too small to
fit the tray then you are going to need
to adjust the size accordingly for it to
fit properly I actually provided you
guys with a
in the description of where you can buy
a sim adapter or a cutting tool as well
as an instructional video on how to use
them unless you know how to do it
yourself
insert the sim tray back into your phone
and it will ask you for the pin number
right away this is where you enter the
locking code that was sent to you in the
email once accepted your phone will be
unlocked immediately and it will display
your signal strength and data speeds and
you can begin using it so that's
basically how you unlock your Moto X if
you found this video helpful feel free
to leave a like if you have any
questions or concerns as well you can
leave a comment down below and as always
I will see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
