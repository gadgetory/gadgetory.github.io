what's up guys it's ed from savage
source and we're gonna be roasting some
setups today so I reached out on Twitter
and I posted some pictures of setups and
I asked you guys to give it your best
roasts and you guys delivered you
definitely went ham on every single one
of those setups so I'm gonna be picking
the best ones and I'm gonna be featuring
them in this video and as always the
person with the worst setup will receive
a hundred dollars in cash and guys
please don't take anything seriously in
this video it is all done for pure
entertainment the people who submit
their setups actually want to be part of
the roast my set up and so anyways with
that said and done
let the roasting begin also guys before
I begin there are some pretty cool
prizes being given away on a nice app I
think some of the prizes are a gtx 1080
they also got that newly released
Logitech G 613 wireless gaming keyboard
and they've even given away an HP
Pavilion 15.6 inch laptop they've got a
bunch of more prizes and they're
constantly adding in more stuff every
single day and week so make sure you
guys download the app it's completely
free and the best part about it is the
more you guys participate and watch
videos and add stuff to your cart the
more points you get and more chances you
get for entering the giveaways so
anyways the app is linked below check it
out if you guys want setting the bar for
crappy setups as Jam and his cardboard
setup and I love that he called his desk
a self-made organic carton and modular
standing desk I mean when you think
about it it's technically modular since
you can remove the bottom two boxes and
convert it into a sitting desk instead
he even has a hanger for the raisin
cracking headset and a 2012 MacBook Pro
that's powering the setup he also has an
Ikea coffee table that's holding up his
entire setup and inside there is the
Gamecube console and a Philips RGB lamp
which by the way cost around 75 bucks so
it's interesting to see where his
priorities are at I love how he tried
the cable manage the wires if you guys
look closely he actually tried to use
some zip
times to keep the cables together but
they didn't do anything about hiding the
cables you're doing it wrong
what's interesting about this setup is
that he's using razor gear with a
MacBook and also if you're really on a
budget why did you go with Razer Kraken
headset when you can buy one of the best
budget gaming headsets for less than 25
bucks
all right let's just take a look at a
few roasts and oh my god is like over a
hundred replies alright so here's the
first victim let us read some of your
roasts out there the set up looks like a
TV card that the teacher wheels into the
room in its movie day I don't know if
that's a roast
you're asking me to roast this setup and
this is roasting my eyes okay okay a for
effort oh wait
typo a for awful I mean it looks good to
me
it looks like what I would be walking on
my 13th birthday and that has no chill
at all dude do you sleep in those boxes
right after you're done gaming yeah that
is pretty convenient actually that set
up is made in his dorm room at his
college believe it or not that's what he
put in the notes so yeah pretty
interesting place to put that kind of
setup you're supposed to unbox the
furniture first and the light just went
out perfect
all right we're back let's continue with
the roasts when are you going to unpack
your real set up how did a six year old
to figure out how to submit set up picks
it's not that hard actually those
cardboard boxes might cost more than
that Mouse did that might actually be
true because using a stock Dell mouse I
think and those boxes three boxes and if
you averaged around a dollar fifty per
box I think this is true this dude owns
a Gamecube but not melee his life must
suck
ouch dad that's a little too harsh I
think he got his setup from the storage
room at Walmart that can be true -
actually you never know you never know
when he picked up these boxes bro so
apparently this guy has major league
hacking somewhere on his setup and this
guy responded more like majorly lacking
that was pretty clever I'll give him
that your parents probably hate you
a little too harsh there I think and of
course the owner must be blind
so on that note let's move on this next
setup takes convenience to a whole new
level
not only is this set up in the kitchen
but it's right next to the fridge I'm
guessing snack time comes often for John
I mean there has to be no other
available desk or table in his entire
home that he can use for his setup so
you decided that it would be a great
idea setting this up on his kitchen
counter and you know what I call BS
because look at the height of the
counter compared to the actual chair he
has to literally sit like this in order
to use his computer
nice try troll I didn't want to have fun
reading some of these roasts already
starting off pretty good the first roast
already in the kitchen so they're
probably trying to roast it themselves
haha what a follow-up Shia LaBeouf emoji
or a meme I should say what the hell am
I saying
roasted myself bro the only games he
would be playing his countertop go wash
my dishes when you can't get a CPU
cooler so you use your fridge instead
that would have been really cool but the
fact is his PC is not in the fridge so
yeah just because it's an apple doesn't
mean it belongs in the kitchen when you
want to eat watch TV and jerk off at the
same time
candy brand skins fix that one ed no
unfortunately you cannot who forgot to
take out the trash yeah get it because
it's in the kitchen
maybe no leg room must be a double
amputee ouch
when he when you need it when you need
to play games at noon but have to make
dinner at 3:00 did he get those
peripherals on a cereal box
not even an RGB refrigerator well he's
using a Mac what is it with all these
mac books with no desk
hashtag manage your priorities this guy
is speaking the truth even the first set
up had a crappy desk actually had no
desk and he had a MacBook Pro
where are you guys PI over to you
seriously where will you put your legs
bro you'll be sitting at your computer
like elf from deathnote huh that is
exactly what I just pictured in my mind
oh my god it's hilarious
all his missing is the trash cat oh wait
my grandma setup is better believe it or
not my grandma setup is better than this
too so I don't know if that's really a
roast it's probably a girl set up so she
doesn't have to get out of the kitchen
to make a sandwich she can Google
different recipes no joke I'm textures I
think this video just kinda monetized
crap Thank You Gerardo thank you very
much I don't think my female audience
would mind anyway so there's like only
like 3% of them out of a million-plus so
I think I'm good there next up is med
what kind of a name is med exactly it
feels like your setups name should have
been named med because it definitely
needs a medic to fix up this disaster
okay so med is rocking a nineteen inch
HP monitor and a $1 optical mouse from
ebay we also got a $1 microphone from
ebay as well and a $1 mousepad also from
ebay this dude is straight up on a
budget maybe Jonathan should take some
notes from him it's also funny how he
just straight-up gave up on the cable
management you know how bad your setup
is when nothing you do can improve it I
love others a random cable hanging down
from the left side like what is that
even connected to I mean at least you
have a nice chair looking at this it's
more of a set down than a set up what
the cable management is more tangled
than my air hey yet here's a meme to add
to the episode okay when he decided to
design your cable management like your
favorite food I guess he hates his face
so he placed the monitor in front of the
mirror here's an interesting meme that
pretty much sums up my and everyone's
reaction
thank you Steve Carell I have eaten
spaghetti is greater than your PC cable
management I think you haven't cooked
your spaghetti enough that's not normal
that PC looks like it can't even handle
Google
true story your cable management is
worse than my dad's pull out Gabe
looks like c-3po from episode one Wow
it's time you quit PC master-race and
get a console that is the ultimate diss
for sure
Simon is next up with a beat up setup I
don't know what's older the desk or the
laptop he's using he does have a
Logitech G 230 wireless keyboard and the
Acme mouse hooked up to the HP laptop
and a pair of sony MDR headphones on the
left side and that's pretty much it I'm
guessing he realized that he didn't have
enough room on his desk so he mounted
his router on the wall yep that
definitely cleaned up his setup a lot by
mounting it on the wall I must agree
instead of a 1 out of 10 it is a solid 2
out of 10 now well done I don't even
want to talk about the cable management
because I might start crying at this
point so let's just jump into the roasts
and nearly went homeless and my setup
was still better than yours
that's actually a true story Wow even
have 40 likes that's impressive here's
an interesting gift that pretty much
sums up a lot of people's reaction looks
like this is the meme Edition because a
lot of you are sending in memes just
like I asked for that's that's clever
that is clever hey I gotta give you
points for for the effort so this guy
pretty much copy pasted the picture of
the setup and this meme yes this was
good what I would pay for this whole
setup I give you air from my lungs I
wouldn't give anything not even my air I
think it's a waste
thank God he went wireless with the
peripherals if you screwed a hole in the
table they would break the total
tragedies with custom seven dollars wow
this is like a realistic gif of someone
hanging themselves
you guys are savages I swear it's a
little that's taking it a little too far
but it is it is funny
Jake Paul's better
last but not least we got one and
whatever the hell this is supposed to be
honestly I don't know if this is a
picture of a rat's nest or the aftermath
of a drug bust it literally looks like
someone weighted your setup trying to
look for drugs or something similar
honestly the only good thing about the
setup is the video that you are watching
I mean this setup is a cable nightmare
so many wires coming out of everywhere
it's like a cable orgy is happening
right on your setup and the climax is
you I'm sorry to say this but that bug
spray you have on the floor is not
helping at all because you were still
able to take pics of your setup and send
them over I feel like that funnel is
used to guide his poop directly on his
setup because the setup is complete okay
I think I crossed the line there but
before I apologize to when I'm allow my
subscribers roasts in a bit my dead
grandmother has less dust on her and
I'll back it again with the savage
tweets gotta love it well the only good
thing about the setup is the video
playing on the monitor I literally made
the same grossed inside my video when
you watch Texas but get inspired by Pitt
my Senate oh my god oh you went there oh
dude I even liked that I even liked the
tweet so Savage I swear who wore a
better picture of the setup and that's
it if somebody blows the dust off this
setup Wow why this setup dustier than my
grandma's how can you even know what
that looks like
winky face de dust2 see you still
reference I'm guessing set up level
Malaysian Wow can't tell if they pulled
this stuff out of a dumpster or if it's
their actual setup one of my all-time
favorite chips from Jim Carrey this is
the perfect response from looking at
that setup roaches - this setup has the
whole package looks like Hurricane
Katrina pass through this dude's house
even the cockroaches wouldn't go near it
is setup
now why does he have a cockroach spray
I'm guessing that's one of the reasons
why they're not coming back it could be
the setup - you never know why the is
very funnel and literally explain why in
my video dirtier than all the hose
nowadays out here fact still better than
console hashtag PC master-race are we're
Osteen console gamers now seriously so
