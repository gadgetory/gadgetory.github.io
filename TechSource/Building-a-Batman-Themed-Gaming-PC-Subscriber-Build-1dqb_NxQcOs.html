and welcome back to another PC build
here on the channel today we're actually
gonna be doing a high end gaming PC for
a subscriber of mine he reached out he's
like hey ed can you build me a
sexy-looking gaming PC I'm like he came
to the right place of course so today
actually we're gonna be doing a
black-and-gray slash silver build and
he's a huge fan of Batman so when do a
batman-themed build let's go over some
parts here but before that a quick
message from our sponsor this video was
sponsored by udemy it's a website that
offers over 50,000 courses and pretty
much anything you can think of you can
learn about drawing editing videos in
Premiere or even learning about
investing into cryptocurrency one of the
courses I've been checking out is the
strategy design and development created
by Joe Natali and in this course he
talks a lot about UX and goes over a
design content and coding budda me is
not only a great place to learn new
skills but it's also a great place to
educate yourself on a new profession
that makes money for example
cryptocurrency investing in stocks real
estate and more right now everything on
the website is on sale for a limited
time so be sure to check it out by
clicking on the link below alright so
let's take a look at a few of the parts
let's start off with the CPU this is the
7800 X this is a six core processor he's
gonna be using the PC mostly for gaming
and if he ever needs to do any
productivity stuff later down the line
out of videos or stream then this
processor will cover it because it does
have 6 cores 12 threads and it's
unlocked so we're gonna overclock the
crap out of it and this is a very solid
process so the motherboard we're going
with is the asus strix X $2.99 XE we
also got a bunch of parts from Corsair
we got the H X 850 power supply and
their new H 150 eye cooler this is
actually the 360 millimetre radiator
which I've never used before so this is
actually the first time and I'm pretty
excited
we do have a buttload of fans we got
some 120 s we got some 140 s they are
RGB of course and we're gonna be hooking
them up with the commander
bro and lastly at least we're gonna top
it off where is it with some RGB strips
from them as well for storage we're
gonna be hooking up to 960 proem tattoos
in raid 0
I honestly told him this was overkill
but he didn't listen to me he picked up
two terabytes each so 4 terabytes total
in raid 0 and he has you can see there's
no hard drive there's no other SSD so
those are pretty much the main storage
device for the PC some accessories we
picked up we got the a IO sleeping kits
we're getting wrapping this around the
ugly black cable from the cooler and
this is the backplate we're gonna be
using I completely forgot about the GPU
guys we're using the Titan XP this is
their new version it's the fastest XP
out there and it's this the newest
version but yeah I think a look at this
backplate it's sick it's black with a
mirrored finish in the center and the
same style goes for all the fan grills I
got some 120 and I got some 140
millimeter fan grills again it's all
black with the nice mirrored accent in
the center so it's gonna look really
nice and that's gonna be reflecting off
some of the parts inside the build which
I think it's gonna look really really
sick and I didn't pick up some paint
also I don't know if I'm gonna be custom
painting some parts of the case maybe
but I think that I'm just in case and of
course the case we're gonna be using is
the fantex eclipse p400 I pretty much
fits the color scheme of the build it's
got a nice tempered glass side panel and
it's all black with some silver accents
and last but not least I did print out
some custom text or stickers which I
might put in the build obviously I'm
going to try and put it in a place where
it's not gonna affect the color scheme
and he said that he wants me to sign the
PC once I'm done building it so yeah
those would be the final absolute final
touches but anyways with that said let's
start building the PC it's gonna take
out the motherboard first pop in the CPU
and the RAM sticks alright let's get
cracking again guys I do want to
emphasize that all these parts were
picked up by him and sent to me for some
reason when I was announcing that I do
subscriber builds people were assuming I
was doing it for free or I was buying
the parts that is not the case guys
you have to unfortunately buy the parts
and send it over or in this case give me
the money and I purchased the parts and
haven't delivered here and inhabit built
there is one part that he is actually
using from his old PC and those are the
RAM sticks we got 32 gigs I think these
are thirty four hundred megahertz
corsair dominator platinum so yeah these
are pretty expensive so I'm glad he's
actually using some parts of his old PC
for the new one let's pop this beast in
the sockets that is the wrong way
mr. tech source there we go number one
lever to this is not popping off
sometimes it does not do that alright
CPU is in place let us do RAM sticks
next this dude has eight freakin sticks
so we're gonna occupy all eight RAM
slots which honestly looks a lot better
than just putting in four
all right looking sexy already by the
way if you guys haven't noticed we're
actually officially filming in our
office so that's probably why you can
see colorful walls in the background
that's the kind of the points of our
recording studio but let me know what
you guys think in the comment section I
don't know about an about a new about
our new recording studio but yeah we're
still waiting on carpet actually because
as you guys can probably hear we still
have some echo going on some reverb but
once we do have the rug set up its gonna
sound crisp alright this is the H 150 I
Pro from a coarser I've actually never
used this before so boom 360 millimeter
of goodness let's pop this thing out
alright so we're not gonna be using the
stock fans of course we do have amazing
RGB fans from Corsair this is the triple
pack so we're gonna be popping in these
three fans in here alright so there is a
minor complication so it's gonna require
some effort to put in the three sixty
millimeter radiator in the case because
for starters there's this plate over
here which actually acts as an extension
for the radiators so when I went ahead
and removed this we come in contact with
the hard drive cage as you guys can see
so if I were to put in the radiator in
this way it's pretty much being blocked
so it's kind of weird how they have this
in the first place because if the hard
drives is gonna be here blocking the
radiator then what's the point of
putting this in here so luckily he's not
going to be using an SSD or any hard
drives so what I can do is I can take
this out as well
so let's pop these screws out let's get
this one out of here too and I think we
should be good after this keyword I
think I think there's something holding
it for the bottom yep there is there are
two extra screws down here let's get
these out of here so much work just to
take off this freaking it rack are you
serious right now but at least it's out
now we can continue putting on the
radiator
all right so I mean at least now we have
clearance that's that's definitely a
good start
all right so ladies and germs we have
installed the three sixty millimeter
radiator it actually fit perfectly I
think there's about about an like half
an inch of clearance from the top so
perfect fit I'm glad that the Atlantic's
included an expansion Bay for the
radiator so otherwise I wouldn't have
fit so awesome job you guys great to
work there what's next I guess we can
put in the motherboard so let's go to
slide that in here what I'm thinking
about doing is since courser sent us
three extra fans I think we can just put
these in the back of the radiator and
just do a push and pull configuration so
that way I'll have an excuse to use
these bad boys and then we still have
two other boxes of 140 millimeter
radiators from radiators what am I even
smoking arms must be smoking out
something good two more boxes or two
boxes of the 140 millimeter bands Jesus
Christ okay so yeah so two 140 s will go
on the top here unfortunately I don't
have an extra 120 for the back here so
I'm not sure what I'm gonna be doing for
debts all right all the fans are inside
so I think what I'm gonna do now is hook
up the fan grills
and there's two ways you guys can do
that in case you're wondering how I how
you install these
all right so option number one is you
can actually use fan screws and screw
them inside a fan from the outside
that's only if there is no fan screw
sticking out now if you look on this one
over here as you guys can see obviously
I used the radiator mounting screws and
you cannot obviously mount the fan roll
this way because the screw hole is
already occupied so in this case what
you can do you can use the included
magnets that come with your fan grilles
so they include a bunch of them and
basically this is what it looks like for
each individual one it's got a piece of
3m tape hooked up on it so all you have
to do is peel it off and stick the
sticky side against the fan grill so I
just put it over like this and just
pretty much tap on it until it sticks on
so there you have it now because these
are all magnets obviously it's gonna
hook up straight to the screws when you
bring it close so as you guys can hear
that pretty much it snaps in place so
that's the beauty of these fan girls now
easy it is to install them so I'm go
ahead and just basically put the finger
rolls on the rest of the fans and I'll
be right back
okay so before we install the
motherboard inside the case let's hook
up both of these bad boys two terabytes
each guys a 960 Perl m dot 2 SSDs
totaling 4 terabytes of just pure
goodness so okay so this asu's
motherboard actually has this shield
over here it's kind of like an armored
thing so I'm gonna have to actually pop
this open first I think it's just a
layer of protection I don't know I don't
know if actually does anything for
cooling to be honest but those look
pretty cool and it covers those the
nasty you know label on the end dot -
there is only one m dot two slots
what the heck where are we gonna put the
second one there that out look into this
I mean this is a pretty high-end board
from Asus I would imagine it has two m
dot two slots
okay this might be a problem
no there is no extra slide on the back
sometimes motherboards have that ok oh
ok so obviously one goes here
so the other one has to be so am i blind
like it has to be somewhere on here
right that looks familiar let me see
what this looks stupid well okay that
looks I'm sorry I look stupid is that
how you connect em that ooze now surely
a soos can figure out another place to
put it that looks aesthetically pleasing
that actually makes sense now what this
stupid cover is for how does this even
oh my god what what ladies and gentlemen
a PC building in 2018 that is what your
pc looks like what the heck this is this
is the ugliest thing I've ever seen all
right first one for sure is staying
there so let's just put the cover back
on because that is going nowhere
yeah let's get the cables real quick of
course you guys know me I got I got with
the best of the best I've been using
cable mod cables for the past I think
like three or four bills now absolutely
love them let's see which one the CPU
cable is we definitely need a single
four pin so far let's turn this out so I
got the four pin hooked up let's do the
eight pin next beautiful so that's their
do you know the cables I need a hook up
are the CPU fans there's a lot of fan
cables Oh lower cable management is
going to be a pain look at all these
ki-- these are just from the fans guys
we have six seven eight nine fans in
this case look at this if this isn't
give you nightmares I don't know what
the hell does but you get cable
management part of the tech source
package so yeah it's gonna take a while
alright so we got an update to the build
the motherboard is finally inside the
case unfortunately I had to swap out the
140 millimeter fans we had to put in a
to 120 millimeter fans otherwise the
cables there was no space for the cables
to get routed towards the back we still
don't have clearance for or enough
clearance for the fan grills so
unfortunately I don't leave those off
but at least things are moving now so I
think that's a lot of matters all right
time to juice up the system ice actually
hook up the cables first before plugging
it speaking of building guys I need to
ask you guys a question if you prefer
this style of building pcs already
preferred the og time-lapse style videos
where I just basically build a PC with
music in the background compared to the
conversation type where I'm talking
while building so let me know in the
comments section your feet
back and I'll be reading the comments
guys just to see what your thoughts are
and what you prefer watching all right
time for the big boy honestly if I had
the time if the person gave me like
maybe two or three extra days to work on
the PC I would have completely taken
apart this GPU and painted it gray which
i think would look really sick but I
mean black still goes in with the color
scheme so it's not a big deal personally
I would have painted it alright slap
this bad boy in here ooh that felt good
ladies and gentlemen the climax of the
build little e is this the backplate oh
my god that looks sick he had the
reflection of the RAM sticks on there
dad likes it guys not gonna lie and
that's pretty much what the build is
gonna look like I'm gonna obviously hook
up the cables later on I'm gonna work on
some cable manager in the back but I'm
loving the way it looks so far it's a
very clean build black gray silver
accents with some white on there but
like I said guys it was up to me and not
extra time I would take off this PSU
cover and the PCI brackets in the back
and paint those great which I think will
look really really nice with the build
but so far I'm very happy with the
progress like I said we all got some
cable management and I'll see you guys
very soon to wrap it up ladies and
gentlemen of the jury welcome it is late
night around 1:40 9 a.m. cable
management was Abe
bees working on this PC but nonetheless
everything's hooked up ready to go will
it turn on that is the million dollar
question I hope it doesn't fail like my
first built in case you guys missed that
one check it out so flipping over to
switch guys here we go moment of truth
oh god I hope it works
so there are at least three fans head
hard spinning ah why I mean looks like
it's working sounds oh thank the Lord
thank the Lord's thank the PC Lords so I
want to show you guys how stupid I am
come here Bob here so this hole
commander pro unit is obviously all the
fans are hooked up to it this is what
powers the fans and what powers this
whole unit is a SATA power cable
well I hooked it up obviously as you can
tell but this entire set of cables is
connected to thin air normally at this
time I would say that it's been a long
day by this this is no excuse how did I
now connect this to the power supply oh
geez okay well you know what I'm just
gonna fast-forward to the B you all I
hope you guys enjoy this dommage
but that's the bill guys let me know
what you think in the comments section
it is it's looking very clean I think
that a pretty good job like I said I
would custom paint a few things I've had
more time but for what it is it's one
hell of a bee species so I hope you guys
enjoy the video congratulations on your
PC if you're watching and if you guys
enjoyed this type of content as always
drop a like to show your support I'll
love your faces and I will see you in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
