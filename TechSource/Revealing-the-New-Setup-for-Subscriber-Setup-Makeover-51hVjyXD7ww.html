warships is free-to-play but just for my
subscribers watching I'm gonna hook you
guys up with some awesome rewards that
includes a million credits a premium
ship and more a fee download the game
using my link below
you
so we made it to Phillips house around
1:00 p.m. and we didn't waste any time
we started to remove his old crappy desk
so that I can build him a new setup this
was obviously the first time I've built
a setup from scratch in someone else's
house so I was kind of worried about a
few things you know I was worried about
not finishing on time I was worried
about damaging his wall I was also
worried about the setup looking like
crap in the end you know it's one thing
to design it and see it on paper and
it's another thing to actually build it
and see it in person all right so
basically this is the wall we're gonna
be working with this is where we put in
the setup together and already we're
coming across our first issue and we
haven't even begun so the table top
we're gonna be using is actually 74
inches wide but upon further
investigating I don't think there's
gonna be plenty of or enough space to
put that on there because the tabletop
comes all the way up here and it's gonna
cover up the third drawer there's gonna
be one Alex you're specifically used to
hold the PC and then two other Alex
yours that I give me the support for an
entire desk so unfortunately we're gonna
have to cut off one Alex your and just
use two and put the tabletop on there
and the PC is gonna go on the far right
and little that I know that was the
beginning of the many bumps along the
road I think I miss calculated or miss
measure or something and I'm gonna have
to go with the flow unfortunately wait
what the hell is that is this Lube
interesting stuff down here once we move
the desk so then I have to vacuum it up
a little quick so yeah guys make it a
habit to clean behind your desk once in
a while you might have some stuff that
drops back here you don't even know
pencil obviously the only person in the
room is me and my cousin Bob who was
filming a video and also helping me put
together just set up Phillip is kind of
just chilling in the living room so that
we can call him in here and film as a
reaction once everything is done
all right so I want to mount the
ultra-right against the wall and I'm
gonna be using the mounted to do so so
the only issue with this type of mount
is that it really depends on where the
stud is against the wall because if it's
kind of all too far to the left or too
far to the right then the monitor is not
gonna be centered exactly in the middle
so that's gonna be the tricky part so I
guess I'm gonna figure out where the
stud goes where the stud is because you
guys know me I want to make it as
symmetrical and as centered as possible
so I will need my stud finder which is
this little thing I see if I can find it
all right so we got one right here
the next stud is over here because this
is too far to the left and then this is
too far to the right so I'm hoping I'm
really hoping that this is Center or at
least as close as possible to the middle
because otherwise it's not gonna look
good how does it look yeah I mean we
could always adjust the arm in just a
little bit maybe pop it out to
compensate but only one way to find out
honestly because there's really no other
option I just realized what we forgot I
forgot to pick up the cable raceway to
hide the cables running down the monitor
I thought I see I told you guys I knew
doesn't forget something and not only
one of the things I just realized
so after six very long hours we finally
managed to complete the set up but with
some minor complications which I will go
over near the ends but for now here is
his reaction
okay mother
holy smokes what dude that's insane
I've never even seen anything like this
crazy
it's dead silent - you can't even hear
that that's ridiculous
waiting about the color scheme you said
you love why the blue so we trying to do
that's so nice man
thank you so much wise dude yeah no
worries man you deserve it I want to
show you one cool thing though all right
I don't even notice that over there a
little plaque yeah
number one contestant so you can turn it
on no way that's also you can change
your colors do you make it red white
holy smokes it's all it's all
color-coded yeah but yeah sweetie and
I'm they're really nice to me uh yeah
let's
yeah
beautiful so you have had this things
packing 7600 K I over clocked it for you
that's a point nine max of about 2 grams
card as well I even overclocked do or
monitor it's at 100 Hertz refresh rate
what yeah cuz you think as well so you
can pretty much tear it again maxed out
settings you got 32 gigs of RAM so
pretty
and yes ooh shrieks 10:17 oh one of the
cool things about your that's what I
know if you noticed here it's the EPA
yeah it's got order USB ports plugged in
so I can actually was hanging you can
plug in the cable and let it juice up so
next time beyond anything yeah Thank You
coolermaster I'm very appreciative yeah
mine I think we're out of here
enjoying your setup again have any
questions yeah I would say I'm pretty
damn satisfied with how everything
turned out near the end I have to keep
telling myself that this is my first
time doing something this big so
obviously it's not gonna be perfect for
my first time but believe me I've
learned so much from this experience
that I'm gonna bring with me for the
next contestant obviously I wanted to
keep everything either white and blue
but Coolermaster just doesn't have any
white options available until recently
they announced their new white H 500 P
but the PC was built like two months
before that announcement otherwise
believe me I would have used that case
for the build if there's one thing I can
tell Coolermaster to focus on this year
I would say please for the love of God
do us all a favor and please work on
more white product we need to see white
keyboard mouse and even case options
please so I had this one-of-a-kind
custom plaque made just for the series
with Philips name on it and the setup
makeover logo which kind of sits on this
stand with RGB strips underneath that
you can control using a remote and I
thought that was pretty cool
now originally I plan to have the plaque
set directly right smack in the center
of the setup but the height of the
actual desk and the monitor were
different in person so the plaque ended
up blocking a monitor
you so I had to move it over to the side
which actually ended up looking a lot
better
unfortunately now there's this nasty
cutout that's visible from the add-on
unit and that's originally where the
plaque was supposed to be another issue
I ran into believe it or not I know it's
coming from me was the cable management
there is this nasty cable running down
the center of the desk which annoyed me
so much okay so the wire is actually the
cable coming from the left speaker that
needs to be plugged into the subwoofer
otherwise it's not gonna work and the
reason why it's running straight down is
because the cable is so short that there
isn't enough slack to run it across the
back of the desk and behind one of the
Alex yours and the funny thing about all
this is it's an easy fix all I had to do
was cover up the cable using a wall
raceway which is one of the items that I
forgot to bring with me I also forgot to
bring the white cable sleeve which was
supposed to be used to cover up the
cables near the bottom you know as
someone who has really high standards
and this obsession with perfection I was
honestly disappointed that this was the
reflection of my work it bothered me so
much that I even wanted to go back pick
it up and come back another day but at
that point I just want to fill up to
enjoy his setup you already made him
wait like four months for it I've
learned so much from this entire project
and honestly none of this would have
been possible if it weren't for
Coolermaster who supplied most of the PC
parts and the peripherals for this setup
also huge things to Asus for providing
me with a graphics card at motherboard
and of course a huge huge thanks to
David for working with me on the design
and 3d printing these awesome items
overall I would say season one was a
huge success in my part Philip did enjoy
his setup and he said that there is
nothing that he would change it's
perfect the way it is the only thing I
recommended to M was the cable raceway
to cover up that wire and of course a
touch of his personality as he gets used
to the setup whether its picture is
hanging from the wall or whatever it is
he needs to add some personality to make
that setup his and that pretty much
wraps up the first season of setup
makeover I want to give you huge things
to fill up for being such a cool dude
again congratulations on your setup you
completely deserve it and again a huge
