of setup or is potato addition now
normally I would put on my douchebag hat
and I would bash on some of the worst
setup submissions that I received on the
show but this is tech source and you
guys know how we do I like to change
things up a bit and add a new element if
I can to kind of spice things up so this
is a set of boards episode 60 potato
addition with a hint of vodka so I'm
basically going to take one shot of
vodka before I look at each setup so I
think it's a total 5 shots and just to
reminder you guys about a heavy drinker
at all I only drink at special occasions
like birthdays and like Christmas
parties and stuff like that so I'm very
lightweight when it comes to alcohol so
this video is either going to be a
complete disaster or it's going to be an
interesting one so it's probably going
to be disaster and just like always the
person would be worse the set up will
receive 100 bucks and there will be a
strap holding down below so make sure
you guys vote at the end of this episode
but ladies and gentlemen without wasting
any more time
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below
alright so the five victims for this
episode are Maurice Calum journey John
and you Knights or you nice I'm so so
sorry and just to prove to you guys that
this is an actual bottle of vodka it's
still sealed and you guys will hear me
crack it open so to start off the show I
will take one shot with my kind of a
shot glass I swear it's such a bad idea
Oh God alright I should get this over
with alright someone sawed up with
John's setup and it looks like we have a
triple monitor set up with an iMac in
the middle looks like the keyboard is
from Dell and that is a very
strange-looking Mouse which I'm not sure
where exactly it's from but there's a
lot of crap on the desk honestly
sometimes it's not even about the setup
but what's around it that really bothers
me and this guy looks like he is a very
messy person is that a trashcan next to
his desk it looks like it does
voice-overs maybe has a YouTube channel
or something because there is a mic
hooked up to a boom arm cable management
alone is atrocious and it doesn't look
like John has any organization skills
that's for sure
in one of the drawers he has a random
power strip just laying there that's not
connected to anything and then we have a
set of floppy disks or floppy drives
aren't even what they're called at this
point okay which explains the ancient
Mac way over there in the corner
honestly I don't even know what to
recommend at this point this setup is so
far gone that it is beyond repair
honestly there's just so many wires to
work with there's some cables running up
to the ceiling and there's some against
the walls I mean it's just a complete
disaster
seriously though those floppy drives so
yeah I think I've had enough for one
setup thank you John for entering let's
go to
move on to the next setup the first we
need to take our second shot I'm not
gonna lie I'm like ten percent now I'm
pretty good I don't even know how people
drink the straight without any tracers
honestly I can't do it ah integrate
finish this this is not gonna end well
all right maurices next up so we have a
Yama Pro light monitor genesis rx 55
gaming keyboard speed link dicus gaming
mouse and a Plantronics game con headset
the setup is actually not that bad wait
no I take that back there's just so many
random stuff on the floor why do people
do this constantly in the cable
management is I don't I don't even know
what to say is that a loose plug just
lying on the floor right there
what is that even connected to looks
like more easy dirt has a collection of
speakers or he basically hoards them I
don't know what they're doing on the
side of the setup but they definitely
don't belong there I'm curious what he
has in his PC do so it looks like we
have an FX 4100 and a sapphire r9 390
not bad at all I just wish your setup
was as good as your PC again I'm not
sure what those boxes are doing on top
of your PC and there just seems to be so
many things lying around on your desk
there's no real place to store them and
there is definitely no coordination I
mean you have a pair of gloves on your
ps3 for God's sake I don't know what
else to say Maurice but thank you for
entering and let's move on to Caleb's
setup this one wasn't that bad actually
I think I put a second one it's it goes
down smooth so Caleb is next up with
some sort of a dual monitor setup we
have a 19 inch HP monitor paired with
the Technica Smart TV and for the
keyboard we have a Mad Catz v5 and a
Staples optical mouse Kaylin bought a
mouse from Staples I don't even know
what to say
so the first thing I noticed is his mic
setup we have a Logitech Guitar Hero
World Tour microphone embedded
between a set of pens I gotta say that
is pretty creative but what the hell is
that clay stuff next to it that seems
pretty gross come to think of it that
actually doesn't even look like a desk
it looks like some sort of a drawer or a
nightstand because that monitor on the
left is definitely about to fall off I
honestly don't see how you can even game
on this let alone do any work and of
course the cable management is
completely devastating there's so many
wires everywhere and you have a random
set of CDs way on the bottom which you
probably forgot about the PC does
magically powering the setup has an FX
4300 and a gtx 750ti
I mean I get that you have a small
surface to work with but why do you have
extra stuff on there anyways like those
note cards or a random screwdriver I
mean those can easily be stored
somewhere else honestly the biggest
recommendation I can give you is to get
a bigger desk that will you have a much
larger surface to work with and for the
cable management I would buy an omni
mount cable sleeve and without those
cables through and maybe even pick up a
cable box to hide the power strip in but
overall not the worst setup I've seen on
the worst set up edition of setup wars
Thank You Caleb for entering setup
boards all right so moving on to Unisa
setup we have what in the actual is this
it looks like there's a printer on top
of a PC case now that ladies and
gentlemen is something I've never seen
on the show before so we have a 19 inch
AOC monitor and a4tech natural a
keyboard and a crappy logitech and 105
mouse on top of a fellow's mouse pad
I got headed to you nice though I mean
for such a small surface area to work
with he definitely made it work I mean
you put a printer on top of his PC and
then he put his phone on top of the
printer I mean that this is someone was
definitely good at Jenga so on the right
side of his setup we have a Rubik's Cube
that's solved we also have a wireless
Bluetooth speaker looks like and also a
set of speakers in the back of his
monitor putting the speakers together
like this kind of the Feast of purpose
so I would definitely move one of those
and maybe even put it on the other side
or better yet stack it on top of the
printer
and of course cable management is
atrocious
Alice II don't even know how it got this
bad if I want to recommend a few things
I would definitely say first off get a
better desk because this one looks like
it's about to fall apart and also a new
chair because looks like your dog ate
half of that I don't know if I should be
thankful or upset that you didn't show
me the inside of your PC but nonetheless
thank you uniess for entering setup
boards if you made it this far you guys
are good ah so bad I can't do another
shot I can't
so--that's but not least we have journey
with a single monitor setup we have a
dell 17-inch flat panel a crossfire
Aloha
gaming combo for the keyboard and mouse
and you have a total beach px 21
headphones or headset I should say
honestly just by glancing at the setup
it looks like this is the best one out
of the episode nope take that back we
also have a DeLorean made out of Legos
and a pretty cool set from Game of
Thrones
it appears that journey is a black belt
or at least I think he's a black belt
and by the looks of the awards and
certificates on the wall he's also very
educated so hopefully you don't find me
and do some bad things to me because I
apologize I'm not doing this sober and
please forgive me so on the left side of
his setup is a giant TCL TV which looks
like it's hooked up to the PC as well as
the ps3 and you know what that surface
looks very dirty need to dust that did
you seriously leave a random tag for
your clothes on the desk there it's one
thing to have a crappy setup because
you're on a budget but it's also another
thing not to clean the damn area before
taking pictures this entire desk is full
of dust and dirt and look at the damn
ground it's completely filthy well the
last time you actually vacuumed the
place and lastly the PC that's powering
the setup has a GeForce GTX 960 and an
AMD FX 6100 I do like some of the stuff
that's organized I mean you have a
headphone anger against the wall and you
have a nice rack for your karate belts
or
them but overall I mean just the
cleanliness of your setup is a complete
disaster and cable management definitely
needs a lot of work so I would
definitely recommend watching my cable
management video for some tips I would
also strongly advise investing in a
vacuum cleaner but ladies and gentlemen
that will do it for this episode of
setup wars I'm about to pass out
seriously Jesus Christ drop your
comments actually no click on the shop a
link down below and vote on who you
think has the worst desk set up ahead of
this episode and that person will win
100 bucks anyways yeah if you enjoyed
drunk addition potato addition up set up
bores leave a like
I don't know comment down below if you
want to see another episode I don't know
what I'm saying at this point honestly
I'm like blacking out but my head is
freakin sweating Jesus yeah a vote and I
will see you guys in the next video
Jesus
I am seriously freaking this arena holy
