source and in this video we're gonna be
taking a look at the new high sense.you
LED 4k Android TV high sense was kind
enough to sponsor this video and send in
their 55 inch model for me to review
however they do have a 65 inch version
available as well this is actually
perfect timing because my last TV was
unfortunately stolen so after this video
my office is gonna have a TV once again
both sizes our reason will be priced
when it comes to Smart TVs with built in
HDR but at what cost
I'm sure the ad to cut corners somewhere
to bring in guys such an awesome price
and that's kind of what we're here to
find out is it really worth it or should
you spend a little more and get
something better so first let's start
off with the design immediately it
reminds me of the LG G 6 series with the
picture on glass it looks unbelievably
thin from the sides and here's a dime
just for reference towards the bottom it
does get thick obviously because that is
where all the internals are any built-in
speakers which are facing the back
that's actually the main reason why the
TV has such thin bezels all around in
the first place
if they did put the speakers on the
bottom the TV would have a thick chin
aesthetically the TV isn't bad looking
very modern like with even bezels and
the minimalistic base design actually
they do have two more speakers on the
bottom facing down and that's one of the
reasons why the TV is able to produce
such great sound while sticking with
smaller bezels the TV can be mounted via
VESA mount however you have to pick one
up separately which isn't that bad
considering you can buy one for as low
as 16 dollars
now these speakers get insanely loud at
50 percent it's loud enough to fill the
entire room but I was surprised to find
out even at a hundred percent the sound
doesn't get distorted that's very
impressive there isn't that much
emphasis on the bass however but the
highs are nice and clear if you're
someone who prefers more bass then I
strongly recommend picking up a sound
bar or looking for a different TV now
the TV is using Ultra LED technology or
youlet for short and it's basically a
fancy way of saying that it has really
high contrast a wide color gamut and
smooth motion overall the picture
quality and viewing angles are great I
wouldn't say it's the best quality out
there I mean it doesn't come close to
OLED panels but for the price is
definitely one of the best you can get
I mean it is 2018 at this point is
really hard to make a TV with bad
picture quality so the TV has a native
120 Hertz refresh rate and it supports
both HDR 10 and Dolby vision speaking of
gaming I had a blast playing spider-man
on my ps4 Pro the difference between HDR
is night and day oddly enough there is
actually less contrast through HDR but
it actually makes the game look a lot
better the shadows and highlights are
more prominent in the overall picture
looks brighter and well balanced with
HDR off you get more contrast there's
actually a lot of darker areas present
especially when you're swinging across
the buildings underneath the Sun you can
see some areas darken and begin to see
less details the dynamic range is way
better with HDR enabled in terms of
ports the TV does have a single 4k at 30
Hertz HDMI port next to the ethernet and
audio jacks on the other side you'll
find two USB ports one of them is USB 3
and the other is USB 2 you'll also find
another 4k at 30 Hertz HDMI and two
additional 4k at 60 Hertz HDMI slots the
response time when gaming is really low
you're getting less than 35 milliseconds
which is great considering you're gaming
in 4k with HDR on I don't even notice
any delay or lag while playing
spider-man if you're a casual gamer and
you're playing RPG adventure or even
racing games then this TV is great for
that however if you start playing
shooter games like black ops or
fortnight any game that involves timing
and responsiveness that's when you'll
start to notice the latency on the TV
and fortunately so my favorite thing
about this TV is that it's powered by
Android the more time I spend with it
the more I enjoyed using it so there's a
huge difference between TVs that come
with Android built in and also other TVs
that have their very own custom UI first
of all you're very limited on what apps
you can download and what apps you can
use if you're using a TV that has its
very own custom UI that isn't Android
with Android TV you can pretty much do
anything you have the freedom to
download any app that's available in the
Google Play Store
almost every video streaming app is
available to download except Amazon
video which I was not able to
you can cast photos videos music and
other content you love from your Android
device
now since the TV is powered by Android
you do get access to a bunch of Google
services like Google Assistant home
Google cast and even the TV works with
Amazon Alexa for the most part the OS is
snappy I mean you do get the occasional
hiccup and lag scrolling through the
apps but it doesn't happen often and
launching apps is fairly quick now the
remote may be a hit or miss for some
people first of all they made it really
small and they removed a lot of buttons
from it to make it very minimalistic the
numpad is replaced by a shortcut that
brings it up on the TV and they even
added shortcuts to all the popular
streaming apps you got Netflix YouTube
sling and even a dedicated Google Play
shortcut as well my favorite thing about
the remote is the built-in microphone
and it's crazy how accurate it is you
can pretty much tell it to do anything
you want look up tech source PC builds
on YouTube switch to my PlayStation 4
play black mirror
okay both of you Netflix
what's the weather like in Tokyo Japan
now normally I would prefer like a
full-size keyboard somewhere maybe on
the back of the remote just so it's
easier to type in usernames and
passwords but it's not really a
deal-breaker for me especially
considering how accurate the voice
command is and I can pretty much use
that to do most of the work anyways when
I'm shopping around for a TV I'm looking
for a few things a TV that has great
picture quality viewing angles great
sounding speakers low latency for
console gaming and a UI that's not only
snappy but offers a lot of apps the
intuitive remote with the voice control
is a nice plus and the price of the TV
makes it very appealing to a lot of
people who are on tight budgets I
definitely think that high sense checked
a lot of boxes when it comes to the h9 t
plus I don't really have anything bad to
say about the TV to be honest other than
the speaker is lacking some bass and the
latency when it comes to gaming but
that's pretty much all that I could
think of for the price it's a solid TV
and I don't have a problem recommending
this to my friends or family with that
said if you guys are on a budget and
you're looking for a solid 4k HDR smart
TV for consuming content and casual
gaming
then the Hisense h9e plus should
definitely be on your list to check out
doubling below if you guys are
interested as always thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
