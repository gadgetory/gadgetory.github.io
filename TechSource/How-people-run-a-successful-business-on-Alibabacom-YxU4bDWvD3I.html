and I'm here at the alibaba.com booth at
CES 2018 the purpose of this video is to
give you some insight on Alibaba comm
and how they make it easy to do business
anywhere that we love as we love small
businesses and their stories and one of
the things that I love about my job is
being able to meet a lot of these small
businesses were starting out turning
their good ideas into great businesses
launched in 1999 alibaba.com is the
leading platform for global wholesale
trade and I'm here at CES to talk with a
few suppliers to see how they were able
to grow their business using the
platform ten years ago the overseas
buyers do not know and just know a
little bit about Chinese market and with
Alibaba Alibaba helped us to contact
with overseas buyers overseas buyers can
select high quality suppliers from
Alibaba just like us and the other night
suppliers right here and after that they
offer us information with the buyers and
with the traders rooms which trade with
overseas buyers more frequently and more
safety they decrease the risk for the
payment and the product and logistic for
all kind of business after talking to so
many people about how alibaba.com helped
their business grow I wanted to get a
better idea of Alibaba coms plan for
growth I had the opportunity to speak
with the Global Marketing Manager we
really want to become immersed into the
small businesses day to day journey now
we really want to be looked at as
thought leaders not just a platform
we're helping SMEs trade obviously
that's what we are we started with that
back in 1999 eighteen years later we're
only getting better at that but as
technology improves as as small
businesses are finding new and new ways
of connecting but they're socially
whether it's personally we want to make
sure we incorporate that into our
products and services and become a true
technology company that's very data
oriented speaking of small businesses it
was inspiring to walk around the show
floor checking out some of the amazing
products that helped grow these small
businesses so out of curiosity I spoke
with one of the suppliers to find out
what type of products they are selling
we are made mainly the supplied
headphones for serious headphones but
now mainly the main products are
Wireless active noise-cancelling
headphones these models and Brutis
headphones stylish headphones also we
have the PC has gaming SS and part of
all virtual speakers Michael is just one
of the many successful suppliers using
the platform and it's great to see so
many different type of products being
sourced through Alibaba comm which is
great for the buyers since it offers a
wide selection with over hundreds of
millions of products in over 40 major
product categories it's no wonder that
Alibaba comm is the leading platform for
global wholesale trade be sure to check
out the full CES livestream which I will
