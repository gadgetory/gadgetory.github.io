One m9 is sponsored by cell cashier com
they compare iPhone prices on the
internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iphone with
Samsung's release of the galaxy s6 and
s6 edge early this year they seem to
have claimed the number one spot already
for having the best smartphone so far
for 2015 however there are still plenty
of other phones to be released and the
title is still up for grabs HTC on the
other hand didn't do such a good job
with their m9 in all my videos the phone
has been lacking in all crucial areas
like battery life performance heating
issues and the notorious disappointing
camera overall it was actually a
downgrade from last year's model but how
does it compare to the galaxy s6 well in
this video we're going to take a look at
five reasons why the galaxy s6 is better
than the HTC One m9
so I mentioned battery life performance
in the beginning well the m9 actually
reduce battery life compared to the m8
for a typical use the m8 lasts on
average seven hours and 12 minutes
whereas the m9 only lasts six hours and
25 now this is based on phone arenas
custom web script which replicates
typical real life usage and even though
the galaxy s6 has larger screen
resolution and a smaller battery it's
still last longer than the m9 with an
average use of seven hours and 14
minutes so the first reason why the
galaxy s6 is better than the m9 is
simply because of its battery life
performance reason number two is the
performance in my speed test and
benchmark tests the galaxy s6 dominated
the m9 from booting up to app opening
speeds and multitasking web browsing and
even scored much higher on the benchmark
tests the only test that the m9 was
faster on was the google voice test and
even then it was like a few milliseconds
so if you want a much faster crispy
phone and you're deciding between both
of these then the galaxy s6 is your
obvious choice next reason is the
resolution now I'm not going to say it's
better because it has a bigger screen
because that becomes a personal
preference instead I'm going to say that
it's better because it has more pixels
the m9 stuck with their 1080p display
while the s6 upgraded to a 1440p display
which makes everything look a lot
sharper and give it even though it's not
necessary and many people are happy with
their 1080p display it still doesn't
change the fact that the s6 has a better
display reason number four is the
charging features not only does the s6
and s6 edge come with wireless charging
capabilities but they also include
Samsung's fast charging technology which
will get you a full charge in only 78
minutes compared to the m9 which takes
106 minutes for a full charge the final
reason is because of its camera no doubt
the galaxy s6 has a much better camera
than the m9 in fact that has the best
camera so far putting even the iphone 6
and shame in my camera comparison video
between both phones if you guys somehow
missed those videos you can find the
link to them right below but not only
does the s6 provide sharper more vibrant
and sure to life pictures but it also
shoots amazing smooth video and it has a
much better front
seem camera the m9 20.7 megapixel camera
doesn't even come close to the galaxy s6
is 16 megapixel camera so there you have
it 5 reasons why the galaxy s6 is better
than the HTC One m9 if you guys enjoyed

reasons or not also that I missed a
