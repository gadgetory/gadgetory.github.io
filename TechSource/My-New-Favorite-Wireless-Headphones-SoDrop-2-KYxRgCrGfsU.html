amount of the year from CES to Computex
and a bunch of other small events now as
much of a burden traveling can be
nothing makes it worse than clutter and
that's why I try to minimize the amount
of cables I carry with me from
self-maintained wallet battery packs to
tech jackets I mean everything has its
place and usually more than one function
if you're a longtime viewer then you
might know that I've been carrying
around the so drop from ghost tech as my
travel headphones and they've been
serving me very well with no problems
for about a year now so when I saw that
Ghost Tech released the so dropped twos
obviously I had to pick them up and see
if they were a worthy successor design
wise these two are very similar with a
few minor tweaks in a few areas we now
get a more geometrical ear cup design
darker aluminum as well as more color
choices and a softer perforated leather
but more on that later in the box you do
get a hard carrying case USB for
charging as well as an auxiliary cord
the controls are on the right side and
on the top we get the power buttons that
also function as the play/pause and the
phone call controls the volume control
underneath also doubles as track
selection when you hold either the up or
down button for three seconds they're
both well and offer a tactile feedback
here's also where you will find a
microphone charging an exhilarating
audio sample from the microphone this is
a test of the microphone on the ghost
Tech so drop 2.0 as you can hear it's
clear and this will be just fine for
phone calls eight times or whatever else
your audio needs might be it's very easy
to find a good fit with the eight
position aluminum sliders and overall
it's it's very snug on your head and
thanks to its flexible design it doesn't
squeeze too tight either with a single
charge you get 14 hours of music
playback or call time and a crazy 540
hours of standby time the great news is
that the new materials improve on the
already good feel of the so drops I've
worn these for three even four hour
stretches without any discomfort thanks
to the soft leather combined with its
low weight the wireless range is about
thirty feet with no interruptions which
is great but at a thick wall or any more
distance into the mix and you will be
experiencing drops and even
bag the 40-millimeter driver produces
pronounced bass while still preserving
the detail in the highs and mids all
genres would go great thanks to this
detailed retention even at higher
volumes but if you're into songs that
benefit from high bass like techno and
rap then you're going to especially love
the sound signature coming out of these
even more now when you plug in
exhilarating cluded the bass response
does get a bit tighter and the high ends
do improve as well so when the quality
matters most users have the option of
going wired if they want to
now I'm not an audiophile by any means
so the convenience of wireless is what I
would choose over the slight improvement
and sound the one complaint I had with
the last generation model was the sound
leak and the sound isolation and it
seems they took notice the so drop two
has much less sound leak as well as a
greater sound isolation with its new
bi-directional noise reduction
technology obviously they're not going
to compare it to active noise isolation
on Bose headphones for example but they
do reduce all noise around the ear which
for me is a big deal since I'm going to
be using these again for travel here's a
quick test of the sound leak with the
headphones both on and off
now these do retail for around $100 MSRP
but if you guys use the code down below
you can get them for only $30 on Amazon
I'll drop a link to them down below as
always thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
