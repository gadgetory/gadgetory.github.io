a quick look at a cool watch from
tokyoflash calm first of all I want to
thank everyone i talked to flash for
setting this to us i went ahead and
added some links to their website if you
guys want to browse the fine selection
of awesome watches now this is the key
side ohto LCD wife and it goes for 149
and it isn't an ordinary LCD watch and
I'll explain why in a bit when you do
order one you get a charging cable a
mini screwdriver any small manual and
what makes this watch pretty cool is the
way tells time in fact all the watches
on the site have a unique style telling
time it's almost like looking at a
puzzle and trying to figure out what
it's trying to say but I did decide to
go with the most simple one for the sake
of the video the quality of the watch is
great the belt feels really sturdy in
the matte black really goes well with
this design on this side of the watch is
where you'll find three buttons which
you can use to change the time and date
as well as training the LED on and off
on the other side of the watch is where
the sensor and charging port are located
you can simply charge the watch back
connecting into your computer and what's
cool is that this watch is also water
resistant so this is how you tell the
time on this particular watch the first
two horizontal digits are the hours the
bottom two are ten minutes and the two
vertical digits on the right side rd
seconds with a press of a button you can
also view the day month and year you
never know there might come a time where
you forget what year it is so having one
of these watches can come in handy you
can also choose from a variety of LED
colors they have amber red green and of
course the blue that you see here so
that wraps up the quick look at the key
scioto led watch from tokyoflash the
question I asked you guys is do you
still wear a watch if you do why I
personally put mine up for special
occasions because it affects my
appearance so thanks again for watching
the video if you haven't subscribed
already make sure to do so because we
got a lot of cool videos coming up soon
this is the tech source and we'll see
you next time
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
