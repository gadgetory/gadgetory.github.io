welcome to my Cyber Monday tech deals
video we're gonna be going over some of
the awesome tech deals we found for
cyber monday and i also drop a link to
the full list in the description section
in case you guys don't want to sit
through and watch the entire video you
can also find these deals on our website
deals our tech our entire team is
actually uploading deals as they come
through for the entire week of cyber
monday so the website is constantly
stocked up with fresh deals that we find
not only for us but for UK Canada and
even Germany so check it out and make
sure you guys bookmark it so the first
amazing deal is gonna be actually on
this the 2018 LG gram which I actually
reviewed on the channel you can now get
up to $300 off depending on the side is
for cyber monday which is an awesome
deal it's a super thin lightweight
laptop that comes equipped with an intel
8th gen i 78552 quad-core cpu we've also
got eight gigs of ram and a 512 gigabyte
m2 SSD what makes these laptops so
special other than its light weight is
the insane battery life you can actually
get up to 17 and a half hours of use on
this 72 watt hour battery so if you're
constantly on the move you don't need to
carry the charger with you will pretty
much last the whole day until you get
home to charge it the 14 inch display
has a 1080p IPS touchscreen with great
viewing angles also the overall
footprint of the laptop is much smaller
but because of the thin bezels you get a
lot of screen real estate the backlit
keyboard is nice it doesn't have a
numpad but the keys are spaced nicely
and they're comfortable to type on with
great feedback the touchpad is in a
really good spot and doesn't interfere
while typing and from my experience it's
actually really accurate it may not have
a dedicated GPU but for people that are
looking for a portable lightweight
laptop for productivity that lasts all
day then you should definitely check out
the LG gram especially since you can get
up to $300 off for Cyber Monday and I'll
drop a link to it down below another
deal from LG is their 4k laser Sena beam
projector which as the name says
projects 4k picture quality up to 150
inches the projector has this
rectangular shape to it with a handle
making it convenient to carry around and
you can actually place it either flat on
your desk keep it in vertical mode or
mount it anywhere you want it's pretty
flexible the cool thing about this
projector is that it comes with
OS so you don't need to hook up an
external source to it you can basically
stream content through the projector
itself so whether it's Netflix YouTube
or whatever it is you want
compared to other 4k projector is out
there the LG center beam is actually one
of the most affordable right now in the
market all right now let's take a look
at some deals I found on Amazon Newegg
and eBay but once again guys make sure
to check out the full list down below
because obviously my gonna go through
every single deal this video will last a
very long time
alright so the first deal with taking a
look at is these samsung t5 portable SSD
this is one terabyte and it's actually
going for 198 dollars coming from the
original price of 230 so you're saving
130 dollars on this and actually I
picked this up in August 2000 18 so I'm
curious to see how much I paid back then
let me just double check this real quick
Wow that's why I paid actually $280 for
this at the time so it's nice to see
that they actually lowered the price on
this but either way you guys can get it
for 198 for Cyber Monday next up is the
fire stick TV with the echo combo and
this is in white you guys can get it for
$40 coming from the original price of 70
so you're saving $30 on this and by the
way guys don't pay attention to the list
price that is always in accurate we
based the original price on the actual
original price before
cyber monday if you guys are into drones
we got the DJI Mavic air that's going
for $700 it's actually $100 off for
cyber monday the popular Bayer dynamic
DT 7-7 headphones are going for only 129
so this is actually $40 off for cyber
monday these are really popular
headphones for monitoring audio so if
you guys are mixing or mastering music
definitely check this one out the EVGA
750 supernova 80 + platinum power
supplier is $20 off so it's not the best
deal out there but $20 is still
something you guys are planning on
building a high-end PC then definitely
check this power supply but if you're
planning on building a budget PC this is
definitely overkill the Samsung Galaxy
Tab A and white is going for 210 dollars
from the original price of 310 so this
is actually $100 off that is
a pretty killer deal on a really great
tablet based on the reviews two hundred

tablet but if you guys are looking to
buy one definitely put this on your list
here's a really great deal on the r-tx
twenty eighty from gigabyte guy this is
going for seven hundred and fifty
dollars and these GPU prices are all
over the place but the cheapest I've
