and welcome to PC wars episode 11 where
you submit your custom PC to get
featured on their show if you guys have
a pretty sweet-looking rig and want to
participate make sure to watch the video
linked all the way on the bottom without
wasting any more time let the PC wars
begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always you guys can find the specs to
each PC down below but here are your 5
lucky contestants for this week we have
max Elbert no Roo oh wow oh just gonna
call you oh and Sam congratulations for
making it on this show let's go in and
start off with Max's PC so starting off
the show we have a gorgeous black in
green build from max we got a 59 30 K
that's overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz and
it's also rocking to GTX 980 s and SLI
we also have some ek water blocks custom
sleeping from a 22 and 16 gigabytes of
RAM from hyper x4 benchmarks it's called
a 20 mm 301 placing it way up there and
pretty hard to beat for this episode now
I normally don't recommend things or
give my opinions and PC Wars since the
point of these series is to show off
sweet looking rigs
but if you like going with a painted
black EBG sli bridge would have looked
way better instead of the stock as a lie
bridge but overall a really clean build
inside the fantex and Fukase thank you
max for entering at number 2 we have
this and I don't even know what the hell
to say i think i've godzilla had a pc
this would be it it kind of looks like
an air conditioning unit with a side
panel so this refrigerator is running a
5820k and two gtx 780 s inside the
Thermaltake core x9 case that's it I
thought there will be at least five
Titan X's in there the PC also has 32
gigabytes of coarser ddr4 lpx RAM and
custom red sleeves where benchmarks are
scored on 18,000 705 taking second place
for this episode so far I personally
think the case is a bit overkill but
it's definitely something fresh and
something I haven't seen before
thank you very much in alberta for
entering our second black and green
build comes from no rules build called
the green grape we have a 4790k
overclock 24.8 and a Titan X which is
also overclocked by two hundred
megahertz on both memory and core we
also have eight gigabytes of RAM
some sleeves and an H 100 CPU cooler I
love how you painted the cooler mount
and PCIe brackets neon green so that it
sticks out at night even part of the
case and fans are painted very nice
overall I'm curious as to why you don't
have an exhaust fan near the back
especially after closing off the top I
would definitely recommend one if you
haven't already added it to your system
but for benchmarks that scored a 48 o2
which is definitely lower than it should
be especially with a Titan X you should
be scoring at at least 10,000 so I would
definitely check your PC and see what's
going on but nonetheless a very sweet
looking neon green rig thank you no roof
or entering oh is next up with skylight
piece a black and white water-cooled
build inside the courser 780 t case it's
running on a 6700 K overclock to four
point seven and a gtx 980ti
lightning edition with 32 gigabytes of
ram from a victor prefetch mark set
scored a 17,000 902 taking third place
in this episode i personally think white
custom sleeves would be the icing on the
cake but nonetheless a very sexy black
and white build thank you all for
entering last but not least we have a
black and red build from Sam called the
Hellcat a 4690k paired with an msi gtx
970 and 16 gigabytes of RAM for
benchmarks are scored 868 26 beating out
the Titan eggs from Nauru and taking
fourth place for this episode I love
that you want with custom sleeves it
really means that you care about your PC
but a few more things you can do to make
a look even better is by replacing the
rear fan with an AF 140 millimeter fan
so that it matches your other fans and
possibly even picking up a custom
backplate from v1 Tech regardless the
cable management is excellent and this
is one good-looking black and red build
thank you Sam for entering what I will
do for this episode of PC Wars as always
drop your comments down below and vote
on who you think has the best custom PC
as always voiding will end on the 14th
and allows the winner on the 15th on my
Twitter and Instagram accounts thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you in
the next video
