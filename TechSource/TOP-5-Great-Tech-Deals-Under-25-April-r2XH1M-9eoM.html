from Texas and I missed you guys that
much that I'm back here doing another
on-camera video but I'm reading all the
comments that you guys left me on the
ask me video and a lot of you want to
see videos on great tech deals so that's
something I've actually never done so I
figured I'd start a video now and
depending on how well it goes I'll do
one maybe once a month or so but
definitely let me know how well this
goes by leaving a like or dropping a
comment down below and like I said if it
goes well I start a new one maybe once a
month or something alright so without
wasting any more time you have five
great tech deals that I found on Amazon
for the month of April and if you're
watching this after April you should
still check out the links down below
because the deals may still be going on
alright so the first item I found on
Amazon is an apple lightning connector
cable from Amazon basics I've been
through like 10 Apple cables in my life
and they always fall apart on me the
cable either starts to rip apart
exposing the wires inside all the USB
part completely comes off so I decided
to get these instead and I've been using
these for a little over a year now and
I've been really happy with the quality
the best part about these cables is that
you can choose what size you want from 4
inches to 3 feet or even 6 feet and they
come in either black or white I'll also
leave a link below the Apple cable for
the Android version for those of you
with Android phones next up is the rnd
dual USB car charger for smartphones and
this is actually 66% off right now which
is a killer deal you can pick one up
either in black or white and if you have
multiple USB devices that need charging
like smartphones or tablets then this
can definitely come in handy when you
are on the road the top slot has a 2.4
amp output and the bottom has a 1 amp
output but most card chargers actually
don't exceed 2 amps which makes this one
of the fastest charging devices out
there that you can currently buy for
your vehicle so the galaxy s6 s6 edge
and the HTC One m9 are actually
currently out now and if you're looking
for a protective good-looking case then
you should definitely check out the
cases from spigen that are on sale right
now
there are some really great deals on
speaking cases for the galaxy s6 for
example the tough armored case which
provides extreme protection it comes in
several colors and even comes with a
kickstand which is a pretty cool feature
if you like watching videos on your
phone if you want something lighter you
can go with the Neo Hybrid series which
are also on a discount if you don't want
a bulky case this too comes in several
different colors and features a
patterned TPU backplate for an amazing
feel and that extra grippy feel the same
exact cases are available for the m9 as
well and you can find the links to that
right below the s6 cases in the
description section down below last but
not least I found some really great
noise isolating earphones near the $25
mark and actually from sine Heiser
these are the CX 300 second edition
earphones and I've actually only pair of
the original ones before and I can
safely say that this is definitely worth
the money and the Amazon reviews on this
agree with me they're only available in
black and they come with two pairs of
different sized rubber ear buds and a
neat little carrying case the only
downside to this earphone is that it
does not have a microphone so if you
have to adjust the volume skip tracks
and talk on your phone you have to do it
by using the smart phone if you must
have a microphone then you should check
out the sony MDR IX 100 earphones
instead which are just below the $25
mark and also link that right below
these earphones in the description
section
anyways that wraps up the top 5 great
tech deals that I found on Amazon for
the month of April if you guys liked
these series definitely let me know by
dropping either comment or liking the
video and that basically tells me that
you enjoy this content and I can try and
get this out maybe once a month for you
guys if you guys want me to do a
specific deal video on a specific type
of product like computer peripherals or
smartphone accessories cases things like
that let me know also in the comment
section down below and I'll also add
that to the list but other or not thank
you so much for watching if you enjoy
the video feel free to leave a like if
you did it you can dislike the video and
make sure you guys are subscribed for
future content just like this once again
thank you so much for watching this is
that from tech source and I'll see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
