arrived with geforce r-tx graphics cards
and i managed to get my hands on one
this year is the Acer Triton 500 it's
got a 6 core processor 60 gigs of ram in
the r-tx 2060 GPU personally I think
that these specs are perfect for a thin
gaming laptop if you want the most value
for 1080p gaming compared to the r-tx
2070 or 2080 laptops I gotta say though
I really like the design of the Trident
500 over there Helios it doesn't have
that overused black and red gamer
aesthetic it's much cleaner in my
opinion with its sleek design and those
thin bezels the predator logo also
lights up which looks pretty cool there
isn't that much flex on the keyboard
deck or the display since the frame is
made out of aluminum
it doesn't feel cheap though feels like
it's built pretty well the keyboard is
nice its backlit and RGB but only
through three zones however you can't
set some pretty cool lighting effects
using their predator sense software all
the keys are spaced nicely and I didn't
run into any issues reaching any of the
keys the trackpad is a bit small for my
taste but it works really well it's
using Windows precision drivers it's
very responsive and it recognizes all my
gestures so no real complaints here the
screen gets really bright with very
great viewing angles and it's also
accurate enough that you can edit videos
or do color sensitive work on it the
speakers are located on the back now
they don't sound that great they're more
on the tinny side but either way you
should be wearing a headset because the
fan noise is pretty loud while gaming
they do wrap up quite a bit but if you
end up overclocking the GPU then it gets
even louder for ports you get a decent
selection you got three USB 3 ports a
full size Ethernet jack one HDMI and on
the other side you get a mini display
and a USB type-c that's done about three
compatible unfortunately it does not
have an SD card which is something I
expected on a laptop with this price tag
you can even use the Thunderbolt 3 port
here to charge any of your devices while
the laptop is off which I find very
useful ok now let's talk about the
performance because that is where this
laptop shines first off this laptop is
great for productivity specifically
editing 4k video the 6 core 12th red
processor was able to edit my 4k files
from my a7 r3 very easily
using Vegas Pro I was actually very
surprised that the laptop was not only
able to cut 4k video but I was also able
to provide smooth playback even after
adding effect transitions and color
grading so if you do plan on using this
laptop for editing videos whether it's
4k or 1080p files then you'd be pleased
to find out it can handle it
when it comes to gaming the Arctic's
2060 kicks ass I was getting around 90
FPS on average for Apex legends on high
settings achieving over 100 is
definitely possible if you tweak the
settings or lower the quality the rest
of the games I was getting well over 100
FPS on the highest settings and I didn't
experience any lag or stuttering once if
I can only pick one thing that I really
liked about the trying 500 I would have
to pick the software the predator sense
gives you many options to tweak your
laptop from fan settings to RGB lighting
and even overclocking the GPU which is
my personal favorite
there's even a dedicated button for it
right on the keyboard and once you press
it it will launch the program the
overclocking feature is very useful and
it actually works if you set it to
extreme it will overclock the GPU up to
100 megahertz on the boost clock and it
actually increases the performance in
games I was getting an average of 4 FPS
more per game in exchange for a louder
fan noise again I don't recommend taking
this to a library or somewhere quiet
because the fans do get annoyingly loud
especially if you're overclocking the
GPU the highest the CPU peak while
gaming was 92 degrees which is pretty
toasty but I didn't experience any lag
or thermal throttling I much prefer a
louder fan noise over thermal throttling
the Trend 500 is using an 82 watt hour
battery which got me around 5 hours of
use with a screen brightness of 200 nits
I think I should did an excellent job
with a new Trident 500 it's a thin
gaming laptop that kicks ass in gaming
and productivity with 144 Hertz refresh
rate and a decent battery life I'll drop
a link below if you guys want to check
out the Trident 500 from Acer I hope you
guys enjoy the video if you did consider
dropping a like and if you didn't you
know what to do
thanks again so much for watching as
always I will see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
