collection over time through Amazon this
first one is the one I've been using for
about six months from my cozier it's a
great one as a very sleek design it's
good enough for a 15-inch laptop it was
ok a company sent this one a year ago so
it's called nutsack believe it or not
and this one is actually fairly small
doesn't really fit much inside Kevin to
the laptop but it's a nice bag it's well
made not a fan of it and this one is the
more recent one that I picked up from
Amazon it's the cool Bell one it's
fairly big it sets up to a 17 inch
laptop I think it's got a bunch of
pockets sleek design again gray I love
the color grey but I just wasn't feeling
it but in this video we'll be looking at
something that quite possibly might be
my new favorite laptop bag with water
resistance a sixteen thousand milliamp
hour battery and a solid build the NRG
messenger separates itself from a lot on
the market but am I willing to pay $120
for it stick around till the end to find
out the outside of the bag is made out
of polyester and although it's not as
soft as cloth it's a necessity if it's
going to come in contact with liquid
there's this leather like plastic on the
handles and the front zipper pocket I
would say overall it has a simple design
also on the front we have a power switch
and an indicator one click will turn the
battery pack on and it will start
showing the remaining battery level
unfortunately it doesn't seem like we
have a way to turn the battery off from
here so instead we have to unplug all
the connected devices but on the plus
side it does turn off by itself after 12
seconds so no worries about it if you do
forget so under the indicator is the
microUSB port that's used to charge the
battery pack it's protected by this
rubber seal that shields itself against
liquids we get a single large zipper
pocket on the back the zippers are made
of metal and glides smoothly so I'm not
too worried about them breaking off
inside the bag we'll find some extras we
got a padded strap for hands-free
transport as well as two micro USB
cables there isn't much padding on the
strap though which as the bags price
point is kind of a letdown all four
pockets are lined with a very similar
polyester material found on the outside
it's not going to be as soft as fabric
but it does kind of
sensor with the water resistance and
improved durability to protect your
devices there is a soft gelatin type
foam that adds a little shock absorption
in here in total there's 8.5 liters of
space in this thing and to put that
number into perspective I fit a 15-inch
gaming laptop in here which is the max
size supported we also got a smaller
Chromebook a tablet mouse my wallet and
a lot of extras in here with still room
to share the smaller pockets definitely
help with organizing things like
batteries and sim ejection tools is
definitely made with plenty of storage
and compartments for organization the
best part is you can even charge up to
three things at once with the included
battery pack we get two USB ports
running at 1 and 2 amps respectively as
well as a DC out that can be used with
the DC 2 micro USB cable included the
front USB and micro USB headers are
routed through the bags built-in USB
pass throughs all the way to the battery
you can even use these to route your own
cables to devices not in the battery
pocket which was pretty cool with the
retail price of $120 it's hard to
recommend this product you can find a
similarly sized laptop bag for around 40
bucks just at a 16 thousand million hour
battery pack for only 15 bucks and you
can jerry-rig yourself something very
similar to the ghost tech for about half
the price but it isn't ill for $100 I'll
drop a link to a below in case you guys
want to check it out personally for me
it is a bit overkill because it's got
three slots for laptops I don't carry
that many things with me in the first
place but it is better than the other
three laptop bags that I currently have
so I will be using it as my main driver
can even say main driver on laptop bags
but that will be my main laptop bag
obviously as I travel to events like CES
or you're on vacation
I love the build design the built-in
power bank is really nice ghost tech did
an amazing job on building this laptop
bag but anyway you think you guys so
much for watching I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
