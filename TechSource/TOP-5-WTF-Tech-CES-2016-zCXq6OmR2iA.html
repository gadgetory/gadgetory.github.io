master op they are an online community
that allows enthusiasts to harness the
power of group buying for amazing tech
products the more people that join a
group buy for a product the more the
price goes down right now my strap is
sponsoring a giveaway for the LG 27 inch
4k monitor and all you guys have to do
to enter is sign up using the link in
the description section down below so
every year I attend the consumer
electronics show in vegas and come
across some really cool tech and then
some not so cool tech but before i show
the video where i go over the top tech
i've seen I'm gonna go over the top 5
what op tech I saw at CES 2016 first up
is a sit and stand s combo by lock tech
at first looks like an innocent
adjustable desk but moving back a little
bit you can see a cycle of some sort yes
ladies and gentlemen you will never miss
leg day and now can work out your legs
as you are doing work at your desk and
number 4 we have an interesting product
and honestly I was deciding which video
to put this in my WTF tech or cool tech
of CES by ultimately decided it belongs
in this video this is an iphone 6 and 6s
case that has built-in earphones that
has a retractable cable that gets split
into two separate earbuds that also has
a built-in mic oh and the cable is
pretty damn strong so it won't rip off
easily I want to slap it together and
double tap a button it gets retracted
back into the case on top of that the
case serves as a power bank with 2650
milliamp hours here's a WTF part not
only are you forced to use the cheap
earphones that comes attached with the
case which are really bad if you ask me
but this case will go around 100 bucks
once it gets released in the US speaking
of power banks at number 3 we have a
7500 milliamp hour power bank from pison
the doubles as hand warmers I don't make
this stuff up guys what you're looking
at here are power banks that get really
hot I'm talking hot enough that I need
to set it down after 5 seconds of
holding it I don't know if I have
extremely sensitive skin or what but
these things are practically overheating
if your hands are cold why not just
where I don't know mittens I'm just
kidding guys this obviously belongs in
my top useful tech video think about all
the stuff you can use this for like
cooking eggs without fire or putting it
under your butt while driving since you
don't have seat warmers or pranking your
friends by dropping it in their pants
it's just a prank bro we all love to
hate selfie sticks but now you guys can
hate them
as much because this one doubles as an
umbrella that's right guys if it's
pouring hard outside and you feel like
taking a selfie but are scared of
getting wet well fear not because now
you can take selfies in the rain hell
you can even use the umbrella as a stand
to take real photos I promise you that
people will not judge you at all just
look how happy this couple is now you
can be as happy as they are and they
even come in a bunch of color options
all right guys now is the moment you
have all been waiting for word the piece
of tech that deserves to be number one
on this list this is a walkie talkie
case for the iphone 6s it comes with
this massive antenna stuck up top and
you can basically communicate between
two the same cases by pressing down on
this orange button off to the side it
also doubles as a three thousand million
of our power bank but are you guys ready
for the real reason why this takes the
number one spot not only is this the
ugliest case I've ever seen for any
phone but it has a range of only 26 feet
26 feet I can seriously whisper and the
person can hear me from 26 feet why the
hell do i need to put on this ugly
looking bulky case in order to
communicate not to mention that the
other person needs to have one of these
cases as well for it to work well
anyways that's it for the video if you
guys enjoyed it make sure to leave a
like and let me know which one of these
tech products were the most interesting
for you and why in the comments section
down below make sure to stick around for
my top tech of CES 2016 coming up next
and i'll see you in the next video so
the walkie talkie but it is la
Kentucky's
Oh this'll walking yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
