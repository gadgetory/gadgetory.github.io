welcome to setup wars episode 164 where
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel you guys know
what to do if you want to participate
make sure to watch the video linked down
below but with that said let the setup
Wars begin I wanna give a huge thanks to
CleanMyMac for sponsoring this episode
of setup wars finally we have a
multi-function hub and a cleaner app
that does what it says other cleaner
apps make it a chore to wipe and protect
your files but on top of doing these
tasks efficiently CleanMyMac will help
speed up your computer it has a simple
and intuitive interface and the standout
feature I really like is the drop-down
menu at a glance that lets you see how
much space is available on your computer
as well as other important processes
like CPU load and memory use which
shortcut to the app itself once
installed it's very straightforward the
tab on the Left showcases all the main
features smart scan is an automated
detection pulling up results from all
the other Suites this includes cleaning
protection and suggested speed
improvements these reports all have
individual diagnostic reports which can
be manually viewed so there is no
accidental deletion or unwanted
processes it does a great job of
breaking down the report for you now run
this task every once in a while just as
a preliminary measure and to free up
space it's also a quick and safe way to
resolve any errors brought upon broken
items
now the other suite of tools like
malware removal privacy optimization and
maintenance all have the same scan which
in the end tells you what processes to
terminate this can be really helpful in
speeding up your Mac's performance
without winning obtrusive fishy tasks in
the background the applications and
files suite can also come in handy say
for instance you want to delete files
unrecoverable or remove applications and
extensions safely
additionally CleanMyMac can reset apps
bringing them to their initial state and
keep user created files intact
there's even a search bar at the top
right to help you navigate the app as
the name suggests it's a beautifully
clean and powerful utility that will
make your Mac as good as new
if you're interested in links will be in
the description below for you guys to
check out CleanMyMac
and download a free trial my editor uses
this for both of his Macs
and it does the trick every time
okay is it me or did Adrienne just walk
into someone's home I don't know if he
lives here or what but it's pretty
badass having an entire place just for
gaming and editing so we have a triple
monitor setup with a 29 inch ultra light
up top and all of that is mounted on the
back hand desk for peripherals he's
using the Razer BlackWidow chroma
keyboard the Mamba elite Mouse and even
a pair of astro a 50 s he does have a
mic setup as well the road NT USB
microphone that is hooked up to a boom
arm and it probably sounds really good
since half the room is covered in
acoustic panels I love the addition of
the wall shelves he has one on the left
for his ps4 and the other for his PC
which has an interesting spec list and
8700 K with the stock cooler and a gtx
1070 I mean come on at least spend $15
more and get a better cooler than that
that 8700 K is probably starving for
cold air it's also not overclocked which
is a lot of wasted performance for kala
Management he ratted all the cables from
the ps4 and the PC straight towards the
back of the monitors using cable sleeves
and a Signum rack I noticed he uses a
lot of LED strips not only does a setup
have it but the side of the refrigerator
has one and even the ceiling I can't
help but get a feeling that this place
is very similar to an insane asylum
with RGB lighting it's kind of creepy to
be honest but it's still a badass gaming
setup Thank You Adrian for starting off
the show and I'll drop a link to his
YouTube channel if you guys want to
check them out this next set up from
Alex is kind of entertaining it's built
for gaming editing and school work and
it features three 1080p monitors from HP
which he ended up painting to match the
color scheme the desks are also custom
made and he painted the surface on both
of them but the most interesting thing
about the setup is the wall-mounted PC
that does not look safe at all and if
one of the parts were to fall down it's
gonna take the rest of the system with
it he's using a moto speed CL 108
keyboard with a world gaming mouse and
he has a set of PlayStation controllers
under each of the modern
he did drill a hole in his desk for the
wires which run underneath his desk and
behind the backboard I feel like the PC
is mounted in a weird location and it
should be closer to the actual setup
maybe on the right side of the wall but
other than that it doesn't look bad for
a 16 year old setup I'm really digging
the custom work on the monitors and that
desk thank you Alex for entering Andre
is up next with a razor inspired triple
monitor setup rocking three 27-inch
philips monitors that are mounted on the
wall I mean you should look at those
thin bezels Wow sticking with razor gear
we got the Deathstalker chroma keyboard
an Ouroboros mouse which has been
skinned in white and we also got the
Goliath has extended chroma gaming mouse
the headphones are also from Razer he's
using the kraken 7.1 cromoz however the
speakers are from micro lab you know you
could have just picked up a Leviathan
from Razer and called it a day
cables are neatly managed underneath the
desk and routed in the back of the PC
through a cable sleeve unfortunately the
PC is sitting on the floor but he did
say that he has plans on buying wall
shelves so that he can place the PC on
top of those another much needed upgrade
as the GPU because we got bottlenecking
for days an 8700 K paired with a gtx
1050 TI what in tarnation nonetheless
that's a very clean and minimalistic
gaming setup with potential to grow
Thank You Andre for entering sticking
with minimalistic setups we have JM and
a beautiful white and black stormtrooper
inspired gaming setup which is also used
for video editing for his YouTube
channel and programming he's rocking a
24 inch Asus monitor the Razer
BlackWidow X mercury keyboard and the
lancehead Mercury Gaming Mouse excellent
choices on the peripherals for audio
he's got the Logitech z2 13 speakers
which he painted them in white and he
Logitech G 633 headphones I'm not too
sure why he went with a black headset
when there are other great selection of
white headsets like the Void HS 70s from
Corsair and the Turtle Beach Recon 200s
although the black on white contrast is
really nice majority of the gear in the
setup is white even the PC itself adds a
budget build inside the s3 for the elite
case with an r5 1600 and a gtx 1060 I'm
loving the custom sleeve cables the RGB
fans and the
custom stormtrooper SSD cover from v1
Tech that's pretty much it on the desk
other than a painted gamepad from
Logitech now underneath the desk we got
the cables which are managed very well
for the most part using cable clips and
zip ties but I do recommend grabbing a
cable raceway to make it a lot easier
and less messy this is definitely a
clean and compact setup that just works
thank you JM for entertaining I should
probably call this episode the super
clean edition wrapping up the episode is
Sam from Texas and is setup for doing
homework
I truly hope that's a typo and that you
use this for more than just doing
homework otherwise why else would you
have an alienware with a 6800 k 16 gigs
of RAM GTX 1080 last time I checked you
can run Microsoft Word and 1080 P over
100 FPS with any graphics card even a
crappy laptop anyways back to the setup
so he's using the IKEA mom desk to
support the 34 inch ultra wide gaming
monitor and a few other things like the
case M on the keyboard M 65 pearl mouse
and the cursor mm 800 RGB mouse pad I
would personally rat the mouse pad wire
towards the keyboard and tied them
together using a zip tie or something so
that there's only one cable going across
the desk it will look a lot cleaner poor
audio he's rocking the audio engine a 5
plus speakers and very similar to the
first setup Sam also has wall shells
mounted next to his setup however it's
to hold different things his alarm clock
and solo three wireless headphones
really is it me or doze wall shell was
kind of overkill for what they're
holding I think he originally mounted
them to hold up a speaker's but then
realized they would look better on the
actual desk without cables running down
from there
I mean if cables are what you were
worried about then you could have easily
hid them using these white wall raceways
the cables underneath the desk are
managed well thanks mostly to the rack
but the rest of the wires are grouped
together with zip ties nicely done I do
have to say that I approve the use of a
rim to hold up a PC and
leaving it on the carpet hey if it works
it works this is a really clean setup
but I feel like something's missing
specifically that massive gap between
the acoustic foams it's really hard to
ignore maybe you can add a poster or a
painting of your favorite game or maybe
anime to fill that gap and give this
setup some more life thank you Sam for
entering and that's it for this episode
of setup warriors make sure you guys
vote in the comments section below one
who has the best desk set up and if you
guys enjoyed the show feel free to drop
a like and if you didn't enjoy you know
