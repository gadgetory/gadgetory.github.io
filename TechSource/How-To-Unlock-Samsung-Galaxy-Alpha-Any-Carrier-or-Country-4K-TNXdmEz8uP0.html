today I'm gonna show you the process of
a locking your Samsung Galaxy alpha
smartphone so you can use it with any
carrier or country you like so for this
demonstration I'm going to use a locked
18 t galaxy alpha and unlock it so I can
use it on my t-mobile network so first
off we need to get the unlock code for
the phone before we proceed with the
unlocking procedure one of the best
unlocking companies that are currently
available is the unlocking company comm
and I use them for all my smart phones
just because they have the lowest prices
and the fastest delivery times so head
on over to the unlocking company.com and
select your phone model from the
drop-down list and on the next page go
ahead and select the country the phone
was originally purchased from and the
carrier of the phone so in my case it
was purchased in the United States and
the original carrier is AT&amp;amp;T so before
we continue we do need the IMEI number
of the phone and the easiest way you can
look it up is by opening up your dial
pad and entering in star pound zero six
pound now once the phone displays the
IMEI number you have to go back on the
website and enter that in so once
everything is filled out select get a
locking code and that will take you to
the final screen where you have to check
out now the price and time vary
depending on the phone but don't worry
because you are getting the lowest price
in the market with the fastest delivery
times so once you receive your code via
email it's time to unlock your phone but
before we continue make sure that the
phone is powered off go ahead and remove
the backplate of the phone and the
battery as well so you can gain access
to the SIM tray this is where you insert
the SIM card that you wish to use with
the phone I want to use the Alpha with
my t-mobile network so I am entering my
t-mobile SIM card in the phone now if
your SIM card is a different size then
you have to adjust it in order for it to
fit I have provided you with a link in
the description section to show you how
that's done after you insert the SIM
card in the tray go ahead and put back
the battery and the back case and power
on your phone now once it powers up go
ahead and leave your lockscreen once you
do that a prompt will appear asking you
to enter in an unlock code
when this happens go ahead and enter in
the code that you received in the email
after you are done
turning in the lock code it will take
you straight to the home screen like it
did here and the phone will be
permanently unlocked and you can begin
using it right away so as you can see
here I am using an AT&amp;amp;T Galaxy alpha on
my t-mobile network so that is how you
unlock your Galaxy alpha smartphone if
this video helps you guys out please
leave a like and if you have any
questions at all then you can leave them
in the comment section down below and I
will answer them as soon as possible
this is that from tech source and I will
see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
