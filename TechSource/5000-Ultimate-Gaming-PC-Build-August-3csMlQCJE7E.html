guys g2a offers really cheap CD keys for
any game out there for any platform they
sell super cheap CD keys for windows too
and this is actually where I get my
games from as well as operating systems
that I use for my custom PC builds each
month I'm gonna leave a link down below
so you can see for yourself what's up
guys are dead back again from Texas and
welcome to the ultimate gaming PC build
for the month of August
this is XE on the $5,000 gaming PC
running three 980 T is in sli now before
I jump into gaming benchmarks let's take
a quick look at the specs xiana's
running an i7 59 30 K which is
overclocked to 3.9 gigahertz it has an
msi x99s gaming 9 motherboard 16
gigabyte of ddr4 ram clocked at 3000
megahertz 3 msi gtx 980ti is in 3-way
SLI a courser h 100 gtx to keep things
cool and a courser ax 1200 eye power
supply to power up everything for
storage I'm running to 512 gigabyte
Samsung 850 Pro SSDs in raid 0 along
with 2 terabytes of hard drive space
from Western Digital all this packed
inside the awesome dead space looking
case from BitFenix called the colossus
if you guys are wondering why one with
these parts along with more information
on the pc case and you guys can check
out the first part of the video where i
go through the reasoning behind them one
thing i would like to point out is my
custom painted and modeled as a lie
bridge from EVGA if you want to know
what i did you can watch part 2 which is
the time-lapse field of this entire pc
by the way all the parts i use for this
build will be leave down below for
anyone that is interested but with that
said let's go ahead and check out the
temps of the pc so as you can see the 59
30k is currently overclocked at 3.9
gigahertz with a 1.1 48 core voltage on
idle mode all six cores one between 30
to 40 degrees Celsius whereas the 980ti
stick to a constant 40 to 42 degrees on
foo lo the processors reach a max temp
of 50 to 56 degrees but quickly go back
down to idle temperatures the GPUs got
pretty hot reaching temperatures between
70 to 76 degrees whereas the third GPU
which is the one all the way on the
bottom only hitting a max
sixty-two since nothing is blocking the
airflow I mean this is expected when you
sandwich three 980ti is together without
a custom loop for Cinebench r15
benchmarks accion scored a Cinebench
score of 11 46 for its CPU and a crazy
168 FPS for the OpenGL test now moving
on to the 64-bit Geekbench test we got a
3909 for a single core and 22,500 64 for
the multi-core lastly moving on to the
most popular benchmark for gaming pcs
the 3d mark 5 I'd benchmark and to no
surprise it placed in the 1% bracket
with a whopping score of 20 1985 putting
this PC well over 4k gaming pcs now I
know it would have made a lot more sense
conducting the gaming benchmarks in 4k
resolution but I kind of wanted to have
fun and see the crazy high FPS counts
playing these games in 1080p at max
settings and by the way you guys can
check out the real-time FPS counter on
the top left of the screen so with that
said here are the gaming benchmarks
you
alright said I passed up for this video
as always if you guys enjoyed it and
want me to continue doing these PC
builds every month then let me know by
hitting that like button doing these pc
builds every month is really expensive
and you guys can help support the
channel a lot by bookmarking one of the
amazon links down below and use them
while you shop it's completely free for
you and I just get a small kickback
every time you guys buy stuff with it
that will lead us help me out and I can
continue doing these PC builds every
month and a real quick thank you to
everyone that's been using it for this
past few months already
my next PC build for the month of
September has already been announced on
my Twitter account so if you guys want
all the sneak peeks and
behind-the-scenes make sure you guys are
following me there but that's basically
a thank you so much for watching this is
that from tech source and I will see you
in the next video
