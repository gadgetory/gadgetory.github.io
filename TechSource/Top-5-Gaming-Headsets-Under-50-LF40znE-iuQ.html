Texas and welcome to the top five gaming
headsets that you can currently buy
under fifty bucks
this is part of my top five cool tech
series and if you guys are new to the
series I'll go and drop a playlist to my
other videos so you guys can check out
after this one but without wasting any
more time let's begin so before I begin
all the headsets featured in this video
will be linked in the description
section down below and it also be a mic
test at the end as well so first up we
have the sades Archmage headset it's
compatible with pcs only and comes in
just under $20 with an optional yellow
color as well the mic is located near
the front which is an adjustable and
near the back of the left ear cup you
can find the volume controls the headset
is super light in fact it's the lightest
out of the five featured in this video
it's extremely flexible and the ear cups
are very comfortable and cover the
entire ear which is great for blocking
outside noise this headset does not have
any sliders and instead features a
decompressing belt which adjusts as you
put them on it comes with the standard
3.5 millimeter audio jacks along with a
USB plug to power on the LEDs in terms
of sound quality you get really clear
audio with some light bass now if you
guys are looking for a headset with a
deep heavy bass then these are not for
you honestly for just under 20 bucks
these are amazing for gaming next up is
the creative fatality gaming headset
it's available in only black and red and
comes in at just under $30 it features a
detachable noise cancelling boom mic
which is also flexible and the headset
is extremely light and features plush
material for the ear cups which isn't my
preferred choice since it gets my ears
pretty warm after an hour of use the
headband construction does feel a little
flimsy but it's insanely flexible with
somewhat rotatable ear cups that can
also pivot inwards depending on how big
your ears are development padding on ear
cups around the entire ear which
provides excellent noise isolation so
you can get lost in to your music or
game it does come with standard audio
jacks and a control box to mute the mic
and control the volume it also has a
clip located on the back the sound
quality is really great the headset can
be used with gaming and listening to
music since it offers a really nice bass
then again I didn't expect anything less
from creative who also makes some on the
sounding speakers known to mankind I
can't make a top gaming headset video
without including turtlebeach they make
some of the best gaming headsets out
there and the air force x12 gaming
headset is no exception it's compatible
with PC and Xbox 360 however you can use
it with the Xbox one as well if you
purchase a separate adapter which I'll
also link below so this comes in around
$40 and features a built-in mic and mic
monitor so you can hear what you're
saying I'm not really a fan of mesh
cushions but I find the headset quite
comfortable to wear these are over ear
headphones which means that it
completely covers the ears for amazing
noise isolation the ear cups also swivel
slightly and tilt to give you a more
comfortable fit the mic is flexible the
headset is flexible it has a very solid
build overall so the headset comes with
an inline amp which gives you a choice
to control how much space you want to
hear along with options to control the
mic and the game and chat volume
separately for connections it comes with
these standard audio jacks and USB to
power on the headset along with optional
RCA and 2.5 millimeter cables the sound
quality is amazing on the x12 so you get
extremely crispy highs and very deep
lows especially when you increase the
base levels if you aren't afraid to
spend a little bit more for a much
better built and sounding headset then
the X 12s are for you next up is
arguably one of the most popular gaming
headsets in the world this is the
Logitech G 230 gaming headset which a
lot of you probably already heard of it
comes in two just under $40 and it's
compatible with PCs and the PlayStation
4
if you connect it to the controller the
build is really sturdy and it's
extremely flexible as well this is an
over-the-air headset and the ear cups
are made out of mesh cushions like the
Air Force X 12s nonetheless it's
extremely comfortable to wear it also
comes with a rotatable noise cancelling
mic the ear cups have a 90 degree swivel
and also a slight tilt to offer the most
precise fit you do get a control box to
mute the mic and also have access to
volume levels and comes at a clip as
well also for connection it comes the
standard audio jacks the sound quality
is amazing the 40 millimeter drivers
deliver high-quality stereo sound for
immersive gaming experience it has very
crispy sound with a great bass overall a
very solid gaming headset this next
headset definitely wins in the looks
department this is the Eco Pro over ear
gaming headset it comes in at just under
30 bucks and it's available in white and
it's compatible with
both ps4 and pcs I haven't tried it on
the Xbox so I'm not sure if it would
work on that console the design is very
similar to the Said's arc mage that I
covered first on the list the mic is
built-in on the left ear cup and behind
it is where the volume wheel is located
the head band is also similar it doesn't
have any sliders and instead has a
retractable belt that adjusts as you put
them on the headset isn't as flexible as
the others but nonetheless it's really
comfortable to wear the cushions are
soft but the inner material comes in
contact with the ear and it's a very
unpleasant feeling mainly because of the
cobweb design inside for connections you
have the usual audio jacks and the USB
cable to power on the LEDs of the
headset which pulsate and switch colors
slowly as far as sound is concerned it
has a lot of base the highs aren't as
clear as I would have liked but overall
a decent sounding headset for both
gaming and listening to music last but
not least I want to give an honorable
mention to the edx city scroll gaming
headset it's priced right under 20 bucks
and it's compatible with pcs only it's
very lightweight and durable headset
with a built in rotating mic and the ear
cushions are soft and comparable however
it's pretty small for my ears which ends
up kind of folding them so if you guys
have big ears then this is probably not
the best headset for you you can adjust
the volume using the knob located on the
control box and it has a standard 3.5
millimeter audio jacks and the USB to
power on the LEDs on the headset the
sound is pretty good considering it's
only 20 bucks you get good highs good
meds with a pretty good base overall but
yeah a really good solid gaming headset
for just under 20 bucks alright so
moving on to the microphone quality test
for each headset here are the samples
testing the microphone quality on the
sades Archmage gaming headset testing
the audio quality on the creative
fatality gaming headset testing the
microphone quality on the turtlebeach
air force gaming headset testing the
microphone quality on the Logitech G 230
headset testing the microphone quality
on the eco pro gaming headset testing
the microphone quality on the scroll
gaming headset so my favorite out of the
six goes to the Logitech G 230 headset
hands-down
I love the rock-solid design the amazing
sound quality and the comfort level for
just under 35 bucks you get a really
solid gaming headset from a company that
you can trust my least favorite was the
Eco Pro headset the comfort level just
wasn't there for me
and the sound quality wasn't up to par I
think it's lacking crystal-clear audio
and this has too much bass for my taste
well there you have it my top 5 gaming
actually 6 gaming headsets that you can
currently buy under 50 bucks which I
personally handpicked by me if you guys
