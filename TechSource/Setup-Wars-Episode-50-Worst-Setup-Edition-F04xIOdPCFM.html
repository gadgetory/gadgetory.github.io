and welcome to setup wars episode 50
will you submit your desk setup - all
right all right all right all right I
get it
Jesus you win fair and square
Kyle oh they want you man
just please don't mess up
what's up guys it's kylo from the
first-order and welcome to setup wars
episode 50 potato Edition where I'm
going to be tearing through some shitty
setups so without wasting any more time
let the show begin
no no no stop Kyle Oh Kyle oh dude I
told you it's let the setup wars begin
now let the show
let the set up wars begin never pay full
price for games ever again guys g2a
offers the cheapest CD keys you can find
anywhere check them out by clicking on
the alright that's enough of that
nonsense the person would be worse the
setup in this episode will receive $100
that will hopefully go towards their
setup and there will be a trouble link
down below so you guys can vote here are
your 5 pathetic noobs faze Joey
Verbinski Tommy and val-kill starting up
the show we have phase and this
disgusting laptop setup we have the
Lenovo laptop and an HP mouse on top of
the world's smallest table I swear my
forehead has more space than this I'll
give you a point for trying to stick to
a black and red color scheme you have
the red mouse with a red notebook and a
red plastic container which appears to
be MD
did your parents forget to stock up on
food there because it seems like you're
eating the crumbs what can I say get a
bigger desk and clean up the tables a
bit maybe even get a smaller power strip
because that thing looks like a vacuum
cleaner and it only has one outlet Joey
is next up with a ghetto setup we have
the 24 inch vacuum monitor on top of
some cubbies and the Microsoft Comfort
keyboard and cougar 7 M Mouse this poor
bastard doesn't even have an actual
table but at least you happy pc surely
this can't be good for your back sitting
on that chair and bend him over to type
on a keyboard while you have your neck
bending backwards looking up at the
monitor cable management isn't
surprising at all I mean if you can't
afford a bed frame for your mattress
then you obviously can't afford a real
desk maybe instead of buying a PC and
spending almost $200 on a monitor you
should invest in an actual desk first at
number 3 we have urban ski with this a
massive fully inch Samsung TV which is
used as a monitor we also have the Razer
BlackWidow chroma key board and a
SteelSeries sensei Mouse I want to know
what possessed you to make this decision
of going with a 40 inch display I don't
even want to get into the cable
management this is pretty much a lost
cause
the sound bar is being blocked off by
the TV and that's supposed to be
centered in the front of your
the desk is missing a drawer you have
stickers on your ps4 and your GPU is not
even on the first PCIe slot what the
hell did you get me into
you're the kind of person that belongs
on the dark side someone who doesn't
care about humanity and what's right I
like you come together we can make
people cringe next up we have Tommy with
a real set up now you can get head shots
and wash dishes at the same time talk
about multitasking so it looks like we
have a 24 inch asus monitor with the
Logitech G 430 headset just chilling on
there we also have the Razer BlackWidow
chroma key board and a Death Adder Mouse
is that a spongebob Cup what are you
seven years old I don't even know how
your neck isn't broken playing like this
can you at least try and Center the
monitor in the middle of the keyboard
because this can't be healthy especially
since you don't have any back support
maybe if you end up winning $100 you can
not only buy a cheap table from Ikea but
also a chance to go with it good luck
Tommy may the force be with you I mean I
hope you die in a fire last but sure as
hell not least we have val-kill with
this disaster first off this setup looks
like it's in a closet or garage of some
sort judging by all of those storage
containers is that an ego box I don't
even know where to begin with this setup
we have the laptop hooked up to a TV a
disgusting floor that desperately needs
cleaning a random GPU that's being used
as a stands for the laptop and is that a
power supply unit just chilling there
cable management is atrocious and there
seems to be way too many things going on
here let's hope none of those storage
containers fall off and break you into
pieces all right I think I don't know
these pathetic setups for one day there
is a trough holding down below make sure
you guys click on it and vote on
whichever setup made you barf the most
the winner will be announced on Ed's
