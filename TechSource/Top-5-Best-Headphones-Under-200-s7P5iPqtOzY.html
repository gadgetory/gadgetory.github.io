this video we'll be going over five of
the best headphones that you can
currently buy under 200 bucks and you
guys can find the links to them down
below in the description section let's
begin so starting off the list is none
other than the audio technica m50x is
and it's no surprise that these have
been one of the highest rated pair of
headphones in the market and chances are
you either heard of them or are wearing
them right now while watching this video
the quality of these headphones are
amazing you get aluminum sliders with a
soft cushion pad for the head bands
which are also extremely flexible I
really like how portable these are - you
can basically fold them up and take them
wherever you go the ear cup cushions on
the other hand are really soft and the
ear cups are large enough to go over my
ears which also provide excellent noise
isolation with that being said these
aren't the most comfortable to wear over
long hours at a time the most I can wear
these headphones before they start
hurting my ears are approximately 2
hours
the attention to detail is also
something to note on these audio
technica does a great job when it comes
to their quality check and they make
sure every inch of their products
reflect that speaking of attention to
detail I've added some awesome carbon
fiber skins to my m50 X's so it better
matches the theme of my setup but if you
guys own a pair of m50x says I want to
pimp out your headphones like I did be
sure to check them out by clicking on a
link in the description section down
below the sound quality is also the same
as the m50 S you get really rich deep
lows balanced mids and detailed highs
the only noticeable difference between
the previous model is the detachable
cable I would recommend these headphones
for media consumption mixing music video
editing and even gaming they are that
good next up on the list are the bose
soundtrue headphones and what i noticed
as soon as i put these on was how
extremely light and comfortable these
were in fact these are one of the most
comfortable headphones i have ever worn
the cushions completely surround my ear
which also provides excellent noise
isolation from ambient sounds I also do
like the fact that it comes with a
detachable cable with a built-in mic and
media controls and I'm really happy with
the length of the wire coming it has 66
inches you do get a plastic matte finish
on the headphones with aluminum sliders
and these are also extremely flexible
the ear cups rotate about 90 degrees and
the headband can be stretched out quite
a bit
practically are guaranteed to find a
comfortable fit at first I thought these
look a bit flimsy but don't be fooled at
the plastic construction these can be
twisted and stretched out quite a bit
without a problem it does come with a
need carrying case so I would advise
storing these in there for travel now
let's talk about the sound quality the
low end on these headphones are very
deep and well defined but the bass isn't
really over-the-top
these headphones are not for bass heads
but moving on to mid-range I noticed
some areas that lack in definition but
overall the mid-range has plenty of
depth and very nice clarity same goes
with the high-end I hear a lot more
detail on my sound that I didn't catch
on other headphones overall these
headphones lean towards the accurate
side but not as accurate to be used for
monitoring audio these headphones focus
more towards sound that's pleasing to
the ears but overall they are great for
gaming media consumption and non
hardcore sound monitoring a number three
we have the v-moda LP 2 or L p-squared
headphone depending on how you look at
it it comes in an exoskeleton carrying
case with two threaded cables one with a
microphone and remote control and one
without you also get two replaceable ear
cup shields a carabiner clip and a
quarter inch audio adapter which is
great if you plug your headphones in an
audio interface the build quality is on
another level v-moda is known for their
military-grade construction the air
phones are made out of metal and Kevlar
with a matte black finish and like the
previous two headphones these two come
with a detachable cable with a built-in
mic to take calls in terms of comfort
I'm not that satisfied with these to be
honest their cups are not large enough
to surround my ear and instead rest
against my ears which becomes
uncomfortable having them on for over an
hour with that said the noise isolation
isn't that great either compared to the
other over-the-ear headphones in this
video it's not as flexible as well the
ear cups pivot in and out but that's
pretty much all the flexibility you get
with these now let's talk about the
sound quality these headphones are
geared more towards bass heads and DJs
the low end is really deep and full and
somewhat overpowering the difference is
night and day coming from the m50x s and
even the bose soundtrue the sound is
definitely not on the crispy side if you
guys want a more clear and open sound
the v-moda and class
something you should look into instead
the meds aren't as money compared to
other base oriented headphones and highs
are very detailed
I wouldn't recommend this for gaming or
monitoring sound but for listening to
music or watching movies these will do
great I like the past three headphones
which were closed back the sign Heiser
598 are open back audiophile grade
headphones definitely not the best
looking pair of headphones I've seen but
man are they comfortable to wear the
plastic frame and construction of the
headphones contribute to it super
lightweight and the ear cups are
enormous it will practically fit any ear
the pads are made out of wheeler which
are extremely comfortable the ear cups
have just enough movement both
horizontally and vertically to get you a
nice snug fit now because these are open
back headphones there is no noise
isolation and lots of sound leak will be
present it does come with a detachable
cable but unlike the previous headphones
these don't come with a built-in mic or
remote and instead you get a quarter
inch jack as its default connection with
a 3.5 millimeter jack as an adapter so
let's talk about the sound
these are claimed to be an all-purpose
pair of headphones great for gaming
media consumption and even monitoring
sound I will tell you this though the
sound is crispy and clear and I've
noticed this while gaming I can actually
hear the footsteps of an enemy
approaching around the corner the bass
on the other hand isn't something to
praise about Sennheiser isn't known for
their hard-hitting bigs
so if you're looking to rattle your
brain with these headphones you need to
look elsewhere the mid-range is
definitely present and perhaps the
strongest of the three the vocals are
extremely clear and everything comes
together really well which brings the
music to life and you can thank the
amazing wide-open soundstage for that
overall these are one of the best
all-purpose pair of open-back headphones
for under $200 that you can buy and I
recommend this for all types of media
gaming and even monitoring sound last
but not least we have the AKG 267 Tiesto
headphones now these are close back full
sized around the ear sealed headphones
construction is metal leather and
plastic whereas the ear cup frame is
made out of aluminum and the artificial
leather cups are large enough to cover
practically any sized ear which also
provides a nice seal to isolate outside
noise in terms of flexibility these can
stretch and twist without any problems
the ear cups can also rotate a full 90
degrees as well as fold inwards which
makes it great for travel by using the
include
caring bag on the bottom of the
headphones you will notice two mini XLR
connectors allowing the user to plug in
the headphone cable into either side now
it does come with two sets of cables one
coiled and one straight that also comes
with a quarter inch adapter on the ear
cups there are two inner rings on each
side which can be rotated to adjust the
base levels you can set them to Studio
Club or stage the studio setting gives a
more flat base moving it up to Club it
raises the base about two decibels and
lastly the stage setting bumps it up by
seven decibels from the studio setting
the overall sound is nicely neutral with
a good base punch and a non fatiguing
treble overall I would recommend these
for DJs and even people that are looking
for a nice pair of sealed headphones for
media consumption and gaming
these are actually a lot cheaper on mass
drops if you guys are thinking about
picking up a pair don't pay full retail
price for them math shop is a group
buying website that offers a ton of tech
products at a cheaper price so make sure

headphones you can buy on their 200
bucks now if you guys enjoy the video or
