decided to test out their durability by
conducting a scratch test let's be real
no one is purposely going to grab a
knife and scratch their phones unless
they have major issues so in this video
I'm going to be doing real-life tests
things that the average human do to
their phones that I'm actually going to
see how easily the iPhone 6s gets
scratched first test will be me putting
the phone in my pocket along with my
keys and I'll be walking around doing
errands for about 30 minutes test 2 will
be me laying the phone on hard surfaces
like my desk and moving them around a
bit and lastly I will take a knife to it
and see how much damage I can do to the
iPhone 6s so without wasting any more
time let's begin alright to start things
off I'm gonna put the keys in my pocket
and then slide in my phone I actually
had some errands to run that day anyway
so I kept my phone in my pocket for at
least 30 minutes surprisingly there were
no scratches there were however some
minor scuffs here and there but I
managed to wipe them off with a
microfiber cloth the next test I did was
laying the phone flat down on my desk
and moving it around a bit I also turned
it over and I did the same for the other
side I laid the phone down smoothly and
sometimes roughly to change things up a
bit
once again the iPhone success remains
scratch proof the front glass is
spotless without any damages or scuffs
and the same goes for the back even the
protruding camera didn't get scratches
I'm honestly impressed at how
indestructible the iPhone success is
lastly just to have fun let's see how
badly the iPhone 6s can get damaged when
you actually are trying to scratch it on
purpose so as you can see already the
back is getting scratched pretty easily
as I run my knife along the back that
again this was expected now let's try
the front so the glass in the front is
practically immune to scratches as you
can see I'm running the knife through it
as well as applying pressure and even
stabbed it a few times and nothing is
happening
the glass on the iPhone 6s does not get
scratched easily and probably can't ever
get scratched honestly though if you
guys want to protect your phone from
damages or scratches without covering
the awesome design with bulky cases then
the obvious choice is to put on a skin
but not just any skin I'm rocking some
debrand skins on my iPhones now they
have a bunch of different types as well
for any smartphones out there but I'm
gonna drop a link down below so you guys
can check them out for yourself
anyways desert for the video
enjoyed it feel free to hit that like
button and let me know what you guys
want to see on the iPhone 6s next by
dropping a comment down below and I'll
go to and add that to my list thanks
again for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
