guys a dozen sex stories and welcome to
setup for is episode 108 where you
submit your desk excited to get featured
on the channel if you guys want to
participate make sure to watch the video
linked down below but with that said let
the setup words begin
so guys if I begin the video I have a
pretty cool series idea I want to pitch
to you and let me know what you think
about it down below in the comments
section either leave a like if you enjoy
it or leave a dislike if you think the
idea sucks so basically instead of my
worst set of positions I'm going to be
labeling it the roasts my set up I don't
know why I keep doing this so basically
you guys get the option of roasting the
set up that I feature on the show and
I'll even jump in and throw throw in a
few roasts as well I think will be
really fun and entertaining episode just
every 10 episodes so instead of the
worst set up Edition it will be where
else might set up instead by the way
these setups are people that want to be
part of the roast my setup I'm not going
to purposely pull out setups and then
just roast them out I think that would
be kind of rude and kind of mean so so
basically I'm going to be posting the
setup on Twitter and you guys can reply
to that with your roast that I'll pick
out like five or six is really good
roasts and I'll see to them in the
episode and of course I'll jump in and
I'll throw in a few roasts as well
because I am the roast master of course
but anyways let me know what you guys
think about that series down below I
think it'll be pretty fun to change
things up again anyways was that say let
the show begin starting to show off we
got a pretty dope liking read set up
from Alex just look at the color balance
between the red and black the contrast
is on fire he's walking to 24-inch asu's
monitors that are hooked up against the
wall and below that we got a custom made
desk with red vinyl accents on the sides
and also chrome legs on the desk we got
a pair of Edifier lunar eclipse speakers
the cursor strafe keyboard with custom
red pbt key caps and in logitech g502
Mouse I got to say that keyboard is
looking fire there isn't a microphone
anywhere in the setup so that tells me
that these acoustic films are there just
for show but there is a mic on his
HyperX cloud gaming headset under his
desk cable management isn't the
prettiest that's for sure but at least
all the cables are off of the ground I
really like how you balance the color
scheme so well there isn't too much of a
single color like the ps4 with the V
brown skin and even your PC cable
management isn't the best inside here
but it's rocking the 4770k and the AC
Strix gtx 960 a very balanced gaming
setup saying
you Alex for entering next up is Jose
with something different so we got a
white and black gaming and entertainment
set up between the 23 inch Acer monitor
on the bottom and the 55 inch Samsung 3d
HDTV up top
first thing that caught my attention was
the level of symmetry aside I'm not
annoying fire alarm that isn't directly
centered which I'm sure by the way you
had no control over everything else is
spot-on
even the shelves on the right side are a
nice touch I see that you got a bit
creative mounting them on the wall so it
looks like you went with the wireless
router picking up the Logitech K 780
keyboard and the MK 270 Mouse I also
like that custom phone stand that you
built next to your keyboard very nice
trotty oh he's got a pair of Samsung
speakers and blue do wireless headphones
off to the side it also looks like there
are two more Samsung speakers behind his
setup above the couch excellent work
with the cable management all the wires
are hidden from sight and finally we got
the PC off to the right side it's got
the 4690k any ZOTAC gtx 970
it's a very clean and symmetrical setup
indeed Thank You Jose for entering
speaking of white and black here's
another one from Martin a 27-inch LG 4k
monitor hooked up to the Sapphire rx 480
which is inside the thermal take
wall-mounted PC right after that I
noticed all the cables there's
definitely a lot going on and I feel
like Martin could do a better job
cleaning it up with some cable sleeves
and a channel for the wire that's on the
ground on the desk he's got the Logitech
G 120 keyboard and the G 402 Mouse as
well as a ps4 for audio he's using the
monster beats headphones and a beam on
speaker under his monitor I like I was
using one of the PC legs as a headphone
hanger that's actually pretty cool
I would definitely work on grouping up
the cables under the desk a bit more as
well as tidying up the wires above the
desk I will give you some credit for
tying the wires together on your PC but
hiding them using a cable sleeve would
look a lot better Thank You Martine for
entering toddler setup was so
interesting that I decided to feature it
on the show now he's using a home depot
utility shelf as his desk he was going
for a budget standing desk set up with
function so on the top shelf we got the
32 inch Samsung monitor a logitech TK
820 keyboard
and the popular MX master Mouse near the
top he hooked up a BM 800 microphone and
also a set of speakers what's
interesting about this setup is not that
it's built on a utility shelf but that
he has two pcs both of them are equipped
with an FX 8350 CPU and a ZOTAC GTX 970
my only guess is that each PC has its
own separate purpose cable management
isn't easy on a setup like this but
Tyler did an outstanding job organizing
the back this is straight up cable porn
excellent work a very unusual but
interesting setup Thank You Tyler for
entering finishing up the show we have a
very cute husband and wife set up so
Winston set up is on the left and it has
a 32-inch bank you monitor cursor k70
keyboard and the razer chroma Mouse
while his wife is rocking a 24-inch Dell
monitor Falcon z77 keyboard and an asus
Mouse Winston is rocking the Harman
Kardon Sam sticks while his wife is
using the kanto you 2 speakers and for
headphones Winston is using the Razer
Kraken chroma and then she has the
Corsair Vengeance mm I love that both of
them decided to go with different gear
it sounds like they both know what they
wanted instead of having one of them
copy the other the wife is rocking an i7
930 and a GTX 670 while Winston has the
better PC a 6700 K and 2 GTX 1080s
FTW in SLI Winston I'm ashamed man why
don't you just upgrade your wife to GPU
she's basically running a potato
compared to your PC great teamwork on
the cable management how long's she made
you do all the hard work but regardless
all the wires are off the ground and
this is a pretty awesome husband and
wife setup Thank You Winston for
entering so that is the video episode of
setup wars as always makes you guys drop
