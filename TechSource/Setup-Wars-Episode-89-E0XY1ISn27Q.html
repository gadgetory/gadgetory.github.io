simple to do link is down below also
guys there is a new feature on the app
nice where you can actually vote on the
set up so you guys can check the wheel
time of vote counts and you can see
who's winning in first place or in
second and third and so on so that's a
pretty cool feature but with that said
let's go to begin the show
if you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2
a.com
because they have the cheapest CD keys
available for pretty much any game I'll
drop a link to them down below if you
want to check it out so first up we have
a Phil and his symmetrical triple
display setup there's a 24 inch LG
monitor up top and two 27-inch dual
monitors under that looks like the top
monitor is mounted against the wall
while the other two are hooked up using
the Arctic Z 2 desk mount speaking of
the desk key is using the popular IKEA
lemon tabletop with the Alex drawer
add-on the only thing he did differently
is that he added a custom black glass
cover on top to change the look the only
negative thing about that is that you
won't be able to drill any holes to the
desk which actually worked out for a
cell since he's using a wireless
keyboard and mouse from Logitech for
audio he has a pair of Philips speakers
and the sony MDR headphones hanging from
the side of this PC it looks like the
color scheme is mostly black with some
red accents and you can tell from the
rain color on the speaker's the 3d
printed baseband and of course the parts
to decide the PC there's a 35 70 K and a
GTX 770 that's powering his setup cable
iseman is pretty much flawless
everything is really organized and tied
together under the desk I have no
complaints on the opposite side of the
setup is assholes action figure
collection that it looks like he's a
huge fan of Marvel if the giant Captain
America shield in between the two Marvel
posters didn't give it away then this
sure as hell does stepping into the next
room is where you will find an l-shaped
couch the more superhero posters on the
wall and a 46 inch Samsung TV mounted
against the wall
it looks like it's connected to his PC
judging by the wallpaper and I'm
guessing it's used for screaming and
watching videos a very sick set up
indeed thank you assholes for entering
mix up is Armand with a white and black
gaming setup on top of the IKEA I can't
desk I've seen quite a few setups with
monitors in these positions and I've
always assumed that they are either for
programmers or graphic designers but if
you guys position your honor is
vertically as well let me know what you
use it for in the comment section down
below I'm kind of interested to find out
so he's walking a 27-inch 8 suits on the
left and a 24 inch Acer on the right
both of which are hooked up to a
mount the keyboard of choices the cursor
strafe RGB with cherry MX silent
switches and custom light key caps
paired with a white SteelSeries rival
300 Mouse audio wise he's wearing the
ashtray 50s that are resting on a clear
headphone hanger and he also has the JBL
charge 2 plus speaker a few other things
on a desk include a wireless Qi charger
from Samsung and detail tronics Elune
desk lamp both of which are in white to
match the color scheme of the entire
setup nice work on the right side of the
desk is the PC which is equipped with an
FX 8350 and an r9 390 all black hands
desks come with a mess underneath the
table which makes cable management very
easy and also looks like armand hooked
up a channel raceway against the wall
throughout the cables in look how clean
that looks not a single wire is visible
near the ground
job well done an excellent setup Thank
You Armen for entering at number three
we have diver with a pretty simple setup
actually he's only walk in a single
27-inch Samsung monitor that's in
between to Adam a 7x speakers other than
the Cherry MX board 6.0 keyboard and
logitech g930 mouse there's really
nothing else on the desk well besides
the jack in amp for those headphones and
speakers the headphones which are the
sure s rh8 40s appears to be on a
dresser right next to him and the pc is
located under the desk
i mean after all it doesn't have a side
window so there's no need to keep it on
top but in here you'll find the 59 60 x8
core processor paired with the asus
strix gtx 980 and 32 gigs of ram which
leads me to believe that this is a
Productivity setup the desk is custom
made and behind the backboard he hooked
up the IKEA Signum rack to hold up the
cables so I don't have any complaints
here the only thing I would have loved
to see on this already extremely clean
setup was maybe a way to hide the
keyboard wire but overall a very clean
productivity setup Thank You diver for
entering here's a pretty cool black and
red set up from Derek so we have two
24-inch asus monitors a cooler master
Devastator two keyboard and mouse combo
and a JBL creature 3 speaker system the
PC on the right side has a forty seven
hundred and a GTX 1060 from MSI and
topping off the setup is a rifle of some
sort hanging right above the K Weismann
seems to be on the control
again thanks to the IKEA Signum racks
are no complaints here the only thing I
would suggest is to find a way to hide
the keyboard and mouse cables since they
are bit distracting I was personally
drill a hole in the best for them but
it's your setup and your call on the
opposite side of the room is an awesome
gaming and home theater setup with those
surround sound speakers and projector
this definitely looks like a really cool
place to chill with friends and have
some fun an awesome gaming room no
doubts Thank You Derek for entering last
but not least we have email and his new
setup looks like he has majorly improved
from last time so he got rid of his
monitor stands and mounted his 27 inch
stamps and monitors against the wall and
got an entirely new desk from Ikea and
because of this he was able to put his
PC on the surface instead of keeping it
on the ground everything else was pretty
much the same you got the corsair k70
keyboard SteelSeries rival mouse and he
raised her Firefly mousepad actually I
believe the headset is also different
he's using a black and red AKG
headphones while last time it was a pair
of white headphones as always cable
management is on point not only for the
setup but for his PC as well which still
has a thing specs a 4790k
and a gtx 970 email had a great setup
before and now it's even better with all
of the new equipments as always it's a
pleasure to have you on the show thank
