the setup makeover and we're planning to
shoot the first episode sometime this
month
the only issue right now is timing
obviously I couldn't have picked the
worst time to start this new series
there's a lot of projects that been
piled up and then I have actually a
vacation planned for September 25th
we're gonna be going on a cruise but I
think it's gonna be canceled because of
the Hurricanes that are coming in and I
planned this by the way like two three
months before this new series was even
announced and I feel like it's just all
coming together in a very very bad way
and of course the GF is kind of upset
because the cruise is gonna be canceled
and she's been looking forward to that
for a few months now so we might have to
plan on going somewhere else during that
time and this is all inside or doing the
timing of setup makeovers that's the
best apart part right now is juggling
all these things together but anyways I
wanted up to update you guys on that we
did select the winner the person who
Juan doesn't even know he got selected
that's we're gonna keep it a secret for
now if I'm being real with you guys it
was really difficult picking a finalist
out of almost a thousand submissions
most of the people who submitted
deserved an you setup I've seen very bad
condition homes very poor setups it's
just very very bad things I've seen
through these submissions and sometimes
I wish I was a millionaire or
multi-millionaire that I can just go in
people's homes and just give them a
brand new set up but you know I feel
really bad just picking one person we
did eventually narrow it down to around
nine or ten people and just for privacy
reasons I'm not gonna show you their
faces but here is the list of names the
finalist is also among this list of
names so if you're on there if you're
watching this video there's like a 10%
chance of you being selected and based
on what I've seen in the submissions
there are so many people out there that
are in need so many people and those are
just the people that submitted for setup
makeover there's so many people out
there that haven't even participated yet
so like I said guys I will do everything
in my power to change people's lives or
at least impact it some way and I'm
gonna do it by the first season of setup
makeover and after that I'm gonna move
on to the next person even if the season
even if the series isn't successful I'm
gonna continue it I've decided and one
of the main reasons I'm doing this is
because I've experienced it I've been
there I've been poor most of my life up
until my mid-20s I had a very tough
childhood single mother raising three
kids living paycheck-to-paycheck moving
every single year sometimes even twice a
year there were some places where we had
to share an apartment with someone just
to make rent happen
we weren't spoiled at all growing up we
didn't have nice things we don't have
any consoles we had no pcs we had to go
to the public library to do schoolwork
and it was just very tough time so I'm
trying to stay here we also had an
abusive father who would steal our money
and go and Gamble it off in Vegas but
I'm not trying to be emotional or
anything but the point I'm trying to
make here is I've been there and I've
experienced it so if you're watching
this and you've been in my shoes I just
want to say hang in there
it will get better I promise you guys
dad just work hard towards a better life
and separate yourself from toxic people
to some people it might happen sooner
and others it may take a very long time
just like I would happen from me so I
just wanna tell you guys to hang in
there I didn't get a stable income to
help support my family until I was like
in my mid-20s and then from that YouTube
happened which I am so grateful to be a
part of and have amazing subscribers
like you guys to watch my content
separate yourself from the toxic people
and most importantly ignore all the
haters just do you guys because there is
no greater reward than proving all your
haters wrong and being at the top while
they remain below looking up at you just
remember those words in case you guys
need some encouragement and some
motivation alright so a few updates on
