very calm slash tech source what's up
guys it's a from tech source and welcome
back to another vlog on the channel I
know it's been a while but today we're
gonna be focusing on cleaning up the
loft area so that I can shoot the second
episode of building the ultimate gaming
setup and I want to give you guys an
update on what the loft currently looks
like there is the current situation of
the loft and as you guys can see there
has definitely been a lot of changes
from the last time I've showed you guys
this the major change is the sectional
couch that I finally have added in the
loft I'm not a change is I've actually
moved the 55 inch nano cell TV to my
bedroom and I upgraded it to the 65 inch
4k TV from LG as well and I did drill
holes in the wall to route the cables
and so as you guys can see there's no
cables there I hooked up the LG sound
bar I also added the HTC vive just like
I promised
we got the ps4 Pro they're currently
waiting on some D brand skins and the
HTC vive is currently hooked up to my
Asus zephyrus laptop that is currently
what's running the vive system like I
said guys I'm gonna be planning on
building a PC and I'm gonna mount it on
the top of the TV that's probably give
me the last thing I'm gonna be doing to
the gaming setup and I'm gonna be adding
some RGB strips actually I have two
packages here I'm currently gonna be
testing both of them out I'm not sure
which one I want to use now the
difference between these strips and the
life expunged that I was planning on
using is that these come on individual
strips which makes it a lot easier for
me to put it in different sections of
the TV like I want to put one on the top
pulling down the sides and I want to put
one on the bottom but this one does come
with individual strips so it gives me
the ability to do like the sharp corners
if I were to get to one long strip and
if I wanted to cut the corner it's gonna
be
it's it's not gonna look good so that is
why I went with those in terms of
quality I'm gonna protest both of these
out this one was like 40 50 bucks so
this one is more pricier I think I spent
about 15 bucks on this one from HID
lights but I want to test those up I'm
gonna be working on some cable
management I did buy an HTC vive
controller dock which I'm gonna be
hooking up I don't know against the wall
or something and then I'm gonna find a
place for the ps4 Pro and one last thing
is this wall shelf that I picked up from
Wayfarer I'm thinking about mounting it
against the wall over here I did buy one
just to test it out if it looks good
I'll buy another one and put it on the
opposite side as well the only thing I
don't like about the current setup is
this wire that's running all the way
down from the sensor from the HTC vive
and there's two of them there's one on
that side and there's one on this side
so yeah definitely some cable management
is gonna gonna be needed and I want to
figure out where I'm gonna be installing
this wall shelf but so far I'm really
liking how everything is turning out
definitely with these small minor
touches it's gonna improve greatly and I
can finally focus on recording the
second video of building the ultimate
set up there is no real color scheme by
the way guys it's gonna be mostly black
so it's gonna be an all-black setup
because I do have a black couch so yeah
there might be some minor red accents
and stuff but no real dominant color
scheme I just want this set up to look
sick and I wanted to have function a lot
of function that's the main thing here
and of course it has to be aesthetically
pleasing if it's not aesthetically
pleasing it is not made by tech source
not made by me anyway this gets going
let's start off by I guess we can start
off by figuring out a place for the wall
shelf and then we'll go from there okay
so obviously the first thing I want to
do is before I mount the Showa phase I
want to make sure that it's gonna be
level with the TV and the TV stand of
course the ground as well so I picked up
this laser leveler I think it's what
it's called from Amazon this thing was
pretty pricey the tripod itself was
about 50 bucks
and this was I think around
hundred I don't recommend this too
obviously everyone unless you're doing
very sensitive big project so it's got
two buttons on here I can press one for
the horizontal level you guys can see
over there it also has a vertical laser
as well and the cool thing about this is
no matter how uneven your floor is it's
got like a built-in gimbal system or
something if you guys can see that it's
always gonna adjust itself so that way
it's perfectly straight so there's the
horizontal line basically telling you
that is what's gonna be parallel to the
ground and the vertical line is to see
how straight you want things and if you
guys can see the TV isn't exactly SH way
to have to kind of adjust it but I'll
work on that later
all right so now that is completed I'm
definitely gonna be ordering one more so
I can put it on the opposite side it
turned out actually pretty good it's not
too big it's not too long and I left a
little bit of space near the back there
that way I can route the cable in the
corner there I'm gonna get some clips
and then wanted to straight down into
that corner and then into the back of
this stand so yeah pretty good let's uh
now let's go ahead and do the LED strips
or the RGB strips behind the TV and then
from there we can go out and organize
the vibe and then the vibe stand if you
want to show you guys the updated room
layout because I've actually changed a
few things I move my charging station
into my editing room and as you guys can
see I added a few more things and even
some micro USB cables on the side here
with magnetic cables case I need a
charge like the HTC vive controllers or
power banks and stuff like that and I
hung the play button 1 million play
button in this room because because
while I was filming it fell off from the
center and almost destroyed whatever it
was that I was recording because I suck
at mounting things simple as that so
instead I cover up the holes and stuff
with some more acoustic foams as you
guys can see it's just a square design
right now and as far as a silver play
button it's actually on the opposite
side with some more acoustic foams and
that is what this room is currently
looking like okay so nothing going to be
going with the SLR color Kinect RGB
scripts this is what comes the box you
get those four strips I think they're 24
inches long each one there's four of
them this is the power connection for
that and there's a bunch of other cables
these are going to be like the extension
cables there's some in different lengths
they're shorter ones
he's like the medium size and these are
the super long ones so if you guys want
to put them in like super difficult
hard-to-reach places
then you know this set is basically
perfect maybe want to put like each
strip under like a set of stairs or
something pulling under the kitchen
counter and put the other one I don't
know someone next to the microwave stuff
like that that's why they give you these
long cables so you guys can route them
all and I'd have to worry about
connection problems also comes at a
pretty cool looking remote so that's
pretty dope and then you also get two
sets of mounting hardware it does come
with adhesive strips in the back
obviously so if you can amount it
against a desk for example or TV then
you're fine but this is more so through
an amount that again stuff for example
your wall or something like that that
doesn't really work well against
adhesive strips holiday shoppers are
already taking advantage of online sales
but assuring a secure connection is
becoming more challenging this is one of
the reasons why people use tunnel bear
tunnel bear is an easy-to-use VPN that
encrypts your internet traffic on up to
five devices even if you connect to an
unsecured Wi-Fi network tunnel bear will
keep your connection private and guard
against theft of your personal
information you can try total bear for
free when you visit turnover com slash
tax sores
all right moment of truth here we go
maybe not go
maybe it's off let's shut it on nope
so I mean they obviously connected
something wrong or they Oh No
oh wow oh yes damn that looks pretty
sweet so yep looks like it is working
and obviously I can use the remote to
change the colors I just have to aim it
at the actual sensor so yeah that looks
pretty cool the only problem is the
sensor is really bad the infrared sensor
right there I am aiming directly at it
and it's not registering their
keystrokes I'm gonna have to put that
somewhere that's clearly visible because
if it's not even reaching at this point
this distance then let me turn the
lights off completely then we'll see how
it really looks like aha yes that looks
sick the camera is acting up right now I
don't know what the hell is going on if
you guys can sit on the camera but it's
not like that in real life stuttering I
don't know if it's from the shutter
speed from the camera or what there we
go so different color I just one seems
to look better and that's as bright as
they can get guys unfortunately the
camera does not do it justice it looks
so much better in person to be honest
alright so next step I want to run the
cables from the vive headset through the
hole down here into the wall and up
through that hole over there because
these cables coming from the headset are
supposed to connect to this control
panel I guess is what it's called and
this end is connected to the PC
via USB and the HDMI I need to conduct
these cables up there because that is
where the control panel is going to be
as close to the PC as possible and this
entire cables gonna run down the TV out
that end and the headsets gonna come out
from there and there's plenty of wire
slack so I'm not gonna have to worry
about that but I don't have a PC right
now unfortunately so I'm gonna continue
using the AC zephyrus to power up the
vibe which is doing a phenomenal job
first of all problems I know I'm using a
freaking high end power gaming laptop to
run my vibe instead of a desktop PC but
anyways it's gonna get these routed
through the wall and see how it turns
out alright so this is what I've got so
far out of the LED lights
we've done some cable management near
the back clean up the surface a bit I
added the ps4 Pro inside the glass there
the HTC vive headset is down there so if
I need to use it basically just grab it
out the cables coming out from the back
end and it's actually through the wall
and into the back of the TV currently
and there's still plenty of slack over
here to move around and aloft so I feel
like I put the headset in a really good
spot so I wanna put this back inside I
also decided to move my vibe controller
stand to the charging station which
makes a lot more sense I mean I'm gonna
be charging something might as well move
it to the charging station the thing I
love about the charging dock is it's
actually magnetic hooked up a micro USB
adapter on the bottom of both of the
controllers so basically all have to do
is lower it down in a dock I might have
to wiggle a little bit just to find the
spot and then it snaps in place and
begins charging
convenience wise this is one of the best
options out there actually I looked
everywhere to find a decent charging
dock for device controllers and this is
the only one I could find that that's
actually that actually looks good also
green means it's fully charged and red
means it's currently charging so that's
a really cool indicator to let you know
if your controllers are juiced up and
ready to go but if you guys want to
check that out I'll drop a link to it
below as well as everything I mentioned
in this video of course
alright guys so there it is finally
completed very productive day I finished
up the cable management portion for that
sensor and the one for at this corner
looking a lot cleaner unfortunately
there's no way to hide the cables so I'm
gonna have to deal with that I mean
technically I can add a white cable
Raceway but it's gonna be way too
obvious because it's gonna be a lot
bigger than a simple black cable going
down so depressingly it's not bothering
me as much as I thought it would so I'm
gonna leave it that way I don't think
enough to do is to pick up one more
shelf put it on the opposite side find
out some really clean looking headphone
hangers and controller ducts for the ps4
and for the HTC vive controller finally
build a PC that's gonna be powering this
entire ultimate gaming setup I also put
the AC zephyrus laptop down there if I'm
not using it but obviously if I'm
playing on the vibe I'm gonna take it
out put it on top of the stand and then
hook it up to the vibe controllers the
remote sensor I left it there which I
think it's a lot easier to access let me
try it out actually alright let's test
it out so I'm basically gonna just aim
down towards the stand you can't have to
play around with it it's not very
accurate that's one of the things I hate
about this RGB strip but the quality is
really good so I'm gonna have to deal
with it maybe I'll just bring a closer
let me try bringing it closer alright
there's pretty much at the edge of the
stand let's try this again off okay that
worked on off on so yeah it works
sometimes and sometimes it doesn't
whatever but yeah guys that pretty much
wraps up the vlog I hope you whoo I hope
you guys enjoy the video if you did feel
free to toss a like to show your support
if you guys didn't like it feel free to
dislike as well that's completely fine
to let me know your feedback in the
comment section below what do you guys
think about the
setup that I'm building right now if
there's anything you want to change if
there's anything I should modify any
recommendations for the headphone stand
and stuff like that
leave it all below I'll be within the
comments but anyways love your faces
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
