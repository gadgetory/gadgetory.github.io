tech source and in this video we're
going to be doing a detailed speed
comparison between the iPhone 6s plus
and the samsung galaxy note5 for those
of you who are new to my speedtest
videos I basically compare the speeds
from both of these phones when it comes
to booting up opening up apps browsing
the web and multitasking I also do a few
benchmarks as well all in the effort to
determine which one of these two phones
is the fastest so without wasting any
more time let's begin so before I jump
into the speed test let's compare some
of the hardware differences between
these two phones the iPhone 6s plus is
rocking an Apple a9 processor as well as
2 gigabytes of RAM the galaxy note 5 has
a Samsung Exynos 7420 processor and 4
gigabytes of RAM the iPhone 6s plus
however has a much lower resolution
screen at 1080p compared to the 1440p
screen on the galaxy so might produce
better benchmark scores being it has
less pixels to push both of the phones
are running their most up-to-date
software and all apps have been cleared
from the background we also made sure
that both of them are connected to Wi-Fi
and that the brightness is set to max on
both of the phones so with all that
being said let's start the speed test
with a fresh reboot I hope you guys
enjoy the show
all right so as you guys saw from the
video the iPhone 6s plus is really only
marginally faster than the note 5 in
some of the tests what's really
surprising here though is that the
iPhone which has only 2 gigabytes of RAM
beat out the note 5 which is walking
four gigs in the multitasking test
something else to take away from this is
the fact that the iPhone and Galaxy tied
in the benchmark test which is crazy
when he considered that the iPhone has
two cores and that the note 5 has 8
cores all this really shows how Apple
software and hardware optimizations
making difference in performance as
always if you guys enjoy my speed test
make sure to hit that like button to
show your support and if there's a
specific phone you guys want to see go
up against these 6s let me know by
dropping a comment down below thanks
again for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
