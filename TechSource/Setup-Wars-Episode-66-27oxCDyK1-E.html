with another challenge so if this video
gets 60,000 likes I will cover my face
and ketchup and mustard and do an entire
episode of setup Wars that sounds really
stupid I mean give up whatever I'm just
gonna go with it
60,000 likes ketchup mustard on the face
yeah
what's up guys is that from tech source
and welcome to setup wars episode 66 so
when you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel so if you guys
want to participate make sure to watch
the video linked below as always you
guys can find everyone's gear for their
setups link down below in case you guys
are interested but here are your five
contestants for this week we have
Alessandro Anton Chris Jacob and karst
congratulations for making it on the
show first up we have Alessandro and his
triple monitor setup alright I just have
to point this out before we go any
further but this dude has a plant
growing out of a power supply case
that's hilarious anyway so we have three
23 inch LG monitors a corsair k70 RGB
and a logitech g502 proteus core mouse
it definitely looks like alesandro's
audio game is pretty strong we have four
Kenwood LSM 65 V speakers and a luxmo
LED amplifier which he is using as a
monitor riser for all three of his
displays very clever the cable
management game however can definitely
be improved there's a few things you can
do to clean these up and watching my
cable management video will help you out
tremendously so I'll drop a link to it
down below the PC pushing all these
pixels is running on a 50 20 K and the
new GT X 1080 founders Edition there are
a few mods in here as well like the
custom backplate wrapped in carbon fiber
along with a custom ROG fan grill which
was 3d printed and a few painted parts a
very nice black and white build inside
the courser 760 T case aside from the
setup I do like the atmosphere of the
entire room there's these GPU pictures
hung on the walls as well as the chassis
z' for both the titan x and 980ti
although I like the idea behind these I
would much prefer that mounted against
the wall in some sort of pattern because
right now kind of looks a little random
just work on the cable management and
your setup would be perfect Thank You
Alessandro for entering anton is next up
with a pretty simple ultra white setup
so we have a single 34 inch samsung
ultra wide and a razer Deathstalker
keyboard MX master mouse and you raise
your Firefly mouse pad near the back of
the desk we have a pair of fill
hue lights a Kingston card reader USB
hub and a levitating light bulb that
looks pretty though to the left of his
setup he has a console gaming area with
a massive TV that's hooked up to the
Razer Leviathan speaker and also we got
the ps4 with some dban skins it also
looks like he connected the PC to the TV
as well I'm guessing for when he wants
to watch videos from its PC you can
basically just chill on his bed
organization is definitely one of the
strong points of this entire set up
anton did a really great job with the
cable management and everything just
seems well organized nothing is left on
the desk and it seems like everything
has its own dedicated storage I'm very
pleased to see this and finally the PC
that's powering the setup has a 6700
carry and a gtx 980ti inside the corsair
750d case overall this is a very clean
and organized setup Thank You Anton for
entering let's change the gears up a bit
and take a look at this very unique Mac
setup right off the bat I love the
presentation
it's colorful symmetrical and very clean
we have a 27 inch retina iMac on top of
the very popular Grove made walnut
monitor stand and actually he's using a
grove made walnut set across his entire
setup the keyboard tray wrist pad and
phone stand at first glance I thought
there were two monitors on the sides but
those are actually digital art frames
I guess they cycled between photos over
time definitely haven't seen one of
these in a setup yet and it's very
refreshing to see if I were to describe
this setup in one word I would say
personality definitely digging the
Dwight bobble head and the swinging
sticks from Iron Man 2 this thing looks
pretty sick excellent work with cable
management as well I can see cable jobs
being used to hold cables as well as the
blue lounge cable bin that's holding the
power strip honestly from the art on the
wall to the perpetual calendar and the
Moose with sunglasses this is another
awesome and unique setup that I've come
across on setup Wars thank you Chris for
entering a number four we have Jacob
with another ultra white setup but this
time we have an Acer x34 predator the
keyboard of choice is the Logitech k810
paired with the logitech g502 Mouse and
for some reason he has a cooler master
quick-fire rapid tuck underneath the
desk there's also the audio engine HD
six speakers on both sides of the desk
and a pair of San Heiser HD 98
phones resting on the top a few other
things on the desk include his 13-inch
MacBook retina a d1 DAC and an iPad pro
really great work with the cable
management I can see that you velcro the
wires together against one of the legs
and even kept some loose wires wrapped
up behind the monitor I like that
the PCA is located on the ground has a
4790k and an EVGA gtx 980ti superclocked
and that's packed inside a tiny cursor
250 d case other than picking up a
hanger for your HD 598 I would say that
this is a very clean and organized ultra
light setup Thank You Jacob for entering
last but not least we have mkbhd I mean
karst with a very similar setup on the
custom-made monitor riser we have two
24-inch LG displays and below that we
have the Logitech g7 10 plus keyboard
and MX master mouse and that's pretty
much it other than the fake IKEA plant
and Edifier Luna eclipsed speakers I'm
not even kidding you guys I literally
set those up before I started recording
setup boards what a coincidence
cable Ashman looks pretty good I mean
you could definitely be improved by
using velcro straps instead of zip ties
and maybe even a channel raceway or
cable sleeve to hide the wires and
finally the PC down here has a 46 70 K
and a GTX 960 honestly guys if you're
going to go with an unlocked CPU please
buy an aftermarket cooler if you're
going to be sticking with a stock
heatsink you can save money and buy the
non K version instead especially if
you're not going to be overclocking
other than spiffing up the cable
management a bit this is a dope looking
setup
Thank You karst for entering so which of
these setups is the best make sure you
drop your comments down below and vote I
will announce the winners on Sunday on
my social media platforms that's
basically the thing guys so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
