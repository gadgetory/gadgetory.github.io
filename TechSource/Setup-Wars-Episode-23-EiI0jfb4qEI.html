announcement before I begin the video
sadly this will be the final episode of
setup Wars I'm sorry for anyone that's
upset and especially sorry for anyone's
setup and did not get featured on the
show yet I just don't have the time to
focus on setup wars every single week
it's taking up so much of my time and I
need to focus on other bigger projects
so I'm sorry guys
sike april fools
what's up guys it's ed back again from
tech source and welcome to setup wars
episode 23 where you submit your desk
setup to get featured on the channel and
a chance to win 50 bucks if you guys are
new to the show make sure to watch the
video link down below if you want to
submit your setup without wasting my
time
this video is brought to you by g2a
where you can buy super cheap CD keys
for any game on any platform this is
where I get all my games from as well as
Windows Keys for my monthly PC builds
but I'll leave a link down below so you
can see for yourself
as always everyone's gear from their
setups will be linked down below as well
as anything I recommend in this video
here are your 5 lucky contestants we
have amber Andre Chad Verde and Jason
congratulations for making it to setup
wars episode 23 first up is amber with a
triple a C's 21.5 inch monitors set up
on the desk we have the corsair k70 RGB
keyboard a razer mumble mouse on the
scarab mousepad hanging from the
monitors on the left side is the
SteelSeries Siberia v2 headphones the
bottom portion is pretty much covered
which means I can't judge you on cable
management but we do have a custom PC
with an FX 6300 and a GTX 770 finally an
AMD processor honestly it's a really
clean and straightforward setup there's
really not much else to say if you or
anyone likes to hang their headphones on
their monitors then I recommend picking
up an Aegis headset stand that hooks up
to the side of your monitor not only
does it look badass but it offers four
USB ports in the back along with a mouse
bungee and you can also swivel the
amount to hide the headphones in the
back but yeah simple and clean setup
Thank You amber for entering under the
giant is next up with a you I mean a
triple monitor setup so we have three
Dell 27 inch monitors a corsair k70
keyboard and an orochy mouse from Razer
which you can barely see you gotta love
that Super Saiyan 3 vegeta wallpaper
though that just looks badass I'm really
diggin the entire room set up though you
got a giant 65 inch Samsung 4k TV right
in front of your bed and a crap ton of
posters everywhere it seems like you're
into anime but I'm extremely
disappointed because I don't see any
posters of Death Note you have a crap
ton of cables but I applaud you for
hooking them up to the power strips and
attaching it to the roof of your desk
honestly a really badass gaming room and
I'm definitely diggin the atmosphere you
have created here oh there is the Death
Note poster I knew you had it somewhere
Thank You Andrei for entering Chad is
next up with a very minimalistic setup
we have two 24-inch asus monitors hooked
up against the wall using the video seku
motion wall mounts on the desk we have
the razor Deathstalker keyboard and a
Logitech G 700 gaming mouse excellent
work with cable management I mean even
your 55 inch vizio tv has no wires
coming down what kind of sorcery is this
really clean setup Chad I have nothing
else to say thank you for entering I
know I win jacket it's hot as hell in
here
much better party is next up with a
Productivity type setup we have a single
34 inch Samsung monitor on top of the
IKEA monitor stand on the desk we have
the speed link Verdana keyboard and a
Logitech M 705 Maps off to the side of
the desk is the uno microphone hooked up
to the keep drum mic stand and powering
all of this is the 12 core Xeon
processor mac pro cable management is
not bad i mean i can still see that you
have all the power strips and cables
locked up inside the cage which is fine
since technically they aren't visible I
gotta say I really like that monitor
stand you have for my kia not only does
it double that storage but it really
cleans up the overall look of your desk
and I'll definitely be sure to link that
down below for anyone that's interested
nothing else to say pretty sweet
productivity set up Thank You 44
entering last but not least we have
Jason with a black and white beam setup
we have a 24 inch asus monitor corsair
k70 5 RGB keyboard and a Roccat TYIN
gaming mouse we also have a pair of
insignia 2.1 speakers and a func HS 260
headset hanging from the anchor
headphone holder really good job with
cables I see that you've added them
behind the table and you have a really
clean build as well a 4790k processor
paired with a gtx 770 graphics card well
done with cable management in here as
well as good choices on the RAM sticks
and LEDs to match your overall PC build
I'm really enjoying these minimalistic
and clean setups so definitely keep them
coming the only thing I'll recommend is
for you to move the headphone anger
underneath the main desk so you don't
see the cable slack just hanging down
like that I would also recommend using
cable drops as well so the cord doesn't
drag that much near the ground but
overall a really clean an awesome black
and white setup thank you Jason for
entering so that's it for this week's
episode of setup wars make sure you guys
drop your comments down below and vote
on who has the best desk setup as always
voting will end Saturday and announce
the winner on Sunday on my Twitter and
Instagram accounts so make sure you guys
are following me there in case you guys
didn't get the
joke in the beginning setup words will
still continue so make sure to hit that
like button to show your support and I
