today I wanted to introduce an amazing
bluetooth wireless speaker that you
probably haven't heard about this is the
lookalike wireless speaker and not only
is it a speaker but there's also a spot
on here to place your phones which most
other Bluetooth speakers don't have so
you can have your mini theater
experience if you choose to which i
think is a pretty cool addition now to
make things interesting I have brought
over three other popular wireless
speakers that cost the same and compare
them with the Luga leg to find out which
speaker sounds the best and you guys can
also be the judge
but before they all go head-to-head I
just want to share some info on each
speaker starting with the luga lake you
can pick one up for only 40 bucks in
either silver blue gold or metallic like
the one you see here it also has a
connection range of up to 33 feet the
anchor speaker also costs 40 bucks and
comes in either black blue or white and
also has a connection range of up to 33
feet the angle speaker is the same price
as well and it's only available in the
color you see here and it's connection
range is up to 30 feet and last but not
least we have the portable speaker from
JBL and it comes in a variety of colors
as well and it's connection range is
well zero since it's not actually
wireless anyways that's enough of
nonsense let's get to the real
comparison the actual sound test we will
be comparing overall sound quality from
the beat to vocals and even some bass so
without wasting any more time sit back
relax and enjoy the show
five Ford Mustang
all righty so that concludes the test
I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you
which speaker did the best the Luger leg
speaker wiped the floor with the other
speakers the sound quality was just a
lot more clear and crisp and the music
just sounded so much better even with
the high bass songs but I wanted to ask
you anyways do you guys agree with me
did we hear the same thing or am I wrong
let me know in the comment section down
below
I'll also leave a link in the
description section if you guys want to
check out the new Gaelic for yourself
anyways this is Ed from tech source and
I will see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
