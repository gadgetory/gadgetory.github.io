sponsoring our trip to CES 2017 if
you're looking to spice up your device
with the best skins out there then the
brand is where it's at
not only do they provide the most
precise fit out there but they offer a
variety of colors and materials to
choose from for tons of products out
there if you guys are interested in
spicing up your device make sure to
visit them by clicking on the link below
well so guys it's a from tech source and
we are here at the Alpha cool suite here
at CES as you guys know my first
water-cooled build on the channel is
sponsored by alpha cool and using their
parts so I'm joined here by Eddie's
going to be going over some really cool
products from Alpha cool that are coming
out in 2017 so shells what you got
what is new this year will be the ice
want that's the external radiator okay I
could see it here there are inside six
fans three sixty millimeter radiator
blue copper whereas a vast inside you
have two thumbs inside so if one pump
maybe make some problems sometimes also
got a backup and yeah it's a complete
set with a CPU cooler with tubes with
quick-release fittings with everything
you need to to cool the CPU and of
course it can later add like a bu cooler
too we have the ice wolves that's the
new VP cooler serious as on a Mon
solution so you can get a birthing
radiator out back to the CPU i/o and you
can mount us all that quick realistic
settings easily with the icebound and
maybe the ice beer or CPU are you okay
and the idea behind that is to show the
people how easy it is to build the
complete water quality because the most
people are
well you know not experience that yeah
water water and electronics is what's
currently on some people and so we make
a musical note well sing the most know
this weirdo
yeah so what I'm actually using in my
because the one I was using before I
think it was something like that didn't
fit so they won't send me this one a
little very different because the only
idea was that we have if you put it on
the front maybe it's easier to yeah the
top and the bottom that's a big CPU out
special thing is we have a lot of
different radial sizes we have 120
millimeter we have 242 and 80 360 we
will have on the near future 140 and 180
millimeter radiator and like the Ice
Bowl you know if you're rediscovering oh
so it's easy to extend complete loop to
the edge of something else and yeah you
can feel it man
oh okay so I mean normally if you if you
connect the I smooth you connect three
food radiators which we offer - yeah
well we're very good cooling performance
you can
a lot of these videos okay that's my
challenge yeah okay okay what we have
here is our new d5 pump it's not from
the typical d5 pump it's a complete all
creation the top is from aluminium it's
one centimeter shorter that's normal t5
you can control it over like you know on
the normal t5 pump or the table or over
PVM and the great new thing is if you
put the coop maybe on level three and
you controlled over ppm you can't get a
higher rpm then our level three so you
can only regulate ppm from one up to
three and not higher you can't put off
that aluminum top you can cut it so it's
special and perfect for models then we
have the new expects ice blocks on
NewsView cool we will have different
tools for you can change them easily red
blue white chrome and maybe later other
colors or you can paint it by yourself
and we will have tops without cut out
for our levels so you can have gravy for
your name or for your company or
whatever and the best thing is it's in
the moment the best water cooling CPU
cool on the market you can show internet
you will find a few reviews about it and
every review we have the best
performance the next thing is our
isolation
that's not LED strip it's like from your
monitor the backlighting it's the same
technique so you can have a great smooth
illumination in your case and that's you
will not have that lighting points with
LEDs
and yeah well it's from aluminum here
you have some screw holes so we have
some small screws you can screw them in
with a magnetic so you can put it in
your case where you want and we have a
glue tape for the backside so you can
put it in your case we wanted to and
last thing is that's very important for
us
that's industrial radiator all of our
radiators are full couple so things are
talked about all water parts are from
Kappa yeah you can see it here the only
thing is probably many other side
pallets but all other parts are
completely full Kabam is the only brand
worldwide with a complete full coverage
of the most tab and when your friends or
they're using steel for the channels or
both ends are completely free from brass
and a from copper yeah that's our new
graphic card for the Sierra and if you
can see the PCB you can't see the PCB
because society and on the back is
completely closed you will have
different colors like you can see red
silver and chrome and we have specially
caps for there's the e connectors so if
you do not use them you can close them
do not see them and if you use like to
use them and you can see using can put
them off and yeah I hope you like it
as always think guys so much for
watching make sure you guys stick around
for more CES coverage this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
