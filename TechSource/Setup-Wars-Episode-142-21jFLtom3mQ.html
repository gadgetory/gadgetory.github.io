welcome to setup wars episode 142 when
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel so if you guys
want to participate make sure to watch
the video linked below
but before we jump into the show I do
want to say a few things one this is a
new temporary set that we're working on
we are still trying to move stuff around
in the office to make a perfect set and
we still haven't gotten a rug which is
why the audio sounds a little echoey and
there's a little reverb in it I promise
you guys the next episode is gonna sound
a lot better but anyways what that said
yeah that's just the setup words begin
kicking off the episode is angel and his
setup that's used for gaming content
creation and streaming it features three
Acer 144 Hertz monitors that are hooked
up against the wall and a little bit of
my fanboy side came out looking at those
Kingdom Hearts posters
he's also rocking the Corsair strafe RGB
keyboard a SteelSeries rifle 100 mouse
and a dope looking extended mousepad I
don't know if that's custom made or not
but I'm sure someone in the comment
section can educate me on who that is
and what game it's from if it's even
from a game for audio he's got a blue
snowball I set up with an LG sound bar
and a pair of status audio headphones in
some pictures the sound bar isn't shown
and there's even a picture where the
entire wall is covered in acoustic foams
so I'm not sure if these were taken at
different times or if this was one of
his previous setups the PC powering at
all as a 4790k 16 gigs of ram and an
EVGA gtx 1070 in sli I don't think your
RAM sticks are in the correct slots to
take advantage of dual channel but the
rest of the PC is looking clean wrapping
up a setup as the cable management
everything is hooked up against the desk
and the rest of the wires are attached
to one of the legs nicely done it's a
great setup with personality I mean
everything has its own purpose and there
aren't any extra items on the desk that
aren't being used well done angel and
thank you for entering next up is Brian
from Canada and his contrast II black
white and red setup that he uses for
gaming entertainment and work it's
interesting that he separated both of
his monitors like this honestly if you
ask me it looks really good it's
actually more balanced this way as
opposed to sticking it side-by-side it's
also not gonna get in the way of gaming
or watching videos I personally hate
having another monitor next to the one
I'm gaming on or watching videos it's
kind of distracting regardless if it's
on or off for audio is rocking a pair of
audio engine a 2 plus speakers we also
got the cursor void Wireless are
headset and he's even got a blue Yeti
microphone hooked up to a boom arm I
gotta say everything is nicely organized
and spaced out it's not cramped and
everything has its own purpose I also
like I usually hold to route the cable
for the strafe keyboard and two charging
cables for easy access
speaking of cables Brian did an
excellent job with the cable management
we have a Signum rack that's holding up
majority of the wires and he even hooked
up a parish tip against the wall I also
noticed some cable clips holding the
wires against the table and some velcro
straps to group the cables together
nicely done last but not least we have
the PC that's powering everything and
it's equipped with a 7700 K which by the
way is belated we also got an EVGA GTX
1080 FTW with the power link now
personally I'm not a fan on the power
link because it pushes the cables off to
the side the only reason you should use
a power link is if you're going with the
ugly stock PSU cables because that way
you can route the cables to the side so
it's not as visible but if you're going
with custom sleeve cables like Brian did
over here I would personally would have
loved to see them in the front
regardless this is a very sexy and
balanced setup with personality and
purpose well done and thank you Brian
for entering and number three we have
David and his setup for gaming well
technically he has two setups one for PC
gaming and the other for console gaming
judging by the Nintendo switch and the
Xbox controllers on the desk he also has
a MacBook Pro for when he needs to be on
the move so the PC setup features an
ultra-wide from Samsung that's hooked up
on a desk mount and below that we got
some Razer gear the Black Widow X chroma
key board and the Naga chroma Mouse for
audio is rocking the super tiny iHome
bluetooth speaker and a pair of Astral a
50s that are hanging from the desk and
speaking of the desk I like how he
propped it up using some risers now he
has extra storage space between the
tabletop and the Alex drawers
Keio management seems to be in order
thanks to the signal rack and the PC
powering everything has a 4690k
and the EVGA GTX 1070 inside the NZXT
s340 elite case that's pretty much it
for the setup pretty straightforward
thank you David for in turn next up is
Zane with his insane quad display setup
that he uses for pretty much everything
from gaming to screaming and
occasionally editing for his dead shadow
and I swear that is what he wrote in his
notes I'm not insulting his channel in
fact my editor will show you the notes
for proof he also says that he loves
streaming on Twitch I mean this is one
hell of an overkill setup for screaming
but check him out if you guys want I'll
drop a link to his twitch channel down
below also let me remind you guys that
he's only 14 years old however he
acquired this setup doesn't matter
what's really impressive is how clean
and organized he kept it the first row
of monitors are hooked up on the desk
mount and the top ultra light from LG is
hooked up against the wall as an
overhead he also wrapped some RGB strips
behind them and he guys can also see how
he did the cable management
he pretty much grouped up all the wires
together and ran them straight down
behind the monitor mount and tied them
together using velcro straps he also
drilled a hole right next to the monitor
mount for both of his keyboard and mouse
cables for audio he's only using a
gaming headset from HyperX which is
hanging neatly from a hanger on the left
side of the desk however for his mic
setup he's rocking an 80 20:35
microphone that's hooked up to the
popular road psa1
boom arm there's one thing I noticed
about this setup and that's the lighting
umbrella on the top right corner of the
monitors now he put that there to block
the Philips hue bulb from lighting his
face I guess it's very distracting for
him obviously there's an easy fix to
this and you can buy a desk lamp with a
built-in clamp now this way you can swap
the bulb inside which or RGB one and
have it clamped to the monitor mount not
only will it be hidden behind your
monitors but it will not be hitting you
directly in the face while at the same
time giving off some extra lighting for
your setup another thing I know
is that your PC is being blocked off by
a monitor and this is actually a simple
fix because you have a ton of extra
space on the left side now if it's
possible I would move all the monitors
to the left a bit so that your PC isn't
being blocked off I'm guessing the only
reason you haven't done this already is
because it requires a lot of work not
only do you have to remove all three
monitors and remount them but you
actually have to read rill new holes for
the ultra light monitor as well now if
this was me I would obviously do it in a
heartbeat
but a lot of people don't want to put in
that extra work speaking of the PC it's
rocking 867 2k 16 gigs of ram and the
msi gtx 1070 it's interesting that he
went with a black and blue case but with
black and red parts and a set up with
purple lighting it's a very unusual
color scheme they also included a video
of all his previous setups from the
beginning all the way to his current
set-up today and it's awesome to see
where he started and how much work you
put in to build something like this
Thank You Zane for entering wrapping up
the video we have a very clean set up
from zen chile who lives in germany and
i'm actually featuring this set up on
the show because of how clean it looks
and the amazing picture quality it may
be a simple setup but if you guys take
the extra time to send me
high-resolution photos like this then
you are automatically entered so Zen
Chile's actually e german youtuber and
this is the setup he uses for gaming and
editing fun fact he actually has a
German version of setup Wars on his
channel and he actually reached out and
asked me permission a long time ago to
start his own show which I said it was
ok and now he's participating in setup
wars which is cool one of the things I
love about the setup is the lighting it
isn't over the top and I feel like it's
balanced nicely there's an RGB lamp on
the left side and another RGB source
behind this PC and we also got a warm
lighting behind a monitor I really like
the separation in the middle so both the
keyboard and mouse are from Shar kun and
even though he didn't drill a hole in a
desperate able management he did a good
job wrapping them together and routing
around the monitor stand the rest of the
cables are managed very well using some
zip ties to group up the wires and power
strip together on one of the legs he
doesn't use any speakers so the only
audio source are the HyperX cloud
stingers that he has resting on a
headphone stand
lastly the PC powering the setup has a
risin 5 1400 and the ACS GTX 1060 all in
all it's a very compact and clean setup
how much I can recommend that will stay
true to the minimalistic theme he's got
going maybe some posters or wall shelves
with stuff on them to reflect your
personality or interests but regardless
you have a very very clean set up thank
you for entering so that is it for this
episode of setup or is as always drop
your comments below and vote on who you
think has the best best setup as always
if you enjoy the show tossing a like
would be awesome and if you don't please
leave a dislike I encourage you I love
your faces and I'll see you guys in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
