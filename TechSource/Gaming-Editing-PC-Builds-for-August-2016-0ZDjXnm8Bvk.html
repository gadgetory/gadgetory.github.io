again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below what's
up guys is that from Texas and welcome
to this month's PC builds we're gonna
change things up and bring you a $700
Mini ITX build along with a 1950 gaming
and editing PC which by the way you guys
can find the links to all the parts
mentioned down below so let's go and
start this episode so the first build is
a $700 Mini ITX gaming PC featuring the
i3 6100 now although this is a dual core
processor it does have hyper threading
technology meaning it acts as a quad
core and since most games take advantage
of hyper threading technology you won't
be losing out on any frames in fact the
6100 shows similar performance compared
to the FX 8320 II which has eight cores
and even the i5 44:30 in some cases the
6100 actually performed better I did
pick up a cooler just to keep the fan
noise down in overall cooler temps but
it is optional and it's not required
since you can't even overclock the CPU
for the motherboard I went with the Asus
H 110 M which is a very solid board for
only 50 dollars and has a lot of nice
features for ram I went with 8 gigs of
g.skill ripjaws rated at 2400 megahertz
now I did stick with a black and red
theme for this build hence why I picked
up bread Ram sticks and the msi gtx 1060
graphics card the gtx 960 does perform
better than the RX 480 and the gtx 970
so it made sense to go with that card
for this budget build obviously you can
pick up any gtx 960 you want for your
own build but to keep the color scheme
consistent I went with msi for storage I
went with 2 terabytes of hard drive
space from Seagate and for the case I
went with the black version of II
thermaltake core v 21
I'm calling this build the dark cube and
finally juicing up all the parts is a
500 watt power supply from EVGA now you
guys might be asking me so ed which
build is better Ice Cube or dark cube
well obviously dark cube is better
because the GTX 1060 wasn't available at
the time in fact the GTX 760 is nearly
75% faster than the GTX 960 so if you
guys want a nice FPS boost and games
I would definitely upgrade when you
the money overall this build will cost
you a little over $700 all right so
moving on to something with a little
more power this is a great PC for both
editing and gaming featuring the new
1600 k-6 core processor that's great for
editing and rendering 4k video this is
an unlocked CPU which is meant for
overclocking hence why I picked up an H
100 iv2 cooler from corsair and a very
solid motherboard the EVGA micro 2 that
features a USB 3.1 port and an MDOT 2
speaking of which this time around I
went with the Samsung 950 Pro m2 SSD
which has ridiculously crazy speeds of
up to 25 hundred megabytes read and 1500
write this is where the operating system
would be installed as well as any
editing programs maybe even some games
that you want loaded faster our
secondary storage is going to be a basic
three terabyte hard drive from Seagate
and four RAM I went with 32 gigs of
Crucial Ballistix sport I didn't do my
best to keep the white and black being
consistent for the graphics card we are
using the msi gtx armor to match the
color scheme and it comes with some
pretty beefy specs as well of course the
band is optional and you can go with any
GT X 1080 you want powering this PC is
the EVGA 600 watt power supply which has
plenty of juice even after overclocking
the CPU and GPU and finally bringing
this entire build together is the
courser Air 240 case with a very compact
form factor and sleek look this is the
perfect white case to complement the
micro ATX build so that is it for this
month's build if you guys enjoyed these
