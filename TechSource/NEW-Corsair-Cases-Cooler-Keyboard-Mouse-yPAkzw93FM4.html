tech source well so guys it's a from
tech source and I'm over here at the
courser suite in CES 2018 with some
exciting new product launches first up
is their new lineup of the Carbide
series a refresh of their previous
carbide alpha cases that they are
calling carbide Omega it's a mid tower
case with tempered glass on the side and
in the front with an LED strip
unfortunately it's not RGB and it will
only display the appropriate color
depending on what case you pick my first
impression is that this case is that it
looks very cool I'm personally a fan of
the design because of its very
aggressive look with these sharp edges
it does come with a single 120
millimeter LED fan but it can also
support up to a 360 millimetre radiator
in the front and up to a 280 millimeter
radiator on the top I like that the add
of the SSD trays in the back which by
the way it can support up to three of
them and the hard drive bays underneath
but for $100 I honestly expected a PSU
shroud I feel like the hundred dollar
price tag is a little steep for there on
tree-level made tower I personally would
have preferred an acrylic side panel
with a PSU shroud that cost less but
that's just my opinion
it's available now in three different
colors and I'll drop a link below if you
guys want to check it out Corsair also
launched a new power supply the ax 1600
I which is the only enthusiast PSC you
to use gallium nitride transistors which
basically offers better efficiency in a
smaller form factor the PSU is a d-plus
titanium rated and features complete
digital monitoring and control using the
corsair link software one thing I like
about the PSU is the swappable magnetic
stickers on the side and it might not
seem like a big deal to most people but
it's a really nice mod for those that
are trying to go with a certain color
scheme in their pc oftentimes the PSU is
visible and the color of the side
sticker ruins the overall consistent
color scheme the PSU currently ships
with blue red and white magnetics
another thing they changed up is how
they package the cables it used to be
just tied up in velcro and tossed inside
a bag but this time they actually
separated each type of cable and labeled
it so it's a lot easier to find very
nice this power supply will cost you
$450 and it's available now as well I
think the most noticeable release was
their coolers they launched two new RGB
liquid coolers the H 150 I Pro and the H
115 I Pro the 150 I Pro is coursers
first-ever 360 millimetre radiator and
the H 115 I is a 280 millimeter radiator
these are also the first quarter hydro
series coolers to feature a zero rpm
mode so basically the fans will stop
spinning when the CPU temps are low for
absolute silence one thing I like about
both of the coolers are the RGB ring
around it which you can customize via
the cursor link app cursor has also
stated that these new pumps are quieter
and offer better cooling than their
previous lineup of the hydro series la
Spinelli's courser has introduced a new
lineup of wireless devices the new k63
wireless mechanical gaming keyboard and
the dark or RGB wireless mouse the tan
keyless k63 keyboard over here has the
Cherry MX red switches and you can
connect it via bluetooth 2.4 gigahertz
wireless dongle or via wired connection
of course are claims that this keyboard
has extremely fast 1 millisecond
response times via the 2.4 gigahertz
connection violife is expected to last
up to 75 hours and you can control the
blue LED backlit via the courser utility
engine unfortunately blue is the only
color available and the brighter the
colors are on the keyboard the more
battery it will drain one of the cool
things about the keyboard is that it
comes with a 128-bit AES encryption
which is nice and it's fairly light
which is great if you need to haul this
thing around along with the keyboard
courser introduced their wireless dark
or RGB mouse with a 16,000 dpi optical
sensor and with the same one millisecond
response time via 2.4 gigahertz
connection you can also connect the via
bluetooth or a wired connection if you
prefer for the most part it's very
comfortable to hold and contours my hand
nicely however it does feel a little
heavier than the other wireless mouse
I've used in the past like the G 900
from Logitech for example the mouse
features 3 zones that have RGB lighting
which can be customized in the Q
software
and is expected to give you up to 24
hours of battery life the mouse comes in
two versions the regular which costs $80
and the dark core are gbesi with
built-in Qi wireless charging for $90
both of these are available now as well
I would say out of all the new product
launches from Corsair I think the one
that really shocked me the most was
their new qi wireless mouse pad the MM
1000 so get this guys you can charge
your dark core RGB s emails by simply
placing it on the top right corner of
the mousepad
where the logo is you no longer have to
look for cables and plug in your mouse
anymore because Corsair has made your
life a lot easier
and you can even charge your smartphone
if it has wireless charging support as
you guys can see I'm actually charging
my iPhone 10 with a wallet case on so
that's pretty freaking cool now let's
say you have a device that isn't
compatible with wireless charging well
you guys don't have to worry about that
because courser includes a charging
adapter that lets you attach any device
you have in order to make it compatible
with the Qi charger by default that has
the microUSB tip but you can also attach
a USB type-c along with a lightning tip
to charge your iPhone and I pretty much
wraps up the video let me know which of
these products you guys are most excited
about from courser and leave your
comments down below as always make sure
