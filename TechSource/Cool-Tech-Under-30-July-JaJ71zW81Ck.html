and welcome to another cool tech episode
this time I'm going to be taking a look
at tech on their 30 and let's just jump
right into it starting off the episode
we have the samsung go mic that comes in
a little plastic carrying case it's the
perfect portable USB microphone with
noise cancellation technology if you're
going on a trip and need to pack
extremely tight but need a microphone
for voiceovers or Skype calls then this
is something you need to add in your
tech bag here's a quick sample of the
mic what's up guys it's that from tech
source and I'm talking directly at the
samsung go Mike and this is without any
editing using the program audacity
what's up guys is that from tech source
and I'm talking directly at the samsung
go Mike
and this is with editing once again
using the program audacity obviously
it's not going to get you the best audio
recording out there but for everyday use
and light voiceovers this sure as hell
beats the default microphone on laptops
next up on the list is this really
awesome LED bluetooth speaker it comes
with a remote which lets you control the
lights it has a total of three light
modes you have a single solid color
which you can manually choose out of six
different colors you can also set a
rainbow color mode or switch to temple
lights that match the beat of the music
I also like the fact that it has a slot
in the back to store the remote since I
always tend to lose mine
sound wise this isn't anything
impressive don't expect any
bone-rattling bass either the low end is
pretty flat but it's still a lot better
than some speakers i've used in the past
in fact here's a quick audio sample
early Western a missile
they don't give it to me TC
in the end I would buy this speaker
because it looks boss on my desk not
because it sounds incredible there are
plenty of speakers out there that sound
way better under $30 but I can guarantee
you that nothing looks as good as this
in a setup next up we have skin so
believe it or not you can pick up some
really dope skins from D brand under $10
if you want to pimp out your smartphone
gaming console or headphones to match
your set up they make sure to check out
the first link down below I've been
using these guys for the past few years
now we have the best quality skins out
there for a variety of devices so be
sure to check them out if you are
interested and you last item on my list
is the eye pega bluetooth game
controller it's compatible with iOS and
enjoyed and even windows and it can
support devices up to 10 inches in width
and features a locking mechanism in the
back so that your smartphone or tablet
stays nice and snug now although it
won't work on all Android and iOS games
it's still a very cool way of gaming on
a tablet or smartphone the only games as
controller supports on iOS are games
under the iCade category and for Android
games well it's pretty much a hit or
miss but I will do for my cool tech
episode for this month you guys enjoy

always I'll drop a link to the products
