unnecessary but I like to add some spice
to my videos as you can already tell hey
guys it's Edie and welcome to my desk
tour a lot of you have been requesting
this video and the office tour but I
thought that I would at least get this
video out and you guys can expect the
full office tour early 2015 so this is
my work area this is where I am 90% of
the time editing responding to comments
on my videos and essentially running
text source everything I show in this
video will be listed in the description
section in the order that they appear so
it's easy for you guys to find them
okay so first and foremost I have to
start by showing off my baby big red
this is what's powering tech source at
the moment my custom-painted ultimate
gaming PC which we did a video on if you
somehow missed it then you are
definitely missing out I will also leave
links to the videos of the products that
you see on here as well so I won't go
too much into the PC since I already
covered that in my previous videos but
it is a custom PC I built a few months
back with custom painted parts as you
can see here connected to the USB port
on the top of big red is the linear flux
hyper charger which is hands-down my
most favorite charger that I use every
single day it charges my phone super
fast and recharges itself fast as well
not to mention how thin it is making it
really convenient carrying it around in
my wallet
so why my desk we have a few things one
of my daily drivers the iPhone 6 wrapped
in the amazing vessel wood series case
and the vivid power bank I keep the
power bank on my desk at all times to
juice up my phones and other peripherals
since it does have both a micro USB
cable and a USB port
not to mention 13,000 milliamps of
goodness also on the desk is my second
daily driver the Xperia z3 I've always
been a fan of the Xperia lineup and Sony
has impressed me with their new
iteration and I can't wait to see their
newer model of the Xperia series coming
in January also the stand holding the
phone up is the anchor multi-angle
portable stand now most of you guys know
that my favorite color combo is red and
black if it isn't already
from this death store so going with a
Microsoft Sidewinder X was a no-brainer
for me not only are the keys really soft
and quiet but they do light up in red as
well which is a huge plus for my mouse I
went with the corsair raptor and 45 and
so far I have no complaints oh and I
really liked the red LED backlit of the
Corsair brand also from Corsair I had
the gaming mm 200 extended edition
gaming mouse mat which was a great
purchase I think it really brings the
desk together well and it's extremely
wide why don't have to rest a pair of
eight ehm 50 X's which to me are the
best pair of headphones that I have
purchased for that price point also on
my desk is the MPM box speaker and I'm
not exaggerating when I say that this is
the best speaker that I have ever used I
did do a video on this as well which I
will leave a link down below but if you
guys are in the market for an affordable
Bluetooth speaker you have to at least
check this out because it's not only the
loudest but it has the most clear and
crisp audio I have ever heard from a
portable speaker most of the stuff I own
I actually do a video on if it isn't
good enough for me it isn't good enough
for you guys and that's what it comes
down to when I decide to do a video on a
product so how do I record my audio in
fact the auto you are hearing now is
reported with the focusrite scarlett
Studio USB audio interface the package
comes with a condenser microphone and
the audio interface itself it did come
with headphones but I did replace them
with my Audio Technica as well because
there are a lot better the idea that
gets produced is really impressive for
this price point
although I do modify the recording
slightly using the software audacity
which improves the overall sound quality
on the top of the audio interface I have
attached the popular transcend SD card
reader making my job so much easier when
I have to transfer the files from my
camera to my PC it's also connected via
USB 3.0 making the file transfer super
fast and convenient now let's talk about
the monitors I have two samsung 28 inch
4k monitors and I've compared these to
the Asus model and decided that the
Samsung ones are a much better fit for
me in terms of design color and overall
quality all the extra space is
definitely nice especially when editing
I multitask like a mofo and I can use
all the pixels I can get speaking of
editing I use Sony Vegas Pro 13 as my
main editing software something I'd like
to keep on my desk also are my business
cards I did show a sneak peek of this on
my Instagram already but I did order
these specifically for CES 2015 as I
will be handing out a bunch of them and
I'm really happy with the way they
turned out so the desk I'm using that's
holding up everything is called vertex
which is short for vertical desk and
it's an electric adjustable desk which I
have also done a video on quite possibly
the coolest desk on this planet it's 72
inches in width and 30 inches in depth
which is one of the reasons I love this
table so much it has a lot of space to
work on and oh yeah you can adjust the
height whenever you want people kept
asking me what kind of desk I was using
in a big red video and in fact I have
two vertex one for my setup and one for
filming which I'm sure you guys have
noticed in case you haven't noticed the
table isn't facing a wall I purposely
faced it towards my office which means
that cable management won't be as easy
however I did manage to do a good job
wiring the cables under the desk and
through this omnimount cable management
cloth to clean things up a bit
I also routed the PC wires through this
and out the bottom into my balcony our
outlet I gotta say I did a pretty good
job on cable management for my desk
that's not facing a wall so last but not
least the most important piece of
equipment that ties everything together
is my chair yes it matches my theme but
I didn't get it just because of that
it's also one of the most comfortable
chairs that I've ever sat on I really
like the headrest and being six to there
just aren't many tall chairs out there
for me so I'm extremely happy with this
purchase again you can find all the
