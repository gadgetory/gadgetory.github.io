welcome back to setup wars episode 147
where you submit your desk setup to get
featured on that channel if you guys
want to participate you know what to do
make sure to watch the video linked down
below with that said let the setup wars
begin
hey guys so before I begin the episode
I'm gonna give a quick update on setup
makeover season 2 it's taking a while to
start because we're still on the final
stages of selecting a winner we are
going through a lot of applications and
we're finally narrowed it down to 5
final contestants and we're still doing
interviews with them
so by the middle of July we would have
concluded and picked a finalist so thank
you guys so much for your patience
hopefully we can launch episode 1
sometime in August that is the plan but
yeah things are still moving I've not
forget about the about the series thing
guys again for your patience and yeah
let's get back to the show kicking off
the episode it is Jude and his compact
gaming setup featuring the asus rog
swift gaming monitor and some corsair
gear he's got the K 95 RGB platinum
keyboard the M 65 pro mouse with the
Polaris RGB mouse pad and even the
headset and headset stand are from
Corsair I feel like I've Corsair made
speakers it would even be in this setup
as well but instead he's using the bose
companion 2 speakers i like where he
drilled a hole for the mouse and mouse
pad wire it looks more cleaner this way
instead of routing it underneath the
keyboard nicely done in fact all the
cable management looks clean in this
setup looks like he used a channel
raceway to out most of the wires in the
back along with the help of some zip
ties and cable clips to keep things nice
and tidy
excellent work there's really nothing
over-the-top or extra in this setup it
has all the essentials any gaming setup
needs
we got the mechanical keyboard a gaming
monitor speakers headset and of course a
beast gaming pc walk in the 8700 k and
on Asus Strix 1080 the coolest thing
inside the PC is the 50 Cal bullet
that's made out of pure silver the
reason is because it has an awesome
story behind it it was actually given to
him by his dad after surviving a massive
brain tumor that almost killed them it
has the words Invictus engraved on the
side meaning unconquered you know it's
easy to forget about all the terrible
stuff that's happening outside in the
world we are tucked away nice and cozy
in our rooms watching videos and playing
games
you know there are people out there who
have battled against sickness and death
or just live in very poor conditions if
anyone watching this video is struggling
with those problems I just want to say
hang in there don't give up on life and
I really hope that my videos give you at
least a little bit of joy to help you
with these tough times Julian is up next
all the way from Germany and his editing
setup which appears to be inside of
Harry Potter's closet or I mean it could
just be an attic or something it's
interesting that this is mostly an
editing setup
instead of gaming seeing as he's only
using a 6700 K which is a quad-core I'm
not really sure what programs he's using
to edit but I know most programs are
heavily dependent on CPU so I expect
that at least six cores if not an eight
core inside this PC he's got a good
amount of RAM but the CPU choice is
interesting the desk choice is also
interesting so he managed to cram three
monitors on that tiny thing using a
mount which is genius by the way who
says you need a large desk to fit
multiple monitors this is definitely one
of the solutions if you don't have
enough space on your desk there aren't
that many things on the desk however
he's got the shark own keyboard MX
master mouse and his Logitech Z 906
speakers now since the desk isn't up
against the wall Julian had to bundle up
the wires together and run them through
this side of the desk and behind the PC
using some cable sleeves I'm actually
pretty impressed that he was able to
achieve this type of setup given the
overall table size well done and thank
you for entering here's another triple
monitor setup this one is by Justin from
Singapore and its purpose as gaming
editing and audio production he's
rocking three 24 inch monitors that are
hooked up to a desk mount and below that
we got the corsair k70 and Logitech g600
mouse for audio he's using the creative
soundblaster X katana and a pair of son
Heiser Game one headphones I like what
he did with the headphone wire
he used a few cable clips to keep it
from hanging down and he routed it
underneath the desk very nice one thing
I would change however is the cable
clips that you're using for your
charging cables it looks a bit difficult
to remove when you need to use them for
charging so instead I would use these
magnetic cable clips instead it will
allow you to remove and
the cables a lot easier than your
current setup but the rest of the cable
management in your setup is done well I
mean lots of cable sleeves are used to
hide the wires coming from your PC and
the monitors we also got a power strip
that's hooked up underneath the desk
it's a shame that the PC had to be on
the ground though it's a great looking
rig rocking these 6700 K and a 1080 from
Zil tank with custom sleep cables
honestly for up to me I would install a
wall shelf on the right side of your
setup and put the PC on top of it
cable management would also be a lot
easier since you can just run the wires
inside a cable sleeve straight down
against the corner behind your PC but
that would require a little extra work
speaking of cable management I would
mount that Seagate external drive
underneath the desk as well and bring it
closer to you like I did in my setup not
only will you clean up the surface of
your desk but it will also be closer to
you in case you need to use the two USB
ports on there as pass-through just make
sure to use these heavy duty velcro
straps instead of regular 3m tape one
thing I do like about the setup is the
neutral color scheme which means that he
can change up the colors depending on
his mood so it's not always the same
it's a nice multi-purpose setup Thank
You Justin for entering if you're
wondering what a 17 year old
cryptocurrency investor and student is
using as their set up well here you go
the purpose of the set up is gaming
investments and school he's using an
ultra wide monitor with 120 Hertz
refresh rate and gsync for gaming while
the other vertical monitor is used for
productivity most likely to look at
stock related info i love the unique
black purple and blue color scheme of
the setup he did a great job keeping it
consistent with the RGB lighting from
the keyboard and mouse also look at that
speaker placement he spaced out the
monitors just enough to make sure that
they are not blocked off nicely done
aside from the speaker's he's also using
the SteelSeries Siberia 800 headset the
cable management is really clean the
wires are tied together nicely and
capped off the ground using the net
underneath the desk the PC powering it
all has a 7600 K and an MSI GTX 1080
inside the 460 XK from Corsair
this is a really clean setup and I don't
have any complaints at all the only
thing I
recommend is maybe putting some more
stuff on that wall shelf because it
seems overkill just holding up that
letter cave I know it's the first letter
of your name but maybe add some extra
stuff on the sides to contribute to your
personality they could be anything maybe
stuff from your favorite hobby movie or
game I feel like it's just missing some
spice that's all other than that I love
this setup thank you clown for entering
last but not least we have Neil from the
Netherlands with an interesting type of
setup so he uses this for gaming but
mostly for productivity the mahogany
desk was purchased used but he sanded it
down and oiled it so looks new when he
even picked up matching speaker stands
for his Yamaha hs8 studio monitors
personally I'm not a fan of wood desks
because it always looks out of place
when compared to every other tech that's
on it but it seems to be blending in
well with Neil's set up for some reason
it could be due to these speaker stands
or the neutral white and black colours
I'm not really sure four monitors he's
using the 27-inch Acer for gaming while
the HP Pavilion is used mainly as a
second display also one of us we got the
white eagle z77 keyboard with the
logitech g502 mouse and both wires are
going across the desk alongside the
cloud 2 gaming headset wire which is a
big no-no I mean the wire is long enough
to be routed underneath the desk I'm not
really sure why he would take this
approach instead just pick up some cable
clips and route the cable underneath the
desk for a cleaner look my dude the rest
of the wire management looks great the
Signum is holding up the cables I have
no complaints other than that headset
wire the PC powering the set up looks
very clean with a black and red theme
custom sleeved cables and a 3d printed
destiny ghost to keep guard of his PC I
admire the originality of this setup not
only did he make the painting on the
wall but he also made that wallpaper on
his actual monitor it's a very nice
setup overall it just needs some minor
tweaks
Thank You Neil for entering so that is
it for this episode I've setup wars as
