again from Texas and I'm making this
video to let you guys know that we're
going to be doing a giveaway on the
iphone 6 and more details on that will
be available on our video this coming
Friday join the unboxing of the iphone 6
and 6 plus so make sure you guys stick
around for that we're also going to be
doing a giveaway on the Galaxy Note 4 so
once we get our hands on the no 4 will
give you guys more details on that so
make sure you guys stay tuned for that
as well i also want to talk about our
big red ultimate gaming pc project and
if you guys haven't seen part 1 of the
video there's a link to it up there but
basically we had to delayed for a few
weeks because of some complications and
also the iphone 6 and 6 plus event is
coming up soon so we have to push this
one to two weeks maximum so we can work
on that and then come back the current
status of it is i repainted the graphics
card and all the parts are basically
ready to go I just have to install the
graphics card back in the PC through the
benchmarks and present it to you guys so
expect the part 2 to come up possibly in
two to three weeks that's where the
statuses on big red speaking of the
iphone 6 and 6 plus event we are going
to be pumping out a lot of content per
day on our channel expect at least four
to five videos basically covering
everything on the iphone 6 we're going
to first do a drop test on it then we
can do a hammer test on it and after
that we can do camera test benchmarks
things like that we fully stocked our
fridge and we bought a lot of food here
so the next four or five days after the
release of the iphone 6 and 6 plus we're
going to be basically getting no sleep
i'm going to be working on the content
so if there's any type of video you guys
want to see on the iphone 6 and 6 plus
now is the time to let me know in the
comments section down below and you will
add that to our very long list of videos
to do so that's what's going to happen
starting Friday so that is it for the
video i hope you guys enjoyed it if you
have any questions at all that you want
to ask me and if you want to see any
type of coverage for the iphone 6 and 6
plus as i mentioned before you can leave
a comment down below and I will answer
