welcome to the continuation of the
what's in the box series if you guys
missed the first episode or the episode
before this one make sure to watch that
first because we had so many boxes that
we had to split it into two parts but
anyways this is the final video of that
so let us begin this video was sponsored
by Linkous it's an app that gives you
key insights of the world's best-selling
non-fiction books and I love the fact
that you can get through the main points
of a book by reading or listening to it
in like 15 minutes it's perfect for
people like me that just can't find
extra time to dedicate to sitting down
and reading a book you know it's easy to
spend 15 minutes on the internet
browsing through memes or Instagram
videos why not spend 15 minutes and
listen to a book that you are interested
in I really like how user-friendly the
app is and it gives you the option to
read or listen and I feel like blankest
is an awesome way of discovering new
books as well for example obvious I'll
know this but I'm actually getting
married this year so I've been looking
around and I came across this book
called the all-or-nothing married
Jennifer finishing it in just 15 minutes
I was slightly intrigued so now I'm
considering buying the full book like I
said earlier it's an awesome way to
discover new books and if you're like me
don't have the time to sit down and read
or listen to a book then you can use
blinkers and cut your time down to 15
minutes only they do have a special
offer for my subscribers out there and
the first 500 people to visit the link
in the description section or visit
blinkers comm slash Texas will receive a
20% off their membership cost and you
guys can also get an option to do a free
trial to test it out but anyways the
link will be down below let's get back
to the video
I stopped hit step on the top as usual
looks like you have some rap sticks oh
these are actually really nice these are
from g-scale these are the new sniper X
with the old army camouflage looking
style this will actually look nice and a
black and white build to be honest so
these are 16 gigs ddr4 36 hundred
megahertz some very fast RAM sticks
thank you so much G skill for sending
Xen hopefully I will put them to good
use in an upcoming build moving on to
the next box to get some boxes back here
as well speaking of RAM sticks so these
are the RAM sticks we're gonna be
actually using in his build holy crap is
our eight sticks so 32 grit 32 graves
grapes
32 gigs of ram is that these are the
courser dominators I think what's the
speed on these 32 hundred megahertz so
yeah these are the ones that he wants to
use is actually his RAM sticks that he
sent me from his previous build so this
is the only ones that wouldn't be using
and his new build that's coming from his
previous build that makes any sense yeah
here we go you got the power supply
ladies and gentlemen the corsair HX 850
this is going in his build at 30
self-explanatory nothing else talk about
its power supply uh-huh we've got
probably the rest of the props that we
ordered from Amazon so it's good these
others curtains we picked up to cover
the blinds to block out the lights of
course we got
these two per side and we got two
windows all right so we picked up some
colorful notebooks we got yellow we got
blue green and red these will make for
some really nice background props in our
videos all the cool people are doing it
I think we're cool - so we're gonna win
a clue this is actually the minimalistic
art of Siri there's a bunch of colorful
ones but these are actually one of the
best ones out there I'll leave a link
below if you guys want to check it out I
also picked up this interesting blue
base I don't know if I put flowers in it
but I just think it looks really cool
let me actually take this out of the box
I'll show you guys oh just wow this
looks trippy it's actually looks cooler
in person do you see that see the
reflection oh that looks really sick
that is pretty sick yeah probably
feeling like an RGB light in there or
something it will give off a really nice
glow effect so very very nice prop and
it comes in different colors we picked
up a turquoise one because I personally
like that color I'm just kidding guys
they're the vases here knows what that
was a bad joke we also got this moon
light this is actually Bob's peg he saw
this on Amazon he's like hey we should
pick this up because it looks cool what
the hell is this so apparently there's
glows I think it's RGB right it can glow
them different colors and it looks like
the moon so it got some pretty cool
textures on here I don't know we'll see
we'll find use for it somewhere on one
of the shelves maybe but we picked this
stuff as well
how comes it a wooden stand they're
supposed to put together yeah hey guys
this is all the experimental obviously
we don't know if all this is gonna work
this is gonna be there's gonna be a lot
of trial and error so there's some
things that gonna work there's some
things that are not gonna work we're
just gonna learn from that and then move
on eventually putting together the
perfect office for us in order to shoot
awesome videos so that's that's kinda
what the goal is this is clearly from
Asus judging by the Samsung sticker
obviously this is the motherboard I'm
gonna be putting in the subscriber build
you decided to go with the X 299 XE
gaming from Asus and this will
definitely provide the CPU with enough
juice and I pick up a CPU already I
don't watch the CPU yet but yeah anyways
let's move on
it's why I'm still missing a few obvious
maybe it's in this one I think the ones
I unboxed earlier or in the another
other episode were 140 millimeters I'll
actually the 120s so only using these as
well so I for some reason I thought of
course they're again send me to look at
products but yeah those are the fans I'm
gonna be using three more boxes to go
guys aha speaking of the GPU and the
processor you decided to go with a
single Titan XP this is the newer
version of the Pascal Titan XP if that
makes any sense this is the April
release so this is the faster Titan XP
in order to make it more simplified and
it's already open I think they're
supposed just supposed to come sealed
now but anyways that looks like a seal
brand new packin XP now the reason why I
told them to go with this instead of a
1080 Ti is because the prices are so
ridiculous for a 1080i that I told him
just to spend a few hundred dollars more
and get the XP instead literally the
price difference was like only $200 so
I'm like why not go for it the processor
he is going with you've got a brand new
i7 7800 X this is a six core processor
clocked at 3.5 gigahertz of course I
went overclocked it as much as I can and
last but not least did amazon send me
two motherboards by accident so yeah
that was a mistake it was my mistake I
actually ordered two so yeah one of them
is definitely this I think I know what
this is yes I can see it where is my
Kingdom Hearts fans out there this over
here ladies and gentlemen is a very
sharp blade and that is her table
Wow I did not expect this to be it's
actually pretty heavy
you can literally chop someone's neck
off with this but this is one of the key
blades from Kingdom Hearts I don't know
which one if it's the second or third
one yeah it looks really sick it's black
and red it's my color scheme I'm gonna
put this on one of the shelves that
we're gonna have in the office and it's
gonna it's gonna look really nice in the
background of some videos I did order
one more though or maybe it's in this
box let's check it out no joke it's not
it's not a toy box the rest of this
episode with this actually
beautiful the Keyblade has so many uses
I literally have no more space for the
boxes but anyway this one you can only
tell based on the Mickey Mouse emblem
over here ooh
the original Keyblade of Sora I think
this is both from the same company
judging by the quality Wow
the only thing I don't like is this part
it spins I don't know if that's I've
been reading the review is that this
part is it spins on all of them and it's
not supposed to because it's annoying
save me with this one it spins but it's
not as loose well yeah this is the other
Keyblade it's actually built really well
to be honest will stainless steel I'm
walking in with both of these things
everybody was
yeah pretty badass officially last but
not least we have this box I don't know
what this is so this is an RGB ring
light that's pretty much it you can
control the lights I think using your
smartphone and you can set it to any
color you want any effects any
brightness and it's gonna look really
nice again in the background of our
videos and that's the main purpose of
this so yeah it's actually yeah this is
the default mode as you can see it's
kind of just cycling through all the
colors until you hook it up with the app
and you can control it I think it looks
pretty sweet I don't know how much this
thing was things like don't need bucks
or something so it kind of a flimsy bill
to it
so hopefully this lasts but anyways with
that said I hope you guys enjoyed the
video if you did feel free to pass the
mic to show your support anything
mentioned in this video will be linked
below as always I love your faces and I
will see you in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
