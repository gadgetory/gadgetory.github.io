I see it a lot on my setup or show and
eventually I feel like everything is
gonna be RGB we have RGB faucets hell
even our toilets are becoming RGB but
you know what not everybody has 60
dollars to spend on a premium ruv
mousepad so I went on Amazon and looked
over a bunch of RGB mouse pads under $30
and I bought the ones with the most
reviews and the highest ratings with the
exception of the extended mouse pad
which was only two dollars over the
budget because of the size so I'm gonna
go over them until you guys what I like
and don't like from each one starting
with the blade hocks so I picked this up
for $27 and it's a regular-sized mouse
pad with a hard surface however it does
have a micro textured finish which is
nice I do prefer this texture over
aluminum because it's not too cold to
the touch and it doesn't hurt your hand
when dragging it around there are no
drivers for these mouse pads so you
control the lighting with the buttons on
the actual pad itself so the power
button does two things you can either
control the three-level brightness via
short press or turn off the lighting via
long press the other button controls the
lighting you get seven static colors one
RGB rainbow effect and one full sating
effect that goes through all seven
colors it's built really well and you
get four rubber feet on the bottom to
help keep it in place now the cable that
comes with the mousepad is braided and
it's the ugliest cable I have seen I
have no idea what the design team was
thinking going with this color for an
RGB mousepad something so small and dumb
like this can be a deal-breaker for some
people now there is a fix to this if the
cable messes up with your color scheme
I recommend positioning the mousepad
sideways and running the cable
underneath your keyboard or you can
always drill a hole in the desk and
route it that way if it bothers you that
much
the lighting on the mousepad isn't the
best either you can clearly see hot
spots throughout the main source of
light is directly in the center of each
side and you can kind of see the light
slowly fade towards the sides it's not
as noticeable if you keep the RGB
lighting effect on the lighting also
doesn't go all around the mousepad it
kind of stops near the top on both sides
one thing I like about the mousepad is
that
water resistant so if you spill any
liquid on it you can easily wipe it off
and for the most part cleaning it is
also very easy using a cloth just make
sure you use a lint roller afterwards to
get the fabric pieces off of it you know
if it wasn't for the obvious hot spots
on here not to mention this ugly green
braided cable I would have given it a
4.5 but this is a solid four out of five
for me next mousepad is from enhance and
this one costs $30.00 it has a smooth
aluminum surface there is no friction
like the last mousepad and because of
this it's really easy to slide the mouse
around making it great for those
fast-paced games now the mousepad does
have a design on the surface which also
lights up and this could be a
deal-breaker for some people who prefer
a cleaner look the pad is slightly
thinner than the previous one but it
doesn't really affect the build quality
I do like that they cover the entire
back with a rubber mat instead of just
putting rubber feet in the corners and
in the center the buttons are also right
on the mousepad itself now it does the
same thing like the previous one and it
has the exact same colors and effects
with hot spots in the same places as
well
unfortunately the lights don't get that
bright but if you're playing in low
lights most of the time then it
shouldn't matter one thing I do like
about this mousepad is the cable they
stuck with neutral colors but it's also
detachable
so you can use any other micro USB cable
out there it doesn't say if the mousepad
is water-resistant but if you spill
stuff on it you should be fine it's also
very easy to clean the surface because
it's aluminum the lighting might be weak
on here and the design might be a
turn-off a lot of people but other than
that there isn't much I dislike about
this I give it a solid 4 out of 5 next
up we have the cheapest argued mousepad
on the list coming in at just $20 and
for good reason the build quality is
surprisingly pretty good despite the
price now the surface is hard but it's
not aluminium it kinda has this texture
to it so it's not as smooth dragging the
mouse around it does have some rubber
feet in the back and the only way you
control the lighting is from the single
touch sensitive button you only get six
colors this time but you do get three
lighting effects the hot spots on this
mousepad are very bad and not only that
but the lighting is very weak and it's
hardly noticeable in a well-lit room
unless you're someone who's gaming at
night only this is probably a
deal-breaker for you the mousepad also
scratches easily so I would avoid
putting sharp things next to
it it is water-resistant and since the
surface is hard cleaning it should be
really easy you know they definitely cut
a lot of corners to bring the price down
to $20 and it definitely shows I give
this mousepad a solid two out of five
now this next mousepad from red dragon
plus the previous one to shame this one
goes for $22 but I feel like it does
most of the things right the build
quality is really good
we got rubber feet in the back and a
hard polymer surface with the texture
just like the previous mousepad however
this one doesn't bother my hand as much
when sliding the mouse around the cable
is detachable and braided which is great
and for the most part it's a
clean-looking mousepad with a
transparent logo in the corner what I
love about this mousepad is the lighting
I feel like red dragon does it the best
the hot spots aren't that noticeable and
the lighting is spread out more evenly
compared to the previous mouse pads they
also get really bright with four
different levels the downside is you
only get three solid color options
either red green or blue however you do
get breathing options for the rest of
the colors like purple teal and white
and finally you get two color
cycle effects the mousepad surface is
waterproof and it's easy to clean
however can get scratched because of the
texture so be careful with that I'm
pretty impressed for twenty dollars this
is a solid RGB Gaming Mouse I just wish
they had more solid color options other
than blue green and red all the other
colors are pulsating which makes no
sense but because of that I can't give
it a solid five however I can give it a
four point five so this next mousepad is
a straight copy of the enhanced mousepad
with two key differences first of all it
has a different design obviously and the
detachable cable has a female USB port
so you can actually hook up a mouse or a
headset to it your hard to be lighting
the surface material build quality I
mean everything else is practically
identical however this one cost one
dollar more I give this mousepad the
same rating as the other one at four out
of five
this third mousepad from enhanced are
for those who prefer a more minimalistic
design so the surface is pure aluminum
so it's always gonna be cold to the
touch so if you're someone who always
has warm or sweaty hands then this can
help cool you down the downside to this
mousepad is that it can scratch the
rubber feet underneath your mouse and it
doesn't really offer a smooth traction
compared to the
their surfaces also there are no buttons
on the mousepad so you can't control the
RGB lighting you only get the default
rainbow effect this is kind of a hit or
miss for some people out there depending
on what Mouse they're using and honestly
for $30 I kind of expected something
more especially for something that you
can't even control the RGB lighting on
last not least we have an extended soft
RGB mousepad due to the size it's gonna
cost you a few dollars more so I picked
this up for $32 the build quality is
really good the stitching on the sides
seemed to hold up very well so far
and it has a detachable braided cable I
don't like the placement of the cable
though I wish it was directly in the
center so that I can route the cable
with my keyboard it's also a short cable
so depending on where you put your PC it
might not reach it now the lighting is
pretty good I was obviously expecting
some hot spots due to the length of the
mousepad you can see that the corners
are the brightest areas but it does
spread evenly as it travels across the
sides it's nothing too distracting as
far as the lighting you get seven solid
color choices and three effects the one
downside is that you don't get to
control the brightness but they are very
bright even in a well-lit room you can
also turn off the lights if you want now
the surface just like any other cloth
mousepad gets dirty easily especially
from dead skin cells however they are
really easy to clean with some hot water
and soap I think there were two or three
large RGB mouse pads and this is the
only one with the most reviews and the
highest ratings so you guys are looking
for a large soft hard mousepad then this
is the best one you can get right now on
Amazon I give it a solid 4.5 and that
does it for my list of the best RGB
mouse pads on there $30 I drop a link to
everything mentioned in this video and
if you guys enjoyed it or if it was that
all helpful to you dropping a like would
be awesome and if you guys didn't like
it feel free of this like as well make
sure you guys are subscribed because I
do have the best budget gaming mice
under $20 coming up very soon as well as
