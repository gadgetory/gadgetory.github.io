welcome to setup wars episode 161 we
used to make your desk setup to get
featured on the channel if you guys want
to participate make sure to watch the
video linked down below but with that
said let the setup wars begin the
coarser one I forty and I sixty gaming
PC is incredibly fast with Intel's ninth
gen 8 core processor up to an RT X 20
atti graphics card and 32 gigabytes of
vengeance l PX RAM all packed inside a
compact bead blasted aluminum shell with
excellent cooling both CPU and GPU are
cooled using a patented assisted
convection liquid cooling system
achieving higher clock speeds lower
temperatures and minimal noise with
coursers advanced IQ software you can
configure the system's fan monitor
system performance and personalize your
lighting to learn more click the link
below kicking off the episode is a very
clean dual monitor setup from Dennis
that is used for only video editing
apparently he's rocking two beautiful
27-inch 4k monitors from LG that are
mounted on his custom made desk which is
being supported by two Alex drawers so
apparently it took him two years to
build this setup and the IKEA drawers
were an accidental purchase he meant to
grab white ones so that it matches the
theme of the setup at least that's what
he says in the notes if that was the
case why not go with the white version
of the view 27th hour the front panel is
black and it would match the other black
accents and the gear in his setup so in
a way the black drawers kind of worked
out because it gives us set up a nice
contrast
I think the pink LED accents from the
keyboard/mouse the wallpaper and even
the RGB strips give this setup a nice
glow and it makes it stand out more
instead of sticking to only two colors
he does have only one source of audio
which are the yamaha HS 5 speakers I
personally would have wrote it I'm a
little more towards the center but I
know why you did it that way so looks
seamless with the monitors no drilling
in the desk for the keyboard and mouse
which is fine but the rest of the cables
underneath the desk are managed well
thanks to the Signum rack and a few zip
ties
what I would do to clean up those wires
hanging down is by grouping them up
together with some velcro
and tying them with the modern amount
the PC pushing all those pixels is a
beast we got the risin 7 1700 at 3.8
gigahertz 32 gigs of RAM and a gigabyte
GTX 1080
I would have personally took advantage
of that awesome side panel and go with
some custom sleep cables but it's still
a clean looking PC and a clean set up
Thank You Dennis for starting up the
show speaking of clean setups we have
felix from germany and his triple
monitor gaming and editing setup
we have three 24-inch monitors hooked up
to the desk and he Logitech z3 33
speakers mounted against the wall it's
obvious that Felix wanted to go with a
minimalistic setup hence why he opted
for wireless peripherals also he does
have a glass top so he probably didn't
want to drill any holes through it aside
from the speakers he does use the JBL
headphones and we also got a rode NT USB
microphone which he stores in the shelf
right by him this setup definitely has a
lot of storage space and I like how he
added lighting in different areas in
order to spice it up otherwise it will
look pretty bland with all of that
furniture the PC partner setup
unfortunately is on the ground and it's
rocking the 3770k eight gigs of ram and
the gtx 1050 Ti I'm actually surprised
but the 1050 Ti is able to push those
three monitors I'm also kind of confused
with the fan layout in the case you have
the bottom fan as intake but the top-end
Raider is exhaust while you have two
additional fans in the top as exhaust as
well there isn't any positive airflow in
this case I personally would have
switched the fan on the radiator the
other way so that it pulls in fresh air
from outside other than the PC bill
that's a pretty solid setup Thank You
Felix for entering changing gears a bit
we got Nate and his insane battle
station that he uses for pretty much
everything from editing streaming
photography and of course gaming fun
little fact he actually calls the setup
a circuit breaker because he blew his
circuit breaker three times with this
setup damn okay I got to be the first
one to say that the desk does not go
with this setup unfortunately when you
first look at this setup your eyes are
drawn to all those awesome displays and
then the excitement kind of dies down as
you shift towards the bottom half I
would have easily thrown in a couple egg
back in tops and some Alex drawers as
support if
this was my setup but everyone has their
own preference there's actually a lot of
questionable things about this setup
which we will get into but first let's
check out the first setup so we got two
massive curved 55 inch TVs from Samsung
as overhead and below that we got three
27 inch monitors mounted against the
desk below dad he's rocking he Razer
BlackWidow chroma v2 and the abysus
mirror gaming mouse I'm assuming this
setup is the one he uses for editing
judging by the mixer and the audio gear
he's also using a DT 990 pros and the
Presonus speakers for monitoring audio
and actually has the same pair of
speakers for his other setup okay for
the first setup he's using a shure
microphone while the other setup has a
blue yeti and moving on to the other
setup is where you'll start to see some
questionable choices first off the
display setup is a little different we
have a curve 55 inch TV in the center
that's sandwiched by two ultra lights in
vertical mode and below that we have
another set of three 24-inch monitors
you know I'm trying to believe that this
guy works for NASA or CIA or something
well what could he possibly use all
those monitors for he's got to be spying
on some people with that I mean he's
even got maps and pictures of Earth
should we be worried anyway so here's
the interesting part so he's using a
Razer BlackWidow chroma and a $13
vo-tech Gaming Mouse I just find it odd
that he couldn't spend a little more and
buy a better Mouse this setup is the
most expensive out of the two after all
which he apparently uses for gaming and
then we got the PCs which are tucked
away in the corner now I'm not really
sure which PC is useful what's set up
because the specs are quite interesting
so check this out the PC tucked away in
the back is equipped with a thread
ripper 1950 x clocked at 4 gigahertz we
had 64 gigs of ram and 2 different GPUs
he's got a 1080 Ti up top and a gtx 1070
on the bottom from asus he's not able to
use them in sli so both GPUs are running
independently which makes sense since he
is outputting to 6 displays some things
that noticed about this build is the fan
layout so first off the PSTU is
upside-down and then we have the fans
mounted on top of the radiator instead
of underneath it so I'm kind of curious
as to why he went with this
configuration at first I thought this PC
was probably his editing rig judging by
the processor in
Ram but then I looked at the specs of
the PC that's in front of that one and
kind of got confused PC in the front has
here isin 7 1700 at 3.9 gigahertz we got
16 gigs of RAM and 2 different GPUs as
well you got a 1050 Ti and a GTX 770 the
first PC has a way better GPU so it's
kind of confusing which one he uses for
editing and which one uses for gaming I
would have used the first PC for gaming
since it has a GTX 1080 Ti but then
that's the PC that has the thread Ripper
and 64 gigs of ram so it's kind of
confusing the cables are hidden from
both setups thanks to the massive back
boards and that pretty much does it for
this command center I do see a lot of
potential in this setup but sadly it's
overshadowed by some poor choices
regardless thank you Nate for entering
now here is a beautiful custom-made
setup by Sasha from Germany it's used
mainly for gaming and photo editing and
I gotta say the first thing that caught
my attention isn't the backdrop it's
actually that wallpaper he has on the
entire wall it's pretty unique and I
feel like it ties in the setup perfectly
on that beautifully made backboard we
have a 35 inch monitor which is
sandwiched by two Berringer speakers and
I really like how he kept the surface
really clean and minimalistic he's only
got a keyboard and mouse which he
drilled a hole for and that's about it
everything else is mounted on the back
board sasha also did a great job keeping
everything symmetrical and the white on
red contrast was a great choice so it
looks like majority the cables are
routed through the wall and the cables
that need to be plugged into the PC are
wrapped into a spiral sleeve I gotta say
I do love how the PC has its own little
island off to the side
we got a rising 7 in here with 16 gigs
of ram and the Asus GTX 1070 Strix this
is a really creative and super clean
Harley Quinn setup I mean it has
personality symmetry purpose and
creativity I would say it's a seal of
approval worthy had the PC been mounted
on a wall shelf closer to this setup I
feel like that spiral cable coming out
of the setup takes points off but either
way it's a kick-ass setup Thank You
Sasha for entering grabbing up the
episode as Simon and his dual stacked
monitor setup so he's got a 29 inch
ultra white from LG on the bottom and a
27 inch up top you know some people have
risers in there
but don't really take advantage of it
which is why I like how Simon uses it in
this setup
he put a USB hub there and rattled his
cables underneath it personally I feel
like there's a lot going on here with
the cables drilling a hole in the desk
would really clean everything up since
you have an RGB mouse pad as well but I
get it now many people want a permanent
hole in their desks you can also mount
the USB hub underneath the desk using
some 3m tape if you really want to clean
up the surface a bit for audio is
rocking a pair of Mackie cr4 speakers
and these sennheiser hd25 headphones
which are resting on the speakers the
cables are decent underneath the desk he
did put an effort to mount the power
strips underneath the desk and he even
used some cable clips throughout the
cables but I feel like a Signum rack
would be ideal here I would also try and
velcro the cables above the setup and
route them underneath the desk so it's
not as visible the PC part of the setup
has the 2700 X at 4.1 gigahertz 16 gigs
of ram and the msi gtx 1060 I feel like
this setup is all over the place and can
be tidied up easily if the cables are
cleaned up a bit but it's a great start
nonetheless Thank You Simon for entering
and that wraps in this episode of setup
or is as always make sure you guys vote
in the comments below on who has the
best desk setup and announce the winners
on my Twitter and Instagram accounts
thank you guys so much for watching I
love your faces drop a like if you enjoy
the show and the dislike if you didn't
enjoy it and I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
