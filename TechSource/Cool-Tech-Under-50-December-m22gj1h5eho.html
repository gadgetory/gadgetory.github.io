welcome to another episode of cool tech
just in time for the holidays all the
products in this video are under $50 and
they actually make great gifts to kick
things off we have the gam des Hermes
mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse
combo or the G KC 1001 for short with a
solid rating on Amazon current price of
$40 and red mechanical switches it kind
of sounded like a great deal and after
using it for a week I've walked away
impressed let's start off with the main
product of this bundle the mechanical
keyboard when you pick it up the first
thing you notice is the exceptional
build quality everything is plastic but
it's well put together and there is no
rattling at all the USB cable is also
braided and gold-plated the red
mechanical switches are from a company
called TPC and they're very similar to
Cherry MX switches in fact when compared
to Cherry MX red switches I honestly
couldn't tell the difference
here's a quick audio snippet of me
typing with this keyboard there's not a
popular brand so they are a lot cheaper
and the savings are passed down to the
customer which I always like to see it
comes well equipped with 21 key rollover
two programmable macro keys and up to
six player profiles the keys are all
separately lit and LEDs are located
right above the switch but unfortunately
they only light up in red as they aren't
RGB but at this price point that was
expected the caps num and scroll lock
keys light up separately depending on if
the function is either on or off the
switches are responsive and activate
with only half key press it's actually
very similar to the cursor shape that
I'm using currently the rebo switch is
the mouse included is simple I mean
nothing too crazy in terms of features
or design it goes from 800 to 3500 dpi
so there's plenty of room for
customization there's also a dpi change
button that cycles through different
user program levels and something like
this is great for games like overwatch
since you can swap between characters
during the same match that will quire
different levels of sensitivity all the
buttons found on the mouse excluding a
left-click can be user mapped to
different functions through the software
and here's also where users can set
custom profiles and these profiles
include different cursors scroll and
double-click speeds
during poll rates and of course the LED
control the LEDs on this unlike the
keyboard are RGB but I found the color
to be poorly produced this is true only
when trying to change certain colors and
as you can see the mouse doesn't produce
them correctly
the cable is braided and overall the
mouse feels solid in the hand I would
say however it's on the smaller side so
you've got a bigger hand like me and
this could be annoying as a bundle
you're getting a good deal here for
about 40 bucks now if you're in the
market for a keyboard and mouse and are
into red switches and don't mind the
smaller mouse size that I would
definitely pick this up you won't be
able to find a better priced combo
anywhere especially for mechanical
keyboards the second item of the show is
the nub low s2 bluetooth headphones
starting with the build quality they do
feel solid and the stainless steel
headband gives a good amount of flex the
construction is mostly plastic but there
is some aluminum used as well I also
think they look stylish with its color
combination of orange black and
different shades of silver the
indication LED is also nicely placed in
the center of the right ear cup which is
a nice touch the white model looks just
as cool so in the box you get a microUSB
cable as well as a decently sized
auxilary cord look at one of the vise we
can see a micro USB port auxiliary port
as well as three multifunction buttons
the volume rockers allow you to change
the tracks when held down and the power
button also allows for play and pause
and also call control as far as comfort
is concerned these aren't going to be
the best as they are designed to go on
the ear instead of around it I mean I
can personally wear these for three
hours before they start getting
uncomfortable but this will vary on the
size of your head and of course how
sensitive you are in terms of audio
quality it's not bad they're obviously
not going to be amazing or blow you away
as they are budget bluetooth headphones
but if you're into heavy bass then
you'll like these they are very bass
heavy genres like rap and techno benefit
the most from the sound signature but
I've also noticed is that the sound has
zero distortion even at high volumes as
is with most bluetooth headphones plug
in the auxiliary port and the audio does
improve a bit with a tighter bass
response the noise isolation is also
pretty good considering it's an on-ear
design at about 70 percent volume any
outside noises inaudible or completely
muted but they do also leak quite a bit
of sound so if you're the type of person
that blasts your music all the time and
want people hearing what you're
listening to you might want to look
elsewhere
here's a quick audio sample from when
the headphones are both on and off the S
2's provide 14 hours of usage and 500
hours of standby time and at its current
price of $37 you can go wrong especially
for a gift our third item is again a
mouse but this one's a bit different the
Lenovo yoga mouse is the perfect
solution for mobile media and
professional setups and here's why but
offers a bunch of features in an
incredibly slim body so works with
Bluetooth and if your device isn't
Bluetooth ready you do get a dongle that
will pair your device automatically with
the yoga mouse what's unique about this
mouse is that it flips into two
different modes mouse and multimedia
when it's in Mouse mode it's easy to use
and surprisingly organ Amish we get a
touch-sensitive scroll wheel that works
really well with a max DPI of 1600
flipping it back to the flat side is
when the media controls light up and
give us a command over videos volume and
even presentations now although the
presentation mode is pretty useful in
classroom presentations or even meetings
I personally don't use that I do however
take it with me wherever I travel and I
always keep it in mouse mode you guys
can actually find this for around $30 on
Amazon next I'm gonna switch things up
and talk about organization now if you
guys watch the channel at all you will
know that organization and cable
management is a big part of who I am and
I'm always on a hunt for inexpensive yet
effective ways to improve your cable
management and that's where these cable
clips come in it's a simple solution to
one of my most annoying pet peeves which
are cables especially when I'm traveling
I don't like leaving behind anything
that might come in handy
when I'm away from home for an extended
period of time I usually carry a few
things in my tech bags from several
smartphones a tablet laptop earphones
headphones etc so with these new clips I
can actually organize all my cables into
a much smaller space as well as ensure
they won't get damaged or tangled the
best part is that they're extremely
cheap at about five dollars and they
make great gifts for clean freaks like
me in your
family and finally the last item on the
list is the gooseneck device holder now
most of you guys are probably wondering
what the hell is this doing on the list
but trust me guys this thing is actually
pretty cool
so the Stan is very easy to hook up to
your table just basically twist the
bottom to loosen or tighten it and it
does support tables with a max thickness
of 3 inches the clamp at the top is
spring-loaded so will adjust to fit your
phone or tablet going from 4 inches to
about 11 inches once the tablet or
smartphone is hooked up to the arm it's
very secure and doesn't wobble one bit
the head does rotate a full 360 and the
material used for the arm allows for
setup in any position I've used it in my
kitchen on my desk even while in bed to
watch a movie and I've got to say it's
worth getting it's currently going for
only $21 in Amazon and I might pick up a
few just to have around in the house so
that is if my cool tech for this month
as always if you guys enjoy these videos

support and once again you can find all
the products linked down below thank you
