once again and today we are back to look
at the new HTC One m8 that has recently
been launched HTC has big shoes to fill
here as the HTC one m7 was praised to be
one of the best smartphones of last year
and I'm here to unbox this and give you
guys my first impressions when I was
watching the conference I thought that
the m8 would feel very similar to its
older brother the m7 but while this one
right off the bat feels much better in
the hand but let's put this phone to the
side for now and look at what else comes
in the box included we have what seems
to be earphones and an eco-friendly
packaging the earphones are the basic
HTC models that came with last year's
model so nothing new here except the
addition of the HTC logo on the earbuds
which is a pretty nice touch if you're
someone with big ears you should be
covered here as HTC has also included
different sized rubber gels one thing I
don't like is the fact that I cannot
control my volume so if I'm listening to
music I have to manually adjust the
volume using the phone I mean if they
are going out of the way to include
earphones at least make it so that it
has the ability to control the volume
again that's just my opinion we also
have the USB cable which is pretty
standard and the power brick I
absolutely hate when manufacturers do
this they include a necessary giant
power brick I mean really it looks like
this can be used to power up a laptop
but anyways moving on to the left it
seems that we have some more stuff on
the top of this we have the sim and
microSD slot remover and as expected we
got some more paperwork here which
should be useful if you need something
to read in the bathroom for some reason
now to take a closer look at the phone
we will start with the left side of the
device and immediately you can see the
slight curvature that's going on here
and this side also has the nano SIM tray
making our way around the device we can
see that HTC has moved the earphone port
to the bottom of the device which is a
welcome change I strongly believe that
all headphone ports belong on the bottom
of every phone so I'm glad that they
decided to change that and my next to
that is the microUSB charging
or on the right side we have our volume
rocker and micro SD card slot and this
phone can actually accept up to a
whopping 128 gigabytes of space but I
mean who really needs that much space
especially with a 4 megapixel camera
located at the back producing low file
size pictures which kind of makes it
seem like it's overkill but next to the
main camera we've got the dual flash
that mimics Apple's true tone flash and
right above both of them we got a second
sensor that can measure distance
variants and let you do pretty cool
stuff with the camera but more on that
in a later video at the top of the
device we have our IR blaster which is
now the whole black strip at the top of
the phone and if I may add looks pretty
cool actually and also on the top we
have the awkwardly placed power button
at the front of the device we have our
two speakers named boom sound and hidden
cleverly underneath the top speaker
we've got our notification light which
looks pretty sweet something you might
not notice is the capacitive buttons
from the m7 and that's because HTC has
opted to include on-screen buttons on
the m8 which is welcomed as the
awkwardly placed m7 buns really did suck
so the m8 comes rocking a Snapdragon 801
running on a two point three gigahertz
quad-core processor with two gigs of RAM
it also has a 5-inch super lcd3 screen
with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 p and
protecting that is the gorilla glass 3
the curved angles really do provide a
comfortable experience something I could
not say about HTC m7 our gunmetal
variant looks really cool I mean the
pattern on the back here really makes
for an impressive design the phone also
comes in a matte silver variant as well
as in gold which is currently only
available in best buy stores coming from
a bigger phone like the note 3 this
phone does not feel big at all and
that's fine by me because I actually
preferred this size to that of the note
3 it's comfortable enough for me to hold
with one hand and I can safely say that
I didn't need to make much adjustments
to utilize the entire screen I was harsh
a little while ago on the power button
but I guess HTC can be forgiven as they
have included a way to wake up the
device right from the screen just double
tap and the phone will spring into life
the only downside to this is that
she wants you to make some sort of
movement before performing this action
so double tapping on the screen when the
phone's been laying on your table for a
good while will not grant you access to
this feature you can also swipe to the
left and right from the phone screen
when it is in sleep mode to either
access the home screen blinkfeed or
recently used applications but the same
limitation does exist where there has to
be some sort of movement beforehand the
phone feels really smooth and it's
actually the smoothest Android that I've
used by next to the Nexus 5 the icons
and UI elements look more flat this time
around with sent six which is a good
thing and jumping into the notification
panel we can see almost stock look with
an easy way to enter the quick settings
menu HTC is also allowing us to
rearrange the shortcuts which is pretty
cool there's nothing really new here in
the menu with the exception of the new
themes folder which allows for an easy
way to change the wallpaper and the
different accents around the UI we can
also see here that the phone is powered
by android 4.4 point to which is the
latest software holding the power button
we get access to kids mode which allows
for your phone UI to be transformed to
be used safely by your kids and
basically there are games and different
apps that are approved for kids and the
way to get in and out is by inputting
the year that you were born as a
password so basically if your kid is old
enough to know the year then they can
exit the safe mode themselves which is
kind of pointless if you ask me and to
end our first look at the HTC One and
mate we are going to take a look at
perhaps my favorite feature of this
phone the boom sound now this is truly
awesome and I believe that it is miles
away from the other audio offerings from
all the other phone manufacturers I'm
sure you won't get the full effect from
this recording but i thought i would
share it with you guys anyways
why you murder your mercy he turns his
back on the innocent believe me when I
say that the audio was a thousand times
better in person I was completely blown
away by the sound quality of the HTC m8
but you guys definitely have to check
that out by yourself but anyways that is
it for the unboxing and our first look
at the HTC One m8 smartphone we will be
doing a few more videos on this device
including a camera comparison so make
sure you guys stay tuned for that this
is that from texas and i will see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
