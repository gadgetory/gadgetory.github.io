contestants for this week we have Aiden
Allen novice Phil and Tom
congratulations for making it on the
show so the first PC comes from Aiden
and it's called hot runner which is a
water-cooled build rocking an i-5 60 502
GTX 770 s we also have 16 gigabytes of
RAM - 512 gigabyte of SSD space from
Samsung and everything is built inside
the very sexy and ext s340 case since
you guys hated me for removing the
benchmark scores on the last episode I'm
going to bring them back so hot runner
got an 11,000 208 starting it at the top
of this episode and this is actually
Aiden's first ever PC build and he was
on a tight budget which explains the
part choices and he stock PSU cables
nonetheless a very sexy white red and
black build Thank You Aidan for starting
it off Alan is next up with his PC named
the lost but god damn does this look
sexy a black and blue monster built
inside EK slabs magnum tower this beast
is running on a 59 30 k that's
overclocked to 4.2 and 3 Asus GTX 980
Strix gravis cards in SLI excellent work
with cable management this is actually
one of the cleanest builds I've ever
seen I especially like the custom
painted EVGA sli bridge with the blue
layer of film I just wish you would have
sent me pics of the PC while it was on
so that I can check out the LEDs but for
benchmarks the last scored twenty two
thousand eight twenty throwing it way up
there and pretty difficult to beat for
this episode Thank You Alan for entering
coming in at number 3 we have Novus a
white and red build inside another s340
case from NZXT so we have a 6700 K
overclock to four point six and the
Galaxy TX 980ti hall-of-fame graphics
card the RAM sticks also look really
nice and I've actually never heard of
them before but these are from jail or
Gayle and they are the super loose or
loose a ddr4 Ram sticks and they come
several different colors for benchmarks
we have a score of 16000 456 putting
nervous and second-place for this
episode a very clean and beautiful build
no doubt thanking Orbis for entering
next up is Phil and his black and red PC
inside the case labs SM a eight tower
it's rocking eight 4790k overclock to
4.5 and it's paired with two gtx 780 Ti
classified edition cards clearly he is a
fan of the Houston Texans and he has no
problem showing that off and his build
for benchmarks that scored a 16 494
barely beating at nervous and taking
second place for this episode Thank You
Phil for entering last but not least we
have Tom and transformer which is a
black and white build featuring a 6700 K
and 2 GTX 970 s and SLI
I swear AMD just doesn't get any love we
do have a few moderate parts like the
painted as leverage ramp sticks and even
the case was slightly modded in order to
fit two three sixty millimeter radiators
I also want to give you props for going
with white parts where applicable even
something minor like the white SATA
cables really contributes to a
good-looking PC unfortunately I didn't
get any benchmark scores so this PC is
disqualified and cannot win in this
episode but it's surely one of the
cleanest black and white builds I have
seen on the show
thank you Tom for entering this next PC
is out of this world and it wouldn't
make sense putting it as a contestant
because there simply isn't any
competition this episode special guest
is Corey with his incredible modded T ie
advanced fighter if you've been with the
channel for a while now then you've
heard of Corey many times it was
actually featured in PC Wars and setup
wars with his awesome mod of PC desk so
this entire case was custom made by him
just by using hand tools and no machines
he actually has an entire build log on
his channel so if you guys want to check
that out I'll drop a link to it down
below some seriously crazy stuff going
on there the build features a 6600 K and
Asus GTX 980 Strix and 16 gigs of ram
from a Vic sir the attention to detail
and craftsmanship truly is on another
level but I didn't expect anything less
from Corey as always it's a pleasure to
have you in my show thank you for
