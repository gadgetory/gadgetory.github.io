and welcome to my new series on the
channel actually it's kind of like a
miniseries and I'm calling it the desk
setup evolution we all know that setups
constantly evolve we're always moving
things around and upgrading so I figured
I would make a dedicated series on my
desk set up and kind of just see the
progress as time goes on so if you guys
are excited for this new series make
sure to leave a like to let me know to
continue and if you don't feel free to
dislike that's cool too by the way
everything mentioned in this video will
be linked down below so with that said
and done let's begin
so I recently changed a few things
around since last time and if you guys
missed my full desk setup tour I did a
while back then I'll drop a link to it
down below but in this episode I'm going
to only focus on the surface of the desk
and the things that I've changed this is
definitely a temporary setup as I am
moving in February of next year so I'm
trying not to add anything significant
that will require a lot of work to
remove and before you guys destroy me in
the comments section about the cable
management please keep in mind that this
setup was just recently put together an
episode two will focus mainly on the
cable management because I haven't even
started yet
so the first main difference is the desk
I no longer have the verts desk and
instead I'm using the apex desk which
was taken from the perfect desk setup
episode 2 simply because it's more
advanced it looks much better and has
cable management holes in the corners
the height is also adjustable and has
four separate memory modes which you can
manually set for any specific height I
still have my trusty Philips hue LED
strip that I've owned for over two years
now and it hasn't given me a single
problem since I just simply love the
fact that I can easily change the colors
on my smart phone without having to use
a remote I've also placed my iBUYPOWER
element PC on the Alex your unit off to
the right side instead of keeping it on
the desk I did do a few videos on it so
make sure to check it out if you guys
are interested but it's currently
rocking me 6,800 k-6 core processor 16
gigs of ram and the msi gtx 1080 gaming
X graphics card which was originally the
EVGA 1080 superclocked I've also updated
my previous ultrawide monitor to a much
larger one from LG as well I went for my
34 inch ultra wide to a 38 inch and let
me just tell you guys it's massive and I
love it I was very close and picking up
a second ultra wide but when this thing
came in it satisfied my pixel craving
once again I did review on it so check
it out if you're interested the keyboard
is still the same coarser slave RGB with
cherry MX red switches but I did swap my
mouse as you can see I actually reviewed
this mouse a few months back and
honestly
it wasn't a huge fan of it but I've been
wanting to go wireless for a very long
time and I was just very sick of the MX
master I wanted something better that
would also complement my setup so I
decided to give the Asus batha another
chance and so far I'm beginning to love
it it does come with a pretty
sweet-looking receiver which also serves
as a charging dock so whenever I need a
charge I busted out from behind the PC
and slap the mouse on it also if you
haven't already noticed I did really
hole in the desk to wrap the keyboard
wire through I still have the same
headphones from Audio Technica the m50
X's which are skin by D brand but this
time they are hanging from a different
stand this is the Silverstone aluminum
headphone stand and it does come in
silver as well personally though I think
that this is overpriced for what it does
but it's definitely a good-looking stand
in addition to my headphones I also
added new pair of speakers which I
constantly get asked about so these are
the edify DeLuna Eclipse speakers there
are two different versions of these the
regular and then the HD which is the one
I have on my desk I can't speak for the
regular ones but what I can tell you
about these speakers is that they are
freaking amazing the sound that comes
out of these are incredible in fact I
love these so much that I'm going to be
picking up another pair for the living
room TV they are bluetooth as well so I
have it hooked up to my PC via optical
cable and I also have them hooked up to
my smartphone via bluetooth last but not
least on my desk I still have my vodka
bottle that was imported from the UK and
it's also sitting on top of a game of
Thrones coaster for those of you that
don't know I am russian-armenian and we
are known for liking our vodka so I
figured having a bottle of hard to find
the black vodka would add some
personality to my set up against the
wall I have my most prized possession
the 100k silver play button which serves
as a symbol that no matter how big your
dream is it will become a reality
through hard work dedication and most
importantly passion I constantly look up
to it and realize how far I've come and
it gives me a boost of motivation every
single time how else do you guys think
I'm able to put up almost one video a
day that's how finally we have the
acoustic films against the wall that has
two purposes one it absorbs the sound
providing a much cleaner voice
or sound recording and to is simply just
looks cool and complements my setup but
that's pretty much it for the setup tour
I'm sure you guys can tell that I've
aimed more towards a minimalistic setup
while maintaining symmetry and if you
guys are excited for the cable
management episode be sure to hit that
like button so I was on Twitter the
other day and I reached out to you guys
and I asked you what audio book I should
download next and listen to it because I
just finished listening to the entire
Game of Thrones series not about you
guys but I've always had trouble reading
books even when I was younger in middle
school and high school especially every
time I would pick up a book and start
reading after a few minutes my mind
would just wander off and then next
thing you know I'm thinking about the
meaning of life that's one of the
reasons why I like audible so much
because someone actually reads the book
for you so it's kind of like listening
to a story no more putting on reading
glasses or squinting trying to read a
book at night just simply download the
audiobook on your smartphone or tablet
or even mp3 player and just start
listening if you don't already audible
has the largest selection of audio books
online and if you visit audible.com
slash tech stores you guys can get a
free audiobook with a 30-day trial so
anyways a lot of you guys recommended a
bunch of really good titles I think I'll
get fifty shades of gray a try I heard
it's a lot better if a woman is
narrating
in all seriousness though I took one of
the recommendations and I started
listening tonight where basically a
Holocaust survivor tells his side of the
story and what he has seen and been
through as a child I've only listened to
30 minutes out of the four hours but
it's a really interesting story and I
highly recommend you guys to download it
and give it a listen if you don't have
audible I urge you guys to at least give
it a try it is free for 30 days after
all and you guys do get a free audiobook
in fact you guys can download the book
I'm listening to which is called night
and let me know what you think about it
by dropping your feedback down below
also there's a specific book you guys
want me to try out next on audible let
me know by dropping a comment down below
so once again guys the website is
audible.com slash tech stores give it a
shot
it is free for 30-days and you do get
your first book for free hey guys so
much watching as always and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
