budget gaming setup from scratch it's
gonna cost around a thousand dollars and
that includes the cost of the PC this
little guy kicks ass in 1080p achieving
over 60fps and high settings for most
games make sure to check out the full
video link below if you guys want to see
the actual gameplay I'm gonna go over
all the parts and tell you guys why I
picked them and I'm gonna go over the
setup process including cable management
in case you guys want to pick up all the
parts and build yourself this exact same
setup now this first episode does really
great I will continue the series on the
channel and that is up to you guys of
course next episode maybe I can do
something a little cheaper maybe a $500
setup and yes that is possible or I
could do maybe an all-white themed setup
or even a laptop based setup I mean the
possibilities are endless and that is up
to you guys to vote in the comment
section oh yeah what that said welcome
to my new series setups from scratch
so this setup is perfect for anyone
that's on a tight budget but wants to
build themselves a nice clean
minimalistic gaming setup without any
compromises you can't have a great setup
without a foundation a solid desk is the
staple of any great setup and like most
desks there from Ikea this is the
extremely popular linman tabletop combo
they come in different colors and sizes
but for this setup I picked up the black
and brown option to fit the color scheme
and I went with the 47 inch option to
make sure it's long enough to fit
everything on top comfortably including
the PC I wanted a monitor that wouldn't
take up too much space on the desk but
also had to make sure it had the specs I
was looking for 844 Hertz refresh rate 3
millisecond response time on a curved VA
panel it's built pretty well but there
are some things I don't like about it
like the color accuracy for one it's not
meant for color sensitive work only
gaming also it doesn't have any height
adjustability you can only tilt the
screen so if you're too tall and a
monitor is too low you can always add a
riser underneath for cheap for
peripherals I didn't want to cheap out
so I went with a brand that I personally
love and use at home with my own setup I
picked up the corsair k70 luxe for $50
is a full-sized mechanical keyboard with
cherry MX red switches and a detachable
wrist rest
I love the dedicated multimedia buttons
near the top along with the scroll wheel
for the volume the k7e has always been
one of my favorite gaming keyboards to
date and it fits in the budget the mouse
I'm using is the new coarser harpoon
which is Wireless via bluetooth or the
provided dongle however you can make it
wired by connecting the cable I didn't
notice a slight delay in responsiveness
using the mouse wirelessly so if you're
playing FPS or RTS games where timing is
everything then I do recommend playing
wired the wireless option is great in
case you need a mouse on the go it has a
textured scroll wheel with a VPI button
up top and the small compact size and
the side grips makes it really easy to
lift and move around
I do have pretty large hands so this
mouse is kind of small for me as you
guys can see I can pretty much cover it
with my entire hand but for some reason
it didn't really bother me that much I
kind of got used to it after a while now
if you do have really large hands and
you just can't use small mice then I do
suggest picking up something bigger I
recommend checking out the Logitech g43
or the SteelSeries rival 310 which I
will link below now since everything is
pretty much RGB at this point I decided
to stick with the theme and throw in an
RGB mouse pad I want with the Corsair
Polaris that way I can control all the
lighting in one place using the IQ
software and it helps spice up the setup
now for audio I did throw in a set of
speakers as well as a gaming headset
enlarged like Z 200 speakers are great
for watching videos or listening to
music and the HyperX cloud stingers are
great for gaming the speaker is not only
look cool but they sound surprisingly
good for only 23 dollars
it packs a nice punch and a low-end and
the highs are really clear and crisp I
was really surprised at the sound
quality of these speakers for the price
the headset is also great built-in
microphone comfortable memory foam
cushions and it's compatible with Xbox
one ps4 pro and the Nintendo switch I
have it hanging on the anchor headphone
hangar which costs only 12 dollars and
it can support up to two headphones and
finally I added an RGB strip behind the
set up to complete the look it comes
with a remote to control the lighting
and since the setup doesn't have any
storage space I installed a small pencil
drawer underneath to store some items
like the remote for RGB strips cable for
the mouse and anything else that I might
need so that is pretty much everything
on the surface but what completes a set
up is cable management and organization
you can't just leave cables laying
around can you you're probably watching
this video with bad cable management
aren't you so the first thing I did was
drill a hole above my keyboard to route
the wire underneath of course this is
optional and it's not required if you do
not want to make a hole in your desk but
personally I prefer a cleaner surface
with less cables a lot of you guys
already know that in order to hide the
cable from the mouse pad
I rotated it sideways and ran the wire
underneath the keyboard and into the
hole that I drilled in the
desk you can do the same thing for your
mouse if it's wired just make sure to
leave enough slack from there I used
cable clips to keep the wires from
hanging down and I routed them neatly
towards the back into these these are
channel raceways and what's so great
about these individual ones instead of
the long one is that you can create
space between them to allow cables to
pass through and then tuck them away
from the opposite end I only have one
cable going down and plugging into the
wall outlet so the rest of the cables
are plugged into a power strip I picked
up from Amazon and I attached this
underneath the desk using some 3m tape
it's really important to use the right
tape otherwise they will fall off after
a few days you want something that is
heavy-duty to make sure it sticks
permanently using velcro straps helps
keep the wires behind the PC grouped up
nicely and it helps keep other cables
organized as well after all the cable
management I was able to transform this
into this the goal was to build a
minimalistic gaming setup without
breaking the bank and I think I
accomplished that but do let me know
what you guys think about this setup
feel free to leave any criticism or
feedback down below and let me know what
I should build for the next episode if I
were to continue I'm thinking about
doing a beautiful all-white minimalistic
setup let me know some give me some
ideas in the comment section guys I'll
drop a link to all the parts used in the
setup as well down below and if you guys
want me to continue the series consider
dropping a like and if you didn't that's
cool too feel free to drop a dislike and
give me your feedback and your honest
criticism as well thanks again for
watching guys I love your faces and I
will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
