guys it's a chrome tech toys and welcome
to setup wars episode 40 potato Edition
where I go over the worst setups that
I've received on setup wars now before
all of the hate and dislikes and
unsubscribing happens I tell you guys
that I'm doing this for fun and
everything I say in this video should
not be taken seriously I kinda want to
take a break from the usual setup wars
every single Monday and I kinda just
have a little fun so with that being
said for me being an asshole in this
episode the person with the worst setup
will receive a hundred bucks and there
will be a strawpoll link down below so
you guys can actually vote so yeah 100
bucks isn't that much but it's still
something towards their next purchase
half a set up boards begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below so any
thing I recommend in this episode will
be linked down below so your 5 unlucky
contestants for this week are Mason Chui
harab
Mitchell Rick and Abdul Ram man Abdul
Ram Abdul Ram Abdul
congratulations for making it to setup
wars potato Edition starting strong we
have Mason with a laptop setup we have
an HP stream 13 laptop a red dragon
keyboard and mouse with some Logitech
speakers on the sides we also have an
anchor USB hub on the desk and some
unsolved Rubik's cubes on the side now
no expert but I would think that the 2x2
rubik's cube should be very easy to
solve
no cable management is I mean you did
try to wrap it around one of the legs so
a for effort I seriously can't figure
out what's worse the actual setup or the
quality of the pictures I don't
recommending things are kind of
pointless for this episode due to budget
reasons obviously but I'm gonna do it
anyways a pencil tray can definitely
help keep some of that stuff off at the
desk in fact there's a perfect spot for
it down there a cable box is perfect to
keep most of those bulky cables in and
some velcro straps can definitely help
you tie the cables together other than
those uh Thank You Mason for being the
first victim this next set up from Shri
Hari takes the word budget into new
levels but at least he has a monitor for
crying out loud we have a 16 inch Acer
monitor which isn't even 1080p it's a
1366 by 768 the splay it looks like it's
on top of an amplifier of some sort we
also have a Logitech K 200 keyboard and
a terabyte optical mouse I was gonna
comment on how terrible the cable
management was but I'm still distracted
by the cloth on the table I mean this
bit has strawberries on it first and
foremost get rid of that amplifier or
whatever the hell that is under your
monitor and get a very simple and clean
monitor riser you can also cut holes in
that beautiful tablecloth and run your
wires underneath it towards the back of
your setup I'm sure your parents won't
mind a few holes in that I also strongly
recommend placing the power strip on the
table since that can be
as fire hazard and picking up a cable
box can definitely make sure that no one
sees the perish bit I would also remove
all the cables and work on a better
wiring job I see potential of running
them alongside one or even both of the
legs using velcro straps and cable clips
an actual mousepad would be nice and
maybe a real phone stand instead of that
self-made piece of crap you call a phone
stand I see potential I'm not gonna lie
thank you Shree for entering alright
mochilas next up how much worse can it
really get alright so we have two all
right so we have two 23 inch gateway
monitors are you serious guys he has the
same exact monitors oh my god you'll
stop it Logitech G 510 s keyboard and a
red dragon M 901 Mouse on top of a large
coaster hanging from the monitor is the
total beach air force px 22 headset and
also we have a blue snowball mic without
a tripod resting on top cable management
is surprisingly the best in this episode
so far so congrats on that although it
can definitely be improved with maybe
melting the power strip on the roof of
the desk and using some 3m tape but I
see that you at least tried to bring
them together however the cable
management in the PC is pretty bad I
mean you have all that space in there
that's going to waste
and finally the monitors what in God's
name I know you don't use them like that
it's just not practical I would
recommend a headphone hangar but you
have no place for them but what I do
recommend if you want to use both of the
monitors the right way is a wooden plank
that extends off the table that way you
have some space to put the monitors
side-by-side not the worst setup I have
seen fix some of that stuff and the
setup would be just okay then you find
King Abdul is next up with another
laptop set up Christ we have a Samsung
core i3 laptop a goldfinch keyboard and
HP mouse with a pair of HP speakers I
think that blue Yeti microphone is the
most expensive piece of tech you have on
that table of yours
at first I thought I was looking at the
back of your desk but no it's the front
not sure why there are a bunch of cables
hanging around but if possible I would
get rid of those and maybe route them in
the back instead I like the convenience
of the parish clip being on the desk but
as a safety measure I would put it on
the ground
I do see that you have a drawer so maybe
install a pencil drawer inside there
with some 3m tape underneath at least
this way you can keep most of the stuff
in there without crapping the desk
surface but yeah that's all I got
thank you a bill for entering so that's
for this episode of setup pours what
there's more last but certainly not
least we have Rick with another laptop
setup so it doesn't look like we have
much on here a 13-inch MacBook Air
laptop a row cat mouse and a pair of
jabber areevo wireless headphones
hanging from an Ikea lamp
cable management is oh oh wow okay Caleb
adjoint is pretty good actually
okay um I think that's it not really
sure why I put this setup in here
sadly it's the best setup in this
episode oh I know I put this in here I
bet you my entire channel that the total
cost of that MacBook is not only way
more than the 350 PC that I built
recently but it will also be
outperformed by the PC as well and you
would still have extra money to buy
monitor and other gear that's why I put
that in this episode so that's for this
episode of setup wars I hope you are
still subscribed to the channel if you
are there is a strap holding down below
as I promised the worst set up will
receive a hundred bucks so yeah that's
basically it a winner or loser I should
say will be announced on my Twitter and
Instagram account so follow me there if
you guys want to know who lost that's it
thank you guys so much if you guys enjoy
the potato addition I guess let me know
by leaving a like I probably won't do
these for another probably up for a long
time but anyways let me know drop your
comments down below and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
