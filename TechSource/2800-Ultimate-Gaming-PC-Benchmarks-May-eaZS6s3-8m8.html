and welcome to the PC build for the
month of May this is black snow the
$2,800 gaming PC winning two EVGA gtx
980ti is in sli and before everyone
comments about why i didn't wait for the
gtx 1080 to do a build the simple answer
is that this was planned for months and
i didn't want to wait for the cars to
come out because well then there
wouldn't be a build for this month
rest assured though there will be plenty
of 1080 and 1070 builds in the next few
months on the channel so if you guys are
new make sure you subscribe because you
don't want to miss out aside from the
two gtx 980ti is I also packed in the i7
6700k and overclocked it to four point
five gigahertz using the Asus z170
deluxe motherboard black snow also has
32 gigabytes of Dominator Platinum's and
h100 Ivy to CPU cooler and white LED
fans from Corsair as well juicing up
this entire build as the RM 750 X power
supply and everything is packed inside
the gorgeous Corsair 400 CK's one of the
things absolutely love about this tower
is the fact that you can easily snap
open the side panel and the amount of
space it provides for a push and pull
configuration the NZXT s340 or even h4
40 cases don't have this much space and
they look pretty similar some custom
mods include sleeved cables from my guys
at v1 Tech which I'll drop a link below
if anyone's interested and white
magnetic LEDs from BitFenix I stopped
using adhesive strips a while back and
switched completely over to magnetic
strips just because of how stupid easy
it is to install I also don't have to
worry about it falling off for the
standard fire strike benchmarks black
snow scored a 20,000 254 and for the
fire strike ultra it scored a 78 22
moving on to the heaven benchmarks we
have an average frame count of one sixty
eight point three for the 1080p version
fully maxed out settings
whereas I got an FPS counter forty six
point three when we pumped up the
resolution to 4k similar results were
found on the Metro last light benchmark
100 8.69 average FPS fully maxed out
settings and 45 point 42 FPS count on 4k
on GTA 5 black snow got an average
of 109 point 59 for the 1080p benchmark
and average frames of 37 point 84 for 4k
which isn't bad at all considering that
the settings were completely maxed out
in fact lowering msaa down two times
four will give you around 30% more fps
and 4k the final two games I tested are
rise of the Tomb Raider showing healthy
numbers and 1080p with max settings and
somewhere close to 40 after bumping it
up to 4k finally I had to test out our
survival to see how embarrassing the
frames are running to 980 T is and it
was a complete devastation trying to run
it in 4k with average frames less than
20 which wasn't playable so I'm only
gonna be showing you guys 1080p results
instead on high settings I managed to
crank out an average 47 frames per
second and only 27 point 5 fps when I
cranked it up to epic which is the
highest setting in the game but that
pretty much wraps up the video thank you
guys so much for watching if you enjoyed
my monthly PC builds make sure to hit
that like button to show your support as
always I have a bunch of gtx 1080 and
1070 builds coming up in the next few
weeks and even months so make sure you
guys stick around they have so much
watching and i'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
