I've teamed up with some really talented
youtubers to bring you a very special
video so have you guys ever wondered
what pair of headphones your favorite
tech youtuber wears behind the camera
well it's kind of what this video is
about so without wasting any more time
let's dive right in
hey what is up guys I'm cabby HD here
and one of my favorite pair of
headphones is the audio technica ath
m50x a newer version of the m50 is that
i've used for years and one of the
reasons these are so good is they're not
just one specific purpose they're really
good all-around headphones so while they
are reference monitors by name they're
not a perfectly flat sound they do have
a little bit of color a little bit of
low end and a little bit of spice to it
so it does sound great for listening to
music for traveling for casual use but
at the same time I'm so familiar with
the sound and it is pretty balanced and
you can use it for editing so if you
edit video or if you edit audio this is
something you can definitely use for
that too and on top of that they're
comfortable enough to wear for multiple
hours on end they got a little bunch of
padding they look pretty good
they're pretty portable they fold so
there's a lot going for these as an
all-around pair of headphones to pick up
for the price so kind of hard not to
recommend so my favorite headphones are
the Grado SR ates
so the headphones that use as often as I
can now the problem with them and one of
the big advantages is that they are open
back so that means that on one hand you
get a really nice sound stage they sound
awesome especially considering that
there are a hundred dollars on the
downside everyone around you can hear
exactly what you're listening to one
thing I really like is the retro look
these look straight of the 80s now while
they might not be the most comfortable
headphones in the world $400 you are not
going to find better sounding headphones
than this well if you do just let me
know what's up guys Traverse consumer
and my pick has to be the Sony xb9 50 bt
these are a pair of bluetooth headphones
with a pretty large but super
comfortable design the earcup cushions
feel like giant marshmallows so you can
use them for long listening sessions and
they provide a great seal if you're
looking for some passive noise canceling
now since these are bluetooth that means
you're getting access to a ton of
controls on the side of the ear cups so
you can control your audio without
having to touch your device now how do
they sound pretty amazing these offer
some great overall sound quality but if
you
into bass these are made especially for
that and if you think you're really
about that life then there's an insane
bass boost button that I highly suggest
trying out one of my all-time favorite
pairs of headphones that I've owned now
for over three years arm I mean issue of
pro 40's and I find myself coming back
to these koi often because of the fact
they are extremely versatile doesn't
matter if you're really into music or
you're a content creator or a producer
the wide versatility of these headphones
are going to make them perfect for
pretty much any scenario in any genre of
music they don't require a lot of power
to operate so you can use them on your
mobile devices or you can easily hook
these up to a sound board to get
extremely accurate audio which makes
them also perfect for monitor situations
and content creation with the extremely
wide frequency reproduction range of
these that makes them perfect for all
genres whether it be heavy bass or high
clarity and acoustics and those are just
a few of the many reasons why the pro
40s from you Nishio are one of my go-to
headphones hello everyone I'm Dimitri
with Hardware Canucks and my daily
headphone driver for the past year or so
have been the San Heiser HD 800 I am a
bit of a son Heiser nut and also really
appreciate open-back headphones because
I need to feel like I'm in the same
audio environment as the audio source
itself plus they are incredibly
comfortable so I never feel like I have
headphones on they also use very unique
audio drivers that have fantastic
control through the entire frequency
range like these don't distort at all
even at super loud volumes they're not
bass heavy not particularly hot on the
treble but deliver natural
representation so I can edit videos with
these no problem for reference audio and
because of the insanely large soundstage
these produce they are also my main
gaming pair with a mod mic attachment
they are a luxury pair but they're also
for life thanks Edgar for having me on I
hope you enjoyed what's up edie and tech
source fans my name's Kyle from
awesomesauce network you can go ahead
and check out my channel on youtube at
awesome sauce Network I do tech videos
and stuff but these are my headphones of
choice these are the beyerdynamic ooh
the biodynamic dt 880 pros and I've had
these things since 2012 and I've gone
through a lot of other headphones I've
encountered a lot of different other
headphone options since then and
still keep going back to these because
they just sound so good and they're
comfortable for hours on end they've got
faux leather it's got a faux leather
headband and the velour earpads are
super comfy also they just sound amazing
I use them for editing and gaming as
well
they're semi open back design so you get
a really nice soundstage which gives you
really good positional audio in games
and just these are pro level headphones
for for like studio recording and things
like that so when I'm video editing its
they're just super clean and I can hear
every little detail in the audio which
is really important to me so highly
recommend DTA 80 pros back to whoever's
going to be talking after me what's up
guys my name is Paul my youtube channel
is Paul's hardware and thank you very
much edie for having me on the show my
daily driver headphones are these AKG K
553 pros list price on them is about
$200 although you can get them cheaper
130 to 150 I got them through mass drop
where they were significantly reduced in
price I like them because they have a
nice level sound reproduction they don't
add a lot although they're a little bit
heavy on the bass side they're also very
comfortable they have leather ik ear
cups I've considered swapping those up
because they can get a little bit warm
in the summer months but overall they're
not too bad at all
sound reproduction as mentioned is
fabulous and even though they are close
design so I can't hear much it's going
on outside the soundstage that I get is
still fairly open which I definitely
appreciate so k 553 pros from AKG and I
give them thumbs up what's going on guys
my name is matt from ms tack and my
headphones of choice are the meze 99
classics and they're not that well known
but the rather unique in that they
combined real wood with gold accents to
produce a classy look overall the ear
cups are super soft right out of the box
and the headband uses this suspension
system that allows the headphones to
automatically adjust to your head size
when you put them on and in terms of
sound quality they are absolutely
phenomenal but that's to be expected
from a pair of headphones costing close
to $300 not only are they great for
everyday tasks like watching videos and
listening to music but they're also
killer for editing sound especially for
videos like these because the mids and
highs are extremely crisp that I can
hear every single detail in my voice
anyway I think it add for having me in
this video and I'll see you guys later
what's up guys I'm random Frank P and I
say the headphones at IU
most often for gaming our my AKG K 7x X
headphones for mass drop I prefer these
because they are extremely lightweight
and that self adjustable headband feels
great on my head without applying any
pressure the large 55 millimeter drivers
on the inside are coupled with very soft
memory foam velour earpads and the open
back design is just awesome for gaming
has a very large soundstage it makes you
feel extremely immersed and like I'm in
the middle of the battlefield whenever I
use these have a nice long detachable
breakaway cable in case anything happens
the headphones won't be damaged and for
the price I think these are
one-of-a-kind and provides some of the
best sound quality which is why they are
my go-to pair of headphones for gaming
hey guys Asha's so the pair of cans that
I'm most intimate with are the bare
dynamic DT 770 pros now your tents TVs
all over the place and that's for a very
good reason for the price they offer a
lot of appealing characteristics many
have fallen in love with now sound is a
very very subjective thing it feels like
it's the one element of people going to
argue and argue about but it's for good
reason there is no pure objectivity in
audio now when I originally bought these
I ended up hating them I thought they
were terribly harsh on the top end
however this is pretty much basically
down to me not being used to the sound
stage it was also pretty crazy because I
realized that some of the stuff that
I've been listening to hadn't really
been mastered properly it was completely
accentuated on the 770 pros
anyway I truly do love these now and
whilst they aren't the most neutral cans
if you want a neutral port look at the
880 pros the 770's are balanced overall
gives a well-thought-out sound and my
versions the 250 ohm ones only get
better with a proper amp you'd be
surprised just to see how much changes
and to finish it off they're built
really well they have a cushion headband
which is removable and below ear cups on
what are closed back headphones done
dusted solid choice and finally the
headphones that I use are the m50x is
but I'm sure most of you guys already
know that mark has pretty much nailed
all the same reasons why I use these but
as you can see mine look a little
different despite what some people say
about the comfort level of these
headphones I can't wear them for over an
hour because they start to hurt my ears
which is why I replaced the stock ear
cups with these brain waves memory foam
cups the difference is night and day the
only downside is that there is a little
more distance between the headphones and
your ears and what that means is that
you don't get that really snug tight
seal like before and you get this tinny
sound to be honest the trade-off was
well worth it but I go to drop links to
the cushions down below if anyone wants
to check it out
