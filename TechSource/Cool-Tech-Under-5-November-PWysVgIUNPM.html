Texas and welcome to cool tech under
five dollars for the month of November
if you guys are new to the series feel
free to check out my previous cool tech
videos I did on a channel you won't
regret it
but I'll leave a playlist link for you
guys down below without wasting any more
time let's begin
so before I begin I have something
really awesome to share with you guys
that one of my viewers actually reached
out to me and said if I could feature it
it's an iPhone app called nice shopping
imagine trying out a product before
buying it we rely heavily on reading
product reviews and even watching videos
like these before we buy a product and
once it arrives it doesn't meet our
expectations then you're stuck with
requesting our amazed printing out
labels just to send it back and then
sometimes the companies don't even offer
a refund nice is basically like shopping
at a store but online meaning you guys
actually get to try the product yourself
before you buy it if you decide to keep
it you pay for it if not they make the
return process seamless by sending you a
prepaid label and you guys can send it
back with no questions asked it's that
easy
last week I demoed a hoverboard on my
cool tech series and you guys can
actually request one using the app and
try it out at your home before you buy
it you guys can also find other cool
stuff like gaming headsets drones AVR
and basically anything you can imagine
I'd be excited about you can try all of
these and even more for free up front at
no cost the only thing is nice as an
invite-only system and for my
subscribers I have a special invite code
you guys can find over here on the video
and also link it down below for you guys
there is a limited amount of signups so
make sure you guys get in while you
still can
there's really nothing to lose it's a
free app after all so starting off the
list is this folding knife by Sinclair
it's basically a knife in the form of a
credit card and you can fold it into a
working and fully functioning knife
which is extremely sharp I would say
it's about the size of one and a half
credit card so it fits right inside my
wallet or if you have a wallet phone
case that works just as well
the folding knife also comes with a lock
option in case it doesn't come loose and
end up stabbing you while walking next
up is a tablet for a monkey do meet
Felix you're dedicated tablet holder the
arms stretch up to ten point five inches
so it can pretty much hold up any tablet
in vertical mode and even some in
landscape mode given that the tablet is
under 10.5 inches of course it has
rubber feet on the back which will help
keep the stand from sliding on hard
surfaces next up is a plasma ball that
just looks cool and will definitely add
some spice to any desk setup you can
power it using batteries or plug it
straight into the wall and it looks
especially dope when the lights are
it did state that this was 50% off at
the time of purchase so I'm not sure how
long the deal will last next up on the
list is a flexible silicon keyboard for
laptops notebooks or anything else with
a USB port it's perfect for travel since
you can roll it up and pack it away now
if you're thinking about typing an essay
on this keyboard think again I would
definitely not recommend it since the
keys are extremely small and too close
together this is more of a backup
keyboard than anything but it's still
cool and it's under five bucks which is
why I featured it in this video I had no
idea that you can buy a gaming mouse for
under five dollars and I immediately
questioned the quality when I came
across this it turns out that this mouse
is a complete ripoff of the have't Mouse
I featured on my top five mice under 25
and I can't even tell the difference
between the two it features six buttons
a dpi switch up top and a 2000 VPI
sensor needless to say it works well
while gaming gets responsive it slides
well don't really have any complaints
honestly for only 5 bucks it's really
hard to beat and what's a mouse without
a mousepad these two are under 5 bucks
and strangely represent the msi dragon
logo although neither of them are from
msi this next item is a two-in-one cable
now I featured something like this a few
times before but at a higher price tag
this one is MFI certified which means
that it's made for iPhones you get a
micro USB cable once you remove the top
and a lightning cable when you put it
back on last but not least we have a
camera lens mug which looks like a
replica of the Canon lens this one is
made out of old plastic and honestly I'm
not too happy with the quality of it
there's a piece on the cup that's
peeling off and overall just feels
pretty flimsy if you guys have an extra
two bucks to spare I would definitely go
with a more premium lens mug this one is
not only made with better materials but
you actually get stainless steel
insulation with a twist off cap there's
also a lid on the actual cap that you
can open and close so that's it for the
video if you guys enjoyed it and want me
to continue doing these cool tech videos
every single month make sure to hit that
like button to show your support also
don't forget to try out nice the invite
code is down below honestly guys it's an
awesome app give it a try it's
completely free and thanks again for
watching I will see you in the next
