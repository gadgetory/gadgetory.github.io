wars instructions and requirements video
but before I get into the good stuff I
want to talk about the prizes real quick
out of the five contestants the setup
with the lowest amount of votes gets
twenty five dollars in cash whereas the
winner moves on to the final round at
the end of every year I host the best
desk setups of the year where the twelve
finalists compete head-to-head to win
the ultimate prize first place winner
gets 300 bucks in cash a custom-made
black hand signed by me and three Texas
t-shirts or merchandise second place
winner gets a hundred dollars and a
custom-made plaque and one techstars
t-shirt while third place gets fifty
dollars and one Texas t-shirt
additionally if you receive a set of
wars seal of approval you automatically
earn $100 a custom-made plaque and one
Texas t-shirt the seal is extremely
difficult to receive and I think I only
give it to like three people the entire
time but to keep it short and simple if
the setup has a WOW factor that really
impresses me then I give them the seal
