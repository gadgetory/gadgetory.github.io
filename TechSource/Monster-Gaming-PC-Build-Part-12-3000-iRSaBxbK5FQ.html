we're going to build a monster gaming PC
with all these parts that you see here
we are going to unbox each one so let's
get started all right first off the bag
we got our motherboard from Asus we got
our Tower from fractal design we got our
vengeance Ram sticks a harddrive and a
JDI CPU cooler a Windows 7 operating
system and moving on to the other side
we have our Intel CPU we have our Asus
CD drive 2 SSDs from Samsung and HX 850
power supply GeForce GTX 780 graphics
card in two silent fans so this is my
tower to define our four by fractal
design and I chose this because of its
small size and because it is a tower
specifically used for a silent PC build
the r4 comes pre fitted with dance noise
absorbing material on the front top and
side panels to absorb noise and also
features a module vent panel which
prevents noise from escaping unused fan
vents when silence is required you can
add an additional fan on the front here
if you require more cooling and even
comes in an integrated fan controller
that's easily accessible and allows you
to manage up to three fans of your
choosing
you've got your power button USB ports
and your media jacks on top of the tower
making it very simple to access along
with two vents near the back if you
decide to add fans for more cooling on
the right side of the case you can see
that the wire management is super clean
inside the tower you'll find the box
with all necessary screws needed for
installation let's move on to the other
side so we can take a look inside the
chassis even though it looks like a
small Tower it will fit all the parts
that you saw earlier with still room to
spare the driver cages are also
removable if more spaces are needed in
the future as well I prefer more smaller
case simply because it's easier to carry
and it takes up a lot less space than a
full Tower the back of the case is
pretty standard the power supply spot is
located on the bottom and you have seven
rolls of space in case you want to add
multiple graphics cards or other parts
on the bottom of the case you have four
rubber legs and a removable tray to make
cleaning a lot easier moving on to the
motherboard I went with the asus is
newest model the x79 deluxe motherboard
because it offers dual Intel
dodging processes with four-way
optimization you can see for the
overclock your processors with a click
of a button using their software
it also offers top-up performance
efficiency digital power system cooling
and it comes with a built-in Wi-Fi
network and USB 3.0 ports inside the box
you have the standard parts I really
like how the i/o shield adds a soft
cushion on the inside so it does not
scratch the motherboard by accident you
also have your manual driver CD a bunch
of optional cables and this is the
device you need to connect to the
internet wirelessly this motherboard
also has eight memory slots three PCI
slots and also a much friendlier and
more intuitive bios which allows you to
use your mouse making it really easy and
convenient to navigate
moving on to the processor I've been an
AMD guy for the longest time because
it's more affordable that Intel but I
was never satisfied with it playing
games or even editing so I decided to
try something new and go with the Intel
Core i7 I went with this specific model
because not only it has amazing reviews
it also has six scores with 3.2 vigorous
stock which can be easily overclocked to
4.5 gigahertz with stable use and it's a
huge benefit for multitasking video
editing and especially gaming
it's a no-brainer that you have to have
at least one SSD in your computer for
faster reading and writing speeds
I love loading games faster than
everyone else opening up large programs
quickly and even booting up my PC in
less than 10 seconds from just one SSD
so I decided to make it even faster by
adding one more moving right along
these were optional fans that I brought
for my build because the ones that come
with the tower are not as quiet as I
want if you guys want the best most
silent and ugliest fans the Noctua is
the way to go the reviews for these fans
are insane and they offer the quietest
fans in the market I'm not really sure
who designed this for the most hideous
color choices but aside from the color
combinations
these fans are worth every penny when
you do purchase these fans they do come
with optional rubber screws that you can
use in places and steel screws and they
are used to prevent the fans from
vibrating and they do come with a bunch
of extensions in case the stock cables
are too short so there's nothing fancy
here I went with 32 gigabytes of RAM
from Corsair Vengeance with eight
gigabytes and a speed of 1866 megahertz
each that makes editing videos and using
programs that use a lot of memory much
faster I personally think 32 was an
overkill but I got it anyways because
extra space is always great to have for
the video card I went with an EVGA
geforce gtx 780 simply because it has
titan performance at a lower cost and
has three gigabytes of memory with a
memory interface of 384 bits also the
maximum resolution they can support is
4096 by 2160 which is insane seeing as a
36 inch monitor with that resolution
goes for around $36,000
it also asks 23:04 CUDA cores with a
base clock of 967 megahertz it weighs 3
pounds and its length is 12 point 88
inches and like most graphics cards it
does have both DVI ports an HDMI port
along with a DisplayPort on its side
this is definitely one of the best video
cards you can currently buy you've got
to have a CPU cooler especially if
you're going with Excel and PC build in
a small Tower the H ATI comes with two
stock fans but I prefer using the silent
ones that I purchased it also comes with
three metal housing brackets that are
specific to the type of processor you
have and it's used to mount the end of
the CPU cooler to the CPU this also
connects to a usb on the motherboard
which in return allows you to monitor
the temperature and change the
performance via software to meet your
needs a CPU cooler is not only used to
cool the CPU and prevent it from
overheating but it's also used to
improve its performance I went with an
HX 850 power supply which was way more
than I needed
I got it simply to prepare for possible
future upgrades and because it has a
silent cooling fan the 850 is 80 plus
gold certified which means it provides
high power efficiency of at least 87% at
any load between 20 to 100% seeing your
money on your electrical bill reducing
heat in your computer and pulling its
life this power supply also has quiet
operation on low loads most power
supplies are fans that spin regardless
if you're playing games or surfing the
web but the HX series power supplies
generate less seats so they require less
cooling and the thermally controlled fan
only spins when it's needed I had to go
Windows 7 because windows 8 sux I
accidentally bought the home premium
instead of the Professional which is
needed to support my 32 gigabytes of ram
home premium only supports up to 16 gigs
I went with a one terabyte Western
Digital caviar black hard drive because
I didn't want to stuff my SSDs with
useless files cramming up at space so a
hard drive on the side is perfect for
storing documents movies and music and
last but not least I had to get a CD
drive because I needed it to install
Windows this is a basic asus 24x DVD
optical drive so that's all the parts
for my monster gaming pc build I hope
you guys enjoy the video if you did
please leave a like I will upload the
final product in a few days and show it
off to you guys let me know what you
guys think about these parts in the
comments
down below is there something you guys
think I should have added to the build
or changed leave a comment down below
and I'll respond back we have a few
giveaways coming up soon so make sure to
subscribe so you guys don't miss out
this is the tech source and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
