click on the link below what's guys a
definite x source and we are here to
build a PC with one my good friends here
yeah my name is Christian and I'm 16 I
have built on I will build my own very
first PC with IDI my favorite tech
youtubers yeah awesome tell me what is
this PC for exactly this is meant for
gaming and a bit of productivity but
like for like youtube or something like
that down the line but for now is mainly
for gaming nice see if you have a GTX
1080 yep GPU yeah so how did you meet me
exactly how did this even happen in the
first place well um if you remember back
when we meant like the debido like the
very first meetup I mean I'm gonna have
this old apartments since my birthday
was around the corner at the time my
birthday gift was to build a PC and I
don't know how to build a PC properly so
I'm hoping that like Anne will teach me
how to build PC this was like over a
month ago and I made this poor guy wait
like a month to basically build a PC
with me yeah all these components what
all these components
was somewhere storage just sitting
around in the corner yeah I had to put
him in my dad's office for like a month
all month so he passed by these parts
probably once a day looking at like why
if I were you do that order like open
these boxes and build it myself like
screw red man I'm doing this myself like
you made me wait a month so I'm sorry
I'm at it it's okay it's been hectic
since I moved to a new place and stuff
but today's the day we're gonna we're
gonna get it done so gonna go over some
parts here like I said it is the gaming
PC we got 16 gigs of ram from Cory
series I've dominated Platinum's
actually with my favorite RAM sticks
here looks they've got the ACS tricks I
think this is a hard drive how much - uh
um 2 terabytes 2 terabytes of space for
my TV I'm afraid you I'm gonna toss in a
for tab I got one in the storage really
yeah and I thought but make any wait a
month I'm gonna do that for you might as
well give me monitor all right modern
you keyboard mouse Megaman yeah all
right so SSD we got the 850 Evo I think
this is all 250 gigs yeah we got Windows
10 of course we got the i7 7700 K this
is a quad-core processor it's a beast
quad core for gaming also got a name
that tune they're very nice 960 pro that
is also 512 gigs which are things the
operating systems gonna be on yep cool
power supply you got the 750g -
community a of course the GG text I need
to grab this card and the popular H 110
I see people of course there and that's
an LED fence so missing this is
obviously gonna be a black and green and
a razor theme setups yeah we got like
reason if you already attack at home yes
I am like one racer gear which is just
the razor temp as if you remember that's
like you know amber Decker's Mouse yeah
so let's get cracking guys let's go to
open this up real quick and here's the
thing he hasn't built a PC in his life
yeah this is the first time now normally
I can obviously guide him in the process
which is gonna be very easy so I'm gonna
actually test his knowledge and see how
well he can build a PC without my help
if he really needs to help I'll throw in
some hints but
attach any of these parts except maybe
helping unboxing let's get Oliver boxing
so I think some parts that I'm gonna see
you how well you can build a PC in a
start yeah alright if you want to start
taking out start I think the only box we
need here is well the motherboard CPU
and everything else
oh this is open he open the CPU we end
up in the CPU like the thermal place you
know it's funny you said that because
the h1 is 10 out of 10 I h1 10 I
actually comes with thermal paste on
there yeah since you used it if there
was none oh oh that's the one you want
from the giveaway yeah oh okay that
makes sense there you go make sense I'd
like you bought that but speaking of the
get the meetup we had did you besides
that they do anything else no the only
thing and I believe I kept the number in
the box
I believe number I like the number like
the like you know you give out the
numbers oh you kept the ticket obviously
so basically the way the giveaway
happened was I gave it buddy a number
and I started randomly calling out
numbers and based on the number I get
would give him a prize and he ended up
winning the age to 110 I thought I was
pretty good I think even the people that
showed up and didn't have a ticket end
up going on with something some people
even went home like three or four tech
products so I think was a pretty cool
I think that I should just yeah take
part the side panels I'm gonna get your
here's a 2 terabyte hard drive so I'm
gonna play the e i2 4 terabytes that's
the most space I live right now
otherwise I would give him like a 6 or
an 8 terabyte but that is all I got if I
can find it I think it's in here 4
terabyte Barracuda from CJ this thing
will get the job done while I'm here
maybe some you see if I can use
something else but it's guy alright so
I'm gonna give him a 4k monitor from
viewsonic as well I feel like for type a
2 terabyte upgrade for waiting 2 months
isn't good enough so I feel really bad
for the guy and I feel like he doesn't
eat a monitor so that thing is a 28 inch
4k monitor I think it as we sink a well
and as police think he's using a NVIDIA
GPU but anyways it's a nice upgrade am I
getting that alright let's go so I know
you didn't monitor so I'm gonna go
upgrade you as well here's a view sonic
this is a 4k 28 inch one I hope if it's
on your desk but yeah I'm gonna give you
as mine we're gonna test the PC on here
and you're gonna take it home what
monitor are you rocking right now it's a
720p monitor get that on camera at the
720p this guy is running on a 720p
monitor I'm glad you came dude I can't
have my subscribers running on 720p at
least 1080p so yeah this is a nice
upgrade a 4k display the only thing is
it has free sync and I know you rock Ian
and NVIDIA GPU but it's still a nice
upgrade and it's sitting in there
gathering dust so might as well give it
to you
all right so we've got the motherboard
at the i/o shield we got some SATA
cables now here is where I'm gonna leave
it to you
hopefully you'll know what to do all
right oh he's going for the i/o shield
already perfect I was actually thinking
about putting the CPU on but that works
too nice I even tell him the direction
for that you got a nice it's kind of
annoying to put those on you got to make
sure you to apply pressure like on both
sides my what I usually do is I focus on
one side first like the top and I evenly
pry pressure going down
technical difficulties putting on an
Irish you the hardest part either Asus
is Asus picks your IU shields AC fixed
your i/o shields don't make it easier
for us I think it's probably the case
NZXT fix your cases it's not if it's the
eye shield of the only extra ones er no
no that's just gonna fit such as it's
stubborn oh break this thing alright
alright
what is up with this i/o shield asus
does not want us to build this video
today okay i think the only other option
is to use a flat head and force it in
there with each thinks to bob the camera
guy popped it in there for us alright so
next step is what do you do the
processor processor alright
usually it's on the K on the cap
sometimes like at the edge of the cap Oh
so basically what we're doing now is
we're matching the triangle on the CPU
to the black triangle on the CPU cover
nice good job dude
right and I step one done or step two I
should say now what do you think we're
gonna be all right so now we gotta
install the RAM sticks of course they're
down on your plans all right all right
so I need your right I'll be the knife
part sure make sure you keep the
casualties to minimum on the show all
right it'll be nice to lay down the line
you can actually paint the heat
spreaders green that will match your
black and green color scheme even better
or I could get some stuff from Kilowog
so what is the favorite PC builds you've
seen on Tech source PC build so far is
Trigon Trigon oh I feel like it's biased
because that's black and green as well
is that did you get inspiration from
Trigon builders PC I'm just curious no
inspiration from what is raised on which
if you remember oh that's right my don't
even know my own pcs Trigon was the Tri
stellar black and red build okay raise
dogs with the black and green one so I
take back what I said about being biased
okay that's that's nice yeah that was a
nice build though Trigon was pretty sick
it was unique drop a link below if he
has missed that build very nice notice
that he was applying pressure on the RAM
sticks with both of his fingers on each
side you can do that or just apply
pressure in the middle but it's easier
to use both fingers nice one more to go
yeah
all right there you go
all right step three done very nice the
board is looking really sick it's a nice
choice by the way I like that stuff
black look over there all right so what
is the next step the next step is to get
and get the like cooler and relieved so
before we put it in the case what I'm
gonna do to the actual like around the
cooler I might have a socket oh yeah
right we need to get the thermal paste
versus right here face and as I learned
from a video that you're supposed to
make it like a very small like of it
Pete method is I don't think what he's
trying to say you're gonna pee down
methods other methods you can do
crisscross I like what I've been doing
recently on my builds is I would put the
dot in and I would spread it across so
like a piece of plastic or something
that way I get all parts of the CPU you
just pull it out I would definitely put
more it's always a go an extra then less
oh there we go that's good next step all
right so we need to flip over the case
inside and then we need to dig them
another word a house before we put that
in there actually we need to first put
the brackets member on put the cooler
right here so basically we need to get
the right to bracket for the cooler so
first thing you want to do is is that
all that's that came with our kids or
the box yeah it's missing something
missing it's missing this piece yeah we
his piece in the back of the motherboard
that way it holds the screws from the
front and I think I lost it or I gave
him I didn't complete cooler so let me
see what I can do
let me still have one extra in the
storage so yeah the bracket was
basically missing I gave this guy a poor
guy freaking incomplete cooler is
missing the bracket to install the
cooler so I'm gonna upgrade him again
we're gonna go with the h100 iv2 was
brand new
just removed the plastic so yeah maybe
we'll get more upgrades later down the
line who knows we'll see let's see what
happens hello kitty's GP
stay tuned to find out that was a
screwdriver that was not anything
important all right so we just need
there we go perfect so all that you do
actually just be careful with the
thermal paste
are you actually yeah so I'm gonna flip
this over there you go
can't have to play around with this one
a bit yeah there we go
perfect so that's in there I'm gonna
gently lower this back down I haven't
eaten breakfast yet so I'm munching on
my smokers over here there's two
different types so you can see one side
is smaller right there the other so yeah
I wanted to confirm that you were right
it's the right screw so I'm gonna put
that back in there alright so we put on
the standoffs and so we had to get a new
cooler obviously so complements my my
bad again for giving ready Oh incomplete
parts look oh this one has a piston has
a thermal paste we applied it's fine
it's fine we can either use two options
one we can clean it up this or we can
wipe it up we can wipe it off with this
one because um because that will be on
so we know that you're not over filling
it or whatever okay yeah yeah okay
that's it that's fair enough
this one is evenly spread out so we'll
get it all get more coverage some people
actually wipe off the stock holders and
they put the Arctic silver which is a
better thermal paste but honestly
auditing is gonna be a huge difference
between two I'm gonna clean this off a
little quick
recommend 99% or more isopropyl actually
can get more than that so yeah I use
toilet paper so you can use the you
knows coffee filter things but I
honestly honestly the difference between
the two I've been using this for over
two years yeah if you've got a roll of
toilet paper everywhere I do I have
three bathrooms in this place so that I
make use of it somehow there you go nice
and clean brand-new there's some lint on
there but I'm gonna blow it off okay
look at this back on
all right before continuing on with the
build next step what I'm gonna do with
what are you doing with a motherboard
we're gonna do in the motherboard we're
gonna put it inside of the case that's
it all right
right on be gentle it's a very tight
squeeze oh by the way are we gonna
replace that fan on top yeah you want
okay if you want to do that first
because when we're screwing it in or we
put in the fan in its yeah
so what are these what are these fans
for the 140s and the 140s or like the
cooler the cooler I think these are big
to be cooler I know I checked like the
coolers like 140 hey wait that was for
that one so I think they take 120 s like
oh this one is 120 I think that's one
thing yeah it's fine what we can do we
can still who's that cooler if you want
cuz the bracket is still the same it's
done ups are the same that one is bigger
so like here's one sticker that's the
difference this one's smaller but
thicker that one's longer and thinner
though either way at work but if you
want to use these fans it's gonna have
to be with that cooler because 140
doesn't fit on here yeah I guess I want
to use the old horse and I get bored and
I do yeah of course so let's do that
we don't need these stock holders
because we're gonna be using the LED
ones from coarser the sp1 20s to stay
consistent with the black and green
theme yeah we're gonna have to put the
thermal paste back on that's why it will
put it on there you can be that off
that's cool right all right so now
that's there it's too is too tall so
that the cooler is not touching the CPU
yeah I think he's alright actually
yeah these are much shorter perfect as
America yeah they're both the same same
size my chin doesn't turn on the IWM so
too for sure how to troubleshoot no
that's not let's not say that it's gonna
turn on so let's put the thermal paste
back on put the motherboard inside the
case and then from then on we can mount
the cooler second try
here we go you can touch it like the
sides
no like just just to get like the
lifting off you stick test ourselves so
it's not dripping we one do next now we
need to play in the case before that I
remember how difficult it was getting
the fans out so you want to put the fans
in first we decided things easier don't
damage your case man careful
so I got asked what video on tech stores
made you subscribe to the channel I
don't think I've asked you guys before
I think like the I'm not sure I think
some time lapse of whatever so the time
up to the PC yeah okay
and then I subscribe to him like felt
like two years ago two years ago a lot
of time subscriber very nice awesome so
it was like a veteran whereas a veteran
badge if you can can I gave it to so I
was like a time so as a time lapse build
of a PC that made you like oh
interesting Channel and you like watch
some other videos nice okay I thought
you're gonna say setup words because
everybody I asked everywhere everybody I
meet it's always a setup words or PC
words at a time yeah I actually enjoy a
piece of worse than be honest really
yeah the series is not dead it's still
happening guys it's just it's it's on a
back burner right now because it's not
as popular but it's not it's not dead I
promise you so we have to take this
thing which I had to be very careful
very nice the first time I opened one of
these cases I literally ripped off the
cable the connections came apart but it
was fine now before we put the radiator
on what do you want to do to this
perfect we got a fan of the channel
putting on fans did you guys drive far
to get here Paul that was a the road I
think looks like two hours two hour
drive geez
yeah it's right by like specula Oh
Temecula okay yeah Wow how was traffic
it was not that bad actually
nice onna being this close I want you to
screw it in as I hold it in place
screw this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
