you want to check it out starting off
the episode we have Alessandro and a
triple monitor setup featuring a 28 inch
4k monitor from AOC that's in between
two 19-inch dual monitors and vertical
mode at first I thought this was just a
massive desk but it appears to be two
telco office desks combined together I
also like how he has a matching trashcan
to his wallpaper so on the desk he has
the CM quick-fire keyboard and CM storm
Sentinel Mouse used in conjunction with
the worldcat a pari
Mouse bungee for audio he is using the
Sennheiser HD 201 headphones and the
August EP 650 wireless headphones which
is resting on the far right since he
doesn't have a headset he is using a
trust stars microphone which he pulls
out whenever he needs to do voiceovers
or use it for chat I also liked the IKEA
plant pot off to the right side and the
cool looking LED lamp right next to it I
feel like most people would put tons of
stuff on their desk if they had such a
large surface like this so it's nice to
see that Alessandro kept it to a minimum
cable management is also done really
well not a single wire on the ground and
everything is routed underneath the
table and down the legs into the back of
the PC this must have taken a while to
do so good work and finally the pcs
powering the set up has an a 535 70 K
paired with a gtx 680 amp Edition which
he claims to be able to run games over
30fps and 4k resolution and 60fps and 2k
resolution which is kind of hard to
believe regardless it's a very clean
setup Thank You Alessandra for entering
next up is Andrew with a very nice black
and red setup that's built on a custom
made desk I liked how he built a
dedicated place just for his PC so
instead of keeping it on the floor he
placed it on a stand where it's still
visible he's rocking 3 24 inch asus
monitors a Corsair Vengeance k70
keyboard with cherry reds and a corsair
scimitar RGB mouse on top of the tech
where hast mousepad for audio he's using
a pair of Altec Lansing speakers and he
also has a HyperX cloud 2 headset on a
custom made hanger cable management is
really good all the wires are wrapped
the spiral tubing there's also a hole
drilled in a desk for the keyboard and
mouse
there's even a cable box for the power
snip and even the cables running down
the wall have a channel Raceway by the
way check this out guys he hooked up a
PC case pan underneath his router to
keep it cool that's pretty impressive
and finally a PC that's pushing all of
these pixels is running on a 6700 K and
a GTX 980 extreme gaming edition from
gigabyte and 32 gigs of ram from Corsair
I don't know how I feel about the random
Xbox controller being in the center of
your desk but everything else is nicely
organized and has purpose I especially
like the 8-bit art on the wall of
Deadpool and Harley Quinn overall a very
dope looking black and red setup thank
you Andrew for entering I number three
we have Gonzalo with a razor themed
setup he has a massive 4k TV from
Samsung that's being used as a monitor
and for the gear he is of course rockin
Razer peripherals
we got the Razer BlackWidow Ultimate
keyboard Mamba mouse and a chimera 5.1
headset he also has a pair of m50x
headphones and Logitech X 530 speakers I
definitely loved how he kept everything
symmetrical as well both sides of the
desk have the same amount of devices
that's what I like to see cable
management is pretty much perfect
there's only a single wire running down
which I'm guessing is the main power
strip that has everything connected to
it and even the cables and his drawers
are neatly organized his custom PC is
running on a 2600 K that's paired with a
gigabyte g1 gaming GTX 970 and I just
want to thank you for actually spending
some time to take your pc outside to
take pictures honestly the only thing I
would do to this desk if it were mine is
to drill a hole in the desk to wrap the
keyboard wired through for a wireless
look but overall this is a very solid
setup Thank You Gonzalo for entering now
here's a setup that has a lot going on
and Jack managed to cram a lot of things
on his tiny IKEA linman desk
he has 227 inch acer monitors up top an
Xbox one underneath that and then right
next to that an MSI laptop
he's also using a Razer BlackWidow
chroma key board and the Mamba
tournament Edition Mouse on top of the
Razer Firefly mousepad he also managed
to squeeze in a pair of creative t20
speakers a snowball eyes microphone and
a turtlebeach x12 headset Wow if your
bed wasn't so close to your desk and if
you didn't have a shelf blocking
side I would have recommended some
capital eggs from Ikea to mount your
speakers on the sides to free up some
space but I'm afraid you just don't have
the room for any of that the only other
things I can recommend to you are a boom
arm for the snowball ice so that you can
attach it to the right side of your desk
and a headphone hanger for the side as
well that should help free up a few
things from your desk at least even with
all the stuff on the desk I'm surprised
you managed to keep the cable management
under control
it looks like the IKEA Signum is holding
up most of the cables and the rest have
been wrapped up with some velcro and
then down here is the PC itself which is
equipped with a 6700 and a GTX 960 I'm
personally not a fan of cramped setups
but I do understand that sometimes you
are limited to the amount of space you
can work with and I think it did a good
job making it work
thank you jack for entering last but not
least we have Kerry and another
black-and-red setup that's built on a
homemade desk which is built into the
wall
he's walking yep editor x34 gaming
ultrawide monitor with a Logitech g7 10
plus keyboard and e cursor M 65 Pro RGB
mouse on top of the VIP hams extended
mousepad he built up a total beach recon
50 yet set that's behind the monitor and
speaking of behind it looks like all the
cables are ran alongside the wall and
into the hole that was drilled in the
corner of the desk and then out from the
bottom nicely done
but let's take a look at the PC this
thing looks awesome it's running on a
6800 K and two msi gtx 1080s
in sli definitely loving the custom
painted sli bridge the v1 tech backplate
and custom sleeping a very badass color
scheme and impressive setup indeed Thank
