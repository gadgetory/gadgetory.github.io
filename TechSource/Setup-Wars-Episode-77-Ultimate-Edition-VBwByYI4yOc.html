and welcome to setup wars episode 77 now
I don't know whether to call this the
triple monitor edition or the ultimate
edition since both of them do apply but
if you guys want to participate make
sure to watch the video linked below but
with that said and done let the set up
or is begin
if you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2a
comm because they have the cheapest CD
keys available for pretty much any game
I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out as always you
guys can find the gear to everyone
setups link down below but your five
contestants for this week are chase Kyle
Tim yo-hwan and Ozzy do we have an
awesome show for you guys today let's
begin starting up the episode we have
chase and his triple monitor setup and
that's probably the last time I'm going
to say triple monitor setup in this
episode since everyone does have three
displays I don't want to sound redundant
so looks like he uses the left monitor
for console gaming while the other two
are for screaming or PC gaming in this
case so he has two different asus
martyrs all of which are hooked up to an
arm and below that we have the mad cat
strike 7 keyboard and Mad Catz teehee
mouse which I think stands for
tournament edition for audio he is using
the Altec Lansing 221 speakers and
subwoofer system and a pair of astro a40
s hanging under the desk the actual a 40
s are used for his consoles and he does
have both Xbox one and ps4 by the way
both system controllers have custom
skins from Team CR which apparently he
is the CEO of I don't really have
anything negative to say about the cable
management looks like it's under control
for the most part and there is some sort
of rack that's holding up majority of
the cables finally the PC that's
powering the setup has an FX 6300 and a
gtx 660 a well-put-together setup Thank
You chase for starting off this episode
strong kyle is up next he's rocking a
24-inch BenQ monitor in between two
27-inch AOC displays on the IKEA Mackay
desk he has the corsair k70 RGB keyboard
paired with a razer deathadder chroma
talk about mix and match for audio he's
walking a pair of creative t20 speakers
and a pair of actual a 50s which are
resting on the wooden Omega headphone
Sam I'm not too sure why he has a random
at2020 microphone just chilling on the
desk without it being connected to
anything I don't even see boom arm
anywhere let alone an audio interface
cable management looks good but I would
definitely cut those extensions off the
zip ties for a much cleaner look the PCs
powering the setup has a 59 30 K and a
GTX 1080 founders Edition a pretty
straightforward and badass setup Thank
You Kyle for entering at number 3 we
have Tim with a very interesting style
setup so he has a predator x34 ultra
wide in between two 24-inch Pankiw
monitors which he has also mounted
against the wall that's a hell of a
setup you know the monitors are a pair
of argon speakers laying on its sides
and a pair of razer kraken headphones
the keyboard of choice is the Corsair
k70 RGB and the mouse is the logitech
g502 both really solid gaming
peripherals you do have a few wires
visible and the extra one from the Razer
Firefly isn't really helping your case
now if I were you I would drill two
separate holes one for the keyboard and
one for the mouse and the mouse pad and
then route the cables through for a much
cleaner look instead of having to pass
them through your desk normally I
wouldn't recommend drilling holes and
desks for most setups since that is
permanent but I see potential in this
one and I would like to see you perfect
it the cable management under the desk
though is excellent the only thing I
would grab is a cable box to hide the
power strip and but overall very solid
work but that PC though a very sexy
black and red water-cooled build
rocking the 4790k and a GTX 780
I definitely think it's time to upgrade
that GPU though a headphone hangar for
the headset and some double sided velcro
holding the remote on your desk will
help clean up the surface a bit but
overall a pretty badass setup thank you
Tim for entering I swear these setups
get better and better take a look at
this one
god damn the presentation is just
perfect I love the white black and red
color scheme and you did such a great
job keeping everything consistent UN is
rocking three of the same 27-inch BenQ
gaming monitors and for the gear he has
the corsair k70 RGB keyboard m65 mouse
on top of the reflex lab mouse pad I
love the fact that you drill a hole in
the desk even though the desk itself is
pretty expensive I would say it's
definitely worth it also on a desk we
have the Focusrite audio interface which
is hooked up to the blue Yeti microphone
I didn't even know they made white pop
filters that looks pretty though
speaking of white to you is a pair of
Yamaha HS 8 speaker
wresting understands he's also using a
pair of m50 axes for monitoring audio
and he's keeping those away off to the
right side should I even bother going
through cable management I mean at this
point I'm sure you are knows what the
hell he is doing not only is everything
routed beautifully near the back but all
the wires are either sleeved or hidden
superb job and of course we can't forget
this beast lurking down below god damn
this thing is running on a 39 70 X and
two GTX Titan X's in sli the PC also has
a ton of mods from custom painted parts
all the way to the cables I'm definitely
happy that you kept with the color
scheme even in your PC I'm personally
not a fan of keeping such a beauty on
the table but I understand why you had
to do that I'm not gonna lie I was very
close and giving this the seal of
approval but the PC being on the bottom
and the headphones being out of reach on
the right side kind of changed my
decision regardless this is a fantastic
setup definitely one of the best I've
seen on the show thank you your lion for
entering and of course we can't forget
about Yas EADS setup he's been on the
show two times already however this time
he is back with a revamp set up any new
color scheme he switched from his black
and red theme to a black and purple as
you can see and holy where do I
begin you know what let's go backwards
on this one let's take a look at his
beast PC so it doesn't look like the
specs have changed much it's still
rocking in 59 60 x8 core processor with
the msi god-like motherboard 32 gigs of
ram as well in fact the only parts he
has changed are the GPUs because he's
now rocking 2 GTX 1080s in SLI compared
to the GTX 980 s from his previous setup
aside from the GPU swap he's also
repainted most of the parts to match his
current color scheme and even picked up
a fresh set of cables next to his PC he
has a very nice lineup of his consoles
he still has the Xbox one and ps4
however this time they have been reskin
to match his current setup once again
alright so now back to the main setup so
he's rocking three different monitors
the center one is a 27 inch 4k monitor
and between two 27-inch rog swift
monitors the only thing that's changed
is that he added an additional ultrawide
monitor up top which is the 34 inch Acer
predator now all of these monitors are
mounted individually using the freedom
which gives them complete control over
each one of them other than that there
is nothing else that's new in this setup
he's still rocking a Corsair strafe RGB
with the MX master and a reflex lab
mouse pad for the speakers he is using
the JBL pulses and finally in the center
he has a controller stand holding up
both his ps4 and Xbox one controllers
cable management probably has to be the
best I've seen on setup Wars as of yet
it is flawless not only are all the
wires hidden very well but they are
routed with such precision that this can
be labeled as cable porn what's more is
that Yazzie did this on a glass desk
which in itself is challenging just
about everything in this setup is
perfected I love the ambience in the
room and there's plenty of personality
from the figurines on the wall shelves
to the posters and just overall
consistency of the color scheme I did
say just about everything unfortunately
as much as I want to give him the seal
this setup is not perfect and here is my
reason before everyone comes after me
with pitchforks much of the same reason
why he didn't get the seal from my
previous episodes still apply but here
they are anyways you see this setup is
constructed mainly based on a color
scheme without any regard to the quality
of the products the Aussies mentality is
that if it's black and purple well it
belongs in this setup
that's not how setup should be
constructed take the JBL speakers for
instance these are known to have
distorted sound at high levels so the
overall sound quality is terrible
compared to other Bluetooth speakers I
would put in some real quality bookshelf
speakers or something similar instead of
those also the microphone placement is
not practical sure it's sitting on the
right side because it's not in use but
you have to constantly move it to your
desired location when you need to record
audio this is a fine example of Yazzie
choosing looks over practicality sure it
looks better in that location but how
often is it really in that location
number three is the mouse now this looks
like a solid gaming setup and he'll he
might even use it for productivity and
editing videos which is perfectly fine
but why go with a mouse that is only
meant for productivity and not gaming as
well take my example for instance I do
gaming and editing as well probably I
would say 70% editing and 30% gaming I
recently switched or not recently months
I switched from an MX master mouse to my
new Logitech G 900 animals for both
productivity and gaming and it still
matches my color scheme because it does
have RGB lighting in my experience you
don't have to pick one side you can
definitely get the best of both worlds
and finally the last reason is that he's
using professional monitoring headphones
but he has no audio interface it kind of
makes me question why you have the m50
X's in the first place if you're not
taking advantage of its performance
something tells me he bought it just so
he can skin it in purple to match his
setup you guys kind of get what I'm
trying to say seriously though Yazeed
I'm in love with this setup and I think
you did a phenomenal job with it I'm not
trying to crap on your setup by any
means I'm just trying to justify why I'm
not awarding it a seal of approval
because I know my subscribers very well
they're going to attack me in the
comment section so that is why in the
end guys it is my award that I created
and I can give it to whoever I want but
at least you guys know the reason this
time regardless this is an amazing setup
no doubt please continue to improve your
setup and don't be afraid to submit
again in the future
thank you Ozzie again for entering so
that is it for the show drop your
comments down below as always guys and
vote on who you think has the best desk
setup as always alarms the winners on my
social media platforms on the weekend
thing I so much watching if you enjoy
set up boards honestly if you spend a
second and drop it like it helps me out
a ton I love you guys so much thank you
and I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
