that means the next episode of setup
pores has already been uploaded on my
vessel account so if you guys want to
watch it a week early check out the link
below what's up guys is that from Texas
and welcome to setup wars episode 20 for
Brad we use immature desk setup to get
featured on the channel submissions are
still closed but they will open next
month so make sure you guys keep an eye
out for that with all that said and done
let the setup board begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always everyone's gear for the setups
will be linked down below along with
anything I recommend in this episode so
here are your five lucky contestants for
this episode we have our women Gregor
Hayden Mitchell and Sam who
congratulations for making it a set-up
wars episode 42 starting up the show we
have Irvin and his single LG 27-inch
monitor setup at first you think it's
mounted against the wall but look again
it actually has a clear base which gives
it the illusion that it's floating on
the desk we have the Apple Wireless
Keyboard rabu mouse and a MacBook Pro 13
that's powering this setup we also have
a ps4 console with some games off to the
left and a bunch of controllers on the
right I was never a fan of having new
motor controllers on the table because
not only can it scratch the surface but
it's also taking up extra space but I
mean it's your desk and if you like the
look of it then by all means leave them
their cable management isn't bad I do
like the cable channel you are using to
run the cables down to the ground from
your monitor but there's a lot of loose
wires behind that trash can over there
grabbing a cable box can not only hide a
power strip but also help keep the bulk
of the wires in there I would also
recommend one more cable channel for the
ground that way you can cover those
cables other than those extra items on
your desk I think it's a pretty sweet
setup thank you or win for entering
griego's next up with a very bright
setup we have a Samsung 24-inch monitor
Corsair k70 RGB keyboard and a razor at
this mouse on top of the mat cats glide
3 mousepad we also have a pair of
Logitech Z 200 speakers and a rode NT
USB mic on a stand
excellent work with cable management
then again the ikea mount desks really
make cable management an easy task also
props on the remote placement the PC
that's powering the setup has the 4690k
and a gtx 760 inside the zig Matic
Aquila case other than having a
headphone hangar with no headphones I
think this is a very clean and
simplistic setup Thank You Gregor for
entering taking a break from single
monitor setups we are moving on to
Hayden's setup with three Asus 24-inch
monitors hooked up to a desk mount down
below we have the Roseville RGB ad
mechanical game
keyboard a SteelSeries sensei mouse on
top of an extended mousepad after the
side of the setup we have to Rockville
ASM five studio monitors and the popular
ath m50x is hanging from below cable
management is definitely not the best
but can be improved greatly if you spend
some more time on it using a cable
raceway or even picking up a signal rack
can make your life a lot easier the PC
that's powering the setup has a 4690 and
a GTX 970 graphics card inside yet
another fan text and food pro case there
is definitely potential here once you
clean up the cables nonetheless Thank
You Hayden for entering speaking of
three monitor setups this next one is
from Mitchell once again with 324 inch
asus monitors side-by-side on the desk
we have the Razer DeathAdder keyboard
and the mouse I'm having trouble
figuring out you probably can't see it
but there are actually Logitech Z 200
speakers behind the monitors not the
best place to put speakers but you don't
really have any space off to the left of
the main setup we have the PC which has
a 4690 and an asus r9 280x GPU inside
the design are for case and next to that
we have the blue snowball mic and a
random LG monitor just sitting there
cable management is atrocious you can
use the Elmi mount cable wrap and hide
those nasty cables and once again I'm
gonna recommend the cable box to keep
that Perish dip it in the cable box is
such an easy thing to use yet it really
cleans things up it's crazy before we do
something with those speakers let's talk
about those monitors for a second I
don't know how effective that setup is
for you I mean even if you sit in the
middle there's no way you are able to
see the edges of the two monitors since
they are far from your eyes I would
recommend putting the two outer displays
at an angle so that you can get a curve
effect and that way they won't be as far
from your eyes and all you need to do is
just rotate your head as for the
speakers and stay out long you can
actually lay it on its side in landscape
orientation so that the sound is not
being interfered I don't know how that
will affect the sound so maybe you
should try that out and see if it works
another solution is that you can
actually buy an or go tech martyr arm
and raise them up a bit so that the
speakers aren't being blocked and at the
same time it will solve your monitor
distance problem lots of different ways
you can tweak this set up but
nonetheless thank you for entering last
but not least we have a razor set up
three 24-inch ISO monitors a corsair k70
RGB keyboard and a death
chroma Mouse on top of the razor Firefly
mousepad for the headset he is using the
ashtray 50s and we also have a MacBook
right next to that cable management is
pretty good I see that all the cables
are resting on top of the rack with
barely any wires on the ground the PC
that's powering the setup is in another
define r4 case and it's running a 4770k
and a Titan X this is a small
recommendation but I noticed that you
are using the cable spirals for the
wires behind your monitors so I know
that you like hiding visible wires so
why not hook up both of the miles and
the mousepad wired together with some
velcro straps so that looks like there's
only one wire running down the back of
your desk instead of two separate wires
that should look a lot cleaner but
that's all I got very nice green black
and white set up Thank You samu for
entering so that's a for this week's
