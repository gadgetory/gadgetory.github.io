back to another ultimate camera
comparison video this time we are facing
off the HTC One m9 against possibly one
of the best smartphone cameras in the
market the Xperia z3 but Before we jump
into the samples let's take a quick look
at their specs so the m9 has a twenty
point seven megapixel rear facing camera
with an aperture of 2.2 that can shoot
up to 4k resolution at 30fps the z3 also
has a twenty point seven megapixel
camera with an aperture of 2.2 and it
can also shoot up to 4k resolution at
30fps both phones also have digital
image stabilization and continuous
autofocus and it can also record slow
motion in 720p at 120 FPS for
front-facing cameras the m9 has a four
megapixel camera that can shoot in 1080p
and the z3 has a two point two megapixel
camera that can shoot in 1080p as well I
did shoot both phones in manual mode to
adjust its exposure levels in certain
shots to make this a fair test so with
that being said let's take a look at the
samples
hi guys welcome to destabilization and
microphone test between the HTC One m9
and the Xperia z3 pay attention to the
audio icon somewhere on the screen and
it will basically let you know which
phone's microphone is being used and
also both phones are strapped onto one
device to ensure a very accurate
stabilization rating the best thing
about the z3 is that it also has a
stabilization feature even during 4k
recording called steady shot when it
comes to focusing the m9 seems to be
focusing really well here there are
times though where the camera goes in
and out trying to capture the object but
nonetheless it's really accurate and
quick the z3 also does a good job for
the most part however it does often get
stuck at times when swapping between
objects frequently the m9 definitely has
a more dependable camera when it comes
to focusing
alright so for daylight pics the m9 has
slightly more saturation and the XIII
pics appeared to be a little washed out
but they're actually not they're just
more truer to life the images on the
XIII are closer to the real thing and it
actually comes down to personal
preference
some people want rich vibrant colors in
their photos and others want more
realistic so I think both do a good job
in their own category moving inside and
away from the Sun I think both phones
are pretty much equal the only problem
that the m9 faces when focusing on
blacks is that it over exposes
everything else whereas the z3 has a
better balance however even the z3
doesn't stand a chance against a
front-facing camera of the m9 photo
light performance the z3 does a much
better job than the m9 excellent dynamic
range on the z3 you are just able to see
every bit of detail in the shot whereas
the m9 struggles the z3 also has a lot
less noise and a much sharper image the
m9 also fails at flash picks at a closer
distance especially if the object is
white the z3 on the other hand is a far
better job switching to daylight video
in 4k both phones do a great job now
because the z3 has truer to life colors
it kind of seems washed out whereas the
footage from the m9 looks more rich and
vibrant but like I said earlier it does
come down to personal preference for
stabilization the z3 takes the point I
think that the stabilization software on
the z3 is just a lot better than the m9
s for low-light video I think both
phones definitely need improvement the
z3 definitely didn't do a great job but
I think it did better than the m9 if you
actually pay close attention to the
signs and the vehicles you can see that
they are slightly sharper and less
blurry so the final verdict if you want
to err to life colors and decent
low-light experience go with the z3 if
you love vibrant colors and taking
selfies then the m9 is your best friend
personally I'll pick the z3 over the m9
any day when it comes to camera
performance the realistic colors are
what I'm after and it also has better
stabilization for video and does a great
job taking pictures and low-light
settings anyways that's it for the video
