I'm proud ploud proud to now what's up
guys it's effin sex toys and I'm proud
to announce that I've teamed up with
candid once again to give away three
gaming pcs to three lucky subscribers
and more info on that later in this
video so make sure you stick around the
stop is really cool I talked a lot about
last time but for those of you who are
recently joining in candid is basically
an app that lets you discuss your
favorite topics anonymously with friends
and strangers no one knows who you are
on the app guys your name your age where
you're from every time you post
something or respond to a comment
basically new fictitious name is created
just for you so you can basically be
yourself and not have to worry about it
there's a lot of really cool groups that
you can join and participate in for
example we got some from love and
relationships to cars and even PC gaming
which I'm sure a lot of guys are into
you can literally search your topic and
I'm pretty sure there will be a group
just for that so one of my favorite
groups that I follow is breakup text
don't ask me why I follow it but every
time I'm bored I you scroll through it
and I read people's breakup text and I
come across some stories like this one
for example my last girlfriend invited
me to hang out at her place and all her
friends were there she broke up with me
in front of all of them
feels on that one
obviously I'm following PC bills as well
because I me know a thing or two about
building them you know nothing nothing
too much but it's actually a lot of
people on there asking about PC bills
and even posting their own rigs on here
which is pretty cool and this is one
group called vent where they basically
just complain and vent about stuff I
recently joined a group because I like I
don't know why it's like reading people
complain about stuff I there's one
person wrote down you ever loved someone
but want to break their neck at the same
time that's a bit extreme though I mean
I would I wouldn't break their neck I
would probably just set them on fire or
something and then of course you got my
own group which I created last time
which is called tech stores and is
actually a lot of you got well we have
14,000 members in here already but
anyways you guys are always posting
dankmemes on there and posting things
about setups and questions about tech
even PC bills even posting your own PC
bill down here so it's pretty cool to
actually see that a thread is that
active and actually participate in there
sometimes obviously you guys will never
notice me because of all the anonymous
posting but oh yeah guys it's a really
cool app it's really different than
others that's kind of why I really like
it because of the anonymous factor of it
there's a lot of other social media
platforms out there I mean got Instagram
Twitter and even red where you can post
things and respond but those aren't
really anonymous you know you have one
account and people can always see who
you respond to and we reply so kinda
just it's completely different with
compared to canned and that's why I
really like this because of the
anonymous factor
it's basically freedom of speech you can
write whatever you want with that worry
about what people are going to think or
stay basically I so now let's talk about
the giveaway instructions are very easy
I'll also leave them down below so you
want to follow so first you got to do is
leave a like on the video number to post
a picture of your PC whether it's a
laptop custom build or pre build
whatever it is take a picture of your PC
make sure it's in at least peace and
quality and post it on my text or screw
in the candid app with your Twitter
handle that way if you do in I know
where to find your basic reasons
everyone's account is anonymous I need
to know how to find you guys and the
final step is to obviously follow the
text source group on candid and now
there are several tech stores groups
on there so make sure you guys are
following the actual wheel one because
there's a lot of fan made ones this one
has obviously 14,000 members so it's
really hard to miss that's the only one
with that and it also has my set ups
back without background so my setup
background as the avatar or profile pic
so it's really easy to spot this
giveaway is global so no matter where
you live in this world you are eligible
to enter and the winner will be
announced on April 15th on my Twitter
account of course so make sure you
