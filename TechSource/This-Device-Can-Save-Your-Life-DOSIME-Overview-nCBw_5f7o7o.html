and today we're going to take a look at
the dose of me a hybrid smart home and
wearable device that detects radiation
this thing can literally save your life
as you probably know the human body can
sense any form of radiation including
ionizing radiation which is harmful to
the human body when exposed to high
levels the body cells usually die or
mutate incorrectly and possibly become
cancerous pretty scary stuff let's find
out how effective this device really is
so we here at million technologies to
expose the dohsa made to a source of
radiation and to see how accurate this
is or if this is just a gimmick let's go
the tests are pretty straightforward we
attach the dose of me to a block that
was across from a source of radiation
and one side of the room we flipped the
switch which exposed a radiation to the
entire room through the app we see that
the device picked up an accurate reading
of twenty-two thousand two hundred
twenty milligram per hour this exceeds
the federal Occupational limit of five
thousand milligrams it's hard to say
what would happen as everyone's body
reacts differently but the dose was high
enough to say that it would be bad news
so now that we know it works let's move
on to our next location so guys I am now
officially in Santa Clarita California
and I'm standing right on top of my new
home as you can see I was going for more
of an open look novel all seriousness
I'm starting on top of the home which is
being built for me in Santa Clarita and
so far they've built the foundation and
I actually was really curious to see the
radiation levels of where they are
building my home so I thought would be
really cool place to test out the dose
MA which is right now on my collar
because I don't have any other place to
hold it as you can see them kind of
occupied so I'm going to open up the app
and check out the radiation levels right
now so the app is showing point zero
zero eight millirem per hour which is
good looks like I won't be leaving
planet Earth anytime soon that's
actually one of the reasons I wanted to
test out the dose of a in the first
place because I was curious to know how
much radiation I'll be exposed to once I
move in here but anyways I'm going to
get out of here before I start swinging
back to my crappy apartment I don't get
paranoid and start radiation proof
your home being it's pretty hard to come
into contact with levels that pose any
threat to you I see it as more of an
investment than anything else really
it's a one-time purchase and you can
carry with you wherever you move you're
essentially paying for peace of mind at
this point the benefits of only one far
outweigh the benefits of not owning one
I guess it's better to be safe than
sorry
put that pretty much wraps up my video
on this pretty interesting device if you
guys enjoyed it make sure to leave a
like and I'll drop a link to the dosa me
down below if you guys want to check it
out for yourselves huge thanks to those
to me for setting this end and
sponsoring this video thank you guys so
much for watching and I will see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
