welcome to one of my two budget builds
that I'm gonna be doing for December one
for Intel and one for AMD and both of
these are gonna be sub $700 gaming pcs
that will get you over 60fps and maxed
out settings and 1080p this particular
build will cost you around $650 at the
time of making this video and it
features the rising 3 1200 quad-core CPU
which I was able to overclock using the
stock heatsink and by using the MSI be
350 amp gaming Pro motherboard
I spent $10 more and picked up the MSI
board over the asrock because of
stability and I wanted something more
reliable when it comes to overclocking
for RAM I picked up a big bites from
Patriot which are rated at 2400
megahertz
now this is the sweet spot for risin
builds paying for faster ram won't get
you much more performance based on the
benchmarks i've seen and for storage I
went with a simple 1 terabyte hard drive
from WD however you can always easily
substitute this for an SSD or add extra
storage as you please the point of this
bill is to get the most performance
possible by spending the least amount of
money
speaking of performance I opted for the
gtx 1066 gigabyte variant from ZOTAC
because currently this is the best
performing mid-range card for the value
that's why guys it actually cost less
than the rx 588 gigabyte version that
usually goes for around 280 dollars
which is $20 more if you look at
benchmarks between these two cards there
are pretty much even in terms of
performance and in some cases the rx 580
does have a slight lead over the 1060
but the difference is miniscule and
honestly I'd rather save $20 and get
access to GeForce experience you get to
use shadowplay to record games smoothly
and of course you get G sync power in
the build is the 500 watt power supply
from EVGA and the case I went with is
the Roseville fbm x1 and this is
actually a pretty good case for only $27
it has 4 USB ports in the front two of
which are USB 3 you also get a clear
side panel and two pre-installed fans it
even comes prepared with standoffs
already installed the cable
management wasn't that bad either I was
able to hide some of the wires behind
the PC and keep the rest of them hidden
behind the hard drive rack I'm still
surprised that this case is going for
this cheap as I said before he can
easily hit 60fps and high or max
settings on triple-a titles GTA 5 on
very high settings you get around 100
FPS doom OpenGL over 100 fps and destiny
to maxed out was actually running in the
high 80s which was very impressive I
jumped in to a few events I joined some
PvP matches and drove around my air bike
and not once did the frames dip anywhere
near 60 I was getting steady 80 to 90
FPS and sometimes it would peak over 100
in areas that don't have any action
going on what was more impressive though
was actually getting over 60 FPS and pop
G on high setting so this game is
horribly optimized and the fact that it
was running very smooth in the mid 60s
was very nice to see inside buildings
the frames would jump in the high 80s
and low 90s just overall very smooth
gameplay at this point I do want to
mention that both the GPU and CPU were
overclocked unfortunately I didn't get
lucky in the Silicon Lottery and I was
only able to push my rise in three-chip
to 3.8 gigahertz at one point 3 to 6
volts which is actually the minimum it
can go I have seen other people using
the same cooler and the same exact
motherboard combo that pushed there are
three 1202 4.0 gigahertz so it's
definitely possible you just have to be
a little lucky the GPU overclock however
was a lot smoother I was able to throw
on another 100 megahertz to the core
clock and 350 megahertz to the memory
the GPU boost clock peaked at 19:30 but
once the temps kicked in the 1060 was
keeping steady at 1873 megahertz for the
boost clock and a total effective memory
clock at eight thousand seven hundred
and six megahertz do keep in mind that
the zotac gtx 1060 came out of the box
with a boost clock of 1708 so that's a
healthy gain of 165 megahertz on the
overall boost clock temperatures were a
bit high as expected after all I did
push the parts to its absolute maximum
to get the most performance out of it
both the CPU and GPU
were running
stable Abbie's overclock settings with
the horizon 3 1200 peaking at 74 degrees
during full load and the GPU peaking at
88 degrees the Foundry's wasn't too bad
with the side panel on during full load
the fan noise was around 50 decibels
for five spec benchmarks I got a score
of ten thousand four hundred and seventy
five and when it comes to productivity
it does a decent job I mean it's not the
worst I definitely don't recommend doing
any CPU intensive tasks like editing or
graphic design but just for reference I
rendered out a three-minute 5k video
file in a little under 15 minutes this
is a 5k resolution video file the reason
why I'm throwing all these numbers at
you is because I'm gonna be comparing
all the benchmark numbers in this video
to the Intel build which is coming up
shortly so make sure you guys stick
around because we're gonna find out
which one of these two builds is gonna
give you the best performance and also
the best bang for your buck overall this
is an awesome gaming PC delegate to over
60 FPS maxed out and 1080p across almost
every game and it's only gonna cost you
around $650 which is very tempting if
you guys want to build this PC for a lot
less than be on the lookout for
discounts and deals coming up for
Christmas in fact the best place to
check for PC deals is on my website deal
sourced tech because we update the
website four to five times throughout
the day with fresh deals that we find on
Amazon Newegg and eBay so if you guys
want to save money on your next build or
maybe you want to pick up a few parts
and upgrade your current PC then make
sure you guys are bookmarking the
website and checking back constantly
especially during the holidays the
website is gonna be packed with some
awesome deals if you guys are new to the
channel consider subscribing for more PC
builds like these and if you guys are
excited for the Intel build make sure to
smack that like button thank you so much
for watching as always everything
mentioned in the video will be linked
below I love your faces and I will see
you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
