welcome to an update video I haven't
done one of these in such a long time
but I figured Li no it's a new year and
there's a lot of stuff going on with me
and with a channel that I figured I just
combined everything into one video and
just talk to you guys let's sort of make
it you guys to do this entire boring
video I've actually separated into
segments then if you guys check out the
description section I've actually
labeled the timestamps and you guys can
actually click on those and skip to the
part of the video that you aren't
interested in but here are the updates
that I'm going to be talking about in
this video up the number one is I'm
working on a new website very exciting
news status on my water cool build I
know a lot of you guys have been
attacking me so I'm going to be updating
you on that tech source oh I should say
I'm going to be hiring people for the
channel this year more info on that I'm
going to be announcing the winners for
2016
set up wars the three winners and
finally an update on my home purchase
that I bought late last year I'll give
you guys a status on that before I get
into the actual update video I want to
share a really cool product I came
across a few weeks ago now originally I
wanted to hold off and feature it in my
cool tech of February but that's like a
few weeks ahead of time and the campaign
doesn't have much time left so I figured
you guys would be interested in this so
if you guys are anything like me who
have dozens of passwords to remember and
hate constantly typing them in or even
filling out forms to check out then I
honestly think you're going to like this
product so it's called a Q key and it
basically stores all of your personal
information on a physical device which
you can even attach to your keys they
managed to achieve this by using the
same chip technology you would find on
your debit and credit cards so you can
definitely rest assured and knowing it's
all secured just simply plug it into
your PC or laptops
type in your master password and you are
in next time you shop online all you
have to do is click on the information
you want to use from the digital wallets
on the right side whether it's filling
out a shipping form payment information
to buy something or a simple username
and password for logging into an account
it all happens on the key it is a really
cool product and I actually pick one up
for myself because I do want to make a
video one of eventually but if you guys
are interested make sure to check out
the Kickstarter which I will have linked
down below but with that said let's
begin with the updates
so the first exciting news and really
big news at least for me it is is that
we have an official website Texas has an
official website its tech stores int or
international.com and we've been working
on this for months now and now it's
officially here not only will it be the
home to the latest tech news reviews
guides future tech and many more
categories to come but there also be
monthly newsletters delivered to your
inbox with all the best and most
important tech news all in one email
that way you're caught up with
everything that's been going on in the
tech industry for that entire month it's
gonna be really cool and I keep saying
we because we're going to have a team of
professional writers that's going to be
posting constantly on the website I'm
personally not going to be writing on
any articles because I'm really focusing
on YouTube videos but there's definitely
a lot of people contributing to this
website now it is a brand new website so
obviously there might be some changes
down the line I thought if you guys
leave any constructive criticisms down
below we will take that very seriously
and we will make the necessary changes
on the website but people always read
articles and there's still people who
read articles as opposed to watching
videos so that is why I've always wanted
to open up a website it's kind of like
CNN kind of like the verge and just
focus on just pure articles because
sometimes people don't have the time to
sit and watch ten minute videos on a
product they want to skim through stuff
and just check out like the key talking
points and things like that so that's
one of the reasons why I started this so
I'm very excited to see where this is
going to take tech source but anyways
you guys want to check it out the link
will be down below
electro Vox where do I even begin with
that I can't even post a single video
without at least a hundred comments
mentioning where the hell is the
water-cooled build so I think I'm just
going to show you guys so the issue with
that build is very simple actually
everything was going fine you know I had
the momentum going and then I realized
the cables that were sent to me by some
company were incorrect they were for a
different power supply which is bizarre
because I don't even understand how that
even happened because I clearly told
them what power supply I was using for
the build and I still managed to send
the wrong one and that's pretty much
what set me back for like three weeks
now that's what I've been waiting for I
said the cables back there working on it
and I recently just got news that they
fix the cables oh maybe they sent me
once I don't know but they sent it out
so as the time at the time I'm recording
this video it is still in process is
still in route so I haven't received
them just yet but as soon as I get them
I promise you guys I will continue with
the build it's I haven't abandoned it
I'm not giving up on it I definitely
want to finish it up because that is the
first water-cooled build on tech stores
and so far it's not it's not as not the
way I wanted to be you know it's
definitely got a smoother had I got all
the correct parts but it is my first
time so I'm expecting these issues to
come up so yeah that's definitely on
that I hope to bring you guys a video I
think part 5 by the end of January at
least but don't quote me on that
Texas is hiring I know I've talked a lot
about this last year but it's getting
really close guys I'm having very very
soon mid is 2017 so around May and June
is where I'm looking to pick up two
full-time team members and these team
members will be in charge of scripting
help with production editing and pretty
much any other office work I need done
for the channel so whether it's creating
some nails or finding beats for the
videos you know just stuff like that but
I'm looking for two full-time people
right now I have one full-time his name
is Bob he's my cousin I'm sure you guys
know him he's been helping with the
production with the scripting and all
that stuff yeah what they was out of
here in April I will finally rent out an
office space nearby and continue with
the hiring process of two very educated
very skilled individuals now we're
looking for needs individuals are very
simple lots of knowledge in the tech
industry so you guys need to know about
pretty much whatever I do on the channel
need to know about PCs keyboards mice
mutters oh geez don't even know like
graphics cards processors it means know
enough to do a review to do benchmarks
do stuff like that and whatever I'm
reviewing like if it's a laptop you need
to know how to review a laptop
essentially so that's kind of what I'm
looking for I'm not just looking for an
editor that makes any sense so basically
I'm looking for someone who has
all-around knowledge on text basic
ratings easiest way to put itself if you
are interested make sure you stick
around the channel there will be an
official announcement probably in a few
more months where I'll be taking in
applications and basically what the
application is going to be is you
sending me a review that you've done
yourself you shot yourself you scripted
yourself and you've you invoice over
yourself you will be doing the
voiceovers of course but this is just a
good way to get an idea of how smart you
are I guess or how well you know the
industry or how well you know how to
make videos and stuff like that so so
yeah that's all I want to talk about in
terms of hiring for tech stores let's
move on to the next segment
all right so the top three winners of
set-up wars 2016 were in third place we
got stands the second place saw Luke
with that incredible gaming room and
that god damn beautiful water-cooled ps4
and Xbox one honestly I'm surprised you
didn't win first place but yeah first
place I actually went to no surprise
yahzee a lot of you guys grilled meats
were not given and the seal of approval
so at least now he's won and actually
liked it and even better for it so
congratulations guys if you're watching
this video make sure to email me at set
up boards to claim your prize I'm going
to show on screen right now with the
prizes work as I forgot what I said in
the previous video so although it's your
first place this is what you win second
place and third place everybody else
will entered thank you guys so much for
your participation let's make 2017 and
even better year for setup and finally
last thing we'll talk about is the
status of my home which is currently
being built I know I started talking
about this like in September last year
it's been such a long time but the the
completion date was moved from February
to April I think in December of
mid-december they started working on it
they built the trenches and stuff for
like the the tubing and wires I don't
even know what how houses are built but
so yeah that's that's on the way so I'm
very excited about that
like I said in April or late April it
should be done I'll give you guys a tour
or like a vlog or something if you guys
are interested something is in my eye so
yeah fun stuff happening there guys I
don't really have much information to
give you because I don't have anything
so I know that it's being built and
that's pretty much it it's a pretty big
place 2,100 feet it's four bedrooms as
the loft it's got a two-car garage and I
kind of designed the inside they gave me
options on like the flooring the
countertops the ceiling lighting
electrical and stuff like that though
very excited how the house is going to
turn out I can't wait to see the final
product but
product the final home final house so
it's been a much it for the video I
don't know how long this thing has
dragged on so if you actually sat
through this entire video without
skipping then you are seriously the MVP
you are the true loyal Texas subscriber
and I seriously appreciate it but
everyone else who's watched the video
thank you so much seriously I hope that
answers some of your questions on what's
going on I've been dealing with some
other stuff too like my personal like
personal things going on that's kind of
why I haven't been updating or uploading
daily as kind of truth be told I've been
kind of burnt out ever since New Year's
I just feel like the motivation is kind
of like it's not there anymore like it
was in 2016 the grind I've lost the
grind of off the the momentum that I've
built so much for and make it you know
yes I understand that doing a video by
yourself every single day for like
almost a year like a legit full year and
as a toll on your body physically and
mentally so I think I finally caught up
to me and it's just looking back I'm
like how the hell did I do that like how
the hell did I upload a video a day by
myself I don't even know how the hell I
was possible so yeah it was crazy it was
definitely crazy you're just 16 was the
best and I hope to make special 17 even
better but I feel like if I bring people
in to help me I can go back to that
schedule of uploading one video a day so
that's the plan that's the goal for this
year so other than just losing the
momentum and the motivation to continue
making videos every single day I've just
been dealing with other personal stuff
with my life and family and
relationships so it's kind of it also
that's kind of what's also impacting me
as well so you got that for one side and
then you got the other stuff and the
other side everything just being like
combined to make everything worse so
that's kind of what's happening I don't
want to give you guys too much detail
because it's so you guys don't even care
but anyways I'll be back in full force I
would say hopefully in a few months
thing guys so much for your support past
few months been crazy love you guys
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next video
