with another unboxing slash giveaway
today we are looking at a popular iPhone
5 case from EXO vault this is the EXO
vault nickles ERCOT composite and it
goes for around 2:30 so their products
come inside this neatly packed wooden
case with a clear slidable cover on top
inside they include a business card with
some support information and they also
provides you with a screwdriver for
installation along with two spare screws
so this case is made out of a strong
phenolic resin composite core and POW
Farrell veneer which is capped on the
ends with impact resistant nickel plated
aluminum material you can also see the
precise cutouts on all four sides of the
case here for an easy access to all of
your buttons and ports and we'll go and
take a closer look at this once I
install the phone the installation of
this case is really easy so I'm gonna
fast forward or quick you just remove
all four screws on each corner remove
the cover
insert your phone and then replace the
cover and put back all four screws so
this is no ordinary case EXO vault is
one of the very few case companies that
provide low volume products and what
that means is they take the utmost care
and crafting each one of their cases
which are machined and finished by hand
in Brooklyn and I completely agree when
they say that mass-produced products
lose their individuality and integrity
in order to appeal to a wide and bland
demographic there are hundreds of case
companies that mass-produced in the
cases really just become another number
so here is what the phone looks like
after installing the case and you can
really see how accurate the side cutouts
are giving you plenty of room to access
all of your buttons with ease a lot of
companies struggle with this and it's
nice to see that extra vaulting
compromise their case designs with
accessibility and you can also add skins
to your phones like I did here in the
video to make your phone stand out even
more so this case is available on their
website EXO Volcom and they carry a wide
variety of iPhone 4 and 5 cases in
different materials such as aluminum
brass composite titanium and wood so
definitely check them out if you are
interested and even if you don't have an
iphone these cases make great gifts so
overall I think this is a great case
it's lightweight easy to slide in and
out of your pocket and the most
important factor to me when it comes to
cases is the accessibility of the
buttons and I think that they did a
phenomenal
job on that alright so that concludes
today's unboxing if you guys want a
chance to win this amazing case all you
