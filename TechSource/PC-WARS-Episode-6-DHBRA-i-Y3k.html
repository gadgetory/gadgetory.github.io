hundred bucks if you have a badass PC
you want to submit yours for the show
make sure to watch the video linked down
below for the instructions so level out
seven done let the PC board is beginning
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below so you
can find the pc specs and parts link
down below in the description section
for anyone that is interested but here
are your 5 chosen pcs for this episode
we have bill Chandler Corey Matt and
Maxim or Maxim a congratulations for
making the PC wars episode 6 so pressed
up on the show is Bill and his
water-cooled black and red build running
on a 5820k two gtx 980ti is in sli and
32 gigabytes of ram we also got water
cooling parts from ek and custom red
cables all packed inside the Corsair 900
D case for benchmarks that scored a
twenty nine thousand two hundred eighty
nine but not on five strikes so this
score is pretty relevant overall a very
powerful beast and a great start for PC
Wars thank you Bill for entering the
blizzard built by Chandler is next start
burning on a sixty six hundred K which
is overclocked to four point one
gigahertz it has an EVGA GTX 970
superclocked Edition sixteen gigabytes
of ddr4 Ram and a cooler master hyper
212 Evo to keep the CPU cool some mods
include the silverstone text leads cable
extensions an RGB multicolor LED strip
and a sweet-looking EVGA backplate for
the fire strike benchmark had scored a
ten thousand seventy one putting it in
first place by default but yeah not much
else to say a really good looking black
and white build by Chandler thank you
for entering Chandler not Chandler I was
doing shadow Lear for some reason that's
why I said that Chandler thank you for
entering Cory's next up with a custom
built inside his desk
you heard right folks we have an i7 59
60 X paired with three EVGA gtx 980
superclocked edition inside of his desk
to be truthful i didn't know if he was
entering for a setup wars or pc wars but
regardless it's gonna be tough to beat
so inside this pc or desk depending on
how you look at it we also have 32
gigabytes of kingston hyperx ram 740
gigabytes of SSD space 17 terabytes of
Western Digital hard drive storage and
tons of water cooling parts from ek the
mod list on this bad boy is way too long
so
that'll have the link down below if
anyone is interested but I'll go ahead
and go over a few of them the desk
itself is obviously custom made using
MDF wood we also have a bunch of painted
parts a custom car audio system which is
built into the desk
what the cable management on the other
hand is so damn clean and all the parts
are nicely aligned with each other
definitely one of the more unique builds
I've seen on the channel for benchmarks
that scored a twenty thousand seven
hundred eighty to one five strike which
easily takes the lead for this episode
Corey it's a sick PC build man thank you
for entering okay why the hell would you
drill three holes in such a beautiful
case like this Matt anyway so we have a
4790k with two r9 280x is sixteen
gigabytes of ram from corsair and an h
100 a gtx cooler inside the butchered h
440 case some mods include red sleeve
cables custom painted PCIe brackets
painted SSD and RAM sticks and even the
graphics card brackets are painted red
to match the theme I also like the
modded carbon fiber SLI bridge that you
made very nice touch for benchmarks that
scored on eleven thousand five hundred
eighty eight putting this PC in second
place for this episode but other than
that mess up there with the CPU power
cables the rest of the cable management
is great and this is a very good looking
black and red build thank you Matt for
entering last but not least we have the
ugly beast I'm not even joking that's
the actual name of the PC it's running
on a 5820k which is overclocked to four
point six gigahertz and it's paired with
not one but two r9 290 s it also has 32
gigabytes of kingston ram and a coarser
h 110 cpu cooler ugly beast is the
perfect name for this i mean i know you
can do a better job with that cable
management bro for benchmarks i got a
whopping 19,000 183 putting it right
under the modded desk pc and second
place i definitely think that this pc
has the potential to be a great black
and yellow build but it's really being
overshadowed with those cables but
nonetheless thank you Maxima or Maxim or
