bringing you a special unboxing of the
latest iMac released by Apple just a few
days ago the new models come sporting
Intel's newest processors speedy a
wireless internet capabilities and
improved graphical performance so this
model that we are currently in box C
goes for $19.99 and it comes with the
following specs it has a 27 inch LED
backlit display rocking on a resolution
of 2560 by 1440 it runs on a three point
four gigahertz quad-core Intel i5
processor it also has eight gigs of RAM
one terabyte hard drive space and this
baby even has an nvidia geforce gtx 775
m graphics card with two gigabytes of
memory they also have built-in stereo
speakers dual mics and a headphone port
and as i mentioned before these models
are now capable of connecting to 802
point eleven AC compatible routers which
means a much higher cap for download
speeds already in up with his specs
portion let's move on to the unboxing
so here you have it the newest timac
Willy's from a Paul one of the things I
love about the iMac unlike the PC it has
everything on display on the top of the
screen you have your 720p HD
front-facing camera along with your
ambient light sensors on the back side
you will find all your necessary ports
on the same side now I know it may seem
pretty inconvenient putting all these in
the back especially the USB ports but
after using the Mac for some time I'm
sure you can get used to it first off
you have your headphone jack Dan USD
card slot for USB 3.0 2 Thunderbolt
ports and you Ethernet port if you
choose to connect your cable on the
opposite side you will find a power
button and in between all these is where
you plug in your power cord I also love
how they created a hole on the stand
making it super easy to connect it's
small things like this that make a huge
difference the iMac also has a tapered
edge measuring at five millimeter at its
thinnest point giving you the look and
feel of a very thin surface also on the
back of the iMac is where the two
microphones are located the first one is
located on top of the Apple logo and
that's used for noise cancellation where
the mic that's on top of the displays
the actual microphone used for input
overall this seems like a really solid
desktop I love the specs on it and the
27-inch screen is ridiculous especially
with that monster resolution you can fit
a lot of stuff into that one screen
making multitasking very easy the video
card is also a huge plus and if you are
like be in edit videos and you can
definitely benefit from that I have
always been a PC guy and I never paid
much attention to Apple products besides
their iPhones but after playing around
with this I can see why IMX are really
popular the price may be really high but
I assure you that you are getting what
you pay for so what have a person are
you guys PC iMac or both let me know in
the comment section down below I believe
there are huge benefits from both sides
that will do it for the unboxing and
overview the new iMac desktop you want
to thank you guys for watching the video

you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
