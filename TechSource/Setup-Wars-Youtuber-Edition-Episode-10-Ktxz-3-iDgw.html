so before I start this episode I need to
address something has been bothering me
for a while I shoulda done this since
the beginning but I'm doing it now and
that's the hate towards the Mac setup so
that they have a MacBook Pro or an iMac
there's a lot of hate going on in the
comment section just because of the
operating system they're running and you
know what it's not fair you guys
disrespecting my guests that are coming
on my channel to be part of this series
it's kind of disrespecting me so I can
ask you guys politely to please tone it
down a bit and if you guys can't leave a
positive criticism or a positive
feedback then don't comment at all it's
basically all I wanted to say thank you
guys again so much for your support and
it's going to start this so we are your
five youtubers for this episode we have
Chaitanya from CG tech Kane from the
channel Cain Abe Sam Beckham salut she

set of fours youtuber edition hey guys
Gigi tech here and I run a channel here
on YouTube well this is my setup so as
you can tell I'm aiming to maintain a
metallic theme while keeping
productivity at its max the monitors I
use are acer 21.5 inch 1080p monitors
these are powered by my macbook pro
which are they dual core i7 and eight
gigs of ddr3 ram the MacBook is sitting
on top of a monitor stand which helps
save some space as per peripherals I'm
rocking the Gmail Bluetooth keyboard and
the Apple Magic Mouse which I love just
because of how clean they look right
behind that is the pluggable USB 3.0
seven port hub this plus my new tech
cameras headphones make editing my
videos a breeze these headphones are on
the Satechi headphone stand which adds a
nice gold touch on the other side of the
desk I have a que ma shi wireless
charger and the taotronics a desk lamp
which is great for when I'm doing work
on the desk
well that is my setup huge thanks to Ed

channel I look forward to seeing you

tour I would just like to take a moment
to thank Edgar for featuring me on his
channel up first are my monitors I have
two 1080p samsung monitors one being 24
inch and the other one being 23 inches I
also have the Razer Levithan sound bar
for peripherals I have the raised
desktop keyboard along with the Razer
abysus Mouse for recording my voice I

my Astro 850 headphones along with my
iphone six-plus and for the desktop

to my channel will be in the description
below don't forget to go and check me
out I see you guys what's up guys Sam
here and here is my current setup I've
designed it to be a mobile workstation
which basically means that anyone can
bring their laptop along plug in a few
necessary cables and boom they're good
to start working with minimal
interruption and speaking of laptop my
whole setup is powered by my mid 2012 13
inch MacBook Pro in the center of my
setup we have the Asus MX 27 9h monitor
which is perfect for editing videos
because of all that screen real estate
on either side of my monitor we have the
super attractive audio engine a 2 plus
speakers in white which are the perfect
size for my desk and then on either side
of those I have these super affordable
cement blocks housing these Edison light
bulbs along with that I have a budget--
LED strip around my desk which in
combination with the Edison bulbs look
wicked in the background of my videos
but anyway that's a super brief overview
of the most noteworthy things about my
setup thanks heaps to Ed for having me
on and I'd love for you guys to come and
check out my channel we are having
plenty of fun over there so hopefully
I'll catch you guys later
yo guys what is going on it is so lush
here and this is my setup starting off
with my monitors I've got three Acer G
24 GH l wall-mounted monitors with green
LEDs surrounding them for my peripherals
I'm rocking the SteelSeries sensei
Gaming Mouse the Coolermaster CM storm
keyboard and that is all held together
by the glorious PC
Gaming race extended Mouse map for my
microphone I'm rocking the blue Yeti
original that is held on the blue Yeti
shock mount which is actually attached
to the road psa1
boom arm in the corner I have a small
21.5 inch Toshiba television desk
mounted and that is actually hooked up
to my Xbox one now for the heart of my
setup this is my computer and everything
is wrapped up in the cooler master k3 8

thank you to EDD for having me on the
show I hope to see you guys over at my
channel thank you very much for watching
hey guys take from here today I'll show
you guys my long-awaited setup video
photo monitor I use the AOC I - 379
because it is an affordable monitor as
well as having an IPS display 23 inches
also perfect for my needs
and has a borderless design for the
keyboard I'm currently using the CM
storm quickfire rapid eye 10 keyless
mechanical keyboard these are with
Cherry MX brown switches and they are
really tactile with really nice
backlighting I use the Razer Taipan of
the mouse as it is perfect for gaming
and work for a computer I'm using the
MacBook Pro 13 inch with Retina display
so I personally really like the Mac
system as it is more friendly for work
this is put on to a 12 South Burkhardt
mod which minimizes death space and also
has a cable management system which
keeps the desk screen and finally I use
the Bose QuietComfort 3 acoustic
headphones as these are really good
noise cancelling headphones for music so
