PSP was released in early 2012 but the
new model known alternatively as the
Vita 2000 or simply the Vita slim has
finally come to us Shores
this is ad from Texas and let's take a
closer look the black model will debut
with Borderlands 2 and an 8 gigabyte
memory stick which is not a bad deal
considering you get all this for only
$1.99 there are a total of 6 colors to
choose from however the black model is
the only one available in the US there
might not be a big leap from the
original Vita but it's evolutionary
changes are welcome it's lighter and
thinner than the original model and it
includes 1 gigabyte of on-board storage
Sony did however change the OLED display
from the old Vita to an LCD panel we
will have to wait and see how that looks
when we play with the device so what's
included with the PS Vita slim you may
ask well you came to the right place
instead of the game disk you will find
the game code written on this which you
can redeem via the PlayStation Store and
here is the 80 gigabyte memory stick
that comes with the PS Vita moving
forward we have a welcome booklet in two
languages followed by some more
paperwork including the safety guide for
charging you have your microUSB cable
power cable and the power brick finally
we have the PS Vita it definitely feels
slimmer than the previous model there is
no question there it feels as if I'm
holding a very white smartphone it
almost seems a natural to me because of
how slim it is maybe it's just me but I
prefer handheld consoles to be much
thicker for a more comfortable grip
design wise there aren't really any
differences from the PS Vita a 5-inch
display sits in the middle and on both
sides are the same layout of buttons and
analog sticks they also brought over the
point 3 megapixel front-facing camera on
the bottom of the PS Vita you have your
micro USB port which was converted from
their proprietary charging port that
they had in the previous models you also
have your headphone port and memory card
slot on top of the PS Vita are both
triggers volume buttons game
a lot the LED indicators and the power
button the screen size however is the
same coming in at a resolution of 960 by
540 4 which might seem subpar by today's
standards but it is plenty for handheld
gaming and you will hardly notice the
difference
flipping the device over we can see a
newer layout of the touchpad along with
the rear facing camera up top
unfortunately like the last olvida the
newer model still only accepts memory
cards that are made by Sony which is
probably my biggest complaint with this
device did I mention that the PS Vita is
slim it's literally double the thickness
of the iPhone 5s using the PS Vita we
can see that the new LCD panel isn't
that bad by comparison it doesn't have
quite the same deep saturation as last
year's OLED model but the screen does
provide for more natural color tones and
it did not seem washed out at all it's
not an improvement over last year's
model but it's definitely not worse it's
just different I have never really gone
into mobile gaming I've always been the
traditional console and PC gamer but
after using the Vita for a couple of
days now I can say that Sony has done a
good job I can stream my ps4 games as
well as enjoy exclusive content that's
only available on the Vita the things
that I hate about the Vita are the fact
that I have to purchase Sony memory
cards which are overpriced instead of
buying aftermarket SD cards and secondly
the comfort level is just not there for
me it's great that they made a slimmer
but people that have large hands will
find it hard to get used to personally
I'll be sticking with my PC and ps4
since I don't do a lot of traveling but
to anyone that likes handheld and is on
the go constantly this is a no brainer
