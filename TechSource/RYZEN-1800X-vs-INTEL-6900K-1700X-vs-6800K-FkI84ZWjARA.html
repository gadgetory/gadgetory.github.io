finally have competition once again I
have with me all three rise in CPU the
1800 X 1700 X and these 1700 but in this
video going to be comparing the 1800 X
and the 1700 X against the direct
competition di 760 900 km v 6800 K in
the later video I will be comparing
these 1700 against the 7700 K so be sure
to stick around for that as well so the
new rising 7 CPUs are all 8 cores 16
thread processors and here are their
respective prices and TDP the most
notable being the 1700 which has the
lowest TDP in any 8 core processor in
the market very impressive numbers on
paper to say the least $500 for an 8
core processor is unheard of but is it
too good to be true we're going to take
a look at performance per dollar as
always at the end of this video so make
sure to stick around now obviously
there's a lot of exciting stuff with
AMD's new processors and there is just
too much to cover in this video which is
why I'm holding it off for a separate
video because I know a lot of you guys
are here for the benchmarks only I have
to test beds set up for this comparison
1 for AMD which features the new MSI X
370 X gaming titanium motherboard 16
gigs of ram from crucial clocked at 2400
megahertz
the be quiet silence loot cooler and an
EVGA GTX 1080 for the wind graphics card
while the Intel testbed features the a2
Strix x99 gaming motherboard the same 16
gigs of ram from crucial the same EVGA
GTX 1080 FTW card 1200 watt power supply
and the 110 I cooler both from coarser
it's also important to note that all the
drivers are up to date and I'm using the
latest BIOS update that was sent to me
from AMD
I'll also be sure to follow up with
these numbers as new drivers become
available and bugs get fixed so I'll be
showing the benchmarks from the stock
frequencies as well as overclocked
I managed to push the 89 X 2 4 gigahertz
and the 79th of X 2 3 point 9 which I'm
still not proud of I kind of expected
more Headroom on these new processors
considering I was able to achieve an
extra 1.2 gigahertz on these 6900 K the
first test was Cinebench the 18 X scored
a little higher on stock frequencies but
after overclocking the 60 manager K shot
up to 1800 which was surprising then we
got the 60
educating down there which is to be
expected since it's only a six core
processor it can't quite hang with the
big boys yet next up we have handbrake
which is an open-source video transcoder
so i transcoded a 60 second raw 4k video
file using the h.264 codec and here are
the render times lower obviously being
faster both the 18 and 17 processors
beating out the 6900 k on stock
frequencies while the overclocked 6900 k
takes the lead once again in render
times similar numbers for the Vegas Pro
editing programs rendering out a 60
second real 4k file was faster on the
6900 k once overclocked but not by much
it appears that both the 800 X and the
17 FX processors are faster than the
6900 k when it comes to multi-threaded
applications on stock frequencies which
is interesting
once over clocks though is a different
story but how does it perform in gaming
the first up we have ashes of the
singularity it appears both Intel CPUs
performed better during the CPU focused
benchmark for ashes we're looking at
around 30 percent difference in speeds
compared to the 60 900k not a huge
difference in battlefield 1 since it's
more of a GPU intensive game but we can
see that the 6900 K is still a lead by
four fps followed closely by the 1800 X
on dual is what we start to see
something interesting
even a 6800 K perform better than both
rising chips despite it having two less
physical cores granted this was done in
OpenGL instead of Vulcan where Andy
would have surely done better if the
game didn't keep crashing on me I would
have given you guys scores on that as
well but OpenGL was the only stable
option for me at the time for the three
is the new game I add it to my
benchmarks to spice it up a bit and we
can see that the sixty nine hundred K is
about 17 percent faster than the 1800 X
and stock frequencies while these 6800 K
and the 1800 X are pretty much neck and
neck the gap in performance increases as
we overclocked both CPUs hitman
absolution same things only different
there's a gap in performance is much
higher the 1600 K is 24% faster and
stock frequencies compared to the 1800 X
Metro last light being more of a GPU
intensive game we can see similar
numbers across all the CPUs except the
60 manager K once again
this TPU is clearly on steroids and
finally we got gta5 looks like the 1,800
X and 6800 K are both neck-and-neck the
1700 X with slightly lower frames and
the 6900 carry way up there with a 20
FPS gap that's a 14% increase in
performance before I share my opinion
let's take a look at these performance
per dollar as expected at 6,900 K gives
you the worst value out of the rest with
a point ten frames per dollar average
compared to the 1800 X's 17 frames per
dollar which is nearly double not even
though it shows that the 6800 K gives
you the most value for your money you
have to keep in mind that these scores
are only for the gaming benchmarks and
it doesn't take into account the
rendering speeds where these 6800 K does
totally the best bang for your buck CPU
is the 1700 X followed by the eighteen
hundred's when taking gaming and
productivity into account so conclusion
time based on the benchmarks in the
video and the performance per dollar it
honestly doesn't make any sense to me
why you wouldn't go with a rising CPU
for your next PC in the end you get a
solid 8 core processor for only $500 or
$400 with slightly lower clocks the
value is definitely there whether you
are gaming or using a PC for
productivity or both it just makes sense
going with either the 1700 X or the 1800
X CPU there is no question there however
and there's always it however if you're
one of those elitist and extreme PC
enthusiasts that wants the best for
their PC no matter the cost then
obviously the 6e manager K is the better
option
you just have to overpay for it and by
overpay I mean paying double the price
which is ridiculous if you want the best
bang for your buck
Rison is the way to go either way I'll
drop a link to all the processors

are excited for my other comparison or
if you enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching and I will see you in
