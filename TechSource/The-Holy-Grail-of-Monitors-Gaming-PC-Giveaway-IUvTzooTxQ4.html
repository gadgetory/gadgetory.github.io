Nvidia for not only sponsoring this
video but also hosting a giveaway on
this custom-built
gaming PC from GeForce garage to learn
how to enter stay tuned for more info
ladies and gentlemen right here in front
of me is any gamers dream set up we got
a dope custom pc built by GeForce garage
that's rockin a 70 20 x8 core processor
we also got 16 gigs of ram and the
mighty 1080 TI founders Edition but what
I'm really excited about and what you
should be excited about is this the new
Acer X 27 predator gaming monitor this
thing has all the bells and whistles any
game mode wants I'm talking 4k
resolution g-sync HDR 144 it's refresh
rate all on an IPS panel and that is
what's got me really interested I've
seen similar specs like these on TN
panels but I can't really use those
because of the poor color accuracy as
someone who loves gaming and also making
a living on content creation this
monitor gives me the best of both worlds
alright guys so before we jump into the
gaming performance we're gonna try and
overclock the CPU it is using a 7 a 20 X
8 core processor so I usually can hit
around 4.5 to 4.6 gigahertz easily so
I'm gonna try and see how much I can
push that so let's do start the PC and
get it to BIOS alright guys so we're
able to push the CPU to 4.6 gigahertz at
one point to five volts anything after
that the pce becomes unstable and keeps
crashing so I'm gonna lower back down to
four point six and I'm gonna put the CPU
core voltage back to one point two to
five I'm also going to set the frequency
of the DRAM to 3,000 megahertz I'm also
going to increase the voltage of the RAM
to one point three five as well we'll
hit f10 save the changes and run some
benchmarks alright so after the CPU
overclock we got a score of 2007
compared to 1624 on Cinebench r15 that's
a 20% gain just by overclocking the CPU
alright guys so now it's time to
overclock the 1080 Ti to try and get
more performance out of it
gonna be gaming in 4k resolution so
obviously makes sense to overclock it so
I do have MSI Afterburner
open enough person we're gonna do is
increase the power limit all the way to
the max and down here we're going to be
basically messing around with the core
clock any memory clock until we hit a
stable number so we're gonna gradually
increase the core clock until we hit a
stable amount so usually I try to
increase it by 25 megahertz increments
and I run the heaven benchmark in the
background to see how stable it is if it
crashes obviously we have to lower the
amount if it doesn't then I can go back
and slowly increase the amounts so I'm
going to mess around with the core and
memory clock until I find a stable
frequency and I'll be right back alright
guys so we got some impressive numbers
off the 1080 Ti I was able to add an
extra 125 megahertz on the core clock
and an extra 600 50 megahertz on the
memory clock all keeping the GPU between
80 to 83 degrees so very impressive
numbers more importantly we want to see
the performance difference before and
after the overclock so here is a chart
with the full benchmark numbers
comparing before and after benchmarking
as well as benchmarking with HDR enabled
because HDR does in fact impact GPU
performance
speaking of HDR let's take a closer look
at the X 27 uh guys this is one of the
very few gaming monitors out there that
not only has a 4k resolution but also
144 Hertz refresh rate IPS panel and
because of these specs you're gonna pay
a premium on top of that it does have
g-sync HDR and very accurate color space
making it perfect for gamers who also do
professional work it uses quantum dot
technology and has a 384 zone full array
direct backlight it's also got dcpip
three color gamut which translates to
over 99% srgb I mean this is all around
the perfect monitor for me because not
only can i game on it but I can also use
it for professional work because of the
color accurate display I no longer need
to use two separate monitors one for
gaming and one for productivity this is
pretty much the olden one for me design
wise it's not a bad looking monitor I
mean
fan of the thicker than average bezels
or the aggressive stand which by the way
has the predator DNA written all over it
I know it's made for gamers but
personally I prefer a more minimalistic
design luckily it does have a VESA mount
option so I'll be mounting this to my
desk so the stand itself has a lot of
adjustability it can swivel it can tilt
and of course it's height adjustable as
well and on the back you'll find a
handle which makes it easy to carry
around also behind the monitor
underneath this cover you'll find all
the ports you get usual one display one
HDMI and four USB 3.0 ports you can
actually use them as pass-through if you
use the provided USB pass-through cable
you get two USB three on the side and
two more on the back and of course it
can't be a gaming monitor without LED
lighting this monitor actually has two
points of lighting you got one going
horizontally underneath the base of the
monitor and there's also one on the back
it's not fully RGB but you do have the
option to choose from several different
colors as well as several different
effects now the lights don't get that
bright guys so you can't really notice
them during the day the only time you'll
notice that even if it's at full
brightness is when you're gaming at
night it kind of gives off this nice
ambient effect all right now let's look
at the screen because at the end of the
day that's what matters the most once I
turn it on I immediately noticed how
vibrant the colors were also because
it's an IPS panel it's got great viewing
angles all right let's talk gaming so
once I overclocked the screen to 144
Hertz through the Nvidia control panel
things got heated combined with the four
millisecond response time and gsync
everything was smooth it was night and
day coming for my 75 Hertz ultra light
back at home I noticed a huge
improvement in my reactions
I was also responding quicker to enemies
and overall increased my accuracy in
games let's take a closer look at the
HDR technology inside the monitor on
paper it's supposed to enhance the
viewing experience it's supposed to give
it vibrant colors and lifelike colors as
well so I'm gonna load up some content
and watch some Netflix videos and play
some games and see
if there's a real difference between SDR
and HDR alright guys so I loaded up
black mirror my favorite series on
Netflix to show you the difference
between SDR and HDR by the way guys the
camera does not do any of this justice
if you really want to see an experience
that do you have to see it in person
this is the best scene that we can find
to really show you the difference on
camera between SDR on the left and HDR
on the right the first thing you guys
can notice is the level of contrast the
colors on the right are more vibrant
compared to kind of the washed out
colors on the left side if you guys take
a look at his face you can tell that the
shadows are more prominent and the
orange is actually more vibrant on M
compared to the SDR image the darker
scenes obviously are more darker on HDR
and the brighter scenes are more
brighter you guys can tell by just
looking at the sky and also these
shadows on his jacket it really does
come down to personal preference if
you're someone who likes to watch
content that has more contrast and more
poppy colors than Asia it's definitely
something you're gonna enjoy alright so
now let's load up some games and see the
impact that HDR has on the games destiny
- looks incredible on HDR the colors
definitely look more vibrant with great
dynamic range I can actually see the
different colors in the sky
compared to SDR another thing I noticed
is the level of contrast once again the
darks are much darker and some colors
even look slightly saturated which gives
it that extra lifelike look I want to
switch back down to SDR I immediately
noticed the difference in the level of
contrast the colors don't pop out
anymore and they seem pretty washed out
destiny 2 is definitely one of the games
you want to play in HDR so in conclusion
this is by far the best gaming monitor I
have reviewed on the channel but it's
not for everyone not only do you need
the hardware to take full advantage of
this monitor but you're gonna be paying
a pretty penny for it in order to take
advantage of the full 144 it's refresh
rate and play in 4k resolution with
maxed out settings you're gonna need
some high-end hardware I'm talking a
multi GPU set up at least and even then
most games aren't optimized for SLI
support so hitting that 144 FPS cap is
going to be
difficult with the current hardware
that's available otherwise for those of
you who are just looking for the best of
the best out there and don't care about
the cost then this is it ladies um you
cannot get anything better than this
right now in the market in terms of
gaming and productivity this pretty much
has the best of both worlds all right
