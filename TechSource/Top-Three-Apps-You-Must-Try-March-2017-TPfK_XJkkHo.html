and welcome back to the March episode of
top three apps
you must try just like the previous
episodes all these apps are available
for free and the links will be in the
description below first up we have war
robots available on Android and iOS this
game is a free-to-play third-person
shooter that puts you on the frontline
of hectic 6 vs 6 robot battles the
objective of the game is very
straightforward capture all five of the
beacons or take out the enemy team to
win the deep level of customization in
this game will definitely keep players
coming back for more you can choose from
24 robots with their own strengths as
well as over 20 different types of
weapons that can be selected to best
match your playing style the overall
simplicity of war robots makes it a
must-have for anyone that wants an
engaging game that they can just pick up
and play at any time so number two we
have photomask which is an extremely
helpful tool for solving mathematical
formulas and equations the app goes
above and beyond the conventional
calculator by being able to provide the
answer to a question using the camera on
your smartphone
once the instant result is given fotomat
will also detail step-by-step
instructions on how to solve it and
achieve that same answer that's pretty
damn cool it's available on Android and
iOS for free but there is an in-app
purchase which unlocks slightly more
detailed mathematical explanations to
the solve equation the app will not only
read text but handwritten problems as
well which makes it a great tool for
students and it can save you a lot of
time there's also a smart calculator
feature that will continually update in
real time based on a formula or equation
that is being typed our final apps for
this episode is bullet Forest and
personally it's one of my favorite
mobile first-person shooter games this
is a fast paced free-to-play title which
is available for Android and iOS as
always the game takes a lot of
inspiration from a popular series such
as battlefield and Call of Duty offering
similar features such as weapon class
customization and popular game modes
this includes team deathmatch we for all
conquest and gun games what really
impressed me though was the wide
selection of maps which kept the game
very refreshing if you've ever played a
mobile first-person shooter before then
the control should come to you very
naturally if you find a first-person
shooters and want to kill some time on
the go
this game is definitely for you
that is it for this episode as always if
you guys enjoyed this month's elections
