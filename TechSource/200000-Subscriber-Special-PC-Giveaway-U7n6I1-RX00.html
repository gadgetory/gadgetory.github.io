gonna wing it hopefully it doesn't tank
pretty bad but I'm also gonna do the one
take I'm not gonna edit or script or
whatever
first and foremost 200,000 subscribers

I'm feeling right now I had I couldn't
sleep as past few days I came to this a
lot sooner than I expected it's supposed
to happen in December but it happened
early thank you guys so much for this
achievement it means so much to me and I
honestly wouldn't be here without every
single one of you guys if I can reach
inside the camera and give you guys a
hug
I would but fortunately I'm stuck here
but I know it sounds redundant every
time a youtuber reaches a milestone you
thank their subscribers which they
should because you guys are the reason
why we are here but it's really true

making my dream a reality and for that
I'm very grateful

for this this is this is an amazing at
you I can't even I can't even describe
it I guess it's crazy its I do want to
say this it is a lot of work no matter
how easy everyone makes it seem or how
easy I make the seem sitting here in
front of the camera it really is and
there's so much stress involved there's
so much work that gets and put in these
videos I can show you guys the office
right now in fact let me show you real
quick there's been a lot of stress
recently actually is past few months
I've been doing these videos by myself
I've mentioned a few times and it's not
easy putting up three four videos a week
by just myself so I brought over my
cousin Bob from Texas he actually helped
out some of the videos in the past if he
has been with the channel for a while
you guys already know who he is but he's
coming back he's gonna be helping out a
lot with the videos especially with the
iPhone 6s launch hopefully we can put
out five and six videos a week for you
guys that's the plan I was supposed to
announce to giveaway in December but
apparently it happened earlier so I'm
going to be doing another PC giveaway
it's gonna happen in October hopefully
you guys can stick around for that but
that's basically all I wanted to say
thank you guys so much for your support
is amazing
honestly I can that's crazy it's it
really is crazy I cannot just can't you
can you can tell I can't even like say
the words it's I can't describe it but
it's amazing I got up every morning with
a big smile on my face to make videos
for you guys

rest of my life I do this as a passion I
love making videos I love making tech
