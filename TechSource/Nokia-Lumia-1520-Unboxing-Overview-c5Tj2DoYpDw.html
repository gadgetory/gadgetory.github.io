Texas and today we're gonna look at
Nokia's new Lumia 1520 smartphone this
has a six inch 1080p display which makes
it the first Nokia to use a 1080p
display and the phone is powered by a
Snapdragon 800 processor with 2 gigs of
RAM
unlike other smartphones the Lumias have
all their buttons on one side the volume
rockers the power button along with the
camera button all located on the right
side and on the top of the phone you'll
find the headphone jack right in the
center which actually bothers me a lot I
prefer the jack to be on one side of the
device and on the other side of the
phone you have both the SIM card and SD
card slot which means that you can
upgrade the memory up to an additional
64 gigabytes of space if needed I
believe the best feature on this phone
is definitely the camera while the front
facing camera sports only a 1.2
megapixel camera the back has a whopping
20 megapixels which is perfect for
anyone who likes taking a lot of
pictures and wants to be able to zoom in
and crop their photos all the way on the
bottom of the phone you will also find
three
which I use for wireless charging along
with the phone speakers and a micro USB
charging port overall the device feels
really nice in my hand I gotta say that
I'm a fan of the matte finish which
feels really smooth and despite its size
it's actually really light
although the 1520 may feel comfortable
to hold it can't be used with one hand I
actually have large hands as you can see
here and I still have trouble using the
phone I can't reach the top of the
screen with my thumb so I have to
reposition my entire hand in order to
achieve this as I said before the camera
is a huge part of the phone so I decided
to take a few pictures and compare it to
my iPhone 5s right off the bat you can
already tell the whites are more
accurate on the 15:21 looking at the
wall on this outdoor shot
however the roles are reversed when
taking picture indoors the iPhone 5s
does a lot better under unnatural light
settings if you take a look at the
blacks on here on the table but in
natural settings which is where you will
most likely be in the 1520 wins hands
down the pictures are more colorful and
more accurate the overall design is very
similar to the other phones in the Lumia
lineup being constructed of the same
polycarbonate material gives the device
a similar feel the Lumia 1520 is the
best Windows Phone by far I'm personally
not a fan of Windows Phones because of
its lacking app ecosystem but Nokia on
the other hand makes some fantastic
hardware to whoever prefers a simplistic
UI that has no lag and it's not a fan of
Android or iOS a windows phone is
definitely option you should consider so
that wraps up the unboxing and overview
of the Lumia 1520 let me know what you
guys think about the phone in the
comment section down below and as always
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
