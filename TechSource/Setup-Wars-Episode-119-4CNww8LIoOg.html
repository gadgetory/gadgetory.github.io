the worst setup edition aka the potato
edition of setup wars which is
everyone's favorite but if you guys
remember I think a few weeks ago I said
that I was gonna do something completely
different than the usual worst setup
edition so basically I'm going to be
doing a roast my set up kind of themed
with the episode obviously for fun none
of us should be taken seriously just for
entertainment and people who submit
their setups actually want to
participate in the work roast my setup
so what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna
be posting the people's set up on my
Twitter account and I want you guys to
reply with your worst roasts ever I want
you guys go ham on these setups and
maybe I'll feature your tweet or your
comment in the episode so I think it's
gonna be fun
just to change things up obviously
technology with spice that is the model
of tech source I like to constantly
change things up but anyways I'm done
rambling welcome to setup wars episode
119 let the setup wars begin kicking off
the episode and our underwear as well is
Alex and his crazy battle station it's
about time we saw another amazing black
and blue setup it's actually a
custom-built desk that was designed by
him and CAD with cable management and
mind even the table legs were custom
designed to be perfectly organ on achter
his body very impressive so he's walking
three issues 24 inch monitors that are
resting on his custom-made monitor riser
you guys might be wondering where his pc
is and I bet you my channel tech source
that you'll never figure out what he did
with it
we'll get into that later though on the
desk he's got the corsair strafe RGB and
the Logitech g600 but he does have a
wireless keyboard as well when he wants
to watch TV from his bed but check out
the speaker placement looks like he
hooked up his Harman Kardon sound sticks
on the ikea capitol eggs it's not even
sitting on a shelf I'm not exactly sure
how he did that but that looks pretty
cool okay so the cable management is
where it gets interesting so check this
out guys not only did he hide all the
cables behind his desk but he even
crammed his PC in here the desk he is
using is actually the case for his PC I
haven't seen
a set up quite like this before as
pretty hilarious if you guys look
closely the motherboard actually has
sand off screws installed on it so it's
not just laying inside there so I will
give him props for that I don't know I
mean personally I would build a
good-looking PC and put that on top of
the desk but I get that sometimes you
want a clean look without a giant
rectangular case taking up the space on
the desk aside from the Harman Kardon
sound sticks he has a pair of em 50 X's
and the wireless H 600 headset from
Logitech which he uses with his wireless
keyboard if he wants to watch TV from
his bed I can't help but notice that his
entire room is so clean there wasn't any
crap on the floor the trash bin is empty
his bed is actually made I mean he
really did put an effort to clean up his
room and set up before taking pics and I
can definitely appreciate that I feel
like the only thing that can make this
setup even more awesome is a new paint
job I feel like the wood colour is
throwing everything off personally I
would paint it either black or pick up
some black carbon fiber skins to cover
up the surface but it's up to you an
awesome setup indeed thank you for
entering toning it down a bit we got
Gavin and a more simple gaming setup
featuring the IKEA mom desk he's walking
a 27-inch monitor from Samsung and the
Philco majesty board and the Logitech G
4-3 wireless mouse I actually had to
look up his keyboard and I found out
that it costs $200 $200 for a wireless
gaming keyboard that is insane and looks
like the only audio source is got are
the Atom audio artist 5 monitor speakers
the funniest thing about this setup is
the chair I mean I'm expecting someone
who's rocking a 200 dollar keyboard to
have something maybe a little fancier
then again the ergonomics of that chair
looks amazing and it kind of matches the
water-cooled PC so this is project tiny
and it's rocking a 7700 K and an EVGA
GTX 1080 founders edition with 16 gigs
of RAM this thing has so much power in
such a tiny space and finally we got
everyone's favorite part the cable
management which is pretty much flawless
excellent work here I have no complaints
there isn't any personality or a
specific color scheme and he's pretty
much using a jank
chair but you know what the setup works
and he's done a really great job
organizing everything something tells me
that Gavin is a type of guy who cares
more about the gear he is using then
it's actual appearance or color scheme
but then again that chair is kind of
going against whatever I just said but
anyways well done on your setup thank
you for entering up next is Jesse and
his quad display setup featuring three
27-inch AOC monitors and a Visio TV as
an overhead display jesse was so
determined to make all three monitors
fit on his ikea add-on unit that even
put up some 3d printed blocks near the
edges to help support it that is
definitely an interesting approach even
went as far as to paint them in white so
it doesn't stand out as much the desk is
using consists of three separate like
key alignment table tops that he
connected together with two Alex drawers
underneath the main setup now I don't
know how tall you are but for me
personally there wouldn't be any legroom
down there look how close both of the
drawers are together now Jesse if you're
watching this and you really need that
extra leg room then I strongly recommend
you to follow this simple modification
okay so we move the back corner leg of
the two side tables you have and move
over both of your Allen drawers so that
half of it is supporting the side table
and the other half is still under the
main tabletop this way you get more
space in the middle without affecting
any support he does have a black and
green color scheme and what better gear
to go with then the Razer BlackWidow
chroma and the Ouroboros mouse with a
colossus extended mouse pad keeping with
the Razer theme we got the Man O'War
gaming headset and the razer seiren
USB microphone he also has quite the
console collection he's got a ps4 pro
and Xbox one which I'm assuming because
he does have an Xbox controller and the
HTC vive to keep him entertained and of
course we can't forget his Razer themed
PC rocking and MSI GTX 1080 and a 67 2k
with a stock heatsink cable management
can easily be improved by using a cable
box to hide the power strip and even
some 3m tape to mount those power bricks
underneath the table instead of having
them just hang
like that with some minor tweaks you can
definitely improve this pretty sweet
gaming setup Thank You Jesse for
entering next up is Jesse once again it
looks like actually now this is a
different Jesse but we're changing
things up from the PC master-race and we
are taking a look at yet another clean
Mac setup powering the setup is the late
2011 27-inch iMac and sandwiching that
he's got two KRK Rokit speakers Jesse
realized he didn't have space on his
desk and I'm guessing he didn't want to
drill holes in his wall either so
instead he picked up these speaker
stands and placed them next to his desk
and I gotta say guys it looks super
clean guys remember the last episode I
was actually talking about putting
speakers on speaker stands next to your
setup well this is the perfect example
speaking of clean he decided to stick
with the Apple wireless keyboard but he
upgraded his mouse to the MX master I'm
not sure what mousepad he is using but
it looks very comfortable and even comes
with a wrist rest keeping the setup from
looking plain he did add some stuff on
the add-on unit like a silver skull a
plant and the popular IKEA lamp with an
RGB bulb cable management looks pretty
good it looks like he hooked up the
Signum against the back portion of the
desk and he even used some velcro to
keep the wires together not a bad job he
even squeezed in a USB hub underneath
the add-on unit and hooked up the wall
Raceway to cover up the cables from the
iMac if I clean and organizing
productivity setup Thank You Jessie
number 2 for in train wrapping up the
episode and putting our underwear back
on is Jojo and his black and red setup
he's rocking the Acer 27-inch monitor
and the Corsair k70 keyboard with the
m65 Pro RGB Mouse I get that you want to
stick with Corsair gear but the yellow
border on the extended mousepad kind of
goes against the whole color scheme oh
look he's even using the same speakers
as me the Edifier a 25s which are
absolute beast speakers it's resting on
a monitor riser that he made using for
capitol eggs from Ikea and on a riser
he's got quite a few tech the original
ps4 console and eight terabyte backup
external hard drive from Seagate and a
seven port USB hub in addition to the
speakers he's also got the coarser void
while
this gaming headset what's interesting
about this setup is where the TV is
mounted I'm not sure if that's more
comfortable for him or what but it's
interesting that he didn't mount it
above his monitor like everyone else I
just think that the long mounting arm
looks bizarre and it's definitely out of
place but hey if it's working out then
more power to you he does have a 2015
MacBook Pro that he uses for work but
the main PC that's powering this setup
has a 6600 K and an Rx for ad from XFX
it's a good looking PC and I like the
fact that you skins one of us as these
with carbon fiber but why did you leave
the other one alone cable management
seems to be under control for the most
part the Signum is holding up majority
of the cables and then we got this
strange-looking power strip that's also
hooked up against a table using some 3m
tape okay so the color scheme isn't as
consistent as I would have liked and I
feel like it's a simple fix for you
adding some black and red skins to your
MacBook Pro and ps4 will give it more
consistency but again this is your setup
not mine it's a pretty solid gaming
setup aside from a few minor things
Thank You Jojo for entering so that is
it for this episode of setup wars as
