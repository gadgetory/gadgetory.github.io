sponsoring our trip to CES 2017 if
you're looking to spice up your device
with the best skins out there then the
brand is where it's at not only do they
provide the most precise fit out there
but they offer a variety of colors and
materials to choose from for tons of
products out there if you guys are
interested in spicing up your device
make sure to visit them by clicking on
the link below so here we are at the msi
booth and CES 2017 and msi has managed
to amaze me at how many products they
have unveiled to kick things off they
introduced an entirely new lineup of
their z2 70 motherboards for Intel
seventh gen cabby Lake processors amis I
unveil a ton of new motherboards that
covers all types of gamers and I will be
doing a video just on their motherboards
so be sure to stick around for that a
really cool feature that was introduced
to their lineup of boards was an MDOT to
shield which may not seem interesting
but it definitely caught my attention
the shield is used not only to protect
the SSDs against thermal throttling but
it's also used to cover up the ugly PCB
that is present on most MDOT twos
this results in two better-looking pcs
another cool feature is their VR boost
which helps deliver a lag free VR
experience with lower latency and less
chance of motion sickness on top of all
that these motherboards look insane I
would gladly use any of these in my own
personal build they have a variety of
color schemes to choose from and some
even come with RGB lighting like their
gaming m7 and gaming Pro carbon
motherboards MSI also announced a
plethora of gaming laptops with Intel 7
gen CPUs these laptops are expected to
increase up to 25% and just cpu
performance these new laptops also come
with and videos new GT x 1050 TI one
thing msi emphasized during this press
event is that they're not only focusing
on performance but audio as well which
is why their new lineup of laptops will
feature ESS saber hi fight technology
which is essentially a high resolution
audio they showed a demo between regular
audio and their high res audio and there
was definitely a noticeable difference
when PC brands focus on every detail
like this it really separates them from
the competition and that's what I love
to see they also unveiled an all-new
lineup of gaming desktops as well
some of which have been refreshed with
the new z2 70 motherboard the Aegis
series are at the top of MSI's gaming
desktop lineup they've got the new
knight blades which feature both an
update
exterior and interior design while the
Triton series still remain as the
world's smallest VR ready PC to date the
only difference is that it now features
until seventh gen CPUs MSI Gus also
shows some promise by offering a choice
within gamers who want additional
graphics power whether you are stuck
with a laptop with no GPU or just aren't
happy with the performance you have
right now you can actually hook this
thing up via Thunderbolt and immediately
take advantage of a more powerful
graphics card msi is also finally
unveiled their new CPU cooler which was
kind of hinted at Computex last year and
are calling it the core frozen which
honestly looks like a badass CPU cooler
and it's perfect for anyone that wants
to keep the color scheme of their PC
consistent it comes with replaceable
side plates and either white or black
which is really cool and in terms of
acoustics it's said to be very quiet and
attempts are similar if not cooler than
other CPU coolers within the same
bracket and finally they announced a few
gaming gears the GH 70 gaming headset
which features HiFi sound virtual
surround sound and RGB lighting then we
got the clutch gm7 II gaming mouse which
has an 18,000 dpi optical sensor full
RGB mystic lighting and it can be used
both wired or wirelessly by
disconnecting the cable on the mouse and
lastly they have two mechanical gaming
keyboards the vigor GK 80 and the GK 70
that features the new cherry MX silver
speed switches the GK 80 comes with a
detachable wrist rest and has an
aluminum chassis but if you guys want to
see comparison between the two let me
know in the comments below
that pretty much wraps up this overview
from the msi booth here at CES 2017 make
sure you guys stick around for more CES
coverage thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
