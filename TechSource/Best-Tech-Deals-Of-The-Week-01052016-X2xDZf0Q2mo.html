episode of best tech deals of the week
for the first week of January starting
off the new year we have some pretty
sweet deal so let's begin let's first
start off with a great deal on a laptop
if you have $350 to spend towards one I
suggest picking up this Asus 15.6 inch
with a core i three four gigabytes of
ram 500 gigabytes of hard drive space
that comes with Windows 10 a laptop with
these specs in this price bracket is
definitely a great by jumping two TVs
real quick an LG 42 inch 1080p TV is
going for 340 bucks right now which is
currently two hundred twenty dollars off
normally the video shield goes for 200
bucks without a remote but for a limited
time you guys can pick up this entire
bundle with the remote for the same
price for my Halo fans out there the
Guardians limited collector's edition
for the Xbox one dropped in price on
Amazon and I also did a video on it so
if you're curious what it comes with
feel free to check it out if you're
looking for a sweet gaming desk to
change up or even start your own setup
on then the Atlantic gaming desk is
worth looking at there's currently one
more left in stock and it's selling
pretty fast because of the price cut
staying on the topic of games batman
arkham knight for the ps4 is going for
thirty-eight dollars for the physical
copy whereas the digital code is going
for fifty bucks the hell's amazon doing
we also have a pretty sweet wireless
gaming mouse going for 13 bucks that's
available in blue and red and if you
looking for a pair of bluetooth earbuds
under 50 bucks then you should check out
the jar and motion pro sport earphones
which are 50 bucks off right now jumping
into headphones real quick you can find
a pair of sennheiser HD 550 headphones
for a little under 100 bucks and for
those of you that don't know about these
headphones I strongly suggest you to do
some research because these are one of
the best sounding headphones that you
can buy they're comparable to the
popular ath m50 exes but this one is
fifty dollars cheaper for now if you're
in the market for a widescreen monitor
you can find a 22 inch auc monitor going
for only 100 bucks you get a 5
millisecond response time 60 Hertz
refresh rate on an IPS panel with super
thin bezels it's crazy that's going for
only a hundred dollars right now looking
to upgrade your graphics card while the
msi gtx 960 is going for 180 bucks with
a twenty-dollar million rebate which
also comes with a
free copy of heroes of the storm keep
looking for something a little more on
the budget side the XFX r7 370 is going
for 170 dollars with a ten-dollar
mail-in rebate if you're building a
budget gaming PC you can also pick up 8
gigabytes of RAM from crucial for $27 by
using this code on the screen for five
dollars off this one is actually a
really great deal as well a 128 gigabyte
USB 3.0 flash drive for only 29 bucks
but it's only available for Prime
members if you don't have prime you can
find the same deal on newegg and i'll
leave a link to both of them down below
you lack cases for the iphone 6 and 6s
are going for only two dollars if you
put in this code so if you only have two
dollars in your pocket and I looking for
a new case for your phone then you
better jump on this deal right now
because it won't last long next up is a
27 inch IPS monitor from LG going for
170 bucks but the discount lies within
the $35 mail-in rebates last but not
least we have a 90 dollar discount off
of the logitech g930 7.1 surround sound
wireless gaming headset so everything I
mentioned in this video will be linked
down below as always if you guys enjoy
these make sure to hit that like button
