again with another GPU comparison so
this time going to be comparing the GTX
1080 against the EVGA gtx 980ti there
will be plenty more GPU comparisons with
the GTX 1080 so make sure you guys are
subscribed their channel so you don't
miss out so the GTX 1080 founders
edition goes for $6.99 and features a
1607 megahertz base clock which can be
boosted up to 17 33 megahertz and the
gtx 980ti currently goes for 620 which
will most likely get a price cut soon
and it features a base clock of 1102
megahertz and a boost clock of 1190 both
of the cards also featured three display
ports one HDMI and a DVI the 980ti has a
dual link DVI port while the 1080 only
has a digital DVI port let's jump
straight into the benchmark starting off
with fire strike as you can see the GTX
1080 beats the 980ti across the board in
regular extreme and even ultra
benchmarks by a solid amount moving to
heaven 4.0 we can see that the 1080 gets
an average frame rate of 150 7.9 whereas
the 980ti scored only 91 point 4 that's
almost 75% more FPS and 1080p bumping up
the pixel count to 4k we see a
difference of 12 fps similar results
were found on the Metro last light
benchmark with the 1080 nearly doubling
the score of the 980ti
in lower resolutions whereas in 4k there
was only a 5 FPS difference in GTA 5 the
results weren't that drastic the 1080
did push more frames in the 980ti but
only by 14 mostly due to the game being
more CPU intensive rather than GPU and
finally we have the rise of the Tomb
Raider the GTX 1080 got an average frame
rate of 48 point six and the gtx 980ti
scored 41 point two so seems like
there's more of a difference and lower
resolution gameplay and a much less
difference as the quality gets higher
so in conclusion should you buy the GTX
1080 well it depends on what resolution
you are playing for 4k gaming the extra
5 or 10 frames just doesn't justify
spending an extra $700 however if you're
still gaming in 1080p and I
coming from the gtx970 the 980 or even a
980ti
that i would say yes there is definitely
a noticeable difference in performance
on the opposite side of the spectrum
there is still the gtx 1070 card so
instead of grabbing your wallet and
tossing your money at the 1080 honestly
i would advise you to hold on and see
the benchmarks on the gtx 1070 which
I'll be doing on the channel as well
before you spend your hard-earned money
also don't forget the 980 TI will most
likely get a price cut making it more
desirable in the end i would honestly
wait for the price cuts and the release
of the 1070 before tossing any money at
these cards but that's it for the video
thank you guys so much for watching if
you enjoy my quick straight to the point
without wasting any more time benchmark
style videos let me know by dropping a
like and also let me know by leaving
your feedback down below because i will
definitely keep these going on the
channel let me know what other cards you
guys want to see go up against the gtx
1080 and i'll go to add that to my list
that's basically a thing guys so much
for watching and I will see you very
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
