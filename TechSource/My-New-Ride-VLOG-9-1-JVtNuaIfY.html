alright so before I head out to the
dealer and get a few things done
I want a bitch I need to release my
video the chorion benchmarks and gaming
video that I finished yesterday alright
so the four hundred dollar budget pill
right here it was already on my playlist
which is why though it has views and
comments and likes so people managed to
find that before I went live sneaky
bastards and it let's make this public
add a little message he's ready for the
next PC build Save Changes
it is now public and then what I usually
do is I share it on Twitter
Twitter so yes the process of releasing
the video usually I do my videos done
before the next day so I have some
content
alright so now that's done it's gonna
take care of my hair and then I can be
on my way it just started pouring so
hard right now I just had to rain today
there was like no rain this past week of
course it has to be my day alright I'm
all ready to go I just hope you stole my
raining let's find out
so we got some rain it's not as bad as
before it before was like really pouring
there she is my 2013 Scion fr-s this is
his last week so take a good look at it
yeah as you can hear it's still raining
so this time is gonna be really annoying
I'm also not sure exactly what car I'm
gonna get but I do know that I wanna
Lexus and I'm sure by just looking at
the thumbnail or reading the title of
this video you guys probably know what I
went with
unless I keep it hidden from you all
right so the rain has stopped the least
that's a good sign
it's so weird it was like waning in
chatsworth then over here and in
Woodland Hills there are barely any
clouds like really check it out no
clouds what's well some clouds but
for the most part it's pretty clear
check this right out the LFA
and only a sweet-looking ride I don't
know how much this cost holy crap see
three hundred eighty thousand so
basically I'm here waiting for Sabrina
which is the person at the appointment
way so yeah just waiting on that yeah
yeah
oh let junior this is way more advanced
than my forest look at this
so that right there's your speedometer
press this button
whoa we do that again that is that's
what got me about these cars dad is
awesome the indicator compass there's
your radio
so I just test drove the car and I loved
it
now to decide which version to go with
the standard which starts around 40,000
and it's available in the cream white
which or the export version which is
around 44,000 and it comes in the clear
white that I actually like a lot better
so he's gonna bring down the cream color
one downstairs and I'm gonna look at it
in person or on there's sunlight and see
how it looks
there it is this is the cream-colored
white Ken looks like a metallic style
like metallic white it's not like glossy
it's not like a glossy white it looks a
lot better in sunlight as preferred so
these are the two cars it comes down to
d/f sport and the non export family they
don't have the model that I want which
is the stock export version so they're
trying to hassle and haggle me into
buying the one they have here but that's
not what I want I don't want all those
extra features I'm not gonna use it it's
a two-year lease after all and I think
just gonna be wasting money so well that
was a complete waste of time
turns out they don't have the well I
should say Lexus doesn't even have the
model I want built which is the base F
Sport model no dealer around my area has
it pretty disappointed actually I was
looking forward to driving home and a
new Lexus but it is what it is you know
we'll see what happens are so just
gotten used that the dealer and Van Nuys
keys of Van Nuys I think has the model
I'm looking for so right now I'm rushing
over there to see if it's actually true
and then possibly even lease it
hi I'm here to see my mother yes Edgar
guys guess what
oh my god I'm so excited right now so
there you have it
goodbye my baby hello beautiful
it's been fun but I'm sorry for us it's
time to move on to bigger and much
better things look at this you guys I'm
so freaking happy oh my god
words just can't describe my feeling

this isn't this isn't is okay I can't
even talk
