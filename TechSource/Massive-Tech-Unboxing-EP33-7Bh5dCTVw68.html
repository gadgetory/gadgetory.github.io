to another episode of what's in the box
I really hope you guys are enjoying the

source and add the extension to your
browser after that you can start saving
also let me know what you guys think
about our new sets a lot of you know
that we recently moved into our new
office space and we're slowly putting it
together but so far I think this looks a
lot better than the boring white
background so let me know what your
feedback is in the comments section but
what that said let's continue with the
unboxing
so this is from a company called TMR
life and these are pretty much like a
Wemo switch but with RGB lights if that
makes any sense
it is 2018 so why not RGB all the things
but this is pretty much what the socket
looks like there's a ring around and
this is the part that actually lights up
in color and you can control the actual
color of it using your smartphone there
is a power switch on the side if you
want to manually switch it on and off
but obviously the the biggest feature of
this is the ability to turn it on and
off using your smart phone so actually
gonna try it out we're gonna plug it in
and see how accurate it is and also what
the quality is like of the the RGB
lights just because sometimes the lights
are very faint and they're not as bright
so it kind of just makes it useless so
the app is actually very user friendly
at the main page you can see all your
connected smart devices as you guys can
see here I do have the RGB smart plug
once I click on that I have the option
to turn off the actual switch and the
top right corner over here and I also
have the option of changing the color of
the actual ring around it
using the bottom left option that says
color I basically have the option to
choose any color from the RGB wheel and
down here you have the option to lower
the brightness as well as change the
color to simple white if that's what you
guys prefer instead of an RGB color and
last but not least you can even set a
timer for the lights to turn on or off
and you can click on the clock icon
underneath the power button and set a
countdown timer which is pretty cool and
little cool thing about these smart
plugs is that it's compatible with
Amazon Alexa and even Google assistant
but if you guys want to check them out
as always I'll drop a link below along
with anything you see in this video
alright moving on to the next package
oh okay I think I've seen these before
so these are from a company called Nanda
we got the Zeus smart car charger which
I think I featured previously in a video
and these us smart tire safety monitor
so I'm sure a lot of you guys have
actually heard about this the idea
behind it is you plug it into your car
and you can essentially keep track of
where your car is parked or if it gets
stolen and you can also monitor a lot of
things about your car which I'm gonna
demonstrate right after this so other
than locating your car is actually a few
other things you can do within these us
app and monitors your battery life so I
could tell you if there's any potential
issues with charging or voltages and
also send you notifications through your
smart phone and last but not least my
personal favorite feature is actually
the parking meter alert so that safety
Park at a shopping center or a paid
parking location for example meters it
will send you a notification a few
minutes before your time runs out so
that way you guys can avoid penalties or
paying parking tickets so very very
awesome smart charger it actually comes
with two USB ports as well so you plug
this into your car and you can juice up
your devices so yeah very dope product
and of course the next one from nanda is
the smart tire safety monitor so this
one's an interesting product I don't
know if it's for everyone but I'm sure
there are some people out there that
will definitely find it useful
all right so essentially the idea behind
this is you get to monitor all four of
your tires so you got these little
sensors over here that you need to plug
in to the valve so you pop open the
valve cover of your tires and you put
these sensors instead and you have to
plug this part inside your car using the
USB port and these lights over here will
light up green basically letting you
know that only retires are the correct
pressure and there's nothing wrong with
them a few cool features about these is
that it can actually detect slow leakage
so there's this algorithm that detects
slow leaks before it's too late on your
tires so that's pretty cool oh these
also come with anti-theft protection so
for some reason you have really
expensive rims or tires and someone
decides to take them off and steal them
the app will actually send you a
notification saying hey
trying to mess with your tires so that
is actually a pretty cool feature well
you have some pretty cool stuff from
nanda nonetheless check them out if you
guys are interested let's move on to the
next package let's see if I will cut
myself in this episode oh oh okay I'm
not doing that anymore I was I can I can
lose a finger
screw that the entertainment is not
worth it
the views ain't worth it whoa okay look
at this unboxing over here this entire
thing we are one tiny box in here like
what is this alright so ladies and
gentlemen what on earth I've never
actually heard of this before this is
called The Cove commuter it looks like
it's a portable wireless speaker but is
it any good let's check it out it's what
it's what this video is about unboxing
stuff and checking them out and see if
it's actually worth buying I'm here at
the cove commuter yeah me neither it's
interesting because one of those like
amazing quality sounding speakers that
nobody has ever heard of so that is true
we do need a quality speaker for this
office so and okay actually looks pretty
sweet and inside the box we also have a
guessing into the charging cable I'm
assuming microUSB actually no this is
the 3.5 millimeter jack this one is the
microUSB cable unfortunately it does not
come with a power brake so you're gonna
have to find one by yourself so the
build quality is actually pretty decent
it's nice and durable
there isn't any flimsy pieces on here
from what I can see all right on top of
the speaker we have some controls we got
the power switch we have a microphone so
you can accept calls and there's even a
mode to switch between outdoor and
indoor I'm not sure what that does but
we're gonna test it out and over here on
the side we can see the volume control
and also you can see an indicator for
the outdoor and indoor so we're gonna
test that out and see what that is I'm
guessing you can control the volume by
essentially moving this ring over here
left and
which is pretty cool well then that's
pretty much it you got some rubber feet
on the bottom so if you do want to put
this flat on the desk obviously it's not
gonna move around you can even put a
vertical mode because there is some
rubber feet on the bottom here as well
so that is pretty sweet so let's turn
this thing on actually and see if you
can pair this oh that sounds sensual
woah we are paired and let's test it out
you can feel the bass
so I'm gonna cycle between indoor mode
and outdoor mode and see if there's
actually a huge difference so the
difference between outdoor mode and
indoor mode is the volume the max volume
I should say it's a lot louder in
outdoor mode than it is indoor mode
which actually makes sense so if you're
gonna be playing this outside obviously
you want this hooked up to outdoor mode
now final thing I want to test out is
what it sounds like in vertical mode
because the base area is facing
downwards so it's if there's any
difference in the audio quality so yeah
I didn't really hear a difference when
placing in vertical mode and this is a
360 degree speaker or very close to one
so whichever angle you have the space
that it's gonna sound incredible either
way and I'm actually pretty impressed
I've never heard of Cove but this is
gonna be actually a really nice addition
to the office so if you guys are looking
for a solid speaker with amazing bass
and sound clarity you guys definitely
have to check this out I think they sent
a note actually in the box so if you
guys visit coves speakers dot-com slash
tech stores you guys can get sixty five
percent off the price of the speakers
which is insane but yeah I'll drop a
link below if you guys want to check
them out this is honestly I'm loving
this but yeah again thank you co for
setting this in let's move on alrighty
ladies and gentlemen moving ona to let's
open this one this one's only halfway
open cuz Bob couldn't keep his spill T
hands off my packages he thought this
was a pillow he was looking for a pillow
to sleep on our couch this guy but how
do you know what this is B just because
I popped open already so this is merch
it's not my merch just sexually with my
favorite YouTube channels they're
actually like my number one favorite
YouTube channel right now to be honest
I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of
them ladies and gentlemen they are none
other than rock or a cat what up guys
yeah their hoodies look so comfortable
and it looks pretty dope I don't know I
picked it up and it's in red so
yeah I mean not much else really to talk
about if you guys want to check them out
what's what am I even supporting them
but yeah hoodies it feels really soft
and I can't wait to rock them in my
videos but anyways moving on this is
actually the package I've been waiting
for for the longest time guys this is an
addition to the office and I'm not gonna
say what it is obviously I'm just gonna
unbox this video guys but be ready be
ready oh my god what what this is a
5-piece guys this is a five piece
painting ladies and gentlemen the one
and only Goku in ultra instinct mode
this is going on that wall over there
which I'll show you guys it took about
three weeks to come I think it was
coming from Hong Kong or something I'm
looking at the print right in front of
me guys and I gotta tell you in its
high-definition it's printed really well
this is some quality stuff right here so
yeah it's going to put all these five
pieces together it's gonna look sick and
they actually have a bunch of different
Dragon Ball super mural paintings like
this and this is actually the favorite
one this is my one of my favorite ones
that I saw in there so I had to order it
I might order a second one just for my
personal setup though so we won't we
will see you guys we will see I am a
hurry up and finish this unboxing so I
can put together the painting I'm really
like I'm really excited to get it's
legitimately excited
there was something in their eye that
was an act it
oh the they send me more of the plug
this is the same smart plugs that we
opened up earlier so yeah I guess I'll
just should do a giveaway on these we
have two extra ones no all right thought
I'd ask if you guys are gonna hate on
someone hate on Bob he's the one who
said no oh this is just personal stuff
that I bought from Amazon some travel
body wash from Doug it's not sponsored I
promise two guys and then like these are
some scented candles for the home whoo
these are wax oils actually yeah it
smells good that's it was one of the
best sellers on Amazon's my about it
ladies and gentlemen we are to our final
box this is obviously from coarser
judging by the Corsair logo and I think
I know what this is after waiting for
almost a month now
yes it is the keyboard that I have been
waiting for this is not available in the
US unfortunately I cried and of course I
heard my cries and they sent me over
there Limited Edition actually not
really limited edition it's only
available I think in Malaysia or some
some country but this is the k70 RGB SC
and this is the old white and a silver
keyboard
we got Cherry MX speed switches and this
is all fully RGB as well but it's gonna
go really well with my setup and I'm
tired of the old boring black keyboard
so that is why I begged them I literally
begged them to send me one of these so
thank you so much for Sur for hooking me
up I cannot wait to put this in my setup
