and welcome to setup wars episode 140
potato Edition or people around the
world submit their crappy setups just to
be on this episode and as always please
don't take anything I say in this video
seriously because it is done for
entertainment purposes it's not a
serious video and of course the person
with the worst setup will receive $100
and that is up to you guys to vote in
the comment section so with that said
ladies and gentlemen let the setup wars
begin
if Harry Potter had a set up it would
look something like this because this
guy has his setup inside of a closet
under his stairs or at least I think
it's under hysteria judging by the slant
Kristian is currently working in a
supermarket until he starts police
school so right now he's living with his
girlfriend and this is the setup he uses
for competitive gaming like csgo League
of Legends and hearthstone he also does
some editing for his YouTube channel so
he's using a 24 inch gaming monitor from
Asus and he's also got the Corsa K for
the RGB keyboard and the m65 RGB mouse
what's interesting is that Christian is
using half of an extended mousepad just
so he can cover the hole that he drilled
for his keyboard I've never seen that
before
for audio he's got two headsets that
SteelSeries Siberia to hundreds and the
Marshall major two headphones along with
a trust and Meeta microphone that's
hooked up to his IKEA desk which by the
way is the perfect size to fit inside
this tiny closet cables are managed
pretty well although I would use a cable
sleeve to hide the cables running down
one of the legs the PC powering this has
an i5 6400 and a GTX 970 honestly this
isn't the worst setup I've seen but I
decided to put it in this worst set of
position to give him a chance of winning
a hundred dollars and because this is
probably the worst place to build a set
up in I mean there is hardly any space
to move around which is the worst
nightmare for anyone with cluster phobia
but mostly because as no ventilation all
the heat from the PC and the monitor and
even his body is going to rise and since
there is no exhaust it's just gonna
float around making everything warmer
and warmer
unless it's always cold where you live
actually I just checked the weather and
apparently it's freezing cold in Denmark
never mind what I just said thank you
Christian for entering next up is
Hussein coming all the way from Egypt
and his setup from gaming and
productivity he's rocking a 19 inch
monitor from Fujitsu and a budget
keyboard and mouse with a set of budget
speakers from Highland however he does
have a pair of bluetooth headphones as
well everything seems to be tidy up here
but underneath the setup is a completely
different story there's a bunch of
cables that
main unattended some velcro straps would
help keep most of the PC wires grouped
up together and a cable box to hide the
power strip instead of mounting it
against the back like that the PC itself
is pretty outdated rocking a GT 710 and
a dual-core CPU but the most
disappointing thing about this
submission is that he didn't watch my
Alienware r7 video or my set up montage
episode 8 usually there's a red bar near
the bottom but there isn't any on his
videos so I mean it's not the fanciest
setup but it's definitely a potato setup
it seems like you got a cosy room as
well I really like how you kept
everything so organized but I have to
ask you this why on earth do you have a
toilet paper next to your bed do you
have a toilet in your bedroom because
usually they put toilet paper in
bathrooms I'm just going to give you a
hard time I'm actually Middle Eastern
myself and we put stuff in the weirdest
place as possible back then and summer
times used to put our underwear in the
freezer because we would have no air
conditioning and it would get really
really hot so yeah fun times but anyways
with that said thank you Hussein for
entering Milan is next up from South
Africa and his ghetto setup for gaming
watching anime and the occasional fap
session so apparently my Lin's friend
Idris I think that's how you pronounce
it I'm sorry if I'm butchering your name
by the way I took pictures of his
friends set up and then submitted it
without him knowing and both of them
watched set up words so it'd be
interesting to see his reaction watching
my show of a sudden and by the way Milan
if you're watching congratulations your
setup made it to the show because it
sucks he's got a 20-inch monitor with
the Alienware keyboard and the razer
naga hex mouse but the most interesting
part about this setup is that it's built
at the edge of his bunk bed I saw these
setup locations are getting more
interesting by the episode but look how
much space he has for his Mouse there is
no way you can game like that unless
you're playing Minecraft of course the
only audio source I see are those
wireless Sony headphones sitting on top
of his PC which is from Ilya we're
already a disgrace and it actually has
decent specs but Jesus Lord when is the
last time you clean inside this pee
see it's looking like a desert storm hit
your PC I bet you that's the first time
you've open the side panel just to take
pictures for setup words it looks like
the storm hits your cable management as
well good lord
there are only two things I recommend
for your setup some Lysol and an air
duster I can also see that you decorated
your entire room with posters of anime
that's definitely something to attract
the ladies into your dorm
excellent excellent taste anyways thank
you Idris for submitting your friends
setup and good luck Matthias is up next
from Ecuador and this is the setup he
uses for gaming and some editing it
looks like his setup is on a tiny
nightstand and he's using two pillows as
his chair really I don't even know where
this is it could be his living room or
bedroom I mean it's hard to tell but
wherever it is this is not the ideal
setup I mean I don't know how anyone can
sit and game like this let alone edit a
video my back would be killing me after
just an hour he doesn't have any
headphones so it looks like he's using
those foldable speakers and he has some
other stuff lying around like a VR
headset drone and an empty pill bottle
actually it's not really empty and I
don't know what's going on underneath
your setup but there's one thing that's
certain
you need to vacuum the floor my dude I
also see a bunch of stuff just laying
around
I mean shelves go as low as 20 dollars
and it will really clean up everything
around you here's one that I recommend
I'll drop a link below please pick one
up after all a clean setup starts with a
clean area I mean where have you ever
seen a dope setup with a bunch of mess
around it it just doesn't exist the PC
power in the setup isn't half bad that's
actually the only good thing about this
setup and it's got a 7600 K and a GTX
1060 Wow
I mean if you have the budget to buy a
PC like that why does your setup look
like this I smell something fishy
and it ain't coming from that dying
plant regardless thank you for taking
your time to submit your setup Mathias
and good luck last not least we have
Sahir coming from Pakistan and his
creative setup that's used for gaming
editing and socializing
I don't know if this is creative or just
sad but if you haven't noticed by now he
is using a set of speakers as his desk
the two subwoofers are the actual
tabletop and he's using the other two
tweakers as the front legs and two boxes
near the back as the support legs I
actually take back what I said earlier
this is very creative he was like I'm
not gonna let not having a desk stop me
from having a set up so he grabbed his
dad's old speakers and he went to work
he even used the legs on the speakers to
hold his earphone cables it's actually
starting to make sense now because he is
going to school for engineering at least
that's what he says in the notes the
rear speaker is holding up his monitor
and PC while the front speaker is
supporting a keyboard mouse and the
smartphone the pc itself doesn't
actually have a GPU and it doesn't even
have a PCI slot so it's actually using
the integrated graphics chip on the AMD
CPU so when he said that he used this
setup for gaming I'm actually curious
what type of gaming are you talking
about - Reaper but you know what I gotta
give props to Sahir for working on his
cables as bad as this set up is he
actually cares enough to zip tie the
cables together and keep everything neat
and tidy this has to be one of the
cleanest worst setups I've ever seen on
the show and I pretty much wraps up this
episode of setup or is make sure you
guys drop your comments down below and
vote on who you think has the worst
setup because that person is gonna take
home a hundred dollars in cash I'll be
announcing the winners on my Twitter
account thank you guys so much for
watching as always I will see you very
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
