with another unboxing and overview this
time we are looking at Apple's newest
iPad the iPad air you can choose from
two different colors either space grey
or silver starting at 499 for the base
16 gigabyte model which connects via
Wi-Fi only and you also have the option
to add data plan as well and that base
model starts at 629 you also have the
choice of selecting up to 128 gigabytes
of space if you are a really heavy user
we will be giving away this iPad to one
lucky subscriber so make sure you guys
stay till the end of the video to find
out how to enter so the ipad air weighs
only one pound and its twenty eight
percent lighter and twenty percent
thinner than the ipad 2 measuring at
just 7.5 millimeters apple also stated
that they reduce the overall volume by
twenty-four percent and you can really
tell just by holding it we obviously
want with a Space Gray 16 gigabyte model
with no data plan I'm not really a fan
of silver when it comes to devices I
always choose black just because I think
it looks a lot better than most colors
but of course everyone has their own
taste the ipad air also has a stunning
9.7 inch Retina display with a
resolution of 2048 x 1536 and you can
really see how crisp of pictures are
even though they kept the same screen
size the difference is huge in the box
you will find the usual accessories that
Apple products always come with like the
warranty information USB and the wall
chargers but enough about that let's get
a closer look at the ipad air besides
the stunning display the ipad air also
has twice the power with their new a7
and m7 chips just like the iphone 5s
does making ipad air up to two times
faster than the previous generation in
both cpu and graphics performance
without sacrificing battery life in fact
the ipad air gets up to 10 hours of
battery life they also operated a
front-facing camera the ipad air now has
a 1 point 2 megapixel front-facing
camera with 720p HD video for facetime
compared to the previous vga quality the
same goes for that back camera they
upgraded to the new isight camera which
gives you 5 megapixels and photos and
1080p and HD video recording with three
times be
zoom on the top of the ipad air you will
find your headphone jack dual
microphones and your power button the
dual mics improve audio and suppress
background noise for pretty much
anything from video recording facetime
calls and even when using Siri overall I
like the iPad air it's definitely a huge
change from the iPad to the display is
simply stunning with a huge screen along
with Apple's newest chips and weighing
only one pound makes this iPad
definitely worth up waiting for me with
