camera with a hammer what's up guys is

guys want to participate in setup wars
make sure to watch the video linked

everyone setups link below along with
anything I recommend in this episode but
here are your five contestants for this
week we have Alex
CJ downtime Gus and Jeffrey
congratulations for making our show
starting off the show is Alex and his
try display setup so we have three 22
inch HP monitors sitting on the IKEA
Lindeman desk and a black web centaur
keyboard and an e blue maser wireless
mouse on the right side is his custom
painted xbox 360 slim they say--it's
gaming headset on the left and finally
we have a set of Boston Acoustics
satellite speakers in the center cable
management can definitely be improved I
do see that you try to wrap them
together but it still needs some work
perhaps a cable sleeve or some velcro
straps can aid you with grouping those
wires together the PC does probably the
setup has an FX 8350 at an r7 370
honestly this is a dope setup but the
main thing that's lacking is
organization I will definitely hang the
headset under the desk or behind the
martyr so that you don't have the cable
running through your setup like this
also putting one of those speakers on
each side of your desk would give you
more of a surround sound experience
instead of having all your audio coming
out from the center the Xbox controller
charging dock is cool but it's also a
little too high which blocks the view of
one of your monitors so if you want to
keep them on your desk
I would advise getting something flatter
like this charging dock instead
and finally the action figures although
it does add some personality to this
setup I would at least move this dude to
the other side so that the legs aren't
covering the screen
other than those minor adjustments I do
like the custom painted r2d2 trashcan
and the wall art that you have over
there lots of potential for the setup
thank you Alex for entering CJ is next
up with our second try display setup but
this time we have two 24 inch LCD
monitors sandwiching a 27 inch Acer on
the desk we have the razor Deathstalker
chroma keyboard Razer Tartarus keypad
and a Naga
2012 Mouse looks like the desk is custom
built with carbon fiber wrapping
which looks pretty sick I also love the
placement of the PC right smack in front
of you I wonder if that gets distracting
at times because if that was me I would
constantly look up at it and not get any
work done the PC powering the setup has
a 59 30 K and a gtx 980ti
inside the Thermaltake core p5 case for
audio we have a pair of San Heiser HD
598 a blue snowball mic hooked up to the
boom arm and a set of insignia 2.1
bluetooth speakers I didn't really get a
clean shot of the cable management but
from what I can see judging by this
picture is that the cables are tied
together with some velcro and are routed
through the giant PC stand other than
moving the phone to the right side so
that it's not directly in front of the
monitor I see that this is a well-built
setup Thank You CJ for entering changing
things up we have down time and it's
super sexy black and white set up we
don't have to be monitors but instead
have two different ones a 27-inch rog
swift and a 27 inch 1080p the monitors
are resting on top of a riser and below
that we have a sony blu-ray player some
surround sound speakers and a custom
painted Focusrite audio interface which
by the way is hooked up to the road
procaster mic that's being held up by
the road psa1 boom arm for peripherals
is rocking Astro a 50s courser k95
keyboard and I'm 65 Mouse both of which
are RGB and it appears that he drilled a
hole in the desk
throughout the cables through speaking
of cable management the powder scripts
LEDs and pretty much everything else is
attached on the roof of the desk and off
of the ground and you did all this
without using a Signum rack job well
done I'm very impressed
and of course we can't forget this beast
that's sitting right next to your setup
a very sexy build inside the cooler
master cosmos 2 rocking the 49 60 X CPU
that's over clock 24.6 and two GTX Titan
X's and SLI this thing is a beast
excellent work with sticking with the
same color scheme of your setup and a
cable management very nice this is
definitely an awesome black and white
setup thank you downtime for entering
back to triple monitor setups Gus is
rocking 327 inch band cues on top of the
IQ and Lindeman desk and for the gaming
year we have another coarser k95 RGB
keyboard as well as a corsair scimitar
RGB mouse
that's sitting on top of the courser
extended mousepad let's go team coarser
we also have a pair of Logitech z6 23
speakers and has sony tablet and
smartphone now although i don't have a
problem with the speaker placement the
cable is running down one of the legs
definitely bothers me I do like the fact
that you decided to keep your PC on top
of the drawer next to you instead of
leaving it on the ground after all why
wouldn't you want to look at this beauty
that's rocking a 6700 K + 2 gtx 980ti s
cable management looks pretty good for
the most part I would really try and
find a way to route that speaker cable
towards the back somehow maybe run it
alongside the desk using some cable
clips also reaching the HyperX cloud
tubes may be annoying since that's on
top of your PC and away from reach but
at least you have a dedicated place for
them apart from that the rest of your
setup looks pretty dope some people
might say that there is too much red but
I for one think it's perfect I love the
contrast especially the red wall I think
it's a nice change from the usual boring
white that we see in most setups
symmetry is also on point with those
paintings on the wall I mean what more
can ask for a very sick setup thank you
guys for entering last but not least we
have Jeffrey and his battle station this
here is a custom-built desk with a PC
inside we have a 34 inch LG ultrawide
monitor on the bottom and a 23 inch tail
monitor up top and for peripherals
Jeffrey is rocking a Logitech G 710
keyboard that has a custom paint job and
the Logitech MX mouse which is odd
considering that this is a gaming setup
and that Mouse is more for productivity
we also have a pair of hercules XPS
studio monitors and an asus epsilon
headset hanging from the side so this is
no regular PC desk what sets this one
apart from the other ones I featured on
my channel is the fact that this has two
separate pcs built inside one is for a
server and the other is for gaming the
gaming side has a 4770k and an msi gtx
980
whereas the server build has AG 32 20
and some other GPU which you forgot to
list in the notes I'm surprised that
cable management is spot on considering
that there are two PC's and two monitors
in this setup I don't see a single wire
in sight and they all appear to be
hidden behind
not much also say a very impressive
setup indeed Thank You Jeffrey for
entering so w-4 this episode of setup
wars Ultimate Edition make sure you guys
drop your comments down below and vote
on who you think has the best desk setup
I'll ask the winners on Sunday on my
social media accounts and that is
