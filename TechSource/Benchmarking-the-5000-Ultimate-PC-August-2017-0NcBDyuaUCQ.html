big white it is big Reds bigger brother
and it's rocking the 7900 X and to msi
gtx 1080p is in sli and yes this is
definitely overkill after all this is a
text source build it also has 64 gigs of
ram because why not and the new msi x2
99x powered gaming motherboard obviously
I was going for something that was
aesthetically pleasing and I haven't
really done a black and white filled
with grey accents so this is officially
the first one on the channel the case I
picked up is the corsair v 7 the x
crystal edition which is exclusive and
only available on Newegg basically it's
a full ATX tower with tempered glass
titles all around and it looks stunning
one of the things I love about the case
is the fact that it comes with a Raceway
near the back which helped me a lot when
it came to cable management I'm not
really a fan when cases come with a back
tempered glass panel because for one you
barely even see it in the first place
and too even if you do see it you get to
see the ugly cables behind there as well
as the storage devices especially if
your SSD hard drive comes with those
nasty stickers on there it really does
mess with your build now what's a 570 X
crystal edition it's not that bad
because the cable management raceway
really made a huge difference in hiding
most of the cables I also like the fact
that it came with three RGB fans and you
can actually change the colors on the
fly using the control panel on the top
of the case that's pretty cool so the
things I don't like about the case first
off the PSU shroud it doesn't extend all
the way to the front which kind of
leaves this empty space near the bottom
I don't like that because now the bulk
of the cables are visible and that
doesn't have any space to hide them
I don't expect it to go all the way to
the front otherwise it would block the
bottom intake fan but just enough to
cover the cables under here would have
been really nice another thing that it
doesn't have is a cutout on the PSU
shroud so that way I can route
Pui are straight down for a much cleaner
look but instead I was forced to run
them through the side and out the back
which honestly it doesn't look that good
to me it looks a little messy but other
than those minor gripes the case is
really cool and I had a lot of fun
building inside it the MSI motherboard
is the piece that brought this entire
build together it was the perfect choice
for the color scheme as well with an
all-black PCB and gray accents it kinda
has a spaceship design which really
looks cool in my opinion
the X power of gaming AC is also packing
tons of features it's currently the best
x 299 motherboard that msi has to offer
with a total of 14 power faces to help
with stable orbit clocking and it comes
equipped with three m dot two slots
four-way SLI support and mystic light
which lets you customize the light on
the i/o cover and that spaceship looking
heatsink overclocking was also very easy
on the motherboard I was able to push
the 7900 X all the way to 4.8 gigahertz
on a 1.45 core voltage out of all the
motherboards I've tested this was
actually one of the most smoothest
experiences I've ever had when it came
to overclocking the board even comes
with a cool m dot to shield that kind of
snaps in place near the top and under
here I drew in a 480 by m2 SSD from
Corsair the other storage device is a
960 gigabyte Corsair force LS SSD that I
hooked up in the back and a 4 terabyte
hard drive from Seagate for mass storage
some mods I included were custom MSI
back plates yes Ally bridge and even
some fan grills to cover up the ugly
back of the corsair RGB fans they are
all from v1 tech and as always they do
amazing work so make sure you guys check
them out and I'll drop a link to it down
below the cables I picked up are from
cable model which is my go-to right now
for custom sleeving since I can
completely customize the length color
and even a type of material I want for
my cables it's just way more convenient
than other websites which is why I love
using them for all my builds I also
decided to modern sticks without
thinking them so basically what I did
was I removed the stock heat spreader
and I install the cable mod memory kit
instead I went with white so that it
matches with the back plates and the fan
grills
I personally think it looks way better
than stock they do have other colors to
choose from which is awesome you can
definitely
find the right one to match your bills
color scheme however it's only available
for the corsair dominator platinum they
also released a new product which is
their new a iOS leading kit which you
guys can clearly see on my h100 ID - it
was a bit difficult to install at first
but after I got used to the method it
became a lot easier it comes in several
different colors and it definitely makes
the PC stand out compared to the default
boring black tubing from AIO coolers
currently it's available for the NZXT
kraken series and the courser gen 2
series but be sure to check out the
website for more info once again I'll
drop a link to all this down below
performance-wise this is a fiery beast
and I say fiery because we got some
pretty high temps we all know that the
7900 X gets extremely hot especially
when overclocking even with the H 100 IV
- I'm hitting temps of around a hundred
degrees on max load even though the PC
is stable I wouldn't recommend
overclocking this trip unless you are
water cooling it or have a beefier
cooler the GPU is on the other hand are
hitting temps of around 80 degrees on
max load which isn't too bad so this is
the sound test for big white Sony got a
full load SLI is enabled and I put back
the tempered glass side panel
but you know what guys to 1080p eyes are
definitely overkill as a lot of games
out there are not fully optimized for
SLI in fact I was getting lower frames
with SLI enabled then with a single GPU
a good example was Doom in OpenGL the
game was lagging so bad hitting around
10 sts and 4k resolution but once I
disabled as to lie I jumped back up to
the low hundreds the same goes with
battlefield 1 I was getting around 35
fps went in to 1080 s and SLI but once I
disabled it I went back up to 75 FPS
obviously battlegrounds is a newer game
so I didn't expect SLI support so you
would be getting around 45 s GS which do
1080 eyes but if you guys drop it down
to 1 GPU you will increase your frames
past the 60 mark so there's definitely a
huge difference there Ghost Recon
wildlands and SLI was also horribly
optimized giving around 32 fps and one
vessel I was disabled we nearly doubled
an FPS to 62 this was in high settings
though games are optimized for SLI
support include GTA 5 which hit over 60
fps and maxed out settings we got hitman
absolution in ultra settings which gave
us around 110 FPS and finally we got
Metro last light maxed out which gave us
around 71 FPS so I guess I'm trying to
say here is don't take up to 1080 T eyes
it's overkill and it's not going to be
worth your money if you guys really want
a game in 4k a single 1080p I will get
the job done or if you guys have the
money don't care pick up a Titan XP this
build wouldn't be possible if it weren't
for courser MSI v1 tech and cable mod so
thank you guys so much for saying its
parts out I'll jump link to everything I
mentioned down below as always if you
guys enjoy my monthly PC build and are
feeling awesome trophy to drop a like to
show your support and also this like if
you guys do not like my builds that is
cool too
thank you guys so much watching as
always I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
