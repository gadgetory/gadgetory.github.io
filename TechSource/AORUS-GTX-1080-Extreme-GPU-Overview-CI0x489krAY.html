functional PC build the be quiet pure
bass 680 X power as what you're looking
for it's completely sound insulated with
dampening materials in all the relevant
places features a modular design with
removable OD d and hard drive bays for
various cooling solutions and it comes
pre-installed with two pure wings two
fans one of the things I love about this
case is the cable management area there
are plenty of pass throughs and grommets
to help with cable management something
I don't often see in most cases the pure
bass 600 comes with a three year
warranty and it's available in black and
silver accents if you want to learn more
check out the first link down below so
gigabyte has expanded their eras line up
to motherboards and even grabs cards in
fact I happen to have their new GT X
1080 extreme 8 gigabyte graphics card in
house and we're going to take a closer
look at it it comes in at an MSRP of 680
dollars and has the same frequencies as
their gigabyte GT X 1080 extreme cards
even a design is practically identical
however there is one major difference
advanced copper backplate cooling
essentially this hideous copper plate is
supposed to fully dissipate the heat
from the backside of the GPU most of the
other card brands actually don't offer
any type of heat dissipation and the
heat gets trapped between the backplate
and the PCB the large copper base plate
comes into direct contact with the GPU
and vram to efficiently transfer the
heat generated from the interior cores
to the heatsink keeping the GPU cool and
stable especially when overclocked but
is this a marketing term or does it
actually work well to find out I went in
and took apart the GPU and put
everything back together again without a
backplate and then tested the card with
and without the backplate so here are
the temps with the advanced copper
backplate installed and here are the
results after it was removed notice a
difference there isn't any the copper
base plate seems to do nothing at all in
terms of temperatures even after
overclocking the card the temps did not
budge at all
by the way the test bed I'm using for
the video features the i7 7700 K 16 gigs
of ram from crucial the New Era's Z 270
gaming nine motherboard and of course
the be quiet dark rock Pro through
CPU cooler everything else on the card
is pretty much identical you get the
same triple 100 millimeters stacked fan
design with the double ball bearing
structure and RGB of course the name of
the GPU on the side the X in the front
and the logo on the backplate are all
RGB and you can control the light effect
with their software honestly I think the
logo looks really cool and LEDs are very
bright compared to other GPUs I've seen
however there is some light bleed near
the edge and actually some colors give
off a second color for example the
purple bleeds a bit of blue and the
yellow bleeds some green so I thought I
would mention that so how much Headroom
do you really get to play with using
their new advanced copper backplate
cooling well I managed to push the era's
slightly higher than the EVGA 1080 by a
mere 50 megahertz on the core clock
however I was able to achieve a slightly
higher memory clock on the FTW take a
look at the times by benchmark we can
see that the era's scored around 300
more but looking at the fire strike
ultra benchmarks the gap isn't as wide
in fact once overclocked the FTW card
managed to score slightly higher in GTA
5 the errors performed significantly
better in 1080
however the FTW did slightly better in
4k for some reason on hitman it was
pretty much neck and neck while showing
a few FPS increase after overclocked and
here it is again the same thing ever
scored higher in 1080p while losing in
4k against EVGA and once again on Metro
last light they are both neck-and-neck
and finally we got Tomb Raider the era's
card showing a noticeable difference in
1080p so in total the era scored higher
in most of the games than 1080p however
the FTW card is slightly better in 4k
resolution to be honest I was expecting
a bit more from the errors when it came
to overclocking a boost clock of 2062
megahertz is not bad but I have pushed
other cards to that number and even some
passed it like you 1080 founders Edition
for example but I will tell you this the
card is extremely quiet and cool even
after overclocking in fact it's one of
the coolest 1080s I've tested on the
channel I just expected more Headroom on
a card with an improved cooling
technology but I think might rest of the
video if you guys want to check out the
era's GT X 1080 extreme
I'll double ink to it down below thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
