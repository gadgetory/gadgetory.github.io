to have on a deserted island if Wi-Fi
food water and a house are on the island
well obviously my phone my PC and a
charger for my phone that's I guess what
I'll go with toughest or hardest
problems you went through during YouTube
career I guess the main thing is finding
the motivation to continue it's very
difficult to start up I was looking into
other things as well I even started like
an animation channel but doing a tech
channel it's really difficult to start
off with and to maintain motivation and
dedication is probably one of the
hardest things I would say doing YouTube
24 inch or 27-inch monitors this one's
simple if you're doing a triple monitor
setup 24 inches is the way to go if
you're doing a dual monitor setup I
think 27 inches is this sweet spot and
you're going with a single monitor setup
34 inch ultra wide how are you liking
the new Sony camera and why did you
upgrade actually I'm still using the gh4
I'm actually using right now to film
this video with the Sigma lens I'm still
waiting for Armando to give me his later
at the end of this month so you guys
will definitely tell the difference in
quality once I do use it dream car
that's an easy one bugatti veyron a
Lamborghini Aventador or even a audio r8
those are my top three dream cars what
are your best tips for someone starting
out youtube but actually mentioned this
in my last ask me video but basically
consistency content and quality stick to
those three rules and that is basically
the best advice I can give you what is
your dream computer I'm actually going
to build my dream computer early next
year it's gonna be a custom water-cooled
build either thinking about going with a
triple SLI PI in X's or maybe a dual Tye
Nexus but it's not only gonna be
water-cooled and it's gonna be something
you guys have never seen before and it's
gonna be super super quiet it's gonna
happen make sure you guys stick around
where are you from my last name is
actually a big giveaway it ends in why
am
and every time last name ends in either
ia n or yn that means the person is
Armenian but I was actually born in
Moscow Russia so I'm kind of Russian
Armenian
have you thought about a gaming channel
I did I tried it in the early years of
YouTube I failed miserably
never again what is your opinion on
AMD's new 300 series they have really
solid GPUs but I'm personally a die-hard
Nvidia fan all the way so any PC I build
if it's gonna be for me it's definitely
gonna be an Intel CPU with a GeForce
graphics card what would your last meal
be if you could choose you'll you got
any last requests Oh actually yeah I do
thank you so much for the offer I'm like
a chicken pasta very light marinara
sauce I don't want it to overpower the
taste maybe with some garlic burn on the
side and a glass of wine would be
phenomenal thank you so much if you win
the lottery what would you do would you
quit YouTube as lame and as corny as it
sounds I won't quit YouTube this is a
passion of mine and I do this because I
really enjoy doing it money will have no
influence on me making YouTube videos
what is the worst piece of tech you have
ever bought that's an easy question the
HTC One a9
gahafer childhood game and/or console
even till today when my most favorite
consoles of all time has to be eaten at
end of 64 and I used to play Super Smash
Bros on there every single day
definitely one of my favorites so that's
it for all the questions thank you guys
for submitting them on Twitter I'm gonna
be doing this actually once a month now
so if you guys have any more additional
questions you guys can follow me on
Twitter and make sure you guys look out
for the hashtag ask Edgar
anyways thank you so much for watching
this is that from tech source I will see
you guys in the next video
