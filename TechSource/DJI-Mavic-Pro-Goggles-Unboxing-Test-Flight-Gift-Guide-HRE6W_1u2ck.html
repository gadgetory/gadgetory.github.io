welcome to the unboxing and camera test
of the DJI maverick pro and I'm also
gonna take a look at the DJI goggles as
well and this video is in collaboration
with YouTube who was sponsoring this
episode for their new channel over at
youtube.com slash unboxed over there
you'll find some of the best and latest
tech that I've been in boxed for the
holiday season in fact you guys will see
a bunch of different creators on there
from YouTube as well so definitely go
check it out if you guys enjoy unboxing
videos like mine I'll drop a link to it
down below
alright so without further ado let's go
and unbox these things set them up and
I'm gonna take it outside for a quick
spin let's go to unbox the Mavic pro
first and guys this is actually the fly
more combo so it comes with more
accessories and again if you guys want
to check any of this out I'll drop a
link to it down below alright so what
the fly more combo you guys actually get
some pretty cool accessories you get
three flight batteries they also throw
in a car charger a battery charging hub
quick-release folding propellers they
send you a three of them and you also
get the battery to power bank adapter as
well as a shoulder bag I was gonna slide
this out of here pop this right open wow
this is actually a really nice shoulder
bag and on this side I'm guessing yup it
is the Maverick pro itself it's gonna
take this out and down here are the two
additional batteries so yeah guys this
is the Matic pro it literally fits right
in my hand this is very portable and
it's able to shoot in 4k resolution at
30 FPS which is insane so a snaps out
like this and pretty much good to go
obviously I'm missing a few propellers
I'm gonna hook that up it does come with
a battery pack installed already on it
and you get also two additional battery
packs with the fly mode combo I'm gonna
put this aside real quick and take a
look at the contents inside the shoulder
bag alright so in here you'll find it
looks like a set of eight propellers and
put this aside and inside the main pouch
is pretty much everything else there's a
micro USB cable you got the booklets a
shoulder strap
AC power cable and this is the power
brick needed to charge the batteries
here is the car charger itself and on
this side if I can get it out here it is
is the actual remote needed to obviously
fly the drone it last but not least we
have the charging hub for the battery it
looks like you can charge for battery
packs at once I think that's how oh
that's how you hook it up on here that's
actually pretty cool very nice so the
remote is actually pretty cool I comes
with a built-in lightning cable on the
side over here but you can also swap it
in for a micro USB if you have an
Android device
with me I got the iPhone X or iPhone 10
and I'm gonna go ahead and hook this up
real quick to the remote basically just
slide in the phone to the lightning
cable and then clamp it in the middle so
it's nice and firm and there you go this
is actually the display you're gonna be
using to navigate the drone that is
pretty sweet the antennas are at the top
and you also get an LCD display in the
center which showcases the battery
percentage of the drone of course and
other useful information on there so on
a full battery the Maverick will get you
around 27 minutes of flight time at
speeds of 65 kilometers per hour and I
think that's around 40 miles per hour
it's got a three axis gimbal built in 4k
resolution at 30fps and a 12 megapixel
camera so yeah some pretty impressive
specs for something so tiny that fits
right in your palm truly is incredible
probably I'm not gonna turn this on
indoors because I might lose a few
eyeballs so I want to put this aside
real quick and unbox the goggles and I'm
gonna sting both of them up together
download the app and take it outside for
a quick test run I want to see what this
is capable of doing outdoors
alright let's get this out of here
there's the headset itself and down here
is the headband and you also get some
accessories in here manuals of course
and finally be charging power brick
now the goggles on the other hand
provide an immersive experience giving
you a full 360-degree view straight from
the drone another cool thing about the
headset is actually comes with a touch
control on the side over here so when
you are using it you can actually
navigate through the menu just by
touching the side of the headset which
is very convenient one of the things I
really want to try the Maverick Pro that
I've seen everywhere is the tracking on
this supposedly it's very accurate and
you could set it to follow you from
behind you can set it to trace around
you as you move I mean you can do some
pretty cool things with the Maverick Pro
this isn't obviously a review so I'm not
gonna go into every single detail but
like I said earlier I'll drop a link to
a below if you guys want to check this
out but yeah let's uh let's go and take
this outside and see what it can do hi
guys I'm finally out here and I'm gonna
be testing out the Maverick Pro all the
firmware is updated it's ready to go I'm
gonna use the remote control first until
I get the hang of things this is my
first time flying the drone honestly I
just hope I don't crash it and I'm gonna
switch over to the goggles right after
once I get the hang of things so yeah
let's start this thing
so yeah I just finished flying the drone
and one word pretty freakin awesome
multiple where it's pretty freakin
awesome I got some dope shots I think at
4k resolution it's very easy to fly guys
especially if it's your first time
flying a drone you can pick this up very
easily and start flying immediately it
does offer some beginner tips in the app
but the user interface on the entire app
honestly it's very easy to follow
anybody can easily just pick up like I
said and start flying one of the
favorite features about the drone was
actually the the tracking software you
can set it the track me and you can also
even set it to trace around me at a
certain speed as I'm walking around
which is pretty dope and you can get
some really nice cinematic shots off of
it as far as distance I was able to push
it all the way to very close to 400
meters anything after that honestly you
start losing connection I don't know if
it's my area in particular but the
signal strength is very sketchy when it
gets past 400 meters anything up to 400
meters
you pretty much stuff to go you don't
have to worry about that but yeah guys
it has a bunch of really cool features
on here obviously I can't go over every
single one of them in this video it will
be a very long video but I'll drop a
link to it down below you guys want to
check it out as well as these awesome
goggles let's put this thing on check it
out this is so sick Wow
that is awesome I don't even I don't
even have to worry about using the
camera I can just fly the drone check
this out oh this is so trippy damn
oh dude this is this is like playing a
freaking flight simulator game Wow Wow
this is sick
okay I'm sold whoa-ho this is awesome
what it's so accurate - it's crazy
there's a very very slight landscape but
you honestly hardly notice it
this is so freakin cool
but pretty much wraps up this video if
you guys enjoyed it feel free to toss a
like and if you didn't feel free to
dislike as well that's cool - huge
