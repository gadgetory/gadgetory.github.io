so I open the door and as I'm sitting
down the door comes swinging back and
hits me fatality Yeah right there next
to my I Adam even know why I'm telling
you this what's up guys is that from
tech source and welcome to setup wars
episode 36 will you submit your desk
setup to get featured on a channel if
you guys are new to the show and want to
submit your desk setup make sure to
watch the video linked down below but
with that said and done
let the setup wars begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always everyone setups to be links down
below along with anything I recommend in
this episode so here are your five lucky
contestants we have heyo
Kirk Robin Toby and Yazzie
congratulations for making it to set-up
wars episode 36 first up we have heyo or
how or however you pronounce it with two
ASIS 24 inch monitors hooked up to the
mounted arm on the desk we have the
ducky shine three mechanical keyboard
and a logitech g502 Mouse on top of the
paraxylene a mousepad also that's we
have a pair of audio engine a two plus
speakers cables aren't visible so you
won't hear any complaining from me today
the PC powering the setup has an i-5 46
70k paired with a gtx 960 inside these
sexy Anwen 9:01 case I think if I see
this case enough I just might do a build
in it pretty clean setup overall thank
you hey-oh for entering I'm pretty sure
I pronounced that wrong cook is next up
with a Productivity setup that's powered
by a 2012 Mac Mini we have 225 inch HP
monitors on top of the Alex add-on unit
a wireless Apple keyboard and a Logitech
performance MX mouse for recording audio
we have the blue spark microphone hooked
up to the road PSA mic arm and also a
pair of Bose speakers cable management
is very clean and I like the hanger
placement for your a THM 50 X's and the
USB hub that you have attached on the
roof of your desk although I would use
cable drops instead of the blue tech to
keep them attached I also like the
addition of the cable box to hide your
power strips now this is a really great
setup but honestly the only thing that
it's lacking is the color coordination
you have black and red skins on your
phone with orange skins on your MacBook
and an orange microphone I'm sure with
some minor changes I feel like this
setup can be perfect but regardless
Thank You Kirk for entering setup ORS
at number three we have Batman and Robin
with a triple display setup three ISO 23
inch monitors a Razer BlackWidow chroma
key board and a Mad Catz rat 7 on top of
the SteelSeries mouse pad off the right
side we have a 32 inch Philips smart TV
for console gaming with not only EP
three but a four as well nearby because
why not
Caleb a Detroit is pretty tidy I mean at
least they are off the ground so good
job with that the PC that's powering
this entire setup appears to be an old
black build rocking a 4770k and an Asus
GTX 980 other than fixing up those
cables behind your monitors and using
cable jobs to keep your charging wires
in place I think this is a beast of a
setup Thank You Robin for entering Tobey
Maguire is next up with a very beautiful
and clean dual display setup we have two
24 inch dual monitors mounted against
the wall with a corsair k70 RGB keyboard
and an MX performance mouse on top of
the ikea linman desk I gotta say
presentation speaks for itself from the
LEDs to the symmetry by having the
m-audio speakers on each side all the
way to the monitors and cable management
job well done indeed although I wish you
would have taken some pictures of your
PC so we can take a closer look at that
beast honestly the only two things I can
recommend is a drawer that you can
install under your desk to keep your
remote and other stuff in and an
extended mouse pad so you don't end up
scratching the desk and rubbing off the
rubber under your mouse very impressive
Toby thank you for entering last but
certainly not least we have Yazeed setup
and holy guys I don't even know where to
start so this is yall's second time on
setup wars and he has improved this
setup since episode 19 I guess you can
start off by the monitors so we have
three Asus 27-inch rog swift monitors a
coarser gaming strafe RGB keyboard and a
red dragon M 801 mammoth mouse on top of
the reflex mouse pad that I'm actually
using for my setup as well also let us
give a pair of JBL pulse speakers that
can change colors to match the current
color scheme and off to the other side
near this beast PC which I will go over
soon we have some consoles an Xbox one
and the PlayStation 4 which are skinned
in black and red from D Brad this do
definitely has taste we also have an MOV
headphone anger holding up the sades
gaming headset and an energizer
controller stand which doubles as a
charger now let's take a look at that PC
so this thing is running on a 59 60 x8
core processor 2 GTX 980 s hooked
together with the rog enthusiast sli
bridge and 32 gigabyte of ddr4 ram from
club the heel management game is also
strong no cables in sight everything is
wrap together and attach to the rear
monitors everything from the color
coordination the LEDs to the gear
choices and even the background just
screams perfection this is by far the
best setup I have seen on setup Wars and
honestly it's going to be extremely
tough to beat this year I'm definitely
looking forward to seeing this on my top
setups of 2016 later this year but it's
always a pleasure to have you on the
show Yazzie thank you for entering so
