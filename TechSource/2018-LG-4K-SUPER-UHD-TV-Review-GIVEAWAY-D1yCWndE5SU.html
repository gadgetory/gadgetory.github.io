and in today's video we're gonna be
taking you look at LG's new super UHD TV
it's no wallpaper TV but it still has
very thin bezels and it also has a VESA
mount in case you guys want to mount
this against a wall but before we get to
the panel and what makes this TV special
let's jump over to the back and take a
look at the ports so we've got four HDMI
we have three USB 3 ports one at the
rear and two on the side we've also got
an Ethernet port and of course your
various audio ports unfortunately there
are no display ports which isn't a
deal-breaker but I would like to see
this at some point moving to the front
we can see how their new full array
dimming backlighting gives us deep black
levels almost on par with OLED TVs now
how this works is the TV has more LED
lighting zones so basically the panel
can light up only the pixels it needs
while keeping a consistent picture
quality throughout the panel and of
course it's also HD already giving you a
wider dynamic range and should we
combine this with 4k resolution you've
got yourself a killer combo for your
PlayStation 4 pro or Xbox one x and
speaking about gaming the Nano Cell TV
is great at it switching over to the
gaming mode lowers input lag making this
experience even better they don't have
the exact numbers listed on their
website but from my experience I can say
that the lag is very minimal or not even
noticeable with the nano cell technology
you're also getting better viewing
angles when compared to the traditional
TVs out there here's a diagram from LG
showing the difference of what they
claimed to be 60 degrees so this isn't
going to make much of a difference until
you start viewing from sharper angles
this is great when you have people over
and you're watching a game a movie or
even playing games and everyone's kind
of spread out in the living room
with this technology you won't have to
worry about anyone missing
action LG did this cool soccer challenge
to illustrate the difference and I'll
leave a link below if you guys want to
check it out moving up to the speaker's
we get to on the bottom with a combined
output of 40 watts and like the past
models they're great I mean it doesn't
get loud enough to fill a large room and
it has a surprising amount of bass
honestly these are probably good enough
for most people without having to go out
and buy a sound bar we also get Dolby
Atmos that gives you a more immersive
audio experience but I left us off in
most situations although our movies
definitely added to the experience I
would imagine with a sound bar this
technology would work better than they
do on the built-in speakers you guys
know what my big fan of LG's UI from my
past reviews and they've made it smarter
this year-round by adding google
assistant and amazon alexa using a
microphone found on the remote you can
use your voice to make your TV do stuff
like search for videos on YouTube for
example overall the experience is clean
and easy to use especially with the LG
remote that has an ergonomic design and
includes shortcuts to Netflix and Amazon
video but still even till today we don't
have a dedicated YouTube button why
would anyone use Amazon video over
YouTube we just makes no sense I feel
like YouTube is more popular it also has
a built-in accelerometer so you can use
a cursor to navigate around so to wrap
up my review this year's model
definitely improves on a lot of last
year's shortcomings but I wouldn't go
out buying it if you do happen to have
the older version laying around but if
you're shopping around for your next TV
they should definitely be on your list
with 4k HDR everything is vibrant and if
you're a gamer you're especially going
to appreciate the low input lag that
isn't so common in TVs like this the
darker blacks add to the overall
contrast and the picture all while
keeping the cost down when compared to
all that panels and the great viewing
angles are a must when you have company
over and that might wraps up the review
LG is actually giving one of these bad
boys to a lucky subscriber and all you
guys have to do to enter is drop a like
on the video and let me know in the
comment section and down below which
features of the 2018 new super UHD TV
to you the most I'll be announcing the
winner on my Twitter account at a month
or so so make sure to follow me there
for all the details and the winner
announcements are doubling below as well
if you guys want to check out the UHD TV
thank you so much for watching I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
