this is the Acer predator Helios 300 the
most powerful gaming laptop under $1,100
Acer did send out the laptop for review
and sponsored this video and as always
guys at the end of the video I'll be
sharing things I liked and didn't like
about the laptop and maybe even a
giveaway so stick around alright so it
comes equipped with a KB Lake 7700 HQ
and a six gigabyte GTX 1060 which will
easily get you over 60fps and most
triple-a tiles no other gaming laptop
has these specs for this price point ok
let's talk about the build quality most
manufacturers would cheap out here to
keep the cost down but acer actually did
a great job the laptop has a top metal
plate with a brushed aluminum look and
the same goes for inside and then
everything else is pretty much plastic
there's very little flex on the display
and the chassis which is surprising on a
laptop for this price point it's also
very easy to open up with just one hand
the keyboard is solid it has a numpad
and it's actually backlit and red LEDs
which you can turn off if you want the
keys are a bit spongy but don't have any
problems typing on it the only thing I'm
not a fan of on the keyboard is the
placement of the shift and the arrow
keys they're kind of crammed together in
a weird spot the trackpad is in a really
good spot and doesn't interfere with me
typing and haven't experienced any lag
or stutter it's very responsive the
buttons on there however are a bit
harder to press that I'm used to the
laptop also comes with a standard 720p
camera located on the top of a display
with decent low-light performance the
downward firing speakers do get pretty
loud but it lacks bass and clarity in
the highs I do recommend using
headphones with this laptop especially
if you don't want to hear the fan noise
on full load speaking of fan noise the
laptop does come with predator sense
which is a software that gives you the
option of controlling the fan speed you
can either set it to max or adjust it
yourself for both the CPU and GPU the
monitor has a 15.6 inch IPS 1080p panel
with great viewing angles and anti
glare coding full brightness on this
laptop is about 250 nits which is kind
of standard compared to other gaming
laptops I've reviewed on the channel I
definitely wouldn't use this outdoors or
in really bright rooms you guys stay
away from those then it's not really a
big deal the ports are pretty standard
given the price point you get three USB
3.0 an HDMI and a USB type-c on the same
side as the SD card reader the laptop
does get pretty warm during gaming you
can definitely feel the warmth through
the keys on your fingers but it's not
too hot or distracting battery life
isn't the best either for my benchmarks
I got really close to four hours of use
under the balance plan which is to be
expected on a gaming laptop of this
price point in terms of storage you only
get 256 gigabyte of space via SSD which
isn't much to be honest so I definitely
recommend upgrading it or adding some
sort of external storage luckily it was
very easy to access the back to upgrade
the storage and memory like I mentioned
before this laptop is beast when it
comes to gaming it pretty much handled
everything I do at it over 60 fps in
maxed out settings
it's the perfect laptop if you playing
demanding titles like GTA 5 or
battlegrounds otherwise if you're
playing csgo or overwatch then I would
save the money and get a laptop with a
1050 Ti instead overall this is a very
solid gaming laptop and it's currently
the best gaming laptop given its price
point of 1050 there is no other gaming
laptop out there that gives you the same
specs for this exact same price point
honestly flew up to me I would have
preferred just eight gigs of RAM instead
of 16 and then use that extra money on
more storage but you know it is what it
is since it is running Windows 10 you
can actually play Xbox and Xbox one
games and connect with other players
online through your Microsoft account
you also get some pretty cool features
like in game DVR capabilities and
optimization for games I'll drop a link
to the Helios 300 down below in case you
guys want to check it out
and again huge things to Acer for
sending out the laptop and sponsoring
this video as I mentioned before I will
be doing a giveaway on this laptop and
if you guys want to enter all you have
to do is drop a like and let me know
comments-section what you liked about
this laptop what is the best feature
that you liked about the Helios 300 in
one sentence I'll be announcing the
winner at the end of September on my
Twitter account so make sure you guys
are following me there believe it or not
there are so many people that haven't
claimed their prizes on my past
giveaways so I was always forced to pick
new winners so make sure you guys are
following me there if you want a chance
to win but anyways that's pretty much it
thank you so much for watching I hope
you enjoy the video and I will see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
