and I'm back again with another video
today we're gonna be reviewing the
galaxy s7 edge and I've been using this
device as my daily driver for about a
week now and I feel confident in my
impressions of this phone so here's my
review let's start off with the physical
aspect it's definitely an upgrade over
the galaxy s6 edge in terms of feel the
edges are rounded which contributes to a
more elegant feel in your hand with that
being said I do prefer how the galaxy s7
feels with its straight sides it's just
more of a familiar grip and less prone
to slipping the phone like previous
Samsung models is made from metal and
glass
it feels great when holding it in the
hand but this thing is a fingerprint
magnet that combined with it being
slippery as ever prompted me to slap a
skin on it and I'll drop a link below if
any of you guys are interested in
checking out the brand's which is where
I got this from but one Hardware change
that I'm really excited about is
Samsung's decision to waterproof the
phone I mean it's great I've used this
phone in the pool and the rain and well
even in my shower a few times that I
have to say I'm loving the ip68
certification what's crazy is that they
did all this without having to increase
the device's dimension or use any port
covers which is awesome the phone will
automatically alert you if the USB port
for example is wet and won't allow any
charging speaking about the microUSB
port one flaw I could see a samsung's
decision not to move to USB see I
personally think it would have pushed
the industry forward if samsung went
with the USB C connection more companies
would board the same ship but I guess
there's always next year some more
hardware changes are the reintroduction
of the microSD card slot 12 megapixel
camera sensor and the removal of the IR
blaster from the past phones oh and
obviously the upgraded specs samsung
decided to go back to qualcomm for the
cpus well at least for the models
shipping to the States countries abroad
will be receiving a model with an X enos
chipset instead but what I have is the
Qualcomm SOC model performance is fast
and snappy as is pretty much every other
newly released Android
phone if you guys want to see more
performance tests like benchmark speed
test or even gaming you should go follow
my cousin Bob from Tech it out because
he will be covering those on his channel
I'll drop a link to it down below
another hardware upgrade is the addition
of another gigabyte of RAM bringing the
total to 4
well 3.5 according to I 264 which is a
system information app from the Play
Store but as some of us know Samsung
phones are notorious for eating up any
and all free RAM so how does this phone
manage it well it's nothing to write
home about I definitely see improvements
in RAM management but it's of course
nowhere near stock Android with a fresh
restart the phone is only showing around
2 gigabytes of usable RAM space which
sounds horrible but you don't feel like
your phone is running low on available
memory you can multitask like a champ
and at no point in time using this phone
that I think to myself that this phone
feels sluggish that brings me to the
battery performance I don't know if this
is a problem with my model or if Samsung
needs to push out an update to address
this issue but my experience with the
battery has been anything but good using
the phone regularly I would get an hour
and a half of on screen time and already
be at 35% also I'll go to sleep with
this phone with a full charge and wake
up with it at 70% this is a serious
problem but others have reported
different findings so I'm sure that I
got a defective unit but in any case
it's something worth mentioning in the
review the 1440p 5.5 inch AMOLED display
is as always stunning the viewing angles
contrast and blacks are really great to
look at the one thing I did notice is a
light color shift when looking at the
curved edges but it's nothing really
noticeable when looking at anything
other than white the speakers on this
phone however really take away from the
multimedia viewing experience
it sounds 10-year and doesn't get as
loud as last years probably because of
the waterproofing but still it sucks
one thing I'm really excited about is
the camera and for my testing so far it
offers sharper vibrant pictures and
video during the day and also does
phenomenal in low-light something that
performed better than what I expected
was the autofocus it's super fast to
lock onto subjects and the camera on
this phone beats any other mobile sensor
on the
right now but that's just my opinion and
the last aspect of this phone I want to
talk about is TouchWiz you either hate
it or you love it I personally find it
atrocious I mean it's been greatly
improved over the years but it's still
bloated as hell it offers great
functionality overstock OSS but at a
cost of system resources but what's
great is you can apply themes which you
can find from Samsung or heck its
Android I'm sure there's a ton of
third-party launchers you can use the
touch of fire phone in terms of visual
experience you have to kind of use it to
see where you stand with it but it is
what it is and I feel it's tolerable but
personally I prefer stock Android like
millions of others the edge is what
makes this film different from a lot of
the other devices and its functionality
has been improved in my opinion but I
feel for the moment it lacks anything
compelling you can have pinned contacts
check out the news set direct actions to
some system apps and a few other things
as of now however Samsung has opened the
API to developers and hopefully soon
we'll get some interesting and new
features from both existing apps and new
edged inspired concepts this brings me
to my conclusion I personally don't see
any usefulness of the edge it's more of
a gimmick in my eyes like horse touch
was on the iPhone it's nice to have but
lacks any real functionality I think the
s7 edge is a better choice over the s7
only if you're looking for a larger
display and longer battery life despite
what you've seen in this video but that
will do it for my review of the s7 edge
as always if you guys enjoyed the video
make sure to leave a like and also stay
tuned for my galaxy s7 review which will
drop in about a month or so thanks again
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
