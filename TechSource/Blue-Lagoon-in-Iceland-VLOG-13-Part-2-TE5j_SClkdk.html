Iceland just got back up from having
some breakfast and we'll be heading out
to the Blue Lagoon in 30 minutes to an
hour I believe to relax and then later
tonight we'll be going to the main event
at the Harper concert hall so before we
get there guys I'm it's going to take a
quick look at these little gifts I got
from LG all right so let's start from
the left side this is honestly I still
can't take it over this is freaking
crazy huge huge thanks to you for doing
this I mean even have my freaking like
face on these tags this is pretty they
seriously went all out and I love the
attention to detail oh my god they made
a freaking cookie out of my face just
when you think like they couldn't be any
more is this crazy how about to eat
myself I wonder how I taste
not bad hey out of time alright moving
on to the next box looks like this is
basically just a chocolates I'm not
gonna open here probably gonna take this
one with me but a box full of assorted
chocolates not bad and then we got a
really cool-looking
action figure which at first looks like
I'm flipping someone off but I'm not
pretty freaking awesome looks like I got
a big hole underneath me I don't know
what they're trying to say and exit out
we have this pretty cool looking applied
with my portrait on there honestly this
looks pretty badass it's got the aurora
lights down there if you guys haven't
noticed and it kind of just blends in
with my portrait so that's pretty badass
last but not least we have this pretty
cool little bird I think it's a puffin
or something very cute and last but not
least we have this bottle to celebrate
college it was kind enough to send over
a raker of vodka bottle on my trip this
is like very popular in Iceland maybe
guys could confirm or deny in the
comments section but yeah this thing is
pretty strong and 40% off all by volume
and we pretty much down this 50% of it
is gone from last night so we're gonna
get ready and start heading out to the
Blue Lagoon I'll see you guys soon
so warm is not that doesn't like triple
digits but it's just actually really
nice how badly would it suck if I just
drop my mark for right now there's like
youtubers everywhere that YouTube is
their vlogging youtubers over there I
think all the a is in here somewhere
so we're on our journey to get some beer
and apparently it's hotter Oh God
feeling it already
the ground is actually not longer was
like these little rocks like you're
stepping on so I'm always walking
carefully and the water that you not
that deep it's like waist tight I would
say right waist height unless you're
tiny like yeah and that's like we are
insisted I'm getting a snack
unfortunately she's never prepared what
you get in there sandwiches
rumor has it there's a cave lurking
around somewhere
we are currently in pursuit
tonight we will all experience the true
blackness of the spectacular scale of LT
OLED TV cell with 330 million own net
pixels
all right so the event is over now it's
pretty much full-time
alright guys so we're back at the hotel
I'm going to eat this crappy snack and
go to sleep because honestly I am
freakin dead tired we have to wake up
5:40 a.m. to go to the airport right now
it's like 12:40 so lonely and you're
like five hours of sleep so I'm gonna be
dying anyways I just want to say huge

Iceland this trip has been phenomenal
