this video we're going to be comparing
AMD's new rx 500 series graphics cards
against their direct competition the gtx
750ti and the 1060 the rx 500 series are
essentially AMD's refined
second-generation graphics cards that
run on the polaris architecture it is
designed specifically for system
upgrades so I have the RX 580 which is
aimed for smooth 1440p gaming and high
settings and it's capable of handling VR
2 then we got the rx 570 which is aimed
at maximum 1080p gaming and they're
basically claiming that you'll achieve
well over 60 fps and all chess settings
in most triple-a titles but obviously we
will verify if this is accurate from our
benchmarks there's also the rx 560 and
the 550 which I don't have on hand but
if you guys are interested in a
comparison between these two cards as
well let me know in the comments section
and I'll go and pick them up for you I'm
also going to be doing another top 5
GPUs under $200 so make sure you guys
hit that subscribe button if you don't
want to miss out
so the RX 560 is kind of like an upgrade
card it's great for those of you who
have a very old GPU that can't quite one
game than 1080p it starts at only $99
and it can basically get you over 60fps
and most games although you might have
to play around with the settings a bit I
don't think you can play most games in
1080p maxed out with this card and
finally the cheapest of the rx 500
series is the rx 550 coming in at just
79 bucks and this card is essentially
competing against intel's integrated
graphics processor it's able to run
games over 60fps but only on less
intensive games like csgo overwatch and
rocket League it's also a great GPU for
a 4k home theater system mainly because
of its low profile design so here is the
entire lineup of the rx 500 series and
their respective prices the old feature
freesync technology so the only free
sync monitor already then you can
definitely take advantage of that as
well as optimization for DirectX 12 and
Vulcan gaming oh and also h.265 4k
encoding this is the testbed that I use
for all the benchmarks then also decided
to add in the 1% and point one percent
lows along with the average FPS it's a
lot of you guys keep asking me to do
that also guys just to be clear I am
benchmarking the board partner version
of the RX 500 lineup as you see in this
video so when I say rx 580 I'm actually
referring to be sapphire rx 580 and when
I say RX 570 I'm referring to the RS RX
570 just to be clear so before we get
into the gaming benchmarks let's take a
quick look at the fire strike benchmark
scores to kind of give you guys an
overview of the performance of these
cards and I even threw in some GPUs from
the rx 400 light up as well we can
definitely see a noticeable difference
from the last generation GPUs not a huge
difference though but just enough to
persuade you guys to go with their new
rx 500 cards instead of the rx 407th
even change it just doesn't make sense
going with the older generation at this
point unless AMD decides to drop their
prices take a look at temp so you can
see that the RX 570 is the hottest card
during full load followed closely by the
RX 580 and with that said here are the
rest of the gaming benchmarks
so the GPU that push the most frames was
the gigabyte gtx 1060 g1 gaming six
gigabyte variants with a total of six oh
eight frames in HD and 470 in quad HD
the runner-up is the RX 580 which isn't
that far behind and then in third place
is the RX 570 but which card gives you
the best bang for your buck well for
both 1080p and 1440p gaming the RX 570
gives you the best value almost three
frames per dollar for HD and 2.25 frames
for 1440p surprisingly the RX 580 gives
you the worst value probably because the
price of the GPU is way higher than it
should be it's claimed a limited edition
rx 580 from sapphire and because of that
stupid title I'm guessing that's why
they priced it a bit higher if you look
at other rx 580 prices they actually
start at just 220 dollars for the 8
gigabyte variant so hypothetically if I
use the actual normal price instead of
the ridiculous $275 price tag we get a
score of 2 point 61 frames on $1.00
which still doesn't beat the RX 5 70
from Oris nor does it beat a gigabyte
gtx 1060 in value so with that said the
RS RX 570 gives you the best bang for
your buck out of all these GPUs featured
in this video so if you're shopping
around for your next graphics card and
don't want to spend more than $200 then
this card should definitely be on your
list if you're looking for a bang for
your buck that is also guys do keep in
mind that other board partners have
these cards starting at just 170 dollars
and I'll drop a link to all the cards
featured in this video down below thank
you so much for watching if you guys
enjoyed it be sure to leave a like it
does take me a long time to make these
videos I hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
