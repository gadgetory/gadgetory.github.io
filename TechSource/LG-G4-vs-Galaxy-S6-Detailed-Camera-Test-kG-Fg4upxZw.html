raps where you can customize your phone
or device with high quality skins what's
up guys is that from tech stores and
welcome to another ultimate camera
comparison test in this video I'm going
to be comparing to the best smartphone
cameras in 2015 we got the LG g4 and the
galaxy s6 so which phone has the best
camera let's find out so before I jump
into the samples let's take a quick look
at the camera specs the LG g4 has a 16
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 1.8 that can shoot up to 4k
resolution and the same goes with the
galaxy s6 with a slightly higher
aperture at 1.9 4 front facing cameras
the g4 has an 8 megapixel camera capable
of shooting up to 1080p
and the s6 has a 5 megapixel camera
capable of shooting up to 1440p and
resets it on the camera specs i'ma bump
up the music so let's sit back relax and
enjoy the show
when it comes to the autofocus the g4
does a really great job it's not the
fastest but it's really accurate at
detecting the object every single time
gesek still has the fastest autofocusing
that i have ever seen on a smartphone
although it isn't really about speed
sometimes it has trouble detecting the
object and just won't focus so I'm have
to give the point to the g4 and the s6
since both have their ups and downs when
it comes to daytime video the g4 has
more warmer colors compared to the
galaxy s6 which is more on the cooler
side both phones have very sharp footage
however the colors are more vivid and
true to life on the g4 which is why I'm
going to give the point to the g4 when
it comes to 4k daylight video for
low-light video both phones do a really
great job because of their super low
aperture footage is as sharp and clear
as you can get in either smartphone
under low-light conditions so I'm a
reward both phones with a point for
low-light video so for the stabilization
test both videos were shot in 1080p so
that optical image stabilization remains
enabled and both phones were strapped on
a single device to ensure a very
accurate stabilization reading and based
on the footage the g4 barely takes the
point for having slightly more
stabilization than the galaxy s6 hey
guys welcome to the front-facing camera
test between the LG g4 and the galaxy s6
and it'll be an audio icon somewhere on
the screen and it will indicate which
phone's audio is being used and also the
g4 is being shot in 1080p and the galaxy
s6 is being shot in 1440p also I'm going
to stay quiet for a second so you guys
can hear the actual white noise in the
background so the s6 actually has a
better front-facing camera it has much
better exposure and the footage is a lot
sharper the g4 is 1080p resolution just
can't compete with the s6 is 1440p
resolution even on the s6 has a lot more
white noise than the g4 the audio is
still a lot louder which is why I'm
going to give two points to the s6 for
front-facing video camera and microphone
quality now in terms of selfies both
pics look super sharp and the color
reproduction is great however the g4
takes the point because of its color
see the jacket I'm wearing is in fact
the same color black that you see in the
g4 pic moving on to daytime pics as I
mentioned before the g4 is more towards
the warmer side whereas the s6 has more
cooler colors the contrast level is
amazing on either phone you also get
really sharp and detailed pics thanks to
their 16 megapixel cameras the dynamic
range however is slightly better on the
s6 if you look above you can see the
clouds on the s6 whereas it's
overexposed on the g4 but in other cases
they are practically identical reds are
also very hard to pick up on both
cameras there's just a lot more
saturation on the g4 and it completely
ruins the image but that only seems to
happen when red is present exposure
levels are also slightly higher on the
s6 on some shots but the reason why I'm
giving the point to the g4 for daytime
pix is because of consistency and truer
to life colors last but not least let's
take a look at low-light performance
look how blue the sky is on the g4 pick
it definitely has better color
reproduction at night it's also a lot
sharper if you pay close attention to
this pic you can see more details on the
tree compared to the galaxy s6 which
tends to have a lot more noise so the g4
takes the point for low-light pictures
the flash on both cameras are also great
for the most part the s6 has a slightly
stronger flash which ends up over
exposing the image where the g4
consistently does a better job you can
see how much of a stronger flash it has
in this shot of the Android figurine the
blue portion on its chest is still
visible on the g4 whereas it's
completely washed out on the s6 so the
final point for flash goes to the g4 so
based on my test the LG g4 is the clear
winner but honestly the galaxy s6 is not
that far behind you can't go wrong with
either for me both of these have the
best cameras you can find that any
smartphone at least for now anyways
