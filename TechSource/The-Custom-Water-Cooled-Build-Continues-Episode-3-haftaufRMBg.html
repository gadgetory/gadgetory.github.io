membership ladies and gentleman welcome
to the continuation of building my
ultimate PC real quickly I do want to
mention why the price change went up
from 7,000 to 9,000 a lot of you guys
were talking about that in the comments
section and that's because the original
build was actually non water-cooled
parts the extra 2,000 was the EK parts
that was added to the total which is why
I came out to around 9,000 but again
prices fluctuate so don't take that
seriously so the last episode we did a
bunch of things as you guys can see if
you guys missed the episode make sure to
watch that before otherwise you'll be
confused
we were waiting on some fans to arrive
and as you guys can see they did come in
and we're also waiting for some paint to
dry on some of the parts so despite the
situation we were in with the parts I
think the paint job came out great
so just to recap the parts we painted in
the last episode we got the mounting
bracket for the reservoir we got two PCI
brackets for the GPU one m dot two
shield and three more PCI brackets so in
this episode we're gonna do a lot of
work we're gonna finish up the GPU
blocks and the next episodes actually be
the finale where we do the bending put
in the liquid and any necessary mods
needed
and first boots I don't know if I'm
gonna be doing benchmarks because it's
not interesting to a lot of people
nobody really cares about that nonsense
anymore but if you guys want to see that
let me know in the comments section
because at this point a high-end gaming
PC like this is pretty much gonna clean
games at 4k resolution max settings so
that is why it's not interesting to do
them but if you guys want to see it let
me know the comments section there's
actually one more thing at the side of
the change and that's the sli bridge
originally I was gonna go with the EVGA
one and take out the stickers and custom
paint the shield red but I feel like I
want to do a completely custom s library
so I hit up a son from v1 Tech and they
sent over some covers so let me open
this up actually for you guys they sent
over one RGB and one non RGB so I'll
have to decide which one I should go
with but yeah this is the person I'm
looking at these actually oh these are
clean so there's actually two versions
but there's one with the white backplate
and there's one with the black I don't
know what yeah which one looks better
let me know guys in the comments section
personally I think this one the one with
the white and then the red TS logo will
look sick but let me know what you guys
think I feel like since the case is
mostly white and this one will look a
lot better so basically what I'm gonna
do is peel this off and stick it to the
stock asus sli bridge so it's gonna go
like this and it's gonna look so much
better than the basic one and then you
got the RGB one so it's basically the
old white backplate and this middle part
over here lights up I think you get to
control the light in it actually so it
comes with a remote control so if I want
to red LEDs I'm gonna get a red LEDs but
anyways it's I guess I should say you
know what screw the black one I want you
guys decide RGB or non RGB let me know
in the comment section
all right so both of the GPU blocks have
been installed successfully let's go and
put them inside the case and then
install the radiators right after so
let's pop this one in first
so when you're winning us-ally there are
usually two methods that you can use to
hook up both of the GPU blocks together
method number one is individual fittings
and method number two is using a
terminal which is usually what I do in
my builds so I think in this case I'm
gonna go with the ek terminal and see
how that turns out if I don't like the
design of it I might just do individual
fittings but we'll see
so okay oh this is the plexi one and I
think I think this is too big actually I
don't know this can go in between both
of the GPUs or maybe you can let me see
no this is a little too big all right so
what I've decided to do is bring up the
bottom GPU one more slot that would
solve the bridge solution and also
actually give me more space near the
bottom because I just realized if I
installed a radiator in the bottom and
hook up the fans on top is barely gonna
be any clearance between the bottom GPU
and the top fan which is gonna restrict
airflow from the fans of course so I
think this way it's gonna work out the
only issue is I'm not gonna be able to
use the sli bridge so Hasan if you're
watching I'm sorry dude you're gonna
have to make another one we're gonna
have to do a one slot as the libraries
that have a 2 slot but I feel like that
it's gonna be a lot better for the build
and I feel like it's gonna look a lot
better so yeah let's do that
all right so now that those are both off
the terminal basically sits like this
between both of the GPU blocks and then
I have to use the same screws and
tighten it to the blocks tell me that
doesn't look a lot cleaner than these
bulky black ones the only thing is
you're not going to see the GTX 10 atti
a logo but you can see it on the back
plate near the top so it doesn't really
bother me got to make sure to put seals
back on otherwise the terminal will leak
this is the tricky part making sure the
seal is still stuck on in the terminal
while you screw this in place because if
you move it around too much it might
fall out of place got those on let's do
the rest
boom ladies and gentlemen that is
installed and I just realized I might
have to take apart the GPU blocks or the
GPUs just to get access to the bottom
rail here because once I install the
Raider and the fans I think it might be
difficult to mount the fans on the
radiator so yeah there's definitely
gonna be a lot of back-and-forth for
this entire build so I'm okay with it
but anyways this part is done let's
finally move on to the radiators we've
got to figure out which ones to use
because they did send four total and I
can only fit two in here I can fit a 360
and I could fit a 240 so let's get these
out of the boxes so we have the cool
stream SE from ek let's put this aside
this one is a cool stream 240 duals so I
think this one's a little thicker that
one was the slim the question is can I
fit the thicker one in the case so yeah
right off the bat you guys can tell it's
definitely notice we take care it's also
wider it's also wider for some reason
so yeah it's thicker and longer just
like mine
I think we'd have to use a slim one
though
let's just let's check it out
actually no we can put the thicker one
to hold up let's try this one
oh no I lied it's too tall it's not
gonna close yeah it's not gonna it's not
gonna close okay the slim rad is fine I
guess so let's try this again there we
go beautiful
so wait it'll go on top the fans will
get installed from the bottom here
question is are we gonna have enough
clearance from the top oh yeah there's
plenty of space okay you know what
probably gonna go with the slim 360 as
well because there's not gonna be enough
room for the double so I'm not gonna
even open that up let's open up the slim
though okay all right so now I'm gonna
flush the radiators it's always
recommended to do this before you
install them so that you can get rid of
any dirt or particles inside the
preferred method is using distilled
water so what I'm gonna do is fill both
of them up shake it a little bit and
then pour the liquid out and I do this
about three to four times per radiator
to make sure that the insides are clean
and ready to go all right so I'm letting
the readers sit for a bit and I came
back here to kind of look at the other
parts that I'm gonna be using this here
is the reservoir and this year is the
pump I don't know what I was smoking on
but I don't know why I thought this
would fit inside the micro ATX case
there was barely any clearance so yeah
this is clearly not gonna fit in here
and this is definitely my fault because
I requested this one instead the problem
with me is I want to cram as many things
as possible inside a tiny case so I map
to see if EK has a shorter version of
this because there's no way I'm gonna
put this in here let alone in the pump
the pump is massive so I might have to
get a smaller pump as well so yeah
fortunately I won't be able to install
that
in this episode so which leaves me to do
the fittings and then the radiators and
that's pretty much it but yeah I promise
you guys on the next episode everything
else will be pretty much ready to go
there's not gonna be any more issues or
we're not gonna be running into any
problems that I will promise you guys
but yeah anyways let me go check on the
radiators and continue with the build
all right so the radiators are squeaky
clean its install the fans on here what
are they here it is I was thinking about
actually painting the rotators but the
fact is they're gonna be hidden inside
the case so there's really no point in
to painting them oh there's actually one
other thing I was gonna tell you guys
what did I put it I'm gonna end that to
shield that we painted here it is this
was originally supposed to go over them
to inside actually between the GPU is aa
BS can even see that but since the GPU
blocks are covering yet there's really
no point in to using it so instead I'm
going to use this and cover up this MDOT
to over here so it's gonna sit over the
slot like this I'm gonna mod it so
obviously it sticks on here but it looks
a lot better than just leaving the MDOT
to visible and just like I said earlier
guys I'm gonna have to take apart both
of the GPU blocks to gain access to the
bottom portion so more work for me yay
so here's another fly found on this case
can someone tell me why the fan holes
over here are so small I'm trying to
mount 120 millimeter fan over here and
the issue here is let me show you guys
an example so this is a typical fan
screw that came in with the corsair fan
and look how small these holes are
there's no way it's gonna fit anything
smaller then this is not gonna hold the
fan in place so unfortunately I'm gonna
have to drill my own hole
it has been a very long day guy this is
one stressful bill this is the hardest
PC I've ever built in my life hands down
I just hope it's worth it near the end
so there's a few things I'm gonna be
waiting for obviously before I continue
there's nothing I can do in this video
waiting for a new reservoir and pump
once that comes in I can finally plan
the loop I'm also gonna order obviously
the new SLI bridge and I'm gonna be
ordering some fangirls because the three
fans and the bottom as you guys can see
it's facing downwards you can see the
cable and the sticker part we're just
gonna look nasty same goes for the rear
fan over here so yeah so fan grills SLI
bridge and then I can plan the loop once
the reservoir pump comes in and then
whatever mods I need to do to make it
stand out for example the mod for the
PSU cover and stuff like that it's gonna
be coming at the very very end but yeah
I think I'm happy so far with the
progress I don't want to jinx anything
but I think once the reservoir and pump
come in they should be smooth sailing
from there but anyways I hope you guys
enjoy the video if you did tossing a
like would be awesome and if you guys
don't like the series please feel free
to leave a dislike and let me what you
guys think so far about the build
anything you guys want to change
anything you guys like anything you guys
hate let me know as always in the
comments section below this is that from
tech source I love your faces I will see
you guys in the next video
