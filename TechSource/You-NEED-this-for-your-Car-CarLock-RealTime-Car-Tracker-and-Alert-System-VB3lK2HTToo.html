you can tell by the location we're doing
something a little different today this
is the car lock an expensive real time
car tracker and alert system so to
install the car lock all you have to do
is plug it in a diagnostic port of your
car now typically on most vehicles it's
located right underneath the steering
wheel and that's about it now we can
actually launch the app and go from
there in the smartphone app available
both on Android and iOS we get access to
all the features so in the dashboard
section we have our driving score which
lets us know if we have bad driving
habits that could be harming our
vehicles and also wasting gas as well
things like harsh cornering rapid
acceleration and harsh braking lower our
scores and having a platform to not only
see this information but also see when
and where it happened can make all of us
better drivers what's also cool is that
all the events are stored in the log
which is organized chronologically so
there's a SIM card in there that makes
all of this work however there is a
subscription plan I believe it's around
113 dollars for a yearly subscription or
you guys can do $10 a month so to put
the costs into perspective get this to
get your car lojacked with the same
security and tracking that the car lock
already provides you you need to fork
over a thousand dollars and even then
you won't get all the functionality this
tiny little device provides all right
now let's test out the app and see if it
actually works
so as you guys can see we're in the
hurricane we got the app running and
we're going to see if there's any lag
while it's tracking real time and to see
if it does send us any notifications
if the car is moving and also if the
device is actually removed from the car
all right so I've been driving around
for a few minutes now and I can
definitely see that it is updating
real-time now sometimes it will take
around five to maybe 1520 seconds for it
to updates but it is updating as fast as
possible as you can see the car just
jumped a few feet forward so I'll
definitely say this is reliable
it's not going to lock the car and cni
commit it is and how fast they're going
to send a notification to us once the
car starts moving so when it's a lock
option as you can see the car is now
armed I'm going to turn it on
so I don't know how long that was but I
just got that verification that the
engine was started so this isn't even
the notification that the car is making
that was notification that the car was
moving here's another pretty cool
feature about this app you can set a
specific speed limit and at our car
passes that limit you'll get a
notification and that is that
notification
so who's the car lock for well it's
basically for anyone who wants to
protect their long-term investment it's
definitely an affordable way of keeping
an eye on your car and knowing its exact
location
whenever you want so that about wraps it
up I hope you guys enjoyed this type of
video if you did make sure to leave a
like and if you didn't you guys can just
like as well I'll jump link down below
to the car life if you want to check it
out thank you so much for watching I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
