welcome to my 2018 desk set up tour
this video was sponsored by guns of boom
a real big shooter that's finally on
mobile it's got awesome graphics it's
easy to play with so many different Maps
weapons customization and game modes to
choose from my absolutely favorite gun
in the game is the Sarah Barris by far
it's a burst shot gun that obliterates
anyone that comes close to me but I do
enjoy the sniper once in a while because
I can pick off enemies from a distance
for a limited time they've added a new
event featuring the real Danny Trejo the
man himself featured in a tournament
that will last until June 14th and
during this time you get access to the
new free-for-all game mode and a bunch
of other cool stuff like maps guns and
costumes we have over 40 million players
that join the game just within a year
and the best part is that it's free to
download for both Android and iOS but
just my subscribers are actually given a
huge starter pack that includes some
awesome gear like a machine gun and some
gold to kickstart your game all you guys
have to do is click on a link in the
description section and download the
game so this is pretty much where
everything happens guys this is where I
run the channel this is where I watch
videos play games I also edit videos
here and of course the occasional fap
session shaking my bottle vitamin-c you
gotta have your vitamins so before you
guys start watching this video I do
recommend watching the upgrade video
which I uploaded a few weeks ago guests
can click on the top right card or the
link down below it's a very beautiful
montage video I did of upgrading my
entire setup so definitely watch that
before you continue watching this one so
I guess I'll start off by talking about
the desk which is the centerpiece of
pretty much every setup this is actually
custom made by level gaming this is the
gamma series they do have a black top
with the red outline as well as a black
and blue so this was actually custom
made for me specifically and there's
also a custom with I think this one is
about 80 inches in width so it's pretty
wide and of course it is adjustable
because I don't like sitting all the
time so I do like the flexibility of
standing up sometimes the only downside
on this one compared to my previous
since then is that there is no memory
built-in so I can't pre-configure
settings for a specific height so we
could have to do it manually
unfortunately but the upside is that
it's more quiet than my previous sit and
standard kind of you guys can hear this
but it's fairly quiet compared to most
since than desks I would say the next
important piece of any setup is of
course the PC itself that is what powers
are set up essentially this year is big
red I have an entire series on it if you
guys want to check it out I've been
through so much
building this damn thing but in the end
it came out to be worth it it's rocking
a 79 80 XC 18 core processor which is
deleted and overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz
I believe it's rocking 32 gigs of ram
two gtx 980ti is from EVGA and I crammed
it inside this tiny micro ATX case from
hex gear this is the our 40 chassis
there's been a lot of mods done to this
case first of all it's water-cooled of
course all the parts are from ek there
has been a lot of custom paint jobs and
some slide modding to make some parts
fit if you guys want to check out
benchmarks and gameplay and stuff like
that I'll leave a link to the video down
below but moving on to the next
important piece of the setup which is
this bad boy my sexy ultrawide monitor
so this is LG's new 38 wk 95 C it's
basically the upgraded version of their
38 you see 99 that I was using for the
past a year or so
it's got a 38 40 by 1600 IPS display
it's got HDR 10 srgb over 99% with built
in free sync in fact the only difference
between this one and the previous model
is that it comes with HDR 10 it's got
slightly thinner bezels and a new base
design with upgraded speakers so you
guys want to learn more about it you can
check out my previous video on the 38
you see 99 it's pretty much the same
thing with different features I'll drop
a link to that down below as well each
tier is really nice if you're actually
watching HDR contents the technology
essentially creates deeper levels of
contrast making the bright parts of an
image even brighter and the dark parts
even darker I would say there's a good
amount of HDR content out there however
if you're not consuming HDR content I
would definitely recommend turning it
off in this
play settings otherwise your image would
have a weird tint to it and it would
look washed out all right let's take a
look at the audio equipment in my setup
the only source of audio I have are the
headphones the speakers and I do have a
microphone which I will get to so you
guys have already seen these many times
these are the Edifier Luna eclipsed e 25
HD Edifier actually makes two versions
of these the HD and the non HD the
analog and the digital I'm actually
using the digital ones which sound
incredible they have a really nice
design kinda like an alien like design
which is why I still kept it and I've
been using it for I think at least two
years now phenomenal audio absolutely
love them so the headphones I'm using
are the Sennheiser HD 800 s which are
sitting on top of drogon and this is my
prop / headphone integrator that I'm
using so these are actually custom
painted and I use these pretty much for
everything
watching videos playing games most
importantly I use them to edit my videos
these headphones have a wide soundstage
and pretty much picks up every possible
sound which is why it's so perfect for
editing videos or monitoring audio or
any audio sensitive work really and I
think that sentencer actually came up
with new headphones for their HD lineup
which I might have to check out but yeah
very a pair of very solid headphones
that I use for pretty much everything
sometimes if I really want to blast the
music and amp it up that's when I switch
over to my speakers alright so moving on
a 2d microphone a lot of you guys had
questions about this in the comment
section some of you even said isn't the
audio come out upside down I don't I
don't know if he was trolling or not but
I seriously hope you were trolling
because no the sound does not become
upside down so the reason why I came up
with that placement is because I didn't
want to use a tripod and put it on the
desk and I didn't want to hook it up to
a boom arm and attach it to the desk as
well I wanted a clean kind of floating
design or floating look to it which is
why I hooked it up to a gorilla pod and
I attached it to the back so one of the
negative things about doing this setup
is because the microphone is behind the
keyboard it's actually gonna pick up me
typing on the keyboard at the same
time so while I'm basically typing and
talking it's gonna be picking up the
keyboard in the background which is a
negative so I don't actually mind
because when I am talking the microphone
I'm usually on skype or I'm on hangout
stalking my friends or meeting so I will
be typing and if I am typing I would
usually just mute the microphone so
here's what it sounds like typing while
talking into the microphone well I'm
basically typing and talkie it's gonna
be picking up the keyboard in the
background so yeah guys I don't
recommend this setup for the typical
gamer because while you're gaming and
you're typing on your keyboard
especially if it's a mechanical keyboard
it's gonna annoy the crap out of your
friends and whatever you're playing with
this type of setup works for me because
of what I use it for and how I use it
but for the average gamer this is not
the ideal setup rather get a boom arm
put it closer to your mouth or just use
your headset microphone so the
peripherals I'm using most of it
actually is upgraded the only thing that
I kept the same was the mouse this is
the logitech g930 mning Mouse it's
absolutely love it I've been using it
for I think almost two years now it's
very responsive it's comfortable and the
battery life on there is pretty decent
that's why I decided to keep it now the
keyboard is one of my favorite upgrades
this is actually not available in the US
at the contact courser and have them
send me a unit this is the case m in the
RGB
se rapid-fire and it's using Cherry MX
switches one of things I love about this
keyboard is the silver aluminum
backplate which really gives off a nice
pop to the RGB colors as opposed to the
black color from the regular k7a the
only downside is it doesn't have a wrist
rest which you know I'm starting to get
used to but overall there's the design
of it with the white key caps it's
beautiful and I absolutely love the
keyboard other thing I replaced was the
extended mousepad my last one was very
filthy and also I was getting tired of
the design it was too busy there's a lot
going on and I replaced it with the red
dragon which really looks nice it's it's
very simple and it's got that nice red
outline stitching which contributes to
the overall color scheme of course I had
to drill a hole in it
and a hole in the desk it's
to out the keyboard wire and speaking of
mouse pads there's this awesome company
out there that just started out and
they're making some dope mouse pads like
these so they sent over a few samples I
think they have like three or four
different designs with three different
sizes and if you guys want to check them
out I'll drop a link below and you guys
can actually get 10% off them using the
code tech source so there are two
reasons why I mounted the speakers this
way on the lack shelves reason number
one it looks a lot cleaner having a
lifted from the desk and also two it's
gonna be at my ear level so the audio is
being directed straight into both of my
ears which honestly really makes a big
difference
alright so cable mandrin was a challenge
for this setup there were so many cables
to work with I have so many devices that
I hooked up and the idea was to
basically keep everything off the ground
so I used a bunch of 3m tape a bunch of
velcro straps I even used a lot of cable
clips throughout the cables but the MVP
here is of course this massive J channel
Raceway that I picked up which i think
is about 50 inches or so most of the
cables are being routed inside that and
everything else is hooked up on the desk
using 3m tape for example the power
strip these power bricks for the monitor
and a bunch of other things of course
and the tricky thing about this is
because the desk is motorized I need to
have some cable slack for a few of the
cables first of all I do need cable
slack for the power strip and cable
slack for the Ethernet cable which is
being routed from the bottom of the
carpet so for example if I'm gonna be
raising the desk I do need cable slack
from both the Ethernet cable and the
power strip so that way both of the
cables will expand with the height of
the desk a few of the things I hooked up
underneath the desk just to make my life
a lot easier is an SD card reader which
is then hooked up to the back of my PC
because my PC case does not have any USB
ports in the front so it's gonna be
really difficult to reach in the back
every single time so that is why I added
an SD card from Kingston I also hooked
up my audio interface this is the
Barringer euphoria um - and my
Sennheiser HD 800 SR hooked up today
and finally an 8 terabyte external hard
drive from Seagate with actually two
built-in USB ports so if I ever need to
transfer data I'll have to do is hook it
up to my Seagate drive which is really
cool because I don't need an extra USB
hub for that it's kind of like a two and
one
so there were mixed feelings when it
came to swapping out the chair a lot of
you guys were against it and others had
questions why the main reason is comfort
so this is the verdict your gaming
series trigger 350.org anomic chair it's
basically if Herman Miller made love to
a gaming chair this is what the outcome
would be I know that the red color is
not matching the rest of the setup and
it's throwing everything off and
affecting OCDs across the world I know
it's affecting my OCD but the main
reason I swapped it like I said it's
Comfort it's got so many points of
adjustment and in the end I'm gonna
signature that I'm comfortable in not
because it looks awesome or it looks
cool one of the things I don't like
about the chair is the headrest I don't
know I think it's damaged actually
because in reality I want to bring it
all the way up here and closer to my
head so I can lay back but as soon as I
do that it goes down so I just think
that maybe it's broken or defective
because it's not supposed to do that
otherwise yeah this would be like the
perfect chair for me I'm gonna have to
contact Burke here about that and see if
they can send me another one because
it's not it's not supposed to be it
I think it's broken but anyways yeah
that's why I swapped the chair so this
was something I added after the video
was completed I needed a phone stand for
my iPhone 10 just so I can prop it up
and see notifications as they appear
eventually what I'm gonna do is I'll
hook up my lightning cable through here
and drill a hole behind it so that way I
can charge my phone at the same time but
that's gonna be at a later time
of course no setup is complete without
any light so I picked up an RGB strip
from my fix and I hooked it up to my
smart phone and I can essentially change
the colors and the intensity straight
through my smart phone which was really
cool I like to keep it on red obviously
to keep the color scheme consistent but
if I'm writing a script or trying to
focus in a productive mode I like to
change the colors to like purple or
light green turquoise just calming
soothing colors like that so you can't
just get in the mood of writing scripts
because I hate writing scripts for my
videos a few other things come on this
way DRA Gon's little brother I hooked
them up in the front here sorry dragon
he's just kind of chillin here in front
of the case I don't know what his
purpose is behind my case I attached a
headphone anger and my Hesh 3 wireless
headphones are pretty much hanging from
here the reason why I hooked that up on
this side is so it's not visible and
then if I'm on the move I can just grab
it and then leave these are pretty much
the only Bluetooth headphones that I use
currently and I hook this up to my smart
phone when I'm playing mobile legends it
does have a mic built-in so we get on
this cord and we talk every place oh
yeah solid pair of headphones I think I
did a video on these over a year ago and
since then I've been using it but yeah
that's what the that's the purpose of
those and that's been at least I added
the mural painting on the wall I wanted
something that obviously contributed to
the color scheme but also nothing too
specific I didn't want like superhero
characters for example like Deadpool I
wanted something like abstract so I
looked up some abstract painting and
this caught my eye it just looks really
cool
and I think really just is the icing on
the cake but let me know what you guys
think
I promote wraps up my setup - or 2018 I
hope you guys enjoyed it let me know in
the comments section what you guys think
of my setup and let me know if there's
anything you guys would like to see me
change or some things you don't agree
with let me know everything in the
comments
also don't forget to rate it out of ten
one being a potato set up ten being a an
awesome setup I guess I don't know
anyways I love you guys thank you so
much anything mentioned in this video
will be linked below I will see you in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
