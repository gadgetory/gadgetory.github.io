and welcome to my comparison video
between the two best budget builds on
the channel in the red corner we got red
Viper which is a $650 AMD build
featuring the r3 1200 and in the blue
corner is Blue Lotus a $730 Intel build
featuring the i3 8100 these prices are
based on the time of making this video I
did a video on both of these builds so
if you guys want to check out temps
overclocking gaming performance the
whole nine yards I'll drop a link to
them down below also I did a full
step-by-step detailed build guide on the
Intel PC with overclocking the GPU so if
you guys want to build one for yourself
or just curious on how to build a PC
then feel free to check that out as well
I'll leave a link below so the purpose
of this video is to do a quick
comparison between both of the pcs and
figure out which one gives you the most
performance and also which one gives you
more value but Before we jump into the
comparison I do want to give you huge
things two-story blocks for sponsoring
this video story blocks is the one-stop
shop to find amazing content for a
fraction of the usual cost they have
access to over 400,000 images videos and
audio from their member library and you
guys can save up to 60% on Marketplace
content once you download the file it's
yours to keep even after your membership
ends and right now they're giving away 7
3 days so you can try it out and access
a massive variety of high resolution
photos vectors and more from story
blocks so make sure to take advantage of
this awesome deal by visiting the link
below so kicking off the comparison
let's take a look at the fire strike
benchmark Blue Lotus managed to take a
slight lead over a red Viper probably
because the GPU was able to be
overclocked slightly more in the Intel
build than the Rison build for rendering
times it was obvious that the risin
build would do slightly better because
of the higher clock speeds I did manage
to overclock the r3 1200 to 3.8
gigahertz compared to the locked 3.6
gigahertz from the 8100 temps were
pretty good for the most parts the GPU
did get a bit toasty since we pushed it
to its limit so expect the GPU
temperatures
the 80s for both of the builds however
if you're not gonna be overclocking the
GPU then you will be looking at mid 60s
to 70s for both graphics cards in terms
of acoustics the intel build is
noticeably quieter than the Rison build
without the side panel however with the
panel on you can't really tell the
difference when we look at gaming
benchmarks between these two pcs we can
clearly see that the Intel build
performs better in every single game the
gap between FPS is huge on some games
like overwatch doom and even GTA 5 while
the gap kind of narrows down the further
we go on the list of games this gives us
a total frame count of 1035 from Intel
compared to rise ins 849 and if you look
at the cost of the build from the time
of making this video the Intel PC
actually gives you more frames per
dollar than the rise in build well what
do you know the Intel build is also the
better choice for the long run because
of its expandability the 500 watt power
supply can support up to a 1080 and an
80 700 K with additional two SSDs so you
pretty much covered with any upgrades in
between that the MSI SD 370 board
supports overclocking so if you do want
to upgrade to an 80 600 K or even an 80
700 K then they will get the job done
you also have the option of adding more
storage whether it's an MDOT to drive or
additional SSDs and get this guys this
case even supports a 240 millimeter
radiator in the top on the spec sheet it
says that it can only support up to a
hundred 54 millimeter fan but I was
actually able to barely fit in the
cooler master master liquid 240 CPU
cooler with two 120 millimeter fans
which is pretty crazy the fact that you
can buy a case like that for only $26 is
crazy
in fact I think the original price is 50
bucks and it keeps going between 50 and
25 but if you guys are planning on
building that PC you might want to snag
that case because the price might go up
again so the best budget bill that gives
you the most value and the most
performance is Blue Lotus however if you
guys are on a tighter budget and only
have around $650 to spend
then the Rison build sounds more
appealing now if you're looking for an
editing and screaming PC and you're
going with
the AMD build that I do recommend
upgrading at CPU to the r5 1600 which is
a six core twelfth read processor and if
you're going with the Intel build I
recommend up getting that CPU to the i5
8400 it's gonna cost a little under a
hundred dollars more but you are getting
a six core processor unfortunately it
doesn't have hyper threading so you only
stuck with six physical cores but for
spending around $200 that is a solid six
core CPU also you guys aren't to spend
extra money on a cooler because both of
the CPUs come with a stock heatsink the
i5 8400 is a loc'd cpu so we can't even
offer clock it so buying an aftermarket
cooler just doesn't make any sense I
mean unless you have the money and you
want a quieter and cooler CPU that's up
to you and as far as the RFI of 1600 I
think you guys can even overclock that
23.9 up to 3.9 gigahertz using a stock
heatsink so I don't recommend spending
any extra money on a cooler what I do
recommend though is upgrading your RAM
from eight gigs to 16 gigs if you're
gonna be doing heavy editing that's
definitely gonna help you out with your
workflow but that pretty much wraps up
this video I hope you guys enjoyed it if
you did show your support to the channel
by dropping a like and if you didn't
please I encourage you guys to leave a
dislike you already know how it is I'll
drop a link to all the parts I mentioned
down below if you guys want to check out
the build guide or if you want to check
out the performance both of the pcs I'll
link those below as well thank you so
much for watching I love your faces I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
