mouse and the Kula Master quick via
rapid keyboard with its ultra satisfying
cherry blue keys my Acer 27 inch qHD
monitor sits on top of my DIY modern
stand and beside my monitor I have the
Edifier s 330d speakers that come with a
subwoofer and this nifty volume control
and my PC is inside a silverstone ft0 2
chassis which is massive and heavy but
continues to clean and simple lines my
setup and my chair choices the IKEA
