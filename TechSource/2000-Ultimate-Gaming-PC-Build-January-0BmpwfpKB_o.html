and welcome to the ultimate PC build for
the month of January this is Reggie oh
god the $2,000 gaming PC with an MSI
theme all the parts I used in this build
will be listed down below in the
description section for anyone that's
interested so it's running on a 6700 K
skylake processor which is overclocked
to 4.4 gigahertz sixteen gigabytes of
ddr4 3000 megahertz RAM from g.skill and
an MSI GTX 980 graphics card for the
motherboard I went with an MSI z170a
gaming pro to stay consistent with the
theme and a Samsung one terabyte SSD for
storage part of all of these components
is the 1200 ax I which I know is
overkill for this build I just had it
lying around so I figured I'd use it my
ultimate builds are more for aesthetics
rather than price performance like my
budget builds are so this time around I
went with the NZXT Noctis 450 case
because it not only looks cool but also
has the same clean look inside from
their other amazing cases like the H 440
and s3 40k old management is always an
extremely easy task using their cases so
I'm sure you guys have noticed the msi
red and black colors but i've actually
stuck to the theme and picked up msi
gaming gear as well you have the msi gk
701 mechanical gaming keyboard with
Cherry MX brown switches which are all
individually backlit this is one of the
few really well-built mechanical gaming
keyboards the frame is made out of
aluminum which adds a really nice
premium feel to it next to that I have
the DS 200 Gaming Mouse which features
nine program multiple ins 16 million RGB
backlit colors and a dpi sensor that can
be adjusted up to 16,000 400 for anyone
demanding extreme precision the bass is
pretty wide which is great for people
with larger hands and me being a claw
gripper I find it extremely comfortable
to grip since it has somewhat of an arch
the mouse also comes with an adjustable
weight system for anyone that wants a
heavier Mouse to complete the gaming
setup we have the MSI DA's 502 gaming
headset it features two large 40
millimeter drivers for krispy audio and
it's extremely light making this one of
the most comfortable gaming headsets
that I've ever worn the microphone is
also adjustable and you can move it out
of the way when you are not used
it yet set also features 7.1 surround
sound to give you that added spice and
bring your games to life using the sheer
living technology that comes built in
the headset the monitor I used to do the
benchmarks is the 31 inch LG 4k display
and this is actually different than most
4k monitors and a sense that it's true
4k meaning it has a resolution of 4096
by 2160 the monitor sports an IPS
display with Adobe RGB over 99.5 percent
which is great for editing so this was
sent to me by mass drop which is a group
buying website the more people join a
drop for a product the lower the price
get set right now they have some really
great deals on a 144 Hertz gaming
monitor but I'll leave a link down below
if you guys want to check them out so
back to the PC I do want to point out
some awesome mods like the MSI fan
grills the custom cables and even the
back plates which are all from v1 tech I
use them before in my last PC build race
ox and I'll jump the link to the website
down below if you guys are looking at
spice up your current PC they do amazing
work so onto the benchmarks that scored
a 12,000 846 on fire strike which I'm
really happy with considering it's only
running on a single 980
you can find the rest of the benchmark
scores and PC temps linked in my Google
Drive down below for anyone that's
interested when it comes to editing
Retro god exported a 60 second 4k file
in around 4 minutes using these export
settings and as always I'll leave the
template in the Google Drive below if
any of you want to run the same tests so
it all that said and done let's take a
look at the gaming benchmarks done in
1080p
so that's what the gaming benchmarks as
always if you guys enjoy these monthly
PC builds make sure to go bacon on that
like button and I will continue to do so
every single month I actually have a
three hundred dollar budget build coming
up for next month and you guys want some
sneak peeks make sure to follow me on
Twitter and Instagram as always thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
