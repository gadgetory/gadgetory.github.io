what's up guys its F from Texas and
welcome back to another vlog today is
gonna be a very busy day here at the
headquarters there's a lot of work that
needs to be done like I mentioned in the
previous episode we're gonna be moving
things around in fact let's start off
with my office slash studio so this is
my office slash studio so yeah I took
apart a lot of things and I kind of
tidied up the area as you guys can see
you so it was way Messier in the
previous vlog so here's the plan guys
this desk is gonna be gone all the stuff
on the vest is gonna be gone I got my
new table downstairs the PC is gonna
stay for now until I make my new one
hopefully in October or November god
knows when and this desk is gonna be
moved over to the room next door
like I mentioned before guys the
charging station which is this desk over
here that's gonna be going against this
wall and that desk over there the
filming desk is gonna go against that
wall over there and of course I'm gonna
have to move the hook up the name of
these Oh the both legs dumbbells and of
course my play buttons I'm gonna have to
probably I don't know hang him somewhere
on the wall over here and there were
some people in the last vlog that were
kind of upset or curious as to why my
mom was sleeping on the ground here in
this room guys let me explain first of
all one I have a guest room downstairs
there's a nice queen bed and I offered
my mom to sleep there but she didn't
want to she wanted to sleep on the floor
because it was good for back I don't
know the whole reason but I did offer it
let me show you guys just so you don't
think that I'm joking around here so
this is the guest room as you can see
nobody currently lives here or sleeps
here so this is the queen bed that I
offered my mom to sleep on but she opted
to sleep on the floor because it's
better for her back she has some back
problems I don't know so yeah guys I'm
not heartless I did offer her a place to
sleep yeah I love my mommy oh yeah and
here is the current state of the loft it
is pretty much a disaster right now as
you guys can see I didn't move the TV to
my bedroom over there and will be
popping in this bad boy this is the 65
inch 65 you h77 4k TV on here I'm
actually going to mount it against the
wall I did pick up a TV mount as you can
see we're gonna be putting that there oh
and I also got my sound bar let me show
you guys that I hit up LG and I told him
to sign over there sj9 sound bar this
thing is a beast
can't wait to unbox this I don't know
why it came in such a huge box to be
honest this thing is actually very slim
as you guys can see that's what that
actually looks like but the sound on it
is incredible and of course I had to
have it for my loft so that is going in
the loft area and that in the corner
over there is my desk which I'm gonna
have to bring upstairs to the studio so
yeah I think I should go and take apart
the desk upstairs first before I bring
that over so let's get that started I
honestly don't think that this desk is
gonna fit through
door over here which means I'm gonna
have to take it apart which it's gonna
suck but you know you gotta do what you
got oh my god oh my god beautiful that
is hey baby I'm gonna be using you
tonight though can't wait
so yeah definitely one of my dumbest
ideas so far as I expected it's not
gonna fit through this door so I'm gonna
have to take it apart I'm gonna have to
do it the long way
I so now that I got these in here it's
time to move the charging station over
to this wall over here and then I can
finally finish setting up the filming
desk against that wall which I think
will look beautiful
now because I'm going to be connecting a
lot of things on the charging station I
decided to upgrade the power strip from
the simple I think eight outlet to a
whopping twelve which i think is gonna
be plenty enough to hook up a lot of
things like printers power banks I mean
rechargeable battery stuff like that
a good example of not what to do I was
horrible so yeah guys there we have it
the filming desk is finally in the
center I did my best to measure it that
way it's perfectly centered between
those two shutters and unfortunately the
Bowflex dumbbells have to stay in that
corner and then the alux drawer unit on
the left side because there's literally
no other room in this entire room
there's no other space in this entire
room obviously we have to Center that as
well and yeah that's pretty much it and
not to hook up everything and this room
is pretty much done
the only thing that's missing is some
artwork because it's looking a bit too
bland I might have to put some paintings
on it actually you know what
I got a way better idea I'm so glad I
kept these because I knew eventually I
was gonna use it where is it whereas it
was there it is the black and red
acoustic films may make it return guys
so yeah we're gonna spice up the wall
over there so yeah we're gonna spice up
the wall over there so yeah we're gonna
spice up the wall over there there we go
I hope this is gonna be enough though
because there is only I think 12 red
pieces in 12 black I don't know if it's
enough to cover up the entire wall
actually I don't want the whole wall
covered up just like the centerpiece
that way there's at least something in
the background as I'm recording my
videos I also want to thank that person
whoever was who commented or I think
send me a tweet
recommending me to use t-pins on the
phones instead of using the 3m spray
that I use which kind of damaging my
wallet my last apartment apparently you
can use these and basically pin the
phone's against the wall and there
aren't gonna be any holes or any
anything like that so that's gonna be
awesome
so I finally just finished this table as
you can see everything is neat and tidy
up top I didn't hook up 3m tape actually
instead of velcro because 3m tape is a
lot stronger as you guys concede none of
this is actually budging so yeah the top
is pretty much finished obviously I have
all this space to work with as I get
more chargeable devices
and battery stuff and also down here is
pretty clean I put the 12 outlet surge
protector inside the blue lounge cable
box and then I tied up the cables
together using velcro I'm not gonna get
a cable sleeve for this because as you
can see the cables kind of just go in
every direction near the top that way
can reach all the devices near the top
so cable sleeve will not do anything to
prevent that so I'm just gonna keep it
that way it's also a lot easier if I
need to add more devices I can simply
open up the velcro strap plug in the
cable and then tighten it again
so yeah this part is pretty much done
now let's work on this wall over here
okay so the issue with this is that I
cannot fit the perfect amount of foams
from one side of the shutters to the
other so there's gonna be there's gonna
be a gap basically but the problem is I
need to make sure the gap is equal on
both sides as you can see that side is
much shorter than the other it's also
one of the reasons why I didn't put the
pins in all the way just so I can easily
pull them out because I'm still
adjusting them and the best part about
these is they're not permanent you know
I can easily just pull this out or pull
both of them out and then boom
there's your wall now that I get stuck
on the back which is perfect
so I guess right now have to do some
measurements and figure out where the
perfect spot is to fit I guess one two
three four I cannot count 1 2 3 4 5 5
booms across the wall and I'm gonna make
my way up halfway I would say and then
cover up some of the parts on the bottom
here as well all right so I'm finally
done it didn't take that long right now
there are about four inches from both of
the shutters so I'm pretty happy about
that
another minor issue that I came across
is that apparently the acoustic panels
if you place them horizontally they're a
few centimeters shorter compared to the
ones that are vertically centered as you
guys can see it's just a matter of a few
millimeters but it's driving me crazy
the top portion as you can see is
aligned but the bottom I don't know for
some reason supposed to be 12 by 12 but
when you place them vertically it's off
by a few millimeters but whatever it is
what it is so I'm going to finish up the
rest of the wall and enjoy this
time-lapse
you
so yeah guys there you have it the
acoustic wall is finally back it's
looking prettier than ever and yes I did
decide to add my silver play button
because I was looking for a place to put
that and I figured why not do the same
design as my previous apartment now guys
I need your help I have some extra
acoustic poem poems poems as you can see
you got two pieces of red and two pieces
of black I was wondering if I should
continue and put the red acoustic foams
on the side there or I should just keep
it square just like this we just think
let me know in the comment section down
below I think this looks perfect if you
guys look really closely you can see the
pins inside there's usually around two
or three in each of the poems and but
from a distance you can't really tell
and that's the point it keeps it nice
and hidden and it doesn't damage your
wall or the acoustic foam so it's a
win-win in my opinion but yeah guys not
too shabby I think this room turned out
pretty good very clean table management
is on point that walls finished this
desk is complete as well I think the
only thing left is these two lamps I
have no idea what I'm supposed to do
with them I don't think there's space in
here and the golden play button which I
think I'm gonna mount right against our
wall cause it's looking a bit empty and
yeah I think this room is pretty much
done very happy with the way it turned
out so now let's move on to this next
project which is my actual desk setup
this is a complete disaster I've been
using this fill for like the past two
months since I moved in so it's
definitely time for a change so I'm
going to take this apart and then bring
up the new desk and then finally set it
up and from there I can start making the
ultimate desk setup series
