episode of PC Wars I know it's been such
a long time a lot of you guys probably
even forgot about it but it's still here
it still exists so I want to keep you
guys waiting welcome to PC wars episode
25 we used to make your custom PC to get
featured on the channel if you guys want
to participate make sure to watch the
video linked below
with that said let the PC Wars begin
first up we got Cori and severed blue
which is a black and blue water-cooled
PC winning on two separate loops it's
equipped with a 6600 K and an MSI GTX
1080 I'm not really sure why Cori went
with two separate loops for a single GPU
but hey it says build not mine besides
the obvious custom painted and modded
case he also did some vinyl work acrylic
panels power supply cover and even added
a platform for the reservoirs there are
no benchmarks for severed blue and
fortunately but this is a sick black and
blue setup Thank You Cory for starting
off this episode next up is Bruce Wayne
with a god damn sick looking white and
red PC I mean a color scheme on this one
is just beautiful and look how cool the
fans look I was actually curious what
model these were so I did some research
and apparently they are RGB LED fans
from ia go I think that's how you say it
and they only sell them in Malaysia
unfortunately they're not available in
the u.s. so boost is calling this frost
edge and it's rocking the 77 and decay
16 gigs of ram in two gtx ten 80s
founders editions actually in sli and
this is all built inside the hex gear
r40 chesties which again doesn't look
like is available in the US the fact
that you managed to squeeze all this
inside a tiny micro ATX case and keep
the cables hidden is incredible and that
modulus though there's just way too many
to name but he's got some custom back
plates painted at the library and power
supply custom motherboard heatsink and
i/o shroud now I don't know if that's
painted or what but damn does that look
amazing he even has a PSU cable shroud
right above the power supply to hide the
cables coming out of it I mean this guy
has thought of everything I'm personally
not a fan of the 90 degree fittings but
this build is just beautiful for
benchmarks is for a 25,000 382 taking
the lead for this episode thank you
Bruce Wayne for entering and number
three is Gavin and the barbershop now
here's an interesting color scheme that
I haven't even seen before we got black
red white and teal I mean at least it's
unique right so the barbershop is
equipped with a 6800 K 32 gigs of ram
and an EEG
a GTX 1084 the win some custom mods
include a painted front grille painted
PC brackets and custom sleeved cables
the benchmarks have scored 18 thousand
714 taking second place for this episode
I mean it's not a bad PC I actually like
the unique color scheme it's definitely
a nice change from everything Thank You
Gavin for entering so you thought
Bruce's white and red PC was bombed
we'll check out Ivan's so damn clean
it's like a scene from the matrix where
the entire room is white so badass
it doesn't have a name but what it does
have is a 6700 K that's overclocked to
4.2 we got 16 gigs of RAM and an msi gtx
1060 there's also a lot of mods mostly
paint jobs like the RAM sticks fans and
even the case got a nice paint job then
we got that acrylic PSU cover and the
panel for mounting the case fans pump
and even the reservoir nicely done
I just love how parallel the build is
I'm pretty sure you did the tubing that
way on purpose to achieve a clean look
you definitely got that right for
benchmarks that scored 11,000 179 taking
third place Thank You Ivan for entering
last but certainly not least is Shawn
and his insane custom looped PC not
because it has a 60 800 K and 2 GTX 10
70s but because of those bends there's a
lot going on here and even though I'm
personally not a fan of how it looks I
got to give props to Shawn for pulling
this off if you're going to do crazy
bends in your PC this is how it's done
take notes g-man there's also a lot of
different LEDs inside here and I feel
like that's what Shawn was going for a
crazy messy and intense look and he
certainly achieved it but benchmarks
that scored 8,000 176 in 5 sky culture
instead of the regular benchmark which
he was supposed to use but it doesn't
really matter because none of the pcs in
this episode can be Bruce's dual 1080
build in terms of benchmark scores a
very sick build nonetheless thank you
Shawn for entering so that is it for
this episode at PC Wars you guys so much
for watching make sure you guys vote
down below on who you think has the best
custom PC I'll announce the winners on
my Twitter and it's the file thank you
so much for watching I'll see you the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
