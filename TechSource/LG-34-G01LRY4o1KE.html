and in this video we are going to be
taking a look at LG's ultra wide 34 inch
free sync monitor this beautiful 2560 by
1080 P 75 Hertz monitor is directly
targeted at gamers first and
productivity second because of his
resolution and features that include
free sync and dynamic action sync for
those of you that prefer a widescreen
monitor geared more towards the
productivity side which has 80% more
pixels then you should definitely check
out that 34 um 95 model which I will
link in the description down below so in
addition to the power cables which are
needed to power the monitor you will
also get a DVI and HDMI cable along with
a back cover for the stand that includes
a hook to help with cable management
taking a look at the front you are
greeted with a beautiful IPS display
with matte anti-glare coating and really
thin bezels the back however is made out
of glossy plastic which is a huge
fingerprint magnet and down below you
will find all the connection ports which
include two HDMI s1 DVI one DisplayPort
your audio ports and the power something
I would have loved to see is perhaps a
USB port on a monitor of this caliber at
least they were nice enough to include a
VESA mount option in the back for those
of you that like to mount things if you
choose not to mount your monitor you can
use their included very nice-looking
see-through mount which really doesn't
give you much choice when it comes to
height adjustability except like an inch
or two however you can tilt the monitor
a few degrees to adjust its angle for a
better viewing experience which is all I
need joystick on the bottom which is my
preferred method of navigation and with
that you can access a bunch of options
in the quick menu settings you can
adjust the usual color and brightness
along with the ratio of the monitor
under picture you can adjust the black
stabilizer feature which lets you
control the contrast level making it
really easy to spot enemies or objects
that are hiding in the shadows or
darkness and on the opposite side when
you are flashbangs &amp;amp; FPS games which I
feel it's kind of a cheat if you ask me
but hey more power to the players also
in the picture settings you can select
one of many
pre-configured settings for picture and
gaming mode that have different gamma
color and sharpness settings or you can
select custom and configure the settings
to your own liking
moving to general settings is where
you'll find all the features that the 34
um 67 has to offer one of which is free
sync that's currently only available
through the DisplayPort and AMD APU and
GPUs free sync essentially resolves the
communication issues between a processor
and monitor and it basically tells the
monitor when to refresh the image and
what that does is it eliminates image
tearing stuttering and lag that you
normally get from either enabling or
disabling vsync the second feature
you'll find useful is dash mode aka
dynamic action sync mode which basically
reduces input lag and allows you to make
timely commands which is especially
important in real-time strategy games
like Starcraft 2 League of Legends and
other MOBAs normally this will lower the
quality of the image on most TVs however
in the case of the 34 um 67 the quality
of the image remain the same so I always
have it turned on outside gaming this
monitor becomes a Productivity monitor
and one of the many benefits of an ultra
widescreen monitor is the fact that you
have so many windows open at the same
time along with infinite amount of tabs
if you're a tab or like me especially in
editing you can really appreciate the
amount of horizontal pixels that you can
utilize as you know I use two Samsung 4k
monitors and it's really an overkill for
me I mean I barely even use my second
monitor at all and I've been wanting to
switch over to a widescreen monitor for
a very long time well I've been using
this for about a week now and I can
safely say that this is exactly what I
needed
however I still find myself scrolling a
lot more due to its vertical pixel count
but that's expected from a 2560 by 1080p
monitor also scaling is unnecessary
anymore even on my 4k monitors I used to
scale everything just so I could see
them better which kind of defeats the
purpose of having a 4k monitor in the
first place so I feel like this monitor
is the sweet spot for me the fact that
it's an IPS panel is also a huge plus as
you get amazing color contrast and
viewing angles so let's get back into
gaming for a sec games look amazing on
this monitor especially when utilizing
the entire screen there's no doubt about
that 75 Hertz is insanely crisp and
smooth
there is a noticeable difference from
sixty Hertz that much is true you will
definitely get the full immersive
experience from this monitor there is
ever one thing I want to mention about
the implementation of free sync on this
monitor
so the 34 um 67 has a variable refresh
rate range of 48 to 75 Hertz which can
be both too high on the minimum and too
low on the maximum side and what that
means is that as long as you are running
at 48 fps to 75 fps in a game everything
looks nice and smooth going above that
value and you will either get some
moderately noticeable tearing with vsync
off or else you'll max out as 75 FPS
with vsync on which is also fine the
real issue is when you drop a low 48 fps
you are basically falling back to
standard LCD behavior at that point so
either you have very noticeable tearing
with a 75 Hertz refresh rate or you get
started from subdividing a sub 48 FPS
frame rate into a 75 Hertz refresh rate
21 by 9 gaming is still new and there
will be more and more support as time
passes by but overall I'm really happy
with this monitor it provides cinematic
immersive gaming experience and great
productivity on a beautiful 75 Hertz IPS
display which if that's what you're
after then you will definitely not be
disappointed in LG's 34 um 67 monitor as
always I will leave links in the
description section down below for both
of the monitors and if you guys want to
check out the curved version of this
monitor which is geared towards
productivity with a lot more pixels than
my good friend Matt from Anna's Tech
we'll be doing a video on that as well
and you can click on the screen to check
it out and I'll also leave a link down
below as well anyways that is it for the
video feel free to drop a like if you
liked the video or you dislike if you
didn't and make sure to subscribe if you
haven't already for more videos like
these thanks again for watching this is
that from tech source and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
