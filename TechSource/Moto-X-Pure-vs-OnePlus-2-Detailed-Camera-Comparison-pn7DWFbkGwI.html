welcome to another detailed camera
comparison test this time we are facing
off two of the best budget flagship
smartphones for 2015 in the Moto X pure
and the oneplus 2 but before we jump
into the samples let's take a look at
the specs the Moto X pier has a 21
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.0 that can shoot up to 4k
resolution and the oneplus 2 has a 13
megapixel camera also with a 2.0
aperture that can shoot up to 4k
resolution as well for facing cameras
the Moto X pier has a 5 megapixel camera
that can shoot up to 1080p and the same
goes for the oneplus 2 but instead can
only shoot up to 720p so without wasting
any more time let's sit back relax and
take a look at some samples
when it comes to auto focusing the 1+2
just doesn't do a great job at all in
some instances that has a very difficult
time focusing on the object and I find
this to be very consistent when the
object is small with a well lit
background the Moto X is the complete
opposite very fast and very accurate
focusing and all of the conditions I
tested it in I also didn't notice the
camera moving in and out trying to focus
the object like it did on the oneplus 2
when it comes to daytime video both do a
really great job there our footage is
super crispy and the color reproduction
is nice the oneplus 2 has much warmer
colors whereas the Moto X pure is on the
cooler side but I'll have to give the
point to the Moto X because the lens
isn't constantly moving in and out
trying to focus like a dozen the oneplus
2 which is pretty annoying for low-light
video both do a pretty good job as well
really great low-light performance and
sharp footage I really don't have much
complaints
well actually the only complaint I have
is that the oneplus 2 shoots at a much
lower shutter speed to allow more light
in which means that it records in 19 FPS
which is horrible when you're trying to
capture motion on the other hand the
Moto X shoots in 24 fps and still
manages really great low-light video I
did however experience some autofocus
issues with the Moto X in low-light but
it wasn't really that consistent so I'm
not gonna really give a point to either
phone for a low-light video for
stabilization both phones were shot in
4k resolution and we're strapped on a
device to ensure a very accurate
stabilization reading and from the looks
of it it's pretty obvious that the Moto
X pure takes the point I find this
interesting because on the spec sheet
that states that the oneplus 2 has
optical image stabilization whereas the
Moto X pure only has digital so that
means that the software on the Moto X
peer is that amazing to outperform the
optical image stabilization on the
oneplus 2 great job Motorola what's up
guys welcome to the front-facing video
camera and microphone test portion the
video between the oneplus 2 and the Moto
X pure both of the cameras are being
shot in 1080p and they're also mounted
on a device to ensure a very accurate
stabilization reading
also you guys to listen to this on your
headphones then I'm gonna stay quiet for
a bit so you guys can hear the
background noise
for front-facing video I'm apt to give
it to the Moto X for having sharper
footage and a much wider field of view
I mean 720p just doesn't compete with
1080 also not that I'm looking at the
footage the dynamic range is solid on
both phones there are some points where
over-and-under exposes but overall both
phones do fine for microphone quality
the Moto X has a much louder mic than
the oneplus 2 this can be either a good
or bad thing depending on how you look
at it since having a louder mic picks up
lots of background and wind noise but
I'll give the point to the Moto X for
having a loud mic since that's what
majority of the people are looking for
for daytime picks both cameras shoot
stunning picture is that oneplus 2
produces warmer pictures whereas the
Moto X is more on a cooler side in my
opinion the oneplus 2 is too much on the
warm side for my taste and some shots
the image looks really bad like here
with the color of the grass I mentioned
as many times before but I do per for
warmer images because they tend to be
more truer to life but this is out of
control
sharpness however goes to the Moto X
hands down the 21 megapixel sensor beats
the crap out of the 13 megapixel from
the oneplus 2 the image is just
beautiful and crispy the oneplus 2
however has more true to life colors
than the Moto X and the actual colors of
the flowers and leaves in this pic are
more accurate from the oneplus pick and
the same goes for these subscribe pillow
and the yellow Jeep dynamic range is
also pretty good on both phones they are
practically even in this category but
for overall day time ticks the Moto X
pure takes the point for indoor shots
the oneplus 2 has much better exposure
on auto everything is more clear and
bright than the Moto X but this can be
adjusted easily on both phones but since
this entire comparison is done in Auto
the point goes to D 1 plus 2 the Moto X
pure however takes a point for selfies
now even though both use a 5 megapixel
front-facing camera the Moto X has a
much sharper image and better color
reproduction not to mention a wider
field of view for low-light pictures the
oneplus 2 seems to have a more clear
image than the Moto X in this pic the 88
engraving on the hinge is more visible
on the oneplus 2 in the background and
this pic is pitch black on the Moto X
where you can still see the design
slightly on the oneplus 2 even in low
light mode on the Moto X two pictures on
the wall
look better and are more visible there's
just too much noise on the Moto X pier
and there seems to be a bluish tint
applied to all the photos the oneplus 2
takes the point for low-light pictures
now when it comes to flash it's a
different story the flash on the oneplus
2 is way too powerful and over exposes
most of the objects and washes out to
pick the flash is only usable at a
distance on the oneplus 2 whereas the
flash on the Moto X can be used at any
distance so there you have it the Moto X
pier has a much better camera than the
oneplus 2 if you guys enjoy these camera
comparisons and want me to continue
doing them then make sure to backhand
that like button and let me know which
two phones you want to see for my next
camera comparison by dropping a comment
down below anyways thanks again for
watching this is FM Tek source and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
