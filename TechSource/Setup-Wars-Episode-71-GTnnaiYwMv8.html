I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out as always you
guys can find the gear for every one
setup link below but here are your five
contestants for this week we have
Anthony email I think Giovanni John and
Mikkel or Michael I don't know if you
forgot the E on purpose or what but I
thank you and congratulations for making
it on the show alright so starting off
the episode we have a black and white
setup from Anthony so we have a 27 inch
Samsung and a 27 inch BenQ monitor
hooked up to the wall II monitor mount
at first I thought the speakers were
resting on the desk but after looking at
it a second time it appears that he
stuck them on the bottom of the monitors
probably using some velcro or 3m tape I
would imagine what a clever way to make
use of the speakers on such a small
surface job well done so on the desk we
have the corsair k70 RGB keyboard
logitech g502 proteus mouse on top of
the white extent and mouse pad from
glorious I recognize that don't stand
from anywhere that's the same one I was
featured in one of my cool tech episodes
and it's also the one I'm using in my
personal desk setup good choice I can't
really see what you did with the cables
because of the angle you took the
pictures maybe you're just trying to
hide them but from what I can see it's
fairly clean I also like how you kept
your coarser void headset on a hanger
off to the right side of your desk I
definitely love the consistency of the
color scheme and you managed to fill up
the entire surface area of the desk
without making it seem so cluttered and
finally the PC that's powering the setup
has a 4790k and an EVGA GTX 980 once
again I applaud you for keeping with the
color scheme very organized and clean
setup no doubt Thank You Anthony for
entering I don't know what you guys get
these paintings from but I'm starting to
see them pop up everywhere and I'm
starting to like them so email has two
27-inch Samsung curved monitors a
corsair k70 keyboard and SteelSeries
mouse we also have the SteelSeries
Siberia headset off to the left side
although there isn't much of color
coordination present email data phenom
with the cable management everything is
hooked up to the roof of the desk and we
have a cable wrap running all the way
down to the PC which by the way is
running at a 4790k and a GTX 970 I can
also see that you're a huge fan of LEDs
I mean you got some behind your shelf on
the roof on all four sides and of course
behind your monitors the only thing I've
modified from the setup is by maybe
adding some velcro to the back of those
remotes and slapping them under your
desk so that they are not visible when
you are not using them but overall a
very clean setup indeed thank you email
or mo I'm so sorry for butchering your
name for entering Giovanni is next up
with an old white setup Daniel that's
clean he's walking the ever-so-popular
24 inch asus monitor and i was actually
wondering where the mouse was only to
realize that he is left-handed
so both keyboard and mouse are from
logitech and a few other things on the
desk include the AKG white 50 headphones
a scanner and an Xbox one controller I
really like the appearance of this desk
and it's actually a combination of the
IKEA mom desk and a custom-made drawer
from Giovanni great work with cable
management looks like most of the cables
are sitting in a rack and the rest are
behind the PC Giovanni has a gorgeous
white PC build rocking another 4790k yet
seriously like three in a row and for
the GPU is rocking an asus strix 960
overall I'm really diggin the aesthetics
of this setup I think the wall shelves
and the chair I really bring everything
together Thank You Giovanni for entering
John is next up with a black and ready
triple-a cyst monitor setup now what's
interesting here is that he's rocking a
glass monitor riser without having the
monitors actually on them instead we
have a bowl that's holding up some of
his items now I'm not sure this was here
for aesthetic reasons but it's
definitely taking up majority of the
space on the desk in fact I'm almost
positive that's one of the reasons why
he has his base pole speakers on the
sides I feel like he is forced to put
everything near the edge of the desk
because the riser is occupying most of
the space but I digress
also on the desk we have the cooler
master Devastator to combo and below the
desk we have two headsets resting on the
anchor the Logitech G 230 and skull
candy crushers by the way props on
mounting the USB hub on the roof
as well as the two remotes for your LED
strips it does look like you record
audio judging by the acoustic films on
the wall and the blue Yeti blackout mic
that's hooked up to a boom arm I have no
idea what that thing is on the left side
of the desk by the way is that supposed
to be a lamp or something there's
definitely a lot going on in terms of
cable management but I'm happy to see
that the wires are wrapped up together
and routed alongside the roof of the
desk finally the PC is powering the
setup has a 60 600 K and an msi gtx 1070
inside the corsair spec alpha case a
very interesting but organized
black-and-red setup
Thank You Jon for entering speaking of
black and red we have Mikkel with a
simple ultrawide monitor setup that's
resting on what appears to be a
different version of the Alex add-on
unit sandwiching the monitors are a pair
of genius bookshelf speakers and below
that we have the corsair k70 rapid-fire
keyboard and razer naga expert mouse
sitting on top of the HyperX extended
mousepad in front of the desk is where
the HyperX cloud tubes are resting and
cable management is Wow
I definitely like what you did with the
backboard running the wires through
there like that if you guys have a
backboard hooking up the power strip
like this is much more effective because
it's a lot easier to reach and plug
things in compared to mounting it on the
roof of the desk but that PC though now
that's a very sick build it's rocking a
6600 K and 2 MSI GTX 970 s in SLI now
normally I don't recommend stuff for PCs
and setup wars but I do love this build
so much that I want you to perfect it
judging by the rest of the room you seem
to be a well-organized and very clean
person and that makes me very happy to
see you know what I'm gonna do for your
mccarroll I'm actually going to toss
into these custom MSI back plates since
I have them laying around from previous
build so if you want these make sure
toss me an email and claim them so that
is it for this episode of setup words as
always make sure you guys drop your
comments down below and vote on who you
think has the best desk setup as always
I'll announce the winners on Sunday on
my social media accounts thank you guys
so much for watching as always if you

dislike and I will see you guys in the
