welcome to another detailed camera
comparison test this time we have the
iPhone 7 versus the iPhone 6s before
diving into samples let's briefly go
over the specs the iPhone 7 has a 12
megapixel rear camera with an aperture
of 1.8 that can shoot up to 4k
resolution the iPhone 6s has a 12
megapixel camera as well but with a
smaller aperture of 2.2 also capable of
recording 4k video the front-facing
camera on the iPhone 7 comes in at 7
megapixels and can capture up to 1080p
video and the iPhone 6s has a 5
megapixel front facing camera and can
record video up to 720p by the way these
skins are from v brands and they offer a
variety of materials for different types
of devices so if you guys are interested
in checking them out I'll drop a link to
them down below so without wasting it
over time of sit back relax and take a
look at some samples
starting with video recording let's take
a look at the rear camera and daylight
autofocus between both phones seem to be
about the same speed it's not painfully
slow but it's nothing to write home
about the field of view is unchanged but
the color of each video shows some
slight differences the iphone 7 camera
takes on an ever so slightly cooler tone
than what is found on the 6s video from
the iPhone 7 is also slightly less
saturated especially in areas with
vibrant colors like green and pink in
low-light certain details are more
visible on the iPhone 7 footage and this
is due to the wider aperture of 1.8
compared to 2.2 on the iPhone 6s video
is brighter overall and less grainy as
well both phones managed to keep focus
locked and don't hunt around that often
video stabilization gets a much needed
upgrade on the smaller iPhone 7 with
optical image stabilization handheld
video is vastly smoother and rarely
shows any shake what's up guys so I am
now holding the iPhone 7 and the iPhone
6s and I'm shooting with the
front-facing camera and the resolution
is set to its highest on both phones
there will be an audio icon somewhere on
the screen and it will indicate which
phone's audio is currently being used
the front camera finally shoots in 1080p
and it shows when compared side-by-side
everything is sharper mostly noticeable
on small details in the
face and on articles of clothing the
field of view remains the same as does
the onboard microphone
moving on to photos both phones exhibit
a very similar level of sharpness and
field of view the colors coming out of
the iphone 7 camera have a more muted
look to them and don't have as much pop
as they do on the iPhone 6s dynamic
range on the other hand sees a
noticeable improvement on the iPhone 7
preserving details and the highlights
better just like with video recording
front-facing camera on the iPhone 7 is
substantially better the dynamic range
and overall contrast of the image shows
improvement over the 6s the PAS facing
camera on the iPhone 7 is definitely
sharper as well thanks to that higher
resolution sensor at 7 megapixels one of
the biggest improvements the iPhone sees
this year is the low-light photos due in
part to that wider 1.8 aperture images
from the iPhone 7 are all around better
than those shot on the 6s showing more
detail and a substantial less amount of
noise than before photos are brighter
too making a much more pleasant to look
at combined with optical image
stabilization the images are noticeably
sharper and keep the motion blur
minimized as well the updated flash also
keeps the color saturation levels in
check definitely looking less washed out
compared to the pictures on the 6s so
there you have it guys both phones have
their strengths and weaknesses the
iPhone 7 is definitely an improvement
over its predecessor but not big enough
to warrant upgrading if you already own
an iPhone 6s the biggest changes come in
the form of low light capabilities and
the front-facing camera aside from those
the two phones are pretty close and
performance but what do you guys think
let me know your thoughts by dropping a
comment down below if you guys enjoyed
these videos I want to see a specific
camera comparison be sure to leave a
like and let me know which two phones
you want to see head-to-head in my next
video thanks again for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
