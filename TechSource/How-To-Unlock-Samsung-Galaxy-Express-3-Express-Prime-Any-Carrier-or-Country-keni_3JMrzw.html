I'm here to show you the process of a
locking your Samsung Galaxy Express 3 or
galaxy Prime smartphone so you can use
it with any GSM carrier in the world put
a cementation I will be using my locked
galaxy Express 3 and unlock it so I can
use it on my t-mobile network but it's
the exact same process for any carrier
from any country so first off we need to
get the unlock code to start your
locking process and a place where I get
all my lock codes is the unlocking
company comm because that the cheapest
price is online and I get my codes much
faster than other websites so head on
over to the unlocking company comm and
select your phone manufacturer and the
phone model from the drop-down list and
on the next page go in and select the
country the phone was originally
purchased from and the carrier of the
phone in my case I purchased it in the
United States an original carrier is
AT&amp;amp;T before we continue we need the IMEI
number of the Express 3 and the way you
look that up on your phone is to open up
the dial pad and enter in star pound
zero six pound once you have that go
back on the website and enter that in
and once everything is filled out it
should take you to the final screen
where you have to check out after
checking out they will email you the
lock code the price and every time of
your code varies by phone but don't
worry because as I said before you are
getting the cheapest price online with
the fastest delivery times once you
receive your lock code from your locking
company it's time to unlock your phone
so go ahead and pop open the back cover
and remove the battery to gain access to
the SIM tray then go ahead and put in
the SIM card you want to use with the
phone I want to use the galaxy Express 3
on my t-mobile network so I'm putting in
my t-mobile SIM card if your SIM card
doesn't fit you need to adjust the size
and you can do that by watching my video
linked below
once the SIM card is inside the phone
going to put back the battery and the
backplate and turn on the phone once
your phone boots up it will take you
straight to the unlocking page and this
is where you enter the unlock code that
you received from the locking company
once you put in your code it will give
you a message stating that the unlock
was successful then it will take you
straight to the home screen which means
your phone is now permanently unlocked
as you guys can see I'm using an AT&amp;amp;T
galaxy Express 3 on my t-mobile network
if this video helped you guys out feel
free leave a like and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
