source and today we're going to be
locking the ZTE grand X 3 so you can use
it with any GSM carrier in the world
however you can use this tutorial for
any ZTE grand X model since all the
steps are similar we do need to purchase
on a lock code before we begin in the
place where I get all my lock codes is
the unlocking company comm because they
currently offer the fastest delivery
times and the cheapest prices so if you
guys want to save money check them out
so the first step is to find the IMEI
number on the phone and you can do that
by simply opening up the dialpad
and typing in star pound zero six pound
once the number pops up you have to go
back on the locking company website and
enter all of the information and go
ahead and put in the manufacturer the
model of the phone and on the next page
select which country the phone was
originally purchased from and the
carrier of the phone once you hit next
you will need to put in the IMEI number
that we just looked up on the phone and
finished building out the rest of the
boxes once you finish checking out they
will email you the unlock code once they
email you the code it's time to unlock
your phone so make sure it's powered off
before we continue pop open the back
cover and remove the battery to gain
access to the SIM tray then you can go
ahead and pop in the SIM card you want
to use with the phone and then you can
go ahead and put back the battery and
the back cover and reboot the device
once the phone boots up it will take you
to this page will ask you to enter in
the a lock code and this is where you
put in the code that was emailed to you
once you put in the code and hit unlock
your phone will take you straight to the
home screen and your phone becomes
permanently unlocked now if your phone
doesn't have an option to input and a
lock code then that means that your
phone needs to be unlocked remotely and
if that's the case then the locking
company will take care of it on their
end
so don't worry so that's how you unlock
any model of the ZTE grand X for any
country feel free to leave a like if
this video helped you guys out and
