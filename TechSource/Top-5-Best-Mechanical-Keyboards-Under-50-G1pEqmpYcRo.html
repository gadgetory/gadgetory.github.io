and in this video we're going to be
taking a look at the top five mechanical
keyboards under fifty bucks and you guys
can find the links to all of these down
below let's begin for the sake of not
repeating myself throughout this entire
video
each of these keyboards have blew out
two Moo switches which are basically
Cherry MX blue equivalent so first up on
the list is the Eagle tech kg zero 11
which goes for 49 bucks the base is
constructed out of ABS while the back
plate is made out of this brushed
aluminum material which gets scratched
pretty easily
seriously I've only had this for about
an hour and there's already a mark on it
other than that the build quality is
very sturdy the keys do feature this
high-tech style font which is pretty
cool and also features a Windows lock
key and 100% anti-ghosting here's a
quick typing sample a few things I don't
like about this keyboard it doesn't come
with a wrist rest only features blue
LEDs which by the way you guys can
adjust the brightness via function key
and the size while typing I'm not able
to reach the backspace button which is
pretty inconvenient also there's about
two inches of unused space near the top
of the keyboard which is unnecessary and
contributes to the overall size of the
keyboard my overall rating on this
keyboard is a solid eight the things I
like about this keyboard aesthetics
build quality numpad feature and the
backlighting the aluminum backplate with
the white key caps really looks nice and
the LEDs are more intense due to the
reflective backplate the sades k10 is
the only other keyboard on this list
with a full numpad it goes for $49.99
and features a full abs plastic
construction with a gold backplate it
also comes with a Windows lock key and
anti-ghosting as well the keyboard is
also the only one that I came across
that has multiple colored LEDs basically
each world the keys has its own color
and they are not customizable so if you
want an entire keyboard to be backlit in
blue or red then you're Sol you can
however change the animation and
brightness using the function key there
are a bunch of different style of
animations from a wave effect all the
way to a spiral effect which is pretty
cool you can also change the speed of
the
animation by using the arrow keys here's
a quick type example the things I don't
like about this keyboard there is no
wrist rest you don't have the ability to
change the colors of the LEDs and the
ugly backplate color I don't know about
you guys but gold is a nasty color on
keyboards speaking of colors the
backlighting isn't as strong as the
eagletech keyboard probably because of
the non reflective and dark backlight
color the things I like full numpad
access sturdy build and cable management
I love the fact that you have the option
to route the wire at any direction you
want from left to right or even just
keep it in the center this is especially
great for those that have a hole drilled
in their desk because you can easily
wrap the cable straight down for a
wireless look despite the ugly gold
backplate I might give this keyboard a
solid 9 for what it offers these last
big keyboards don't feature a numpad and
are more compact first up we have the
Tomoko MMC 0:23 which goes for around
$38 the base is made out of ABS plastic
with a metal backplate and it features
anti-ghosting and key rollover and of
course a Windows lock key for gaming
perhaps its main feature is the fact
that it's water-resistant you can pour
an entire glass of water on it and it
will still work without any problems
it also features three drain holes in
the back allowing the liquid to pour out
of the keyboard things I don't like
no numpad obviously no LED backlighting
and no wrist support what I like about
this keyboard is the fact that is water
resistant and the construction feels
very sturdy and the keyboard actually
has a pretty heavy weight to it I would
even go far and say that it weighs as
much as my Corsair strafe this keyboard
is a solid 7 next up we have my favorite
keyboard out of the 5 in this video this
is the key sound which is a 60 key mini
gaming keyboard with only 5 rows of keys
this means that there is a lot of
overlapping basically the F keys are
combined with the number keys up top and
then
you have the multimedia shortcuts near
the bottom even the home and end buttons
are overlapping with the page up and
page down the base is made out of ABS
plastic while the backplate is
constructed out of aluminum but despite
the size this is one sturdy keyboard I
can't quite figure out why I love typing
on this so much even more than my own
Coursera Wave keyboard maybe it's the
overall footprint or the satisfaction of
feedback I get when pressing each key I
mean whatever it is I really enjoy it
here's a quick sample the negatives
about this keyboard are you probably
guessed it no backlighting with support
numpad or even a windows lock key which
I find very odd considering this is
labeled as a gaming keyboard what's more
is that it features anti-ghosting but
only up to seven keys what I love about
this keyboard is the compact form factor
build quality and the feedback and sound
from typing on it it also comes with a
detachable USB cable which is perfect
for cable management since you can wrap
the cable straight down and do the desk
assuming you have a hole in your desk
furthermore it comes with a micro USB
OTG adapter meaning you guys can connect
this keyboard to your smartphone or
tablet
if it supports OTG overall this is a
solid keyboard and I would definitely
recommend this more for people who
travel around and want a fully
mechanical keyboard to use with their
laptops or tablets for my experience
with this keyboard the past week I'm
giving it a solid eight last but not
least we have the red dragon kumara that
goes for around 40 bucks this is a
backlit keyboard with red LEDs that
feature an ABS and aluminum construction
it's actually very similar to the Tomoko
keyboard in terms of build quality and
the layout of the keys with the
exception of it being backlit it does
feature Windows lock key anti-ghosting
up to seven keys which is nice but it's
lacking a wrist rest and a numpad
I really don't have anything bad to say
about this keyboard for the price it
does what it's supposed to but because
it's backlit with red LEDs imma give it
one more point than the tomoko keyboard
the Chamorro is an older version of the
red dragon so if this keyboard is sold
out by the time you watching this video
I'll drop a link to their new version
which is the exact same keyboard but
with a newer and cooler design so that
basically wraps up the top five
keyboards under 50 if you guys enjoy my
top 5 series or if this video was
helpful
make sure leave a like to show your
support then you guys so much for
watching as always I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
