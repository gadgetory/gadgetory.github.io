welcome back to the final episode of
what's in the box it's not really the
final episode but this is actually the
last episode we're gonna be shooting
here on the first floor of the office
we're actually gonna begin shooting most
of our videos downstairs in the garage
starting tomorrow we have a new a/c
system down there so it's not gonna get
hot and we also have new carpets so it's
gonna be comfortable shooting videos and
the space is just a lot bigger than it
is up here so we have a lot more room
whether it's PC builds or new desk set
up so just unboxing videos like these we
now have the extra space for it but
anyways I'm done rambling let's unbox it
if you guys want to find the best deals
on tech make sure to check out deal
source tech we have a team of
ambassadors constantly searching the
internet and uploading the best deals
multiple times a day across the US UK
Canada and even Germany anything from PC
parts to TVs even Windows CD Keys you
will find them all on deal source tech
check out the link below if you're
interested all right that's not small
box also if you guys have noticed are
the wall color is different we no longer
have that nasty blue green pink color
like you would see in kindergarten
classrooms and it was honestly getting
annoying Oh some nice stuff - I hear so
I went and we painted the office this
grey color which honestly looks really
nice especially if you have colors
bouncing off of it so yeah definitely
shouldn't have gone with those nasty
colors from the beginning but you gotta
learn the hard way sometimes it looks
like a mess I sent over a care package
this is actually some pretty neat stuff
in here let's see you got their famous
dragon mascots
it's kind of rubbery I don't know what
this is for exactly I guess it's a prop
oh it's a flash drive oh it's pretty
sweet how many gigs is this 16 gigs
really 60 gigs all right I'll take it
that's sweet
what else we got here
I'm not a dragon mascot but this one
looks like it's for your key so has a
keychain on here a nice comfy neck
pillow for travel I can happily use this
okay
another stop to Dragon which I'm
guessing can sit on my setup you got a
hat and oh what's this whoa this is
actually really comfortable looks like
they sent over a jacket check this out
guys
this is actually a really comfortable
jacket and it fits perfectly so winter
is coming so I'm gonna be usually
wearing this a lot of my videos thank
you Emma sighs so much for sending these
I was actually two more things they sent
me what is this looks like some sort of
a carrying case for for what though
maybe for this oh it's a mug for coffee
or drinks or whatever this is sweet
and I'm guessing this is the carrying
case for this if I'm not mistaken
it's a tight fit and honestly I will
feel really stupid if this is not for
the mug but yeah this is awesome I'm
actually use most of these thank you so
much I'm aside for setting this in the
eyes are the best moving on to the next
package alright this is the next biggest
box let's check this out okay so this is
from PNY technology let's see what they
sent me
we have a very tiny box inside this
massive box alright oh yeah we have a
GPU what kind of GPU is this from P and
whites icon this is already open I'm
gonna use GPU let's see what you got
here
Oh xlr8 which I'm guessing it's
accelerate that's how you say it
it's a geforce RTX 2080 ti overclocked
edition wow this thing is a beast so
they sent over a GPU for me to test out
expect the video on this bad boy but
also expect an awesome build featuring
this bad boy because I think they're
sending over a second one for an SLI
build and you guys already know the
builds on text source a spicy next up is
this from FedEx I'm so excited this
finally came in I placed the order on BH
photo I think a week ago so I'm actually
making a vr gaming room inside my helm
and I'll be making a video on it of
course but I'm basically turning my gym
room into a vr gaming room and this and
that's where this bad boy comes in this
is the HTC vive pro this is obviously
going to be the main centerpiece of the
entire project I'm very excited to set
this thing up I've been watching
actually reviews of this and it's not
really a big upgrade coming from the
original HTC vive I think this is like
$1,200 which is a complete waste of
money coming from the original vive
based on the reviews but I picked it up
because
the reason actually I just I don't know
why I picked it up because I just like
having the latest in technology
regardless of how much of an upgrade it
really is I think one of the main things
that really attracted me to this let me
actually get out of the box yes so there
are two reasons why I made the jump the
first reason is the headset itself you
get higher resolution for the actual
goggles better sounding speakers and
most importantly now there's only one
cable needing to be plugged in to the
control panel or whatever this piece is
and overall I think personally the
headset just feels a lot lighter than
the previous headset so those are the
main reasons I'm always about comfort
and the highest quality out there so
that is why I decided to make the jump
to the HTC vive pro so I'm excited to
put this to the test and begin the VR
and gaming make sure you guys are
subscribed for that because it's gonna
be an awesome series I think all right
looks like we have a laptop so this is
the omen by HP oh I was not expecting
this let's check it out let's open this
thing up packaging is actually really
nice oh wow this is actually really
heavy why is this so heavy despite the
size this thing is heavy you guys I'm
not even kidding
opens up with one hand really nice oh
that is actually a really good-looking
laptop let's boot this thing up and take
a look at some specs first thing I
noticed is how thin the bezels are on
this side here it does have a little bit
of a chin down here and you do have the
front-facing camera up here but overall
I think the bezels are really nice and
thin brushed aluminum surface down here
underneath the keyboard and looks like
everything else is plastic plastic top
here does have a brushed aluminum look
but it is still plastic and also has the
carbon fiber look here with the black
and red aesthetic personally guys I'm
not a fan of the gamer black and red
look on laptops I much prefer a cleaner
minimalistic design like the eraser
laptops
but this is actually not a bad-looking
laptop Oh looks like it's gonna argue
I'm Cortana and I'm here to help sign in
here okay so here are the specs on this
bad boy
we got the eighth generation I 78758
processor it's at 2.2 gigahertz we have
an SSD at 128 gigs of space with a one
terabyte hard drive we got 16 gigs of
DDR 4 RAM a 15.6 inch full HD IPS
display at 60 Hertz and finally an
NVIDIA GTX 1060 so with these specs you
can expect a game comfortably over 60
fps across most triple-a titles but you
guys can expect me full review on this
bad boy in the coming weeks so very
excited to put this to the test and I
still still curious why it's just so
heavy it's crazy alright moving on to
the next box
alright we got two more to go guys this
box has nothing on here no label or
branding we have a FedEx box in here
okay there's there's nothing in there
okay ah we actually have some more omen
gear okay starting with the omen
mousepad at 200 I think this is an
extended mousepad let me open this up
actually no it's not extended mouse pad
but it is an extra-large fabric mouse
pad
next up we got the omen reactor this is
looks like a wired mouse let's pop this
open whoa look at the design on this
thing it's a very tiny Mouse and guys I
think this is something I've never seen
before this cable is braided in metal or
aluminum or steel or something it's not
it's not fabric yes you're that I don't
know what type of metal that is but this
is the first time I'm seeing this on a
mouse mouse itself is very compact very
light I'm guessing this is perfect for
fast paced games whether it's FPS or
even MOBA RPG is really easy to lift and
move around interesting this is a very
comfortable Mouse but I'm gonna be doing
a video on this and the headset along
with the laptop as well in one video so
I'm not gonna spend more time with it to
give you guys my honest feedback so this
is the omen mine frame it's an advanced
gaming headset why is it advanced I
wonder I gotta say the packaging on the
omen products is very nice it's
interesting that this cable isn't steel
braided like the mouse but I'm okay with
that
so what's so advanced about this headset
I wonder it's got a built-in microphone
which you can bend okay it does have the
mesh type ear cups which personally I'm
not a fan of I like the leather style
ear cups but let's put these on they're
fairly comfortable the design is
definitely premium it's got aluminum
band and it feels very sturdy I'll give
them that
but what is so special about these so I
guess it has surround sound and RGB
lighting across the frame over here if
they do RGB lighting on a headsets so
The Omen mind frame features frost cap
the world's first active ear cup cooling
technology interesting using a
thermoelectric device inside each ear
cup frost cap cool
the speaker grill plate and transfers
heat away from the ears allowing you to
stay comfortable during long gaming
sessions and concentrate on the wind
that's interesting and I think that's
the first I've ever heard of such
technology inside their cups but
obviously I'll be testing that out and
see if it's a gimmick or not it sounds
interesting but we'll see if it actually
even works all right guys last but not
least we have this box which was sent by
FedEx there's nothing else on here let's
see what it is what is this looks like
some sort of a VR headset from Lenovo
and an eye rage camera interesting let's
open this up and see what this is
oh so this is a standalone VR headset
with world sent so I'm guessing is one
of those headsets with built-in
applications and I think these are
targeted mostly for kids out there it's
not only for adults yeah these are the
ear cups it looks like ear cups charging
cables all that jazz in here what does
this is open this up real quick so I
guess you can capture videos and photos
with this and you're supposed to get the
app the VR 180 app by Google to capture
180-degree VR photos and videos with
this thing it sounds pretty cool but
I'll to do some more digging and see if
this is something interesting enough to
make a video on I don't think this is
something you guys would be interested
in because I'm it's mostly targeted for
the younger audience but yeah let me
know let me know if you guys are
interested in something like this I
might do a review but currently I'm not
planning on a review on it so yeah guys
that pretty much does it for this video
I hope you guys enjoyed it everything I
unboxed will be links down below in case
