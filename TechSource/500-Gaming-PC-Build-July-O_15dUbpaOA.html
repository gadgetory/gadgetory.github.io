what's up you guys is that back again
from Texas and welcome to the Orion
gaming PC build a family dollar gaming
budget build that's able to run games in
1080p over 60fps sorry about taking so
long to get this video uploaded those of
you guys have been following me on
Twitter and Instagram probably already
know what I had to go through to get
this thing uploaded but nonetheless its
finished and ready to go by the way I
will be making a video on how to build
Orion for those of you I want to
purchase the parts and build one for
yourself and if the video is uploaded
I'll go ahead and leave a link to that
along with all the parts mentioned in
this video down below in the description
section this is the best gaming PC that
you can build for only 500 bucks and I
will be running benchmarks as well as
gaming performance tests and a rendering
test to see how fast Orion renders a 4k
file I will leave a template or I should
say the raw file down below in the
description section and we'll get more
into that later in this video so for the
parts I went with the AMD FX 8350 Hertz
8 core processor and MSI 760 GMA micro
ATX motherboard 8 gigabytes of ram 1
terabyte storage space a Sapphire Radeon
r9 270x video card and an EVGA 500 watt
power supply all of these packed inside
the micro ATX tower case from Cougar
spike that features 2 USB ports in the
front for easy access one of them being
a USB 3.0 and it also has two audio
ports for your headset and other
peripherals so starting off let's take a
look at the temperatures as you can see
on the right side is currently clocked
at 3.7 gigahertz keep in mind that it's
using the stock cooler and I wouldn't
recommend overclocking it past the 3.7
gigahertz mark unless you pick up an
aftermarket cooler so I was able to
slightly overclock it to 3.7 while
keeping cool temperatures now this is
joying idle and we can see that the CPU
temps hover around 30 degrees Celsius
and the GPU hovers around 31 degrees so
fairly cool temperatures during gaming
the CPU temps rise up to a constant 36
degrees and the GPU hovers around 48
degrees for some reason I had no idea
that battlefield 4 was winning in the
background as I was playing GTA 5 so
this may be slightly cooler when running
only one game instead of two next up we
have benchmarks starting off with
Cinebench r15 we can see a Cinebench
score of 81 point 95 FPS and a cpu score
of 555 also down below you can see how
the CPU ranks against other Intel i7
processors which surprisingly isn't that
far behind next up we have a very
popular fire stripe benchmark and by the
way you guys can download these
benchmarks for yourselves and test it on
your gaming PC as well and compare the
scores to the Orion PC so it scored a
fifty to seventy nine and there's a
little graph below to show the score
ranks compared to other pcs lastly I run
a rendering test due to many requests
from my last PC build so I rendered a
raw 4k video file that I shot using the
gh4 and rendered it in sony vegas pro 13
and the purpose of this test is to
compare the rendering speeds to other
pcs so if you want to compare your PC's
rendering speeds to that of orianna's
then you can do that by downloading the
raw video file link down below these are
the settings I used and as you can see I
rendered in the 4k resolution as well
now the time may vary depending on the
program you are using but nonetheless is
a pretty accurate way of comparing
systems when it comes to productivity
alright so now let's take a look at its
gaming performance now I did what all
the games at the highest settings to
achieve at least 60 FPS and I'll go
ahead and leave the frame counter on the
top left of the corner so you guys can
check that out in real time I did do my
best to test a wide array of games and
if there's a specific game that you want
me to test on my next PC build let me
know by dropping a comment down below
and I'll go and pick that up and add it
to the list but anyways I'm gonna go in
and shut up and let you guys enjoy the
show
anyways that's up for the video I hope
you guys enjoyed it if you did let me
know by leaving a like on the video that
way I continue doing PC builds every
month on that channel my next PC bill is
actually going to be an ultimate gaming
PC so make sure you guys are following
me on instagram and twitter for all of
these sneak peeks and updates but
anyways thanks again so much for
watching i really appreciate all the
support you guys have been giving me
this past few months without you guys i
won't be able to do PC builds like these
so thank you very much for that and for
those of you that want to help support
the channel even more you guys can
change your amazon bookmark to the one i
linked down below it's completely free
nothing changes on your end I just get a
small kickback every time you guys buy
stuff so that really does help the
channel a lot and I can continue doing
these PC builds for free every single
month but anyways thank you so much for
watching this is that from tech source I
will see you guys in the next video
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
