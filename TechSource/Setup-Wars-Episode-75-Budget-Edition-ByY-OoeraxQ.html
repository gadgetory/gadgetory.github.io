wars it's still going to be on every
single Monday at 12 a.m. Pacific
Standard Time but every 5 episodes you
guys can expect a budget edition episode
just like the one you're watching today
and every 10 episodes will still be the
worst set-up edition and then in between
that I'll throw in an ultra light setup
Edition Ultimate editions and of course
the regular editions that you guys
continue seeing but yeah I think is
pretty much it welcome to set of boards
episode 75 someone is throwing away
trash
welcome to setup wars episode with a 75
budget Edition where you submit your
desk setup to get featured on the
channel so if you guys want to
participate make sure to watch the video
linked below let the setup wars begin if
you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2
AECOM because they have the cheapest
cd-keys available for pretty much any
game I'll drop a link to them down below
if you want to check it out so your five
contestants for this week are Alexa
Ernests faze James and Manuel let's
begin starting up we have Alexa and a
very modest setup featuring the Asus 23
inch monitor bloody be 120 keyboard and
SteelSeries sensei mouse he does have a
recording setup which consists of the
SteelSeries Siberia headset and a
microphone which is hooked up to a boom
arm it makes sense I mean he does have a
tech channel as well and surprisingly he
shoots some very nice videos so make
sure to go check out his channel guys
I'll drop a link to it down below I'm
very surprised that is able to shoot and
edit videos using this PC it only has a
44 60 and 8 gigs of RAM there is no GPU
in the PC in fact he's using the
integrated graphics chip cable
management isn't the best but it can
easily be fixed if you pick up a cable
box or just watch my cable management
video I did on the channel a few months
back a very simple and modest setup
Thank You Alexa for entering and good
luck earnest is next up with our very
first ultra light setup in a budget
edition I guess he couldn't afford a
monitor stand so instead he used a pair
of Acme wooden speakers to prop up the
monitor which is very clever the
keyboard of choice is the e blue Cobra
and are paired with the e-blue mazer
wireless mouse there is a hanger on the
wall holding up the phillips 5200
wireless headphones but that's pretty
much it for the surface of the desk
cable management seems to be well done
even though the wall is a bit dirty i
don't really have any complaints here
maybe a cable box for your power strip
on the right side but nothing major
needs improving the PCG is using has an
x4 740 quad-core processor and a
gigabyte r7 250 Thank You Ernest for
entering at number three we have my boy
phase with our first Mac setup of the
episode he's running on the 2014 Mac
Mini which is hooked up to a 23 inch
tail monitor he's also rocking the Apple
wireless keyboard and the MX anywhere 2
mouse for audio he is using the boombox
bluetooth speaker and a pair of Pioneer
M 521 headphones which is resting on a
table that desperately needs some
cleaning I will recommend some Clorox
wipes or something similar to get that
dirt off but all jokes aside cable
management can also be improved some
cable sleeves along with a cable box
will surely clean up the wires a bit
down here a cheap headphone stand can
also keep your headphones from getting
dirty and keep it from damaging your
desk any further
thank you phase for entering James Bond
is next up with a very clean black and
blue set up he's rocking the aoc 27 inch
widescreen monitor with the cursor k70
RGB keyboard and saber RGB mouse on top
of the extended mouse pad also from
Corsair the only thing he has for audio
is the sennheiser momentum headphones
which are hanging from the wall and the
only other thing on the desk is the Xbox
one cable management is superb James did
an amazing job wrapping the cables
together using velcro straps and the
cable clips are keeping the wires from
hanging down the PC he is using has a 49
30 K and a GT 740 honestly I would say
this setup is a little far from a budget
setup the only thing missing is a solid
GPU but nonetheless a very clean setup
good luck and thank you for entering who
says you only need one monitor for a
budget setup Manuel is rocking 2 Dell
monitors with a custom painted base I'm
guessing to match his black and red
setup but honestly that looks really
well done
on the desk we also have the Logitech G
105 keyboard and low
why gaming mouse for audio we have a
pair of stockdale speakers and a big
blue live bluetooth speaker off to the
right side cable management is pretty
good I can see that you made an effort
to tie everything near the top and I
loved that you made your own charging
station on the side of your PC using
some velcro and power banks although the
red one isn't straight and it's kind of
hurting my OCD speaking of the PC is
running on a 2600 K and a gtx 750ti
also down here we have a pair of
Logitech g2 30s I love the consistency
of the color scheme and these origami or
paper art things on the wall look really
cool and complement the setup but Thank
You Manuel for entering so that is it
for this episode of set-up wars I don't
know if you guys enjoy budget edition or
not if you do let me know in the
comments section and leave a like but
also more importantly make sure you guys
vote down below on who you think has the
best budget setup thank you so much for
watching as always and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
