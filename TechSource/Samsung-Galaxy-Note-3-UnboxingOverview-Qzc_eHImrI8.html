to a close look at the new Galaxy Note 3
by Samsung we got this straight from a
tnt which means it comes in a scrappy
box and you can pick one up in either
white or black and they come in either
32 or 64 gigabyte versions but if that's
not enough space you can add an
additional 64 gigabytes of space via SD
card totaling up to 128 gigs which is an
insane amount of storage I'm a Buddhist
up real quick and put it to the side
wall quick so we can finish the in
boxing because we got this from AT&amp;amp;T it
does not come with earphones but it does
not bother me so moving right on you
will find the handbook for the device
you have your micro USB 3.0 cable
enabling faster data transfer and
charging speeds and your wall charger
with the port being on the side so the
note 3 has a 5.7 inch super amoled at
1080p screen with 396 pixels per inch
taking a look at the phone you will find
the power button on it's right side on
the top you have your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack noise cancelling mic and
your IR blaster on the left side you
have your volume controls and on the
bottom you have your S Pen speakers
micro USB 3.0 port and your microphone
on the front of the phone you will see
your speaker grille infrared sensor and
be a light sensor which also contains
the proximity sensor and your
2-megapixel front-facing camera the back
plate on the note 3 is also made out of
pleather which is an imitation of actual
leather it's still plastic but it
definitely feels much better than the
glossy plastic Samsung is used to using
this is why the SIM card would go and on
top of that is where you can insert an
SD card to expand your storage space the
note 3 is a very powerful smartphone
running on a Snapdragon 800 two point
three gigahertz quad-core processor and
it is the first and only phone on the
market with 3 gigabytes of RAM Samsung
has also improved the S Pen design
allowing you to slide it back into the
phone and more orientations which makes
it really convenient when using it at
nighttime the note 3 is a little slimmer
than no 2 and is not as wide it is
however still taller the note 3 is truly
a great smartphone for multitasking I
personally don't consider this a phone
all I look at it as a mini tablet with a
phone feature I definitely don't think
people buy a note 3 to make simple calls
or even use it like a normal smartphone
they buy it to take advantage of its
features with that being said this is
definitely an overkill phone for me
simply because I won't be using over
fifty percent of what the phone offers
but for others this is exactly what
they've been looking for so that's it
for the technical details of the phone
now let's take a closer look at the note
3 so that's it for the unboxing and
overview thanks for watching the video
