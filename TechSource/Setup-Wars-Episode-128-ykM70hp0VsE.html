series I've actually been catching up on
the submissions for the main show and
we're kind of running out of submissions
guys I've already caught up to October
of this year so if you're watching this
video and still haven't submitted your
setup or let's say you submitted your
setup the past year and still didn't get
featured please either resubmit those
submissions or take brand new pictures
and submit those as well the link to the
instructors instructions are little down
below make sure you guys click on it and
watch and submit your setup because I
have lots and lots of space coming up
very soon anyways with that said welcome
to setup wars episode 128 let the setup
board is be it starting off the episode
is Antonio and somehow he forgot to send
in the gear list so I'm just gonna have
to wing it
first up we got the monitors a flat
panel ultra-wide from LG and a standard
1080p one from Asus this is actually the
only practical setup featuring another
ultra wide because the smaller Asus
monitor isn't too far off now if there
were two ultra wide side-by-side then I
would say that it's not practical I
can't tell what mechanical keyboard is
rocking because of the angle but the
mouse is the SteelSeries rival 100
because actually used the yellow one for
the Wolverine setup and actually really
loved that Mouse I also know the
speakers he's using because I've seen it
a hundred times on the show they are the
popular bose companion 2 speakers the
other audio gear he's using are a pair
of Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones and
the blue snowball ice microphone the PC
does powering the setup looks pretty
good sadly I can't tell you the specs
but it looks like he's using an msi gtx
970 with eight gigs of ram and finally
the cable management on his setup is
amazing excellent we're grouping
everything together and mounting it
underneath the desk this is what I love
to see normally I would recommend the
cable box for that power strip that's
just sitting on the ground but it's not
that conspicuous so not a big deal the
Captain America posters and the
figurines on the setup are a nice touch
and I'm liking the soothing LED lights
from the RGB strip and the
here lamps a pretty solid setup that
actually works Thank You Antonio for
entering this next setup from Carlos is
a very interesting one because not only
is it our very first setup that's
actually built inside of a closet or
storage room but also has a very unique
theme his occupation is a building
engineer and he's used some of those
skills to custom build his setup from
scratch so the desk is actually a wood
tabletop that's wrapped in metal with a
glass top it's about seven feet long and
23 inches wide he went with the
honeycomb design on the face and the
backboard and he also built two panels
to conceal all the wires underneath a
desk I mean this dude build a bracket
out of tubes and pipes to hold his
blu-ray player and modem I mean that's
pretty freakin cool you have to look
closely at his pictures to really
appreciate the attention to detail that
he has added to everything for instance
he installed two floating glass shelves
against the backboard that's holding up
a bunch of his tech on one side we got
the blue Yeti microphone the Harman
Kardon sound sticks and the astro a40 s
while the other side is holding up his
iPad to Samsung s7 edge and other
miscellaneous items the monitor that he
hooked up against the backboard is from
Asus and below that he's rocking the
Logitech G 14 silver keyboard and the G
903 wireless mouse I love that the metal
desk didn't stop him from drilling holes
to wrap his keyboard and mouse wires
through very nice he also has an extra
display off to the right side which is
hooked up to his PC as a second monitor
my favorite modification from the set up
by far has to be the Superman logo with
a built-in switch to turn the lights on
and off I like it because not only am ia
huge fan of Superman but it actually
blends nicely with a steel box around it
I don't know if it was done
intentionally because you know they call
Superman the Man of Steel I mean it's
obvious that Carlos is a fan of Superman
as well judging by the countless
Superman related stuff around his room
like the Superman rug some posters and
even be writing underneath the desk the
PC does powering the set up is actually
a prebuilt familiar word that's equipped
with a 48 20 K and 2 gtx 770 s and sli
but Carlos stated that he's actually
gonna be building a custom PC
soon once you're done building it send
me a picture via Twitter or you can even
email to me I definitely want to check
it out I still can't get over how well
the cable management is done we got some
cable sleeves a dedicated power strip
hooked up underneath the desk and a
bunch of cable clips and 3m tape to hide
the cables behind the two panels that he
built underneath the desk fantastic job
I absolutely love the creativity and the
unique approach you took for this entire
setup and the way that you tied in your
engineering skills to your setup was
just awesome and it's actually one of
the reasons why I'm gonna be awarding
you this seal approval and just as a
reminder anyone who receives the seal of
approval will get a hundred dollars in
cash a text or t-shirt and most
importantly which i think is the coolest
prize it's a custom-made plaque with
your name on it this is actually for
setup makeover but you get something
similar like this for the setup or show
with the actual see little pool on here
so yeah if you're watching this video
and you want to claim your prizes please
toss me an email congratulations again
so this next setup is actually a
youtuber and he found that about setup
wars through my subscribers apparently a
few of you or somebody told them to
submit his setup on my show and well he
did I had a chance to check out a few of
his videos and he seems like a very
talented musician so I'll drop a link to
his channel below make sure you guys go
over and show him some love and consider
subscribing if you do enjoy his content
so this is his studio where he produces
his music and videos for his YouTube
channel and the occasional fap session I
mean he did write that in his notes I'm
not even making this up I mean at least
he's honest about it
so aside from his mountain of guitars
hanging from the walls he actually has a
very clean setup it is powered by 2016
iMac and he's using the Apple keyboard
trackpad and he Magic Mouse alongside
the Razer DeathAdder Gaming Mouse
I guess he games on the iMac as well
which is interesting his audio game is
definitely strong he's walking a pair of
Yamaha hs5 studio monitors and axe-fx
preamp processor and a few pieces of
gear from Native Instruments the cables
behind the desk seem to be maintained
nicely no major complaints here I really
like how clean you kept your entire room
from the set up to the lounging area and
even the recording setup is nice and
tidy I'm also a huge fan of the nano
leaf RGB panels that you've installed
above your couch
those are freaking awesome I just wish
they weren't so damn expensive he even
included a video showing off his
lighting setup that he integrated with
Alexa check this out hey Siri made
studio red Oh a very nice music
production setup Thank You Cole for
entering and good luck with your channel
button head number four we got Kaiser
and his heaven themed setup I honestly
don't think I've seen this much white in
any setup holy cow it looks like we have
another youtuber actually a tech
youtuber and as always I'll drop a link
to his channel below so make sure you
guys check him out so this is the main
setup for editing videos while the setup
behind him is purely for gaming he even
has a console set up next to his PC so
this guy has the best of both worlds the
first setup is being powered by a 2015
27-inch iMac with the Apple keyboard and
Logitech MX master 2's Mouse for audio
is rocking the audio technica 8044 t
microphone that's hooked up to his focus
right audio interface which by the way
is skinned in some white carbon fiber
and we also got a pair of M 50 X's also
in white to match the color scheme
I like that casar placed both his
speaker's on the sides of his desk by
using the jam stands and I'm a fan of
the motivational art that he printed
himself above his setup I'm sure at this
point we can reduce that as cable
management is on point not just for his
productivity setup but for everything
else in his room and this over here is
the second setup and it's purely for
gaming it's being powered by 7700 K and
the EVGA gtx 980ti
FTW 3 which is the GPU I'm gonna be
using in my own personal PC the monitor
of choice is none other than the Acer
predator X 30 for ultra wide and below
that he's added a wireless sound bar
from vizio but check this out guys look
at where he mounted those two speakers
up top this is actually a very clever
way of mounting your speaker's above
your desk in case you don't have any
space I've seen so many people put their
speakers sideways underneath a monitor
or even behind the modern
because there isn't any space on the
desk and this is actually a pretty cool
hack that you can do if you're in the
same situation so he basically used a
tablet mount and clamped the speaker on
one end and then connected the other end
to his desk as you guys can see from
below
obviously this might not work with most
speakers but it's worth trying out if
you're having similar issues with your
speaker's cable management is pretty
much flawless I mean he used a channel
Raceway to hide all the wires underneath
the desk and he even drilled holes for
his keyboard and mouse and mouse pad it
doesn't even stop there he's also got
another simple setup across the room
which has a 2012 MacBook Pro and finally
his console gaming setup featuring both
the ps4 and Xbox one but check this dope
modification that he did to his 49 inch
LG TV this is sick guys he installed a
lift system which allows him to raise
and lower his TV from behind the shelf
what that's pretty sick I gotta say man
you did a phenomenal job picking out the
furniture and gear for your setups and
the attention to detail organization and
cable management I mean everything was
just on point I seriously have no reason
not to give you the seal of approval I
just realized the first time ever on the
channel that two contestants one seal of
approval
in one episode that's pretty crazy okay
so if you're watching this video and you
want to claim your prize toss an email
to setup wars congratulations again okay
so actually did a video on his entire
setup if you guys want to check that out
on his channel I'll drop a link to it
down below thank you Casey for entering
wrapping up the episode we got Sawyer
and his interesting black and red set up
so he's a kook and he uses this setup
for gaming web browsing and watching
media it features DX 34 from Acer and
another monitor up top as an overhead
which I'm not sure what the model is
exactly the desk is using is the popular
a Rosie gaming desk with the chair combo
and it actually has a giant mouse pad on
it if you guys look closely but they do
have a few different colors and designs
to choose from which i think is pretty
cool if you guys want to check it out
I'll link it below so on a desk he's got
the corsair k70 RGB keyboard and the
cursor m65 pearl mouse and for audio is
rocking a pair of audio engine a 5 plus
speakers and the
Shoei 40s which he uses with his xbox
one Gears of War Edition the other
headset he is using are the cursor voids
that are hanging from his PC which is
equipped with a 67 GK and a GTX 1080
the kill management can definitely use
some extra work even though most of the
wires are inside the net it's still
looking a bit messy using something
simple like a velcro strap will help
tidy up and group your PC wires together
so it's not all over the place and a few
cable sleeves will help you group up the
rest of the wires underneath your desk I
mean it's gonna be a lot of work to redo
your cable management so it's up to you
to decide if it's worth your time I also
wouldn't recommend putting your
headphones on top of the speakers like
that instead I would move the Xbox one
console to the left side and bring down
your headset on the table in place of
the Xbox one maybe even consider buying
some speaker stands so that they are
positioned at ear level these ones on
Amazon work great with the 85 pluses so
consider checking it out I'll jump a
link below with some minor tweaks I
think that you will have an awesome
setup Thank You Sawyer for entering so
