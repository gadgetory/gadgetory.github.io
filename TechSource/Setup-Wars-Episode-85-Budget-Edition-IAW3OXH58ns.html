starting off the show we have a pretty
simple productivity set up from David
he's rocking a 13-inch MacBook Pro
that's hooked up to a 27-inch Asus
monitor I also like how he has a
matching monitor stand to his mom desk
for audio he's using a pair of M audio
speakers the audio technica m50x s as
well and he's also using the audio
technica at2020 microphone David did go
with the wireless route for his
peripherals he's using an anchor
keyboard and Logitech m57 Mouse
no complaints at the cable management
looks like everything is tucked away on
the rack and just overall a very clean
and minimalistic productivity setup
thank you David for entering Derek is
next up with a blackened red bean setup
he's using a 23 inch auc widescreen
monitor the popular red dragon II
acoustic keyboard and mouse combo and a
blue snowball ice microphone I
personally would have gone with the
black version of the microphone to match
the setup but white is cool too the
setup kind of seems a bit cramped then
again it is a small desk especially
since he has the PC on there as well
which by the way has a 6500 and a gtx
1060 you can easily get rid of most of
the stuff on the desk by picking up a
pencil drawer and installing it
underneath the desk and perhaps consider
putting the PC on the ground as well as
far as cable management is concerned I
would definitely try and clean that up a
bit the cable box and sleeve combo would
be great here I'll leave links to both
of them down below if anyone wants to
check them out not much else is going on
a pretty straightforward budget setup
Thank You Derek for entering joella's
next up with a fairly simple setup as
well he's
using a 25 inch tail monitor that's
sitting on top of a very nice tabletop
he's also using a Logitech G 740
keyboard and he Logitech MX master mouse
he does have an acer laptop on the left
for when he needs to go mobile but the
pc that's powering the set up as a 6700
and a gtx 1060 with a custom backplate
from v1 tech very nice for cable
management he mounted everything behind
the back board for a very clean look so
no complaints here just overall a very
clean setup Thank You Joel for entering
at number four we have Chris with
another Productivity setup featuring the
IKEA mom desk we have a single 24-inch
BenQ monitor in between 2m audio bx5
speakers and below that is the Logitech
G 750 keyboard any Microsoft wireless
mouse it also looks like he has an Xbox
one underneath riser and his 14-inch
Lenovo flex laptop that's powering this
setup he does have a pair of M 30s
hanging from a holder underneath the
desk and cable management is done really
well so once again no complaints here a
pretty straightforward setup thank you
Chris for entering finishing up the
episode we have Rohan he's rockin a 23
inch asus monitor in between two
Logitech z1 20 speakers and also for
audio he has a few pairs of headphones
we got the Sennheiser RS 120 s off to
the left side and the m 40 s which he
keeps in his drawer the wireless
keyboard and mouse are both from TechNet
and cable management seems to be under
control I like how he righted the wires
alongside the legs of the desk a nice
job and finally we have the PC which is
equipped with a 44 60 and a gigabyte gtx
960 but that's not all looks like ryan
also has another set up for his consoles
on the other side of his room a 42 inch
LG TV that's hooked up to both his Xbox
360 and Xbox one I will select the tiny
Star Wars figurines he has on the TV
stand it will put together set up Thank
