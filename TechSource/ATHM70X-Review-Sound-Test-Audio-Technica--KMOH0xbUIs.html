and today we're gonna take a look at the
Audio Technica m7 the X's which is an
upgrade from their previous and 50 X's
that I also own but what's unusual this
time around is their price point a
whopping 300 dollars which is a normal
coming from audio Technica's they have a
reputation of having amazing quality
headphones for a much lower cost
compared to its competitors so I'm
really curious about the price jump I
will unbox these and find out if it's
actually worth the Steep $300 price tag
so the box itself is actually the same
style from the m50x model so nothing new
there but opening it up you can see some
new additions first off they included
this really nice hardcover carrying case
and the usual set-up guide and warranty
info I really like the new hardcover
carrying case instead of the previous
carrying bag since it will definitely
provide more protection if you decide to
travel with your headphones and it also
looks a lot cooler so inside this tiny
pouch you will find all three cable
versions you have the 1.2 meter cable
which is used for portable devices and
then you have the two three meter cables
one of them is a straight cable and the
other is coiled you can add the 6.3
millimeter steel your plug adapter on
those two cables if you want to use your
headphone amplifier mixer or even audio
interface other than that pouch you have
the headphones inside the case now I
won't go too much into detail between
these 70 X and the 50 X because I will
have a separate video comparing the two
but right after bad I noticed that the
m70x is a lot lighter the headband
cushion also doesn't extend all the way
to the side like the 50 X does the build
on the 70 X also doesn't feel premium at
all when holding them at the same time
it feels kind of cheap and stiff
something I didn't expect from Audio
Technica especially something that
surprised this high so on the headband
itself you will find the brand name
etched on there and it's actually a lot
thinner than the previous model which
also contributes to its light weight the
ear cushions are as soft like the
previous model so the comfort is
definitely there like all Audio Technica
headphones
the spider feeling flimsy it's actually
pretty durable too so if you have a
Fathead he should be fine because these
can stretch pretty far
now the ear cups can turn up to 90
degrees like most headphones and these
do a phenomenal job blocking outside
noise even if the volume is set to only
50% it blocks out all the noise around
me so how is the actual sound well it's
not better it's just suited for
different types of people the sound is
more pure the 50x has noticeably more
bass when comparing the two the m70x
Alvar has more clarity and a much
clearer sound it doesn't have any extra
lows or highs it's just pure true sound
it's basically unenhanced and it has a
flat natural sound so if you're
professional DJ or mix music and want to
hear the notes at its purest then the
m70x is definitely for you however if
you're like me and you enjoy listening
to music playing video games or watching
movies then i strongly recommend you to
stick with the amphib the x's it's
definitely not worth the extra 150 bucks
of course I can't end the video without
giving you guys at least a sample of the
headphone sound and I know that you
won't know exactly how it sounds because
of compression and sound cards and just
the type of headphones you are using
which is why I'm only gonna compare the
sound on the m70x with the sound on the
m50x so you can at least hear the
difference so without wasting any more
time here is the audio samples recorded
from both headphones in a controlled
environment
the song goes
so I'm sure you guys noticed the
difference between the clarity and the
bass between both headphones but my
honest verdict just stay away from these
headphones unless you're a professional
in the music industry the price tag of
$300 is ridiculous and I feel that Audio
Technica is moving away from the average
consumer market by releasing these so
anyways that wraps up the video I really
want to hear your opinion about this
headphone so please drop them below in
the comments section and I will be
reading them and for those of you that
are interested in picking one up for
yourself because you're a baller then I
will leave a link in the description
section for pricing and availability
anyways this is that from tech source
thank you so much for watching I will
see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
