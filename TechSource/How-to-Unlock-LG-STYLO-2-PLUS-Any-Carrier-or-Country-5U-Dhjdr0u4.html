today we're going to be locking the LG
stylo 2 plus so you can use it with any
GSM carrier in the world there are a
bunch of locking websites out there and
it doesn't matter which one you use but
if you're looking for the cheapest
prices and the fastest delivery times
then you should check out the unlocking
company comm if you want to save time
and money so the first step is to find
the IMEI number of the phone and you can
do that by opening up the dial pad and
typing in star pound zero six pound once
the number pops up you have to go back
on the website and enter all of the
information in put in the manufacturer
and the model of the phone and on the
next page select which country the phone
was originally purchased from and the
carrier of the phone once you hit next
you will need to put in the IMEI number
that we just looked up on the phone and
finish filling out the rest of the boxes
once you finish checking out they will
email you the unlock code
so once the email you don't lock code
it's time to unlock your phone so make
sure it's powered off before we continue
pop open the back cover and remove the
battery to gain access to the SIM tray
then go ahead and put in the SIM card
you want to use with the phone if the
SIM card is either too big or too small
to fit in the tray make sure you guys
watch the video linked down below and I
will show you how to resize your SIM
card once you put in the SIM card in the
slot make sure to put the battery back
on and then the back cover and power up
your phone once you put up the phone it
will take you to this page where it will
ask you to enter in the lock code and
this is where you put in the code that
was emailed to you once you input the
code and hit a lock your phone becomes
permanently unlocked now if your phone
doesn't have an option to input an a'
lock code then that means your phone
needs to be unlocked remotely and if
that's the case then the locking company
comm will take care of it on their end
so don't worry so that's how you lock
your lg style 2 plus for any country
then guys much watching and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
