again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below what's
up guys it's ed from tech source and
welcome to the build of the month for
July this time we're gonna be focusing
on the new rx 480 graphics cards and if
you guys somehow missed my benchmark
video and my gameplay video I'll drop a
link to them down below along with all
of the parts afford these builds so
let's go ahead and start
so the first build is a $600 gaming PC
rockin the FX 6350 with AMD's new wrath
cooler with 6 cores clocked at 3.9
gigahertz it will definitely be plenty
enough for any game out there and it's
also great for productivity whether
you're editing 1080p video or 4k the
multi-threaded performance is something
you can take advantage of since the 6350
comes with AMD's new CPU cooler which is
both quieter and cooler than a previous
stock heatsink it doesn't make sense to
spend extra for a third-party cooler for
the motherboard we went with the
gigabyte G a 970 a simply because it
offers the best performance for the
money right now you can get it for $62
after a mail-in rebate and it features
an 8 plus to power phase design and
supports overclocking for round we are
sticking with the usual eight gigs from
crucial which is simply the best value
you can get on a pair of 4 gigabyte
sticks and for storage we are going with
only one terabyte of hard drive space
from Seagate obviously storage is
optional and guests can add an SSD or
increase the capacity of the hard drive
altogether for the graphics card we are
going with the 4 gigabyte variant of the
rx 480 that retails for $200 and using
up everything as the EVGA 500 watt power
supply which is plenty if you want to go
with this build and maybe add an extra
Oryx 480 down the line then I would
suggest picking up a 600 watt power
supply instead and finally the case to
bring this bill to life is the deep cool
tesseract and red with a side panel to
show off that graphics card this entire
PC will cost you around 580 bucks before
tax and shipping as always please
remember that prices fluctuate so
depending on when you're watching this
video the total cost would be either
cheaper or more expensive and for our
next build
another gaming rig featuring two rx4 ATS
at an i7 6,700 since we're not doing any
overclocking we are just sticking with
the stock heatsink and going with the
A's rock z170a motherboard which is
currently one of the best bang for your
buck z170 boards you can buy under 100
bucks for round we are going with 2 4
gigabyte sticks from g.skill and red and
for storage we have a 2 terabyte hard
drive from Seagate we're also adding a
120 gigabyte SSD from Kingston which is
where the OS will be installed on -
along with the other important
applications that require a fast start
up juicing everything up is the EVGA 600
watt power supply which is more than
enough assuming you're not going to be
overclocking them and finally the case
of choice is the Coursera spec or one
read to complete the overall black and
red build so that will do it for the
video as always you guys can find the
parts for these pcs linked below and
also let me know what price range I
should work on for my next month's PC
builds by dropping a comment down below
if you guys enjoy these monthly PC
builds make sure you like to show your
support and don't forget about my actual
physical builds happening every month on
the channel so make sure you guys are
subscribed then guys so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
