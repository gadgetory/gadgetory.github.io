what's up guys and welcome to the
long-awaited desk tour I've been judging
other desk setups on my setup wars
series so I think it's time for you guys
to judge mine by leaving your feedback
in the comment section down below
by the way all the products mentioned in
this video will be listed down below for
anyone that is interested so with that
said let's start from the most important
thing on my desk which is big red my
custom painted PC that essentially
powers tech source I did do a video on
it so I won't waste too much time but
it's basically walking a 49 30 K CPU
overclock to 4.5 gigahertz paired with
two custom-painted 780 Ti is in SLI and
32 gigabytes of RAM packed inside the
beautiful NZXT s340 case attached to the
PC I have this two-in-one microUSB and
lightning cable that I used to charge my
smart phone speaker wireless mouse and
my headphones whenever I need a microUSB
cable I just pull out the top portion
and whenever I need to charge my Apple
devices I just connected back it's so
much better than having two separate
cables right next to the PC I have my
iPhone 6 plus on the anchor stand
rocking the dracco 6 case from dracco
design if you ever noticed by now my
favorite color combo is red and black so
was a no-brainer picking up the black
and red carbon fiber skins for my iPhone
by the way these are from B brand and
they have a bunch of other types of
skins for smartwatches consoles and a
bunch of other devices but I'll go to
leave a link to their website if you
guys want to check them out for yourself
underneath the monitor is the anchor
premium bluetooth speaker which is my
personal favorite out of all of these
speakers I have ever reviewed on a
channel it's extremely loud clear and
has an amazing base and I use it to
watch movies and listen to music to get
into my mood when I'm filming my videos
to the left of the speaker is the
Scarlett Studio 2i2 audio interface that
I used to record my voice overs like the
one in this video it sucked up to the CM
twenty-five mic that came with the
package and my trusty 80 hm
vx headphones I have the mic hooked up
to an extension boom arm to get it off
my desk and it's really convenient for
me when recording because I can just
pull it towards me whenever I need to
use it and then push it back when I'm
done it's super flexible so I can raise
it and lower it as well as rotate it as
much as I want also on top of the audio
interface I use some 3m tape and attach
they transcend as the card reader for
easy access when I'm done filming on my
gh4 I just slap the SD card inside and
transfer my files straight to my PC all
the way on the left side is one of the
newer additions to my desk setup this is
the HyperX cloud 2 gaming headset that I
cover for cool tech of September this is
hands-down the most comfortable headset
I have ever worn the word cloud and its
name is spot-on so these are compatible
with pcs consoles and practically
everything else that has a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack the SFU 7.1
virtual surround sound comes with a
detachable mic I use these mainly for
gaming but sometimes leave them on while
I'm editing and watching movies if I
want something more comfortable the
sound output is extremely clear and
noticeably louder than my m50x is so I
have to keep that in mind while editing
the voiceovers I keep the cloud tools on
the Thermaltake headphone hangar just
because it matches my theme and it's one
of the coolest hangars I have ever seen
speaking of headphone hangers I have one
more attached on the roof of my desk
which is holding my FFT X's and my ghost
Tech Bluetooth headphones this is called
the anchor from elevation labs and I
really like this headphone hangar
because I use several headphones every
day and I can hide them underneath my
desk and keep them off my table which
gives more room for other things I've
been using this for the past three
months now without any problems in fact
it uses the same 3m adhesive tape that
you can find on GoPro cameras so you
know that this will stick pretty damn
good I use the ghost tech headphones
whenever I need to move around a lot or
if I'm going places I mostly use them
with my iPhone but they are a great pair
of very light headphones that offers
rich sound it does feature a microphone
so I can accept calls as well and it
also has a 3.5 millimeter jack that I
can use in case it runs out of battery
now let's take a look at my peripherals
so I'm rocking the Microsoft Sidewinder
x4 keyboard and the Logitech MX master
wireless mouse on top of the xqo
extended mouse
I was never a fan of mechanical
keyboards because of the key sounds it
does get pretty annoying when I'm typing
constantly which is why I stuck with the
x4 keyboard all this time it's super
quiet the keys are short for quick and
easy presses and comes with a wrist rest
I have used many mechanical keyboards in
the past and I always find myself coming
back to the x4 for the mouse I'm rocking
the MX master from Logitech this mouse
needs no introduction its notorious for
being one of the best productivity mice
in the world and absolutely love this
thing it's really great for editing but
I do use it for gaming sometimes without
any problems now if I was a hardcore
gamer I would most likely use a gaming
mouse but for being only casual this
works just as well last but not least is
the extended mousepad that I recently
picked up I've been using the Corsair
extended mousepad for the longest time
but when I saw this one I knew I had to
pick it up it has a pretty cool shape
with a red border that complements my
color scheme now although I'm not a big
fan of the Scorpion logo or the text on
the mousepad the keyboard pretty much
covers up most of it anyway so it
doesn't really bother me now on to the
monitor this is the LG 34 inch ultra
wide curved monitor that I have hooked
up to the awesome ergo tech freedom arm
so the story behind this monitor is this
I start off with a triple display set up
a few years ago and then moved on to a
dual 4k display set up from Samsung
which was great but when LG sent me this
34 inch monitor I immediately fell in
love personally I find that a single
ultrawide monitor works best for editing
watching movies and especially gaming
it's just much more immersive and you
get no ugly bezels in between all of
your content is right there in front of
you and you don't need to move your head
from one side to the other with a multi
display set up the monitor arm I'm using
is the ergo tech freedom arm freedom is
damn correct this thing gives you the
option to position your monitor in any
way you can think of you can raise lower
pivot turn and tilt to any degree you
like this thing is incredible if you
guys are looking to get your monitor off
your desk pretty much cleaner look then
you should definitely check this thing
out now instead of paying full retail
price for this you guys can actually get
it from a strop which is a group buying
website they have a bunch of cool tech
products that you can vote on to unlock
super low prices but I'm gonna leave a
link to their freedom arm down below so
you guys can request one for yourselves
daily these are also a huge part of my
desk
these are from friends of you and they
are wireless I can control the lights
using my smartphone and access
pre-configured settings from my
notifications tab without having to open
the app it's available for iOS and
Android and I'll leave a link to the led
scripts in the wireless bridge that you
will need to change the colors
wirelessly I've also been getting a
bunch of questions regarding my desk so
this is the vertex which stands for
vertical desk
it's basically a motorized desk and its
height can be adjusted by pressing on
either of these arrow keys this desk is
probably the most important part of my
setup because I use it constantly every
single day I edit for long hours at a
time and it's nice to stand up once in a
while to stretch the back since sitting
down for long hours at a time is bad for
the back there are a lot of adjustable
desk out there but the reason why I
chose the word desk was because of its
huge surface area this is one of the
very few if not the only adjustable desk
that has a 72 inch width and a 30 inch
depth for the tabletop which is big I
mean you can fit my PC ultrawide monitor
and a bunch of other stuff and still
have extra room it's so great that I
even use a second one just for my videos
another thing I keep on my desk is this
game of Thrones coaster now this comes
in a set of four but since I represent
House Targaryen I use the fire blood
coaster I rest my drinks on it and it
protects my desk from getting water
stains or scratches and oh yeah it's
black and red the chair I use is from
flash furniture now it's no dxracer but
I find this one extremely comfortable
and comes with lumbar support for the
lower back I'm six-two and it's kind of
hard finding a tall chair to rest my
head against until I came across this
one it also comes with armrests and has
a red outline that matches my setup I
had this for over two years and it
hasn't given me any problems and overall
very solid and comfortable office chair
last but not least I want to go over my
cable management because I think that's
extremely important when it comes to any
desk setup my cables were all over the
place before and it was atrocious so I
picked up a 6 outlet surge protector
from Orrico to bring my setup back to
life so they have them in two four six
and even eight outlet variations and
these are extremely light I basically
attached some 3m tape on the back and
stuck it to the roof of my desk and then
proceeded to plug in everything
including my PC into the surge protector
what's
help from cable drops as an added bonus
it comes with five smart charging ports
which will detect the device that's
plugged in and deliver the fastest
charging possible I'm just glad I was
able to clean up my cable management
tremendously and if your cable
management is slacking then this is the
answer to your prayers like I said I'll
leave links to everything in the
description section along with the cable
drops I used but yeah that's basically
my setup it's nothing over the top I
like to keep things as clean as possible
and only leave the essentials on my desk
that I use daily if you guys like my
setup then make sure to slap the crap
out of that like button and if you
didn't feel free to dislike and leave me
your feedback in the comment section
