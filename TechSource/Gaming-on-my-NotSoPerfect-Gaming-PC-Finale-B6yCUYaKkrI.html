done it was a long journey per usual but
I definitely think it paid off in the
end I did take extra time to perfect it
instead of brushing it out like last
time and not be happy with it this
videos gonna be pretty chill we're just
gonna go over temperatures overclocking
performance and we're gonna play Apex
legends on LG's new sexy ultra wide
gaming monitors so yeah what that said
let's get into it your CD Keys having a
summer sale right now with awesome deals
on their windows and office products you
guys can get a Windows 10 Pro key for
less than $15 - an extra 20% off using
the code ts 20 make sure to click the
link below if you're interested so one
of the things I always try and do with
my own personal pcs when it comes to my
own PC that I use back at home for
gaming or editing I always try and be
different I don't like using mainstream
PC cases that you guys see so many
builds in I like to find something
that's unique something that you guys
don't see often or don't see at all so
that's why this case fit the profile it
looks amazing and it's unique I mean
yeah I get it this case is far from
perfect you know keeping it clean from
dust and dirt is gonna be a very tedious
task and also draining the system and we
feeling it it's gonna be very annoying
because I do have to remove all three of
the side panels just to access the drain
port and the fill port near the top rez
there is six screws holding just the top
glass panel and then four on each of the
side panels so ya convenience is
definitely not its strongest suit but
the biggest issue with this case and I
found that about this after I was done
with the build of course it has to do
with the top glass panel and I'll talk
more about it
when
get into thermals so specs wise I did
overclock my deleted 79 80 XE 18 core
processor to 4.6 gigahertz on all cores
and it's running on 1.2 volts I also
have a clock both graphics cards we got
70 megahertz offset on the boost clock
and 500 megahertz on the memory in terms
of temps the CPU idles between 30 to 40
degrees Celsius while both GPUs are
sitting on their 40 degrees now here's
where things get interesting
unload the GPU Peaks at 70 degrees
Celsius which is unusually hot the
bottom GPU is pretty much useless
because the games I play don't support
SLI so it's pretty much doing nothing
for now until then Vidya adds support
later down the line I know that founders
Edition r-tx 20 atti is run pretty hot
even underwater but 70 degrees is still
pretty high that's only seven degrees
less than air at first I thought maybe I
messed up on the thermal paste
application or maybe I didn't tighten
the screws enough and the thermal paste
wasn't coming in contact with the GPU
block so I went ahead and took them
apart and sure enough there was nothing
wrong with them so either way I went and
reapplied thermal paste and slapped them
back on I did make sure this time around
to put a radiator between each block so
the flow direction right now I have is
the pump goes directly to both the GPUs
from the GPU to the top red top rad to
the CPU block and the CPU block to the
second rad and then back into the
reservoir and then ladies and gentlemen
I realized that I overlooked something
so simple something that was right in
front of my eye sockets the top radiator
is not getting enough airflow because
there is maybe a centimeter of space if
that probably a lot less between the top
rad and the top glass and I did have
some concerns building in it but I kind
of brushed it off because I thought you
know I got two full size three sixty
millimeter radiators it's gonna be fine
it's not gonna really affect temps as
much but well what do you know any cold
air that's supposed to go through the
radiator and escape to the top is either
being trapped up there and being bounced
back and I know this because there was a
lot of air being pushed back if I put my
hand over here I can
a lot of air it's almost as if these
fans were flipped upside down and now
they're being used as exhaust I mean
that's how much air I'm feeling on this
hand way more than the air coming out
from the sides here I've also noticed
that this radiator is way more warmer
than the radiator on the side so that
pretty much proves my point that the top
rad is essentially being starved of air
unfortunately this leaves me no choice I
have to scratch this entire build and
build myself a new one I'm just joking
obviously there's no way I'm replacing
this beast especially after it took all
this time and effort to build it there's
only really one option left for me and
that is to cut a new piece of glass with
a rectangular cutout where the radiator
would be that way the hot air can escape
and cold air can circulate through it
unfortunately I can't cut this glass
because I was told that if you cut
tempered glass then it's gonna shatter
into a million pieces so I reached out
to this local company here in Santa
Clarita and I sent over the drawings so
they're gonna reach out to me let me
know if they can do something like this
but if not it's not a big deal I mean
the PC runs perfectly fine it's stable
there's no thermal throttling it doesn't
crash I'm just gonna have to deal with
unusually higher temps than normal but
anyways with that said I think it's time
to finally start gaming on this beast
and see what it can do on LG's new ultra
light gaming monitor so this thing has a
34 40 by 1440p curved IPS display with
120 Hertz refresh rate and gsync support
it pretty much has the same specs as my
all tried back at home but with a higher
refresh rate and a faster response time
at 5 milliseconds all right apex legends
let's do the settings we are rockin 34
40 by 1440 everything else is pretty
much maxed out as you can see let's do
this for sheree jump down
first thing I've already noticed guys is
the temps for the GPU dip down to 66 67
degrees just by removing the top panel
so we're getting three to four degrees
cooler just by moving the top panel so
my suspicions were correct
also I gotta say this game looks amazing
in this resolution if you guys haven't
had a chance to play in an ultra-wide
on apex legends or any game really you
gotta give it a shot because it looks so
sweet they always say once you go ultra
wide you don't go back so twenty-one by
now in sweats that guys frame wise we're
not doing too bad we're getting anywhere
from seventy to eighty FPS do keep in
mind we're playing on a high resolution
34 40 by 1440 which is somewhere between
4k and 2k actually on a side note if any
of you play apex legends on the PC hit
me up I'm looking for some pro players
to carry my noob ass to victory I'll add
my username on the screen if you guys
would add me
don't you hate it when you call your own
care package and then your teammate just
swoops in and steals all your gear
thanks dude
appreciate that honestly I think what
I'm just gonna end up doing is just
keeping the top glass panel off instead
of having a bendy one made
I just gotta get over how amazing this
game looks honestly
what I thought that was my I thought
that was my friend oh my god
so that's it for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed it thumbs up if you did and
if you didn't you know what to do
consider subscribing if you want to see
more awesome PC builds like these I did
hear about Amy's new announcement on
their rising 5 and 9 CPUs as well as
their what is it fifty seven hundred XT
GPU which I'll be using in a few builds
coming up as well anyway thanks again
for watching I love your beautiful faces
oh yeah by the way all the parts used in
this build will be linked below as well
as the ultrawide monitor thanks again
for watching and I will see you guys in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
