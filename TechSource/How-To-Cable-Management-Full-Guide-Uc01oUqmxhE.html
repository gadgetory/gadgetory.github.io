they are an online platform dedicated to

sponsors check them out by clicking on
the link below are you having trouble
sleeping at night because of bad cable
management did I rip you a new hole on
setup wars because of your bad cable
management or do you just have some
really shitty cable management well if
your answer is yes to any one of those
then you came to the right place ladies
and gentlemen the video you have all
been waiting for how to cable management
tips and tricks everything I mentioned
in this video will be linked down below
for you guys so in this video I'm going
to be going over two of my favourite
cable management types to tuck it in
which is the cleanest and my personal
favorite and let it hang which is a lot
easier but not as clean as the first
recently I completely redid my cable
management and you guys can check out my
full setup tour by clicking on the card
in the top right corner I basically
transform this into this and the reason
why I have one cable hanging down is
because my desk is motorized and I need
cable slack so that it can retract as it
rises I'm going to show you guys what I
did and you can do the exact same thing
for your own setup first things first
you want to start fresh completely
remove everything onto your desk and
make sure to dedicate half of the day at
least for this task you don't want to
rush this process the more cables you
have the longer it will take you will
need a cable raceway that when I picked
up is 48 inches in length which is
perfect since my desk is 72 inches long
you can always cut this to fit your desk
length since its plastic the next thing
you want to do is figure out where
everything is going do not stick
anything against the desk yet just sort
of plan everything out
once you have set on how you want to
mount the raceway peel off the 3m tape
in the back and stick it on the roof of
your desk
while applying pressure start moving the
cables around figuring out how you are
going to route them through the raceway
you don't want to just shove cables in
there you guys need to have a system in
my case I run the cables from the top of
my desk in a straight line into the
Raceway using these cable clips ensures
that your cables follow the path you
eight for them if you have charging hubs
power bricks or receivers of some sort
it's time to bust out the 3m tape the
one I always use this from scotch and
they have some really strong adhesive so
I stuck some on my Phillips you RGB
receiver and sneaked it between the
raceway and my table as for the power
brick I did the same thing I applied
four squares one on each corner and
stuck it against the roof of the desk
again using cable clips ensures that
your wires are following the path that
you are creating for them once majority
of the cables are planned out it's time
to attach the most important piece the
power outlet I personally use these
Orica ones for several reasons they
double as surge protectors they are
lightweight and flat which makes it
extremely easy to stick and they have
five USB charging ports which is perfect
if you need to power certain devices
before you mount the surge protector
it's always a good idea to hold it in
place and make sure that all the plugs
can reach it in my case I found the
perfect spot which is in reach of all
the other cables I also hooked up by
charging dock into one of the USB hubs
and proceeded to connect the rest of the
plugs using velcro straps can help bring
the cables together for a cleaner look
that way they are not spread out like I
said earlier create a system or a path
if you will that your wires will follow
so it looks organized the MVP here is
the cable raceway definitely a huge
difference from before let's take a
quick look at the before and after one
more time
if you have a regular desk that doesn't
rise like mine then you can even route
that last cable on the roof as well and
you won't have even a single cable in
sight alternatively if you don't have
that much time or don't care about being
perfect you can simply pick up an Ikea
Signum rack install it under your desk
and just pile all of the cables and
power outlets on it
so my next cable management method is
called the let it hang version and it
isn't as clean but it will transform the
typical setup from this into this for
this you will need an omni mount cable
sleeve you can start from the PC side
and start grouping the cables together
as you work your way down wrapping them
all together once you get to the halfway
point this is the way you need to start
routing the power cable from the PC and
the monitor through the same hole so
that they can be connected to the power
outlet proceed to wrap the rest of the
cables now since this is only 40 inches
long there will be times where you will
have a lot of cable leftover as you can
see in the video what I usually do is
open up the sleeve a little bit and fold
the remaining extra wires and stick them
back inside
the asus monitor i'm using has this
power break which is really annoying so
what I did was attach two pieces of 3m
tape on the back and stuck it on the
roof of the desk to finish it up I use
some velcro straps and tie the cables
together near the end and the beginning
adding velcro straps for your pc's
cables are also a really great idea so
that they don't flare out finally we
need to hide that ugly surge protector
the cable box I'm using is from blue
lounge but there are other much smaller
versions available so when I picked up
can practically fit any sized power
strip open it up
dump a surge protector in wrap the
cables off to the side and close the lid
just like that you have a much cleaner
look so what if you have mounted wall
monitors or TVs and don't know what to
do with those cables running down well
you can pick up some omnimount cable
management covers which will hide those
cables I don't have any wall mounted
monitors or TVs on my wall so
unfortunately I can't show you a demo
for headsets it's tricky depending on
what headset you have since the cable
needs a lot of slack every time you put
them on and hang them so what I do with
wired headsets is wrap the cable around
the headphone hanger and finally for the
smartphone even adding something like a
simple phone stand really contributes to
a really clean desk setup here's a full
before and after
so if this video helped you guys out
please leave a like to show your support
and if you're going to be working on
your cable management after watching
this video make sure to write down in
the comment section which method you're
going to use the tuck it in or the let
it hang I always want to give huge
