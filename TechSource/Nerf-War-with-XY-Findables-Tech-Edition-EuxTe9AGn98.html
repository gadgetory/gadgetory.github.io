Texas and we are here at Griffith Park
playing some capture the flag with some
nerf guns using the XY find it
so basically the objective of the game
is to capture the opponent's flag that
has the XY fine they're attached to it
there is a twist though each team can
look up the exact location of the XY
finder on their smartphone and track it
down since the actual item is extremely
tiny finding it is going to be difficult
if you don't have help so once we track
the item on our phone and get really
close to it we can actually have it beep
making it a lot easier to locate Dom
actually tried to pull a fast one on us
and hit our XY finder in a trash can a
trash can I mean how are we able to spot
that luckily we were close enough to
hear it beep and managed to grab it and
score one for the team the XY finer does
have a Bluetooth range of 150 feet and a
battery lasts anywhere between three
months to a year depending on when you
bought it or what version of the app
you're using or how often you make it
beep down the tough cookie you just
won't go down I have to teach them a
lesson I think it's a really awesome
product that lets you keep tabs on
things but the real purpose of this
video is to raise awareness of their
equity crowdfunding campaign that
basically lets you own a piece of the
company but I will drop a link down
below for anyone that is interested in
checking them out as always thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next video
oh yeah oh my gosh you rip your pants ER
