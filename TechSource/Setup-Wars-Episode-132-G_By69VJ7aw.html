and welcome to setup wars episode 132
will you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the show if you guys want to
participate make sure to watch the video
linked below but with that said let the
setup wars begin kicking off the show we
got Christian from California and his
gaming and editing setup
he's walking to a cert wente seven inch
monitors that are hooked up to a desk
mount and below that he's got the Razer
BlackWidow chroma keyboard and the Death
Adder Mouse Prado he's rocking the
Turtle Beach Elite Pro headset and the
JBL flip 2 speaker I feel like the setup
is missing some storage space because
there aren't any drawers or shelves
nearby to store some of that extra stuff
that he's got on the desk like the G
fuel containers and the Xbox controllers
I mean you do have space for it on the
desk but if it ends up bothering you or
if you want a cleaner surface I would
invest into an Alex drawer that you can
put next to your setup you can move your
Xbox on top of it and store your
controllers and the G fuel inside there
which will clean your set up a lot but
like I said if it doesn't bother you
then don't worry about it
another simple tweak you can do to your
setup is run the mouse wire underneath
the keyboard and wrap both of the cables
together so that there's only one cable
running across your desk instead of two
and finally I would pick up some 3m tape
and hook it behind your modem so that
way you can attach it underneath your
desk instead of just leaving them on the
carpet over there in the corner the
cable management of your overall setup
is really good and it seems like you
watched my cable management video which
is why I was surprised to find out that
you didn't do anything with your modem
and router also I don't know what's
going on behind your monitor but that's
definitely not the right way of using
RGB scripts I see so many people doing
this with their RGB script because it's
really hard to bend them around the
corners after all that is one single
piece so instead of using one strip I
recommend using this four piece RGB set
which actually allows you to put one
strip on each side of your monitor kind
of like what I did with my TV and the
loft area I'll drop a link to that video
if you guys want to check
I don't know if a clear side panel was
necessary for the PC considering the
specs because it's rocking a locked
Intel CPU with the stock heatsink eight
gigs of ram and the gtx 960 if you're
planning to upgrade your PC later down
the line then disregard what I just said
the final thing I would recommend is
changing the placement for your blue
snowball ice microphone I feel like it's
too far off on the right side I don't
really sure how it's even picking up any
audio if you look at my poorly drawn
illustration you can see that there is a
spot on your monitor arm that you can
actually mount the boom arm on and you
can extend it up and over your monitor
when you need to use it and then simply
fold it and hide it behind it once you
are done I don't know try it out if it
works out then it will not only be more
convenient talking into your microphone
but your setup but also look a lot
cleaner and very nice gaming and editing
setup you got there I'm confident with
some minor tweaks it will look a lot
better and cleaner Thank You christian
for entering at number two we got Dexter
all the way from his laboratory and his
gaming and editing setup between a 24
inch monitor from Asus and a Logitech G
810 aurion keyboard with the Razer Mamba
Mouse look at the size of that mousepad
Jesus do you even use all that extra
space for audio is walking a pair of
canto yu4 speakers in glass steel which
actually looks pretty nice and he's also
using the Bayer dynamic headphones which
are hanging under his custom-made desk
out of natural live edge I don't know if
that's the material or the actual brand
name there are some extra stuff on a
desk like the ps4 Pro the amplifier and
even a few other things but it doesn't
look cluttered and Dexter doesn't seem
to be going with that minimalistic look
anyways I love the fact that he went
with the lamp that can be attached to
the desk as opposed to a standard desk
lamp that would have taken up extra
space on the surface the key management
is pretty much flawless everything is
hooked up underneath the desk
we got a USB hub and an SD card reader
on the right side a controller on the
left that's hooked up with some velcro
straps I'm not really sure what that's
connected to and finally a cable box on
the bottom right to store the power
scripts and the rest of the cables
excellent work the PC he's got is one
hell of a beast then it's equipped with
the 7700 K and he
Titan X Pascal very nice I would have
loved to see some sexy custom cables
considering it's a high-end build but it
is what it is
it's a very impressive gaming and
editing setup you got there Thank You
Dexter for entering jumping into
overkill territory we got Dylan from
Pennsylvania and his setup that he uses
for gaming it's packed with three
24-inch monitors with a massive 50 inch
Smart TV up top that he's hooked up to
his ps4 needless to say he doesn't need
to leave his seat I mean Alice needs to
take a dump obviously or for food I'm
not a fan of corner desks but this one
actually doesn't look too bad
on one side he's got his ps4 and on the
opposite side is the PC which is running
on the 5820k 16 gigs of ram and the msi
980ti
which also has the NZXT kraken cooler
attached I really loved that headset
stand for his logitech g930 3 I tried
looking for the same exact one so that I
can buy it for my setup since I'm a huge
fan of Game of Thrones but I can't seem
to find it this isn't even an actual
headset stand it's a dragon statue but I
thought it would look dope on my desk
anyways Dillon if you're watching this
video email me the link to that statue
please because I do want to pick one up
for my setup Thank You
Dillon also decided to mount the
speakers on the floor stands instead of
putting them on the desk itself but then
again there were really only two options
to begin with either this or mounting
them on the actual wall sandwiching the
TV good job drilling a hole in your desk
for the keyboard and mouse and the rest
of the cables underneath your desk are
hidden so I can't say much but overall
an excellent setup Thank You Dillon for
entering dory is up next with a very
simple and clean productivity set up
between the 27-inch 5k iMac which is
sandwiched between the yamaha HS 5
speakers and we also got some Razer
peripherals it's always interesting when
I come across setups that have both an
iMac and Razer gear completely opposite
sides of the spectrum
he's got the Black Widow chroma key
board with the Razer mama Mouse and he's
even picked up the Firefly mousepad what
I really love about the setup is the
attention to detail and how he kept
everything asymmetrical everything is so
precise and OCD friendly it brings tears
to my eyes
cable management is also very clean
there are two racks underneath the desk
to store all the wires on and even
hooked up his Focusrite audio interface
under the desk
excellent work so this looks like his
recording studio as well because on the
other side is a recording booth that he
set up using a mic stand and some
acoustic panels I definitely received
some level of satisfaction looking at
this setup excellent work dory
and thank you again for entering who
wrapping up this episode we got win and
his multi-purpose setup in his office so
he uses it for programming music
creation graphic design and just general
use it consists of two liniment
tabletops that he connected together to
create a corner desk and also threw in
two alex drawers for support and
additional storage monitor one is a 27
inch from LG and the second one is a 25
inch ultra wide which is used mainly for
coding he did go the wireless route but
surprisingly he didn't use the Apple
wireless keyboard and instead he's using
the Logitech a 750 keyboard with the MX
master for audio he's rocking to massive
8-inch speakers from monoprice I swear
when I first looked at these I thought
they were subwoofers and then some Bose
headphones hanging underneath a desk but
the main audio source for creating music
are the guitars he's got one for
acoustic and one bass that are sitting
next to his setup oh I guess he does
have another audio source as well and
that's the creative Sound Blaster roar
which is a Bluetooth speaker and it also
has a tiny Thor's hammer on which is
pretty cool no complaints when it comes
to cable management looks like
everything is in order all the wires are
routed against his desk and into the
Signum rack on the right side the entire
setup is being powered by his mid 2012
MacBook Pro Retina and that pretty much
concludes his submission thank you win
for entering so that's it for this
episode of setup wars as always make
sure you guys drop your comments down
below and vote on who you think has the
best desk setup announce the winners on
my social media platforms on the weekend
thank you so much for watching I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
