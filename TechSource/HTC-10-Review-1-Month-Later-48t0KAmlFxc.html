today you're going to be taking a look
at the jack of all trades in the
smartphone industry the HTC 10 it may
not be waterproof have the best camera
or even the best display but my time
with it has proven to be anything but
lacking so let's go and get the
specifications out of the way before we
start under the quad HD Super LCD
display your snapdragons latest offering
the 820 processor paired with 4
gigabytes of RAM also something we don't
see all that often is specialized audio
hardware but in this case we do get a
24-bit deck and amp for improved audio
quality keeping this phone juice does a
three thousand million power battery and
it comes standard with 32 gigabytes of
memory which is expandable via microSD
card and finally the rear and front
cameras are 12 and 5 megapixels
respectively so with all of those
numbers out of the way let's kick this
review off with the hardware in typical
HTC fashion we get this block of metal
that feels nice in the hand and in my
opinion looks great they did do
something new this year however by
adding these not-too-subtle chamfers
along the back when I first saw this
online I thought it was ridiculous but
my opinion that a complete 360 when I
actually had it in hand ergonomically it
helps with how the phone nests in your
hand and in person it does look pretty
badass throw a deer and skin on there to
add a bit more grip and you have
yourself a fresh beast of a design I'll
drop a link down below if anyone is
interested in checking out these skins
for themselves even the buttons on this
phone feel just extra not in the sense
that there's too many but just by the
field and how much pressure takes to
activate and for me that wasn't
unexpected positive the display on this
phone is what HTC calls a super LCD 5
which tells us that it's one an LCD
display and two it's somehow super the
color is not as vibrant as something
like the galaxy s7 with its AMOLED
display but on that note it's more
accurate than that of the s7 which is
something I actually like I guess it
depends on what you prefer to look at in
the end but am i late or not the display
is plenty sharp it doesn't however get
as bright as you would think which could
be a problem if you're under direct
sunlight you might also notice that
there aren't two grills flanking the
display like the previous models
which brings up the question where is
that boom sound well it's still here but
implemented in a new way HTC decided to
separate the tweeter and the woofer to
the top and bottom for the sake of
innovation I guess it doesn't get as
loud as the HTC nine so my question then
is if it's not broken why fix it it
still strides better than the Galaxy s7
s almost cringe-worthy speaker and it's
louder than most phones out there but
it's not what we're used to seeing from
HTC and that was kind of a letdown to me
here's a quick sound comparison between
the Galaxy s7 and the HTC 10
anything he was right
saying that if you never ever for the
right word there's no way this is real
life there's no setting you're the right
girl
is
once you plug in some decent earphones
however even the ones included in the
packaging the audio experience improves
dramatically you can even go a step
further and personalize your own audio
profile based on the unique way you hear
sound both audio software and hardware
deliver the loudest and clearer sound
I've ever heard from a phone now let's
talk about the cameras HTC has a
reputation of delivering subpar cameras
on their flagships but I'm happy to say
that that's not the case with the HTC 10
we get 12 megapixels at one point fifty
five microns image stabilization laser
autofocus and an aperture of 1.8 which
all sound good on paper but when taking
a look at the pictures and videos
they're just above average it seems to
overexpose pictures and just doesn't
compare to the galaxy and iPhones out
there one thing worth mentioning is that
the front-facing camera also has
built-in image stabilization which is a
first that I've seen and that was a
pretty cool feature but in the end if
you're looking for the best smartphone
camera out there I would honestly look
somewhere else however when it comes to
battery performance you won't be
disappointed I got through most days
with just about four hours of on-screen
time without any worries and rarely use
the power saving modes but when I did I
was able to get five more hours of
device power with just one percent
battery that in combination with quick
charge three point 0 gives me assurance
that I won't be looking for us bc cables
halfway through today it doesn't however
include wireless charging which to some
could be a disappointment but I never
found myself using that feature with any
phone I've owned but it's worth
mentioning the software is probably my
favorite part of this phone it's fast
includes virtually no bloatware and has
features that you wouldn't find on stock
Android one thing you'll notice right
off the bat is how quick this phone just
makes things happen that's in part of
HTC's efforts of reducing touch lag as
well as the animation speeds being
scaled back over my period of testing it
hasn't slowed down at all and at no time
was I waiting for a tap to register or
an app to open up it has a very stock
Android look and feel and this alone
makes this phone a must check out if
you're shopping around for a new android
flagship overall the HTC 10 is the best
well-rounded phone on the mark
as of now it does a lot of things right
and hopefully with some software tweaks
HTC can improve the cameras performance
a bit and put it up there with the
competitors it's not waterproof nor does
it have two cameras or wireless charging
but in an odd way it's currently my
favorite android phone on the market
part of that I guess is because this
phone is such an underdog I mean no one
was expecting this much from HTC but
they came out with a product that checks
pretty much all the boxes but they
pretty much wraps up my review of the
HTC 10 if you guys enjoyed it make sure
to leave a like and as always I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
