back to another episode of top three
apps you must try just like all the
episodes before all of these apps are
available for free and the links will be
in the description down below first up
on the list we have vain glory which
also happened to sponsor this episode
this is a cross-platform online strategy
game available on iOS and Android which
takes many cues from the popular title
the League of Legends but cuts it down
to a mobile game which is easy to get
the hang of the objective of the game is
to takeover the opposing team by
destroying their vein this is done
through taking down armored enemy
turrets players and minions once you
have completed the first four stages in
the game you can now enter a bot match
which is where the game really starts to
pick up there are two main different
game modes to choose from brawl and
standard while brawl mode requires less
in-depth gameplay strategy the matches
are a lot shorter making it perfect if
you want to kill off just a few minutes
standard mode is much more in-depth and
sticks to the roots of a tried-and-true
MOBA game now additionally you can
create a party game to invite your
friends and play with others online PvP
mode has the option to choose from
casual and ranked mode the latter of
which unlocks when you reach level 10
and own 8 heroes each game match begins
at the base sanctuary where players can
buy items and regenerate health very
much like League of Legends along the
way you can earn points which can later
be used to upgrade to characters
abilities weapons and more it only took
me a few seconds to nail down the game
controls and the game really does a good
job of navigating you around the menu
when you just downloaded the game not
only is vainglory a great casual game
but it's also a competitive eSport with
tournaments held it's an easy game to
pick up but there is a learning curve
but once you guys get the hang of it it
is a very addicting game I highly
recommend you check it out next up we
have the today weather app which is an
advanced yet minimalistic hub to see all
of your weather info on top of
displaying the temperature and weather
details the app displays a beautiful
image of the city which changes
according to the time of day you have
your usual 24 hour and seven-day weather
forecast but the app goes much deeper
with data such as air quality sunrise
and sunset the next full moon actual
temperature and air pressure just to
name a few what sets this app is how
extremely clean the
face is everything is presented in a
beautiful minimalistic interface that is
very easy on the eyes there is also a
social aspect to the app where you can
share a photo you've taken alongside the
weather conditions that are currently
present the app is currently only
available on Android for free but the
iOS version is set to come out in two
weeks
lastly coming in at number three is a
personal favorite of mine my fitness pal
available on iOS and Android this app is
the perfect choice for anybody that
wants to track the foods and drinks they
consume on a daily basis the app boasts
a database of over 5 million foods and
drinks complete with data such as
serving size calorie amounts and even
sugar content the app makes it extremely
easy to love your breakfast lunch dinner
snacks as well as water intake once you
decide on a daily calorie goal My
Fitness Pal will keep it displayed above
your diary the app can also integrate
with your smartphone or fitness tracker
to include the activity data and the
accompanying calories burned as well
such as workouts or steps walked my most
used feature of this app is scanning the
barcode of various food products it's
quick and almost always accurate
providing the correct nutritional values
for any item that I scan this all ties
together with the weight tracking which
can be done automatically via a smart
scale or manually by inputting weight
changes over time you can set a weight
goal and the app will update you on your
progress towards your goal so that will
do it for this video if you guys enjoyed

leave a like and feel free to leave any
apps suggestions for the next episode in

suggestions from thank you guys so much
