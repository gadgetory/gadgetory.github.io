welcome to my review of the one plus 5t
I've been using a device for almost a
month now and here is what I have to say
about it
first up we're taking a look at the
design and build quality oneplus has yet
again stuck with the anodized aluminum
build materials which I personally like
because it's light but still very
premium the biggest design change from
its predecessor is what's on the front
gone is the home button that doubles as
a fingerprint scanner and now instead we
have the more modern narrow bezels that
have become the staple of most Android
flagships this year
luckily oneplus has shifted the
fingerprint scanner on the back and am i
testing this scanner is very accurate
and easy to use they have also added a
face unlock feature which we will talk
later about in the box you will receive
a clear silicone case the sim eject tool
for amp - charge wall adapter and a USB
type-c cable the included TPU case does
a good job of protecting the device but
oneplus does also sell multiple
different color cases each with their
own unique grip texture moving on to the
specs the 5c comes in two variants the
entry-level model comes in at $4.99 and
is equipped with 64 gigs of storage and
6 gigs of RAM but you can opt for the
128 gigabyte of storage and 8 gigs of
ram for 559 otherwise both phones are
exactly the same packing the snapdragon
835 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU keep in mind
that the version I have in hand is the
128 gigabyte model with eight gigs of
RAM the dual slim slot is also another
included feature on all variants which
can be very useful for some people
especially for those who frequently
travel abroad on the sides of the device
you'll find the alert slider volume
control the power button and even a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack audio quality
with a pair of headphones is great
especially when you start tuning it with
the EQ settings in my testing I use the
normal profile with a slight bass boost
on the other hand the single downwards
firing speaker can be covered up by a
finger quite easily this won't be a huge
drawback for most people but it's
something to watch out for while the 5 t
doesn't have any water-resistant
certifications oneplus does claim that
the device will hold up to accidental
splashes of water which is a good
to have as I mentioned before the 5t
does use facial recognition as a method
of unlocking the phone and it's
lightning fast the phone detected my
face and no light and even in very
bright environments it's not the most
accurate though compared to the iPhone
10 as it will have difficulty if you
partially cover your face with something
such as a hat or a pair of sunglasses
moving on to the display the oneplus has
gone with a six inch 1080p panel with a
pixel density of 401 PPI and in person
this display is beautiful largely due to
it being AMOLED with amazing viewing
angles we also get deep blacks and
saturated colors display brightness is
quite impressive and visibility outdoors
is not a problem at all the corners of
the display are rounded off which help
make the overall aesthetic of the phone
a lot more modern although its aspect
ratio is 18 by 9
oneplus has made sure you won't run into
any screen compatibility issues and most
sixteen by nine media will be displayed
very well above this panel will also
find a notification LED the display is
protected by Gorilla Glass 5 to prevent
any shadows but can be prone to
scratching so you gotta be careful with
that everyone plus 5 T comes with a pre
applied plastic screen protector but
picking up a tempered glass variant is
also another option moving on to the
software and user experience now this is
where the 5 t shines the most in my
opinion the phone ships with the latest
stable version of oxygen OS which is
based on Android 7.1.1 nougat it's a
clean approach to Android and adds
minimal bloat to the software it does a
great job of simplifying the settings
menu and adding some features to further
customize the user interface to your
liking configuring the navigation
buttons is an option that I really found
helpful and on top of that you can set
custom functions for a swipe on the rear
fingerprint scanner or even a long press
on software keys the Shelf is also
present to the left side of the home
screen giving you quick access to
information such as date &amp;amp; time weather
and most used apps oxygen OS also does a
great job of managing background apps
and overall power efficiency speaking of
power efficiency the phone is packing a
3300 milliamp hour battery which in my
testing lasted just over 4
of on-screen time luckily the - charger
is lightning fast and just a few minutes
of charging will keep your battery
topped off for those I constantly find
themselves scrambling to find a charger
you'll be pleased to know that the 1 + 5
t can be charged from 0 to 60 percent in
just about 30 minutes
unfortunately the 5c does not come with
wireless charging which is a feature
that I would have loved to see on the
phone next up we're gonna talk about the
camera performance GaN is the additional
zoom lens from the predecessor and on
the 5 T we actually have a secondary
lens that specializes in capturing
low-light not only is the overall rear
camera sharpness great but images showed
accurate color saturation we also got
good dynamic range and pinpoint auto
focus auto focus is also great when
capturing video but the lack of optical
image stabilization will become apparent
in certain scenarios videos can appear
jittery when shot at 120 or even 60 FPS
but it's much less of an issue at 30fps
it's good to see the familiar camera app
interface that I've come to appreciate
the camera pro mode allows for custom
white balance ISO exposure and even
other fine adjustments for those that
want that extra control over the cameras
overall oneplus has delivered on their
promise yet again and the 5 T is not
only a well polished device but a very
close contender to competing flagship
devices at only about half the price if
you're in the market for a meaningful
upgrade but don't want to break the bank
for the latest pixel or even iPhone 10
then this is definitely a great option
for you but I pretty much wraps up this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it let me
know what your feedback is on the phone
by leaving your comments below and
whether you guys agreed or disagreed
with what I had to say about the 5 t
I'll drop a link to a below if you guys
want to check it out again thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
