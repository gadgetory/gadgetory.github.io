and in this video we're going to be
taking a look at how SSDs impact
performance on a PC specifically an SSD
from Western Digital I want to give a
huge thanks to Western Digital for
setting out their SSD for me to review
as well as sponsoring this video the one
I'm featuring in this video is the WD
blue with a capacity of one terabyte but
they do have different sizes available
in both 256 and 500 gigabyte variants as
well as an MDOT 2 version so WD SSDs
come in two different colors green and
blue the green version is made for
everyday computing while the blue
version is optimized for multitasking
and resource heavy applications adding
an SSD to your notebook or desktop PC is
a very quick way to increase loading and
transfer speeds I'm sure most of you
guys are familiar with WD and their
drives they are well known for their
reliability and high performance so in
this video I'm actually going to be
testing this SSD to see how well it
actually performs so I'm going to be
doing boot tests on my PC disc speed
benchmarks and also I'm going to load up
some games just to see how the
performance is on these SSDs however
performance isn't the only thing that WD
does right these are says these consume
less power and produce less heat
compared to standard hard drives not to
mention the compact form factor you get
if you are someone who has important
documents and files having a solid and
reliable SSD is just as important as
performance so installing one in your PC
isn't hard at all simply open up the
side panel and locate your SATA ports on
your motherboard which should look
something like this grab one SATA data
cable that is usually provided with your
motherboard and plug it in one of the
set up ports on the motherboard then you
need to grab the other end of the data
cable and the SATA power cable which
runs from your power supply and plug
both ends to the back of the SSD once
you boot up your PC hit delete to get
into the BIOS and here you have to
switch to Advanced Mode depending on
your motherboard is either f6 or f7 you
would then need to navigate to the boot
menu and in here you have to make sure
to set boot option number one to your
SSD if you're going to use that as your
main drive as you can see I have set the
WD 1 terabyte SSD as boot option number
one so that my PC will
from it when it starts speaking of boo
times let's take a look at how long it
takes for my system to load from a cold
start so it took about 17 seconds to
load straight to the desktop compared to
my actual PC which took about 30 seconds
now let's take a look at a restart so
every start takes a few seconds longer
since the PC has to close windows and
then reboot by 26 seconds is still
pretty fast again these boot times do
vary depending on your PC and the parts
that you are using I know for a fact
that the motherboard does have a huge
impact in fact you guys can do this
exact same test and let me know in the
comments section what your boot time is
because I would love to compare these
numbers WD claims to have read and write
speeds of up to five forty five and five
twenty five megabytes respectively which
is very accurate when looking at the
actual benchmarks
I got a read score of five thirty two
megabytes and a write score of five
twenty - I was also comparing these
numbers with another SSD that I was
using and it turns out the WD blue SSD
is noticeably faster across all of the
categories and finally let's take a look
at loading times of GTA 5 so on my main
PC it takes around 45 seconds to load
GTA 5 from the beginning but with the WD
blue it only took 30 seconds the next
game I tested was doom and you can
actually see the loading speed in real
time on the top right corner 14 seconds
to load doom on the WD blue whereas it
took me about 20 seconds on my actual PC
so what we can conclude during these
tests is that the WD blue SSD offers
noticeably faster speeds in terms of
booting transferring and even loading
times compared to the SSD that I was
using in my own personal computer so if
you guys are going to build your next PC
or maybe you're just tired of very slow
speeds and want something with more
performance and reliability then make
sure to check out their SSDs at WD comm
and I'll be sure to drop a link to them
down below thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
