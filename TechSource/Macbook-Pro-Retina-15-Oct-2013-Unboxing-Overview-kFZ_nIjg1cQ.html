look at apple's new macbook pro that was
just announced this is the 15 inch base
model that starts at 1999 apple also
reduced their retina MacBook prices by
two hundred dollars making them just a
little more affordable so the 15 inch
based model comes with it has well two
point three gigahertz quad-core intel i7
processor 16 gigabytes of ram with 512
petabytes of pcie flash storage space
the 15-inch retina display also has a
resolution of 28 80 x 1800 p which is a
monster resolution it also sports
Intel's iOS pro 5200 integrated graphics
card and an nvidia geforce gt750m with
two gigs of memory the new macbooks
already come pre-installed what OS X
Mavericks which is Apple's new operating
system and they even upgraded their
Wi-Fi to 802 11 AC which is up to three
times faster than last chance model
overall the only differences between
this version and last chance is that
this model improves the capability of
Wi-Fi speeds overall processing ability
and faster read/write speeds the design
is exactly the same as you can see here
and they even have the same measurements
and similar weight inside the box you
have your usual stuff extension for the
wall charger which has a different shape
plug the standard wall charger and the
usual paperwork which normally includes
apple stickers warranty manuals and a
microfiber cloth so with their new
Haswell cpus the macbooks get a boost in
battery life as well up to eight hours
of wireless internet surfing eight hours
of iTunes movie playback and up to 30
days of standby time these new models
also have upgraded Thunderbolt 2 ports
which is forty five percent faster than
the previous models making data transfer
speeds much faster one thing i like
about the macbook is their upgraded
pcie-based flash storage the read and
write speeds reach peaks of eight
hundred megabytes per second and i
noticed how fast it really is when
opening the lid while it's sleeping the
previous model will take around four to
five seconds to boot up while these are
instant let's take a quick look at the
right side of the macbook here you will
find your USB 3.0 port hdmi slot and
your SD card reader and on the opposite
side you have your headphone jack
another USB 3
Thunderbolt 2 slots and you're charging
connector so that's it for the quick
look at Apple's new macbook pro overall
it's a great laptop much more powerful
than last chance and the fact that it's
more affordable is a bonus will you guys
