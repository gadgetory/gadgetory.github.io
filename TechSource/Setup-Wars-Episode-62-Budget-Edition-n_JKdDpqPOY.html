welcome to setup wars episode 62 budget
Edition where you submit your desk setup
to get featured on the channel that's
not wasting more time ladies and
gentlemen let the set-up wars begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below so
just to clarify my budget edition of
setup bores are people who have decent
or modest
setups I think eyes are mixing the
differences between my worst setup
Edition and my budget Edition the budget
edition are people who have decent
budgets or very small budgets nothing
too fancy nothing too crazy like triple
martyr setups or a ten thousand dollar
water-cooled PC so with that said here
are your five contestants for this week
we have Alby Charlie Dennis Demetri and
Felix let's begin so starting to show
off we have Alby and his 2016 13 inch
MacBook set up on the ikea standard wood
desk so a pretty simple setup actually
other than the laptop we also have a few
other Apple accessories that include the
iPad air 2 Apple watch and the iPhone 5s
sitting on a dock the mouse of choice is
the g---eight 32 31 which is actually
surprising seeing as you're not using an
Apple Mouse so a few other things on the
desk include a mini skateboard and BMX
ramps off to the left side a ue boom
speaker and a fake ikea plant off to the
right side that's basically the gist of
it a very clean and straightforward
setup
Thank You lb for entering Charlie is
next up with a similar style setup hmm I
wonder where you got that inspiration
from so on the desk we have a 27 inch
Samsung monitor sitting on top of a
custom-made monitor riser and the desk
is actually custom made as well not bad
we also have a red dragon carullo
keyboard a wireless Logitech mouse and
you do know there's no mic attached to
your boom arm right wait a sec are you
using your boom arm as a headphone
hanger instead
Brahe cable management on the other hand
is very clean at least you talked
everything away from sight and on the
roof of the desk and lastly we have an
Asus laptop powering this set up I would
recommend it cheaper and much cleaner
alternative to holding your headphones
like an actual hanger but other than
that not a bad setup Thank You charlie
for entering at number 3 we have Dennis
with another laptop set up we have the
17-inch xmg gaming laptop that's running
the show and a Samsung TV mounted
against the wall that's hooked up to his
ps4 by the way props on the wire
management also a quick tip you can
actually remove the two legs from your
table and scoot over the drawer to the
right side which should give you more
space for your chair and legs
the Alex your has a large enough surface
to support the other half of your desk
speaking of desk we have quite a few
items on here a logitech g930 my last
mouse on top of the Razer Firefly mouse
pad near the back we have a pair of
Logitech Z 2300 speakers and a charging
dock for his ps4 controllers cable
management looks pretty good no wires on
the ground except for the power strip
that's hiding behind those bags of
protein powder what do you think I
wouldn't have noticed if you're going to
be inconspicuous and hide stuff behind
objects make sure the object is in
protein powder regardless a white cable
box will not only go along with your
setup theme but it will also clean up
whatever you have behind there a very
clean and organized setup Thank You
Dennis for entering next up is Demetri
with our first dual display setup of the
episode so we have two 19 inch Dell
monitors and hpk 3500 keyboard and HP
wireless mouse sandwiching the monitors
are a pair of Harman Kardon speakers and
we also have a desk lamp among other
miscellaneous things I guess this is
somewhat of a black and blue setup
judging by the paint color and the blue
accents everywhere on the desk and the
PC which by the way has an i7 4770k
Radeon HD 8470 this is pretty
embarrassing toss me an email dude and
I'll send you an r7 370
so if you're watching this video make
sure to take a new picture of your setup
and make sure you have the words tech
source written somewhere in there so
that I know it's ax
you and I'm going to go ahead and send
you an r73 sexually one sec so yeah I'm
going to send you this r7 370 it's been
laying around since I benchmarked it so
I'm not even using it and I hope you
will make good use of it
so toss me an email the only thing I ask
of you is please fix that fan
on the other hand I'm very pleased with
your cable management
luckily the IKEA Mackay desk comes with
a rack to store your cables and power
strips so no complaints there I would
put some of that stuff in the drawers to
clean up a surface area but other than
that it's a pretty modest and clean
setup Thank You Dimitri for entering and
congrats on your r7 370 last but not
least we have Felix the Cat with our
final laptops set up and I got to give
you points for the presentation I love
the wallpaper so on the homemade desk we
have a 22 inch BenQ monitor sitting on
top of an amplifier and we also have the
hammer wireless keyboard and a pair X MX
Mouse in the back of the desk we have a
pair of JBL speakers and lastly his
Lenovo y50 laptop that's powering
everything I'm honestly not a fan of the
desk it's not very appealing I get that
you made this from home but covering the
surface with anything would improve the
overall look whether its carbon fiber
wraps fake leather or even just a simple
math Vanille wrap would do cable
management isn't bad I also see that you
have a custom-made rack to keep most of
your wires on so good job there and I
guess you do have an actual PC so it's
rocking an i3 41 70 and a ZOTAC GTX 650
P I I will give you points for all the
custom work and the placement of the USB
hub just that's something to cover up
that surface of the table and you will
get my approval
thank you Felix for entering so that is
it for this episode of setup wars as
