source today I'm going to look at the
black ops elite case from element and
this is recently released for the iPhone
5
so I'm just going to turn this in the
back real quick and go over some
features on the sector five black ops
elite features a low-profile and
lightweight CNC machined aluminum case
it's a it's tight fit and if it's really
flush with iPhone 5 it comes with a clip
actually and the screen shield is
actually a stealth privacy screen
protector which I'll go a little bit
more about later on and they also
includes a tactical holster so flippin
is on the side I should ease other
versions you can get the person which is
mine black on black
next one is black on green third is
desert tan on black and last one desert
tan frame with dark earth ok so that's
enough talking let's go to unbox this
and see what the sector 5 comes with
right off the bat you can see the case
itself I'm going to go and put this on
the side we'll get back to it soon we're
going to see what else comes inside the
box so the first thing you see is
actually the tactical holster that I was
talking about it's actually a pretty
neat pouch those of you that I like
keeping your phones and pouches you can
carry this with you it comes with a clip
and inside of it looks like it's the
actual backplate that's included with
the accessory clip is actually included
on there and that's actually optional
too you can take that off if you want it
comes with a speed wrench which is
inside the patch right here and that's
the speed range it's actually Torx
wrench you can pull out the bolts and
I'll show you guys what that looks like
without it
so this hollister is actually really
easy to put on and take off you just
snap it off and snap it back on once
you're done using it so it's really easy
ok so moving on it comes at 8 alcohol
rubbing pad that's your screwdriver for
replacing and putting on your case some
extra screws looks like it also comes at
an instructional guide for the actual
case installation and it comes in
another instructional guide how to put
on your rash guards this is actually
optional you don't have to if you don't
want to especially if you do already
have rash guards I think these come with
silver yeah silver and black you can
choose whichever one you want once again
it is optional and this is also the
stealth privacy screen protector that I
was talking about this looks just like
the ones on the monitors where you
cannot view what's on the screen at a
certain angle so that kind of gives you
some sort of a privacy so that's pretty
cool
so like all other cases it comes with a
microfiber cloth and a squeegee board
which is pretty cool can help you assess
putting on the screen shield which is
really important this looks like a
catalog for their other products like
the Ronin and vapor dogs and things like
that so that's pretty cool and moving
along and while there's a bunch of stuff
in here actually
so this is not an instructional guide on
how to put the back plate it's
self-explanatory but we're guys going to
show you the installation just so you
guys know how it's done last but not
least this is the black plate sheet this
is for people I already have back plates
like mine I have the ultra suede on
iphone 5 currently I can swap that out
put that on there so it saves it and I
could put on the new one which is with
the with the clip-on and both of these
are have a piece of strips so basically
sticks on the back of the iPhone 5 and
does not come out so here's a quick
closeup of the actual case element has
done another great job honestly making a
great case for the iPhone 5 this is a
pure CNC machine it's a perfect fit on
the iPhone 5 it's a treeless nug that's
on the side here as you can see there's
some cutouts for the volume buttons and
actual vibrate button moving down below
there's more cutouts for actual speakers
your charging port and of course your
headphone jack and moving on to the
other side this is actually something
new they're doing there it's like a
small grip over here on the side here so
so you can grip your phone easily it's
optional you guys can take it off
actually if you want you can keep it on
there but if someone has like a rash
guard like mine there's some red on
there as you can see I prefer to make
that visible so I if it were my case I
would definitely keep it off and make
the red more stand out because I think
it looks a lot better that way so let's
go ahead and take off the case real
quick and look at some features of it so
that's the desktop side I was talking
about the actual grip that's of course
that's optional you can actually leave
it off if you want or keep it on
depending on what your preferences and
there's some cool colors on the sides
there actually I should say the hinges
kind of gives it like a black ops team
so that's pretty cool okay so I already
took out my backplate the ultra suede I
put it on the sheet that you save for
later and now I'm going to put on the
new one which is with the accessory clip
and I'll show you guys how it's done
first thing you want to do is take out
one of the screws you could actually
choose any one I chose the top left and
once you take out the screw you just
basically
pull it off it's kind of tight but it
comes off real easily and the first
thing you want to do is actually put the
backplate on and then you put the case
on so you pull off the duties of slip or
sticker I should say I'll put this back
on guys so don't worry about that and
you would put this back on your back
plate so make sure you position it up
perfectly make sure it's aligned on the
sides and the back the great thing about
these back place is actually you can use
them interchangeably you can take them
off as many times as you want and it
still won't remove its stickiness so
I've removed my ultra suede maybe at
least 10-15 times so just to clean the
background so it's you can use them as
many times you want it doesn't lose its
stickiness so once you're done putting
on the back plate you're going to go
ahead and put them in actual element
case make sure all the sides are aligned
before you go and press down on the side
you may have to push down on one side of
it just so you can get the screw holes
aligned and you're gonna get your tiny
screw and go and push it in there of
course once it's in there you're going
to take your screwdriver and just
quickly
scoot in there don't over tighten it
because if you do you might end up
stripping the bolt just so you know just
enough where it's nice and snug so this
is what it looks like after installation
I decided not to put the side grips on
because honestly it looks much better
this way I like my ranch cars to be
visible I think it just stands out
really nicely and just makes the case
look really really sick so I'm gonna
show you guys a few pictures with and
without the clip and also with and
without the grips on the side and you
guys can see what looks better for you
so here's one with the clip and without
the clip I think the no clip looks a lot
cleaner in my opinion and this is
actually a no-brainer obviously the one
without any grips is standard a lot more
