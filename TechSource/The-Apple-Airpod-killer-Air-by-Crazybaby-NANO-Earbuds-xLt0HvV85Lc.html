as unfortunate as it is headphone jacks
are sadly fading away with manufacturers
like Apple and Google spearheading the
change the Nano from air by crazy baby
is a wireless and cordless earbud
solution that I think a lot of you would
be interested in it does retail for $100
and has a lot of the same functionality
that you would find in Apple's more
expensive air pods so I've been using
these for a week now and I have to say
I'm actually impressed but before we get
into the earphones let's talk about the
carrying case it has an apple vibe but
it's all white glossy design and magnets
that hold the ear buds together as well
as the built-in battery that will charge
the earbuds it uses these contact points
to do so and they do have to be
perfectly aligned in order for it to
work as for the battery life the nanos
will go for around 12 hours when
recharging with the battery in the
capsule and three hours with a single
charge
three hours isn't really that great but
considering we get 1.5 hours of use from
just five minutes of charge it's easy to
work with the LED built into the side
gives you the charging status and on the
other end we'll find the USB C port used
to charge the entire case and it's nice
to see that they went with the new
standard one thing I do want to mention
is that on my pre-release unit the
sliding capsule doors are kind of wobbly
and don't seem to be put together very
well one of the doors also slides open
pretty easily but again this is a
pre-production unit so I hope these
issues are addressed before the official
launch oh and speaking of launch it will
come with ten different color choices so
you can match it with pretty much
anything you want one of my favorite
features they've incorporated here is
the quick listen and what that will do
is it will turn the earbuds on and pair
them automatically when you pull them
out of the capsule I found this
especially useful in situations where I
can't avert my focus from a task and
fiddle with my Bluetooth settings or
plug in headphones in ear the nanos are
comfortable they're small and
lightweight and angle in perfectly with
the ear canal and I want to worry about
them falling off either thanks to the
ergonomic design and the rubber ear tips
however if you're going to be very
active with these earbuds in for
example if you're gonna be jogging or
going to the gym I do recommend using
the included sport strap it's also
splash resistant so it can definitely
take the sweat if you're planning to
workout with these on looking around the
earbuds we can see an LED indicator for
the connection status and right above
that there is a button it's attached
fairly well to the earbud but I wish it
was a little more clicky with the left
ear but we get controls over phone calls
and voice assistant and on the right ear
bud it gives us control over music I
really enjoyed using Siri with the nanos
it has a built-in microphone and with
bluetooth 5.0 s extended range I can be
pretty far away from my phone and set
timers ask questions or whatever else
that I deal with Siri I actually find
myself using her more with these on than
I have ever have without any earbuds on
and also these shortcuts work with
Android of course now for the important
part the sound quality if you want
strong base then I'm sorry to say that
these aren't for you the sound profile
is very clear however and has good highs
and mids but there just isn't any
low-end vocals are clear as well and I
found these to be perfect for podcasts
you also get fairly loud I typically
keep them at 70% volume I don't
recommend going above 80% otherwise you
can damage your hearing so for $100 you
get a saw a pair of wireless earphones
that deliver everything that the more
expensive Apple earpods already do if
you have one of the latest smart phones
that don't have a headphone jack or if
you're just looking for a really solid
pair of bluetooth earbuds that I do
recommend checking these out I'll drop a
link to it down below as always thinking
guys so much for watching I will see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
