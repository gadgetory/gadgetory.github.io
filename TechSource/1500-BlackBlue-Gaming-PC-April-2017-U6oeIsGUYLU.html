be one of your standards if so then this
$2,000 PC might be what you need to take
your flashy lifestyle to the next level
all right guys this isn't just for show
when overclocked 7600 K and 1070 this
rig will pretty much eat up any game you
throw at it
enter max kindly send out a few of their
products and we decided to go with a
blue and black build since you guys keep
bugging me about it so here it is
finally the inner max case comes in blue
LEDs with six modes quick-release panels
for easy cleaning and an integrated fan
controller if blue is not your style
then don't fret because they do sell a
bunch of different colors the 700 watt
gold power supply also has two fans
which is a first from what I've seen on
the channel NMX claims that this two fan
design which they call duo flow achieves
lower fan RPMs when compared to single
fan PSUs which should in theory also
reduce noise another benefit of having
two fans as the ability for the PSU to
draw hot air out of the chassis with a
knob on the back users have control over
the fan speeds if you crank it up high
the PSU will use the top fan to extract
and push out hot air through the back
the inner max VF pressure fans also set
themselves apart from the market in that
they are self-cleaning the FDF
technology which stands for dust free so
within 10 seconds they will rotate in
the other direction and go to full speed
blowing all the dust from the blades and
prolonging the lifespan of the fan the
blade can also be detached from the
frame to be cleaned if you choose to the
fans also have a switch that gives the
user speed control Animax is really into
this user control thing cooling the CPU
is the Lee pineal illusion going with
the RGB standard we of course have to
find a cooler that would fit the bill it
has 15 LED colors and several different
lighting modes all controlled with the
included remote on the a2 z170a
motherboard we've got the sick g.skill
tread and the RGB RAM sticks with a
total memory of 16 gigs they do have a
speed of 3600 megahertz and look
absolutely stunning
with those lighting effects for storage
we've got a three terabyte Seagate drive
and a 500 gigabyte Samsung SSD the
little that said and done let's begin
the benchmarks
so the specie will be able to hand with
high settings at a solid 60 FPS as we
saw from the benchmarks there were a few
things I wanted to note though about the
chassis the cable management first of
all isn't the easiest with the narrower
than usual clearance and few zip tight
spots to work with also if you're
looking for a silent build I would
definitely look for a different case as
this one doesn't have sound dampening
materials and I pretty much wraps up
this PC build up drop a link to all the
parts used as always down below thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
