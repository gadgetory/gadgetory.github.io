from a meeting from potential sponsors
and I'm gonna go get some stuff from
Lowe's and Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond just what I
was about to leave IKEA deliver the rest
of the furniture so finally we got the
rest of the stuff in that is the TV
stand comes in two boxes for some reason
I got this little shelf here that I'm
gonna be mounting against the wall here
on top of the shoe stand like right here
is the wall shelf and this we're going
to be keeping the keys and sunglasses
and wallets and stuff like that so so
it's easier to grab so easier to grab
before we leave oh I do want to show you
this this is going to be a security
surveillance camera I think I featured
this in cool tech of September but this
is guardzilla it's basically a video
surveillance camera motion sensor and
even has a speaker and mic so you guys
can communicate back and forth so it's
pretty cool yes little tiny thing is
going to be protecting the headquarters
of tech stores that's basically it uh
time to head out to get some shopping
done I swear she always does this takes
forever 40 already so taking my
girlfriend's car today because mine has
puny storage room and we need some space
for additional furniture the hell is
calling me hey Siri where is the closest
Bed Bath and Beyond

I feel so out of place in this store
guys do not belong in here I feel so
lost so got a few things from Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond now we're heading to Lowe's to
finish up the shopping looking for some
for my room and for the living room and
perhaps our bedroom so now looking
around I kinda want to go with red
curtains but I don't know I think black
would look better so decide to go with
these are all what color it shows up on
the camera but these are really nice
black ones for the office and I have two
windows so I need two these one on each
side and we got similar ones for our
bedroom two from my bedroom bath finally
got shopping done it's five o'clock now
so gonna get head home we're gonna get
held in I'm gonna hold out they finally
got shopping done it's 5 o'clock I'm
gonna head home change and then go out
to eat so whoa relax
I see yessing
why are you taking the easy stuff up a
crackpot or crock crock-pot not a
crackpot some currents which are gonna
go why is it going babe and up in the
bedroom

and the rest are going to my office and
then we got this cutlery tray which is
supposed to go and out of the drawer
here

and then we picked up some rods which
obviously you need to hang the curtains
they are in black because that's how I
roll and some glass bowls for baking I
