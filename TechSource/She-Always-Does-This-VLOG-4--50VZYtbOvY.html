gonna be mounting against the wall here
on top of the shoe stand like right here

to be keeping the keys and sunglasses
and wallets and stuff like that so so
it's easier to grab so easier to grab
before we leave oh I do want to show you
this this is going to be a security
surveillance camera I think I featured
this in cool tech of September but this
is guardzilla it's basically a video
surveillance camera motion sensor and
