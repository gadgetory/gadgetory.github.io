gentlemen today we are building a sexy
gaming PC to game over 100 fps and 1080p
this PC is specifically for people with
high refresh rate monitors to take
advantage of these super high frames and
1080p it's gonna cost you around seven
hundred twenty dollars without the
optional parts and a little under 900
with everything included let's begin
join the custom cooling revolution with
the corsair hydro x series featuring
every part you'll need to make your pc
stand out with a gorgeous custom cooling
system experience powerful cooling with
minimal noise easy setup and automated
control for efficient fan and pump
speeds choose from a range of water
blocks for the latest graphics cards
including the nvidia geforce r-tx 2080
and 2080 TI for more info click the link
below so I wanted to do something a
little different instead of building a
budget gaming PC I want to make it look
sexy after all that is one of my
specialties here on YouTube
PC porn
now with that said I wanted to build
something that performs in the hi
hundred FPS average in 1080p while also
looking gorgeous in your setup the theme
of the build is all light in case you
guys haven't noticed and I feel like
white really blends in well with most
setups out there Before we jump into the
gaming benchmarks let's go over the
parts real quick starting with the CPU I
went with the i-5 90 400 F which a lot
of people don't know about it's a locked
6 core processor with no hyper threading
and a boost clock of 4.1 gigahertz this
processor goes for only $150 and it
competes against the rise in 5 2600 X
which is not going for the same price
since AMD launched a new third
generation rising chips the second
generation chips have dropped in price
significantly if you look at the gaming
benchmarks only ninety 400f compared to
the 2600 X you can see that it
outperforms the 2600 X in almost every
title on stock frequencies however the
2600 X did do slightly better once
overclocked
to 4.2 gigahertz on start the 90 400 F
is about 3% faster than the 2600 X one
of the advantages that the 2600 X has
over the 90 400 F is hyper threading and
because of that it's going to perform
way better in heavy application
workloads whether it's screaming or
editing and for that reason alone I do
recommend going the AMD route I want to
make it very clear for you guys ok if
you want to build a gaming PC for more
than just gaming so whether it's editing
we're screaming and you want a PC that
has a better upgrade path this PC is not
for you I'll drop a link below to a AMD
parts list that has a much better
upgrade path that costs about the same
so check that out instead the build I'm
doing in this video is strictly for
gaming right now and also aesthetics I
would say it's like 5050 so if you guys
don't plan on upgrading any parts in the
next 2 or 3 years and you love the color
white then this PC might interest you so
the motherboard I picked up as the B 360
gaming arctic simply because it's the
only motherboard with an all-white PCB
that's going to fit perfectly in this
build it also supports a ninth gen
processor so I don't need to flash the
BIOS and it has four dimm slots allowing
you to add two more RAM sticks later if
needed the only downside to that
motherboard is it doesn't support fast
only up to 26 66 megahertz speaking of
RAM I went with 2 4 gigabyte sticks of
the T force Delta R GB RAM for some
reason at 3000 megahertz speed was the
same price as the 2666 megahertz so
obviously I picked up the faster ones
instead for $46 the GPU we are going
with is the zotac gtx 1660 TI which
offers exceptional 1080p performance
which you will get to see at the end of
this video the NZXT th 500 is actually
perfect for this build because I like
the compact size of it while supporting
full-size ATX motherboards and the
tempered glass panel with awesome cable
management support is a nice plus
powering everything is a 600 watt bronze
certified power supply from cougar which
has an awesome price only $45 for a 600
watt power supply I couldn't pass that
up for storage we are sticking with a
single 512 gigabyte SSD from teen that
offers pretty good read and write speeds
and finally the rest of the stuff is
optional but without them I feel like
the build wouldn't be complete you know
I was going for an all-white build so if
I didn't pick up white cable extensions
or even a white cooler then it just
wouldn't look as good the gamax cooler
is much quieter than its thought
heatsink from the cpu and it offers
better cooling while sticking with the
color scheme I also picked up a sheet of
white skins to cover up the SSD and then
I realized you can mount this on the
back of the case so technically this is
not even needed and we can cross $10 off
the total I also picked up two white LED
strips which are powered by Moak so I
have to do is plug it in your PSU and
you're good to go
and finally picked up some white LED
fans from a go a set of three white LED
fans which are also molex powered and
these will replace the stock fans in the
case and that's pretty much everything
so let's put it together and see what it
can do
so the final thoughts on the PC it was
built to do exactly what it was made for
1080p gaming over a hundred FPS I mean
you can even run some games in 1440p and
still get over a hundred FPS like csgo
overwatch and even siege because it
doesn't take much to run those games in
a higher resolution I did overclock the
GPU as well and I was actually very
impressed with the numbers never have I
ever seen a GPU overclocked this
smoothly like the zotac gtx 1660 TI i
was able to add an extra one hundred
thirty megahertz offset to the core
clock and fourteen fifty megahertz
offset on the memory this gave me
seventy more FPS on the heaven benchmark
and 23 FPS on Rainbow siege that's 23
more frames just by overclocking the GPU
which is really easy to do I mean that
is extra performance for free basically
now with that said there was one thing
that I didn't like about this build and
that is the fans
it looks very dim compared to the other
white LED fan but the thing that
bothered me the most was the connection
so you have two ways to connect this
either molex or three pin fan header but
look at the spacing between the two of
them I wanted to hook up all three fans
to the fan headers on the motherboard so
that I can control the speed but the
spacing is so terrible you end up having
is nasty molex connector hanging from
the cable I have no idea why they
designed their fans like that it's a
pretty bad design choice if they gave me
at least I don't know three inches of
space to work with then that would have
solved my issue and I'll be able to
connect the fans using the fan header on
the motherboard but unfortunately I had
to use the molex connector instead which
means that I have no control over the
speed of the fans but it's whatever I
mean the case has plenty of airflow and
I'm three fans do a good job on keeping
the components nice and cool while
keeping the system very silence this is
how quiet it is on full load I'm
actually running heav'n benchmark right
now let me show you guys actually this
monitor is huge
so yeah it's running have a benchmark
it's on a loop right now and this is how
quiet the system is
so to wrap up this video for this price
point which is a little over $800 you
can obviously build a better PC I do
recommend going with the AMD rap like I
mentioned earlier if you guys want a
better upgrade path as well as more bang
for your buck this is not a value PC by
any means you guys this is a combination
of aesthetics and performance with
emphasis more on aesthetics of course
and also for someone prefers Intel parts
over a and B speaking of value can I
just rant a little bit about the back
plate from b1 Tech this thing costs $40
which is pretty expensive for a piece of
acrylic I was debating on not putting
something like this in a build but I
couldn't leave the top of the GPU you
know blank and I had to put something on
there so 40 bucks is a it's pretty steep
for something like this I mean don't get
me wrong if you want to take I'll love
you guys you know I use a lot of your
stuff and most of my builds but can you
give us a break here I mean I feel like
you can buy something like this online
for like 10 bucks and then cut it to any
shape you want I feel like what that
extra $40 you can put that towards a
better GPU or really upgrade any
component inside your system instead of
spending it on a piece of acrylic board
but anyways I'm done anyways I'm done
rambling I hope you guys enjoyed the
video I'll drop a link to all the parts
used in this system as well as the aim D
parts which I talked about earlier
consider subscribing because I have an
AMD budget bill coming up with a bill
guide which is everyone's favorite it's
coming up very soon and that's pretty
much it yeah I love your faces and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
