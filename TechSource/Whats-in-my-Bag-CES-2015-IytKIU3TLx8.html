source and in this video we are going to
be taking a look at what we come to CES
2015 let's start with this backpack from
tilting now what's so cool about this is
that it comes with a ten thousand four
hundred milli amp four hour battery that
has its own designated area and places
for cables to run to all the
compartments you also have plenty of
padded areas where you can store stuff
like phones and laptops without worrying
about any damage up next we got this
Belkin power strip that has eight
outlets but what's really cool about
this power strip is that you can pivot
the outlets so that you can fit in
different power breaks
rather than interfering with each other
also from Belkin we have this three
outlet mini travel charger with dual USB
s now what's so cool about this is that
it also pivots allowing you to position
it in any way you like
the added us pieces of bonus as well at
the top here we have two pairs of a th
and 50 X's one in black and one in white
when you buy a pair you actually get
this cool carrying case which is
convenient when you're traveling and
these are probably the best pair of
headphones you can get for this price
point here is the Panasonic lens we used
to film that couples with our Panasonic
gh4 we loved this camera and its ability
to shoot in 4k makes it that much better
I will definitely recommend it to anyone
looking for a camera that can shoot in
4k right below that we have the moto 360
which has most of you knows in Android
wear Smart Watch from Motorola and it's
probably one of the best Android wear
smartwatches out right now
hello we have the phones that we are
going to be taking the CES here is the
iPhone 6 plus which is a great phone for
many reasons but the main reason it is
in my bag is because of its battery life
next to that is Edgar's daily driver
that Xperia z3 which is his preferred
Android headset at the moment next to
that we have the iPhone 6 it doesn't
have any juice in there right now but
this will be a backup just in case one
of our phones dies during the event
under all the phones as a razor mouse
pad which we are going to be using with
these Mouse's which are both from Razer
as well to keep all our stuff charged we
are taking this vivid night power bank
that has 13,000 milliamps and is one of
our
favorite power banks we also have
something smaller than lithium power
card which easily fits in a wallet and
can offer a quick charge here we have
our business cards removed they're nice
and thick and definitely separate
themselves from the other business cards
out there which is why we decide to go
with their luck series over here we have
the h4n which is an awesome mobile
reporter which should offer some decent
audio when we're away from our main rig
at our office and what's going to be
pumping out all of our videos are these
two laptops both from Asus and both very
powerful with core i7 processors and
dedicated graphics cards editing should
be a breeze for these laptops I will
include links down below the
specifications of each laptop if you're
interested as well as links to
everything else in this video if you
wanted to get more details on the
products this is Bob from Texas and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
