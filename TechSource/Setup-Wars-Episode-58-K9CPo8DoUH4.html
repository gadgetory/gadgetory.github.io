said I was going to tase myself if it
got to ten thousand likes this video
gets 10,000 likes I will tase myself
with this and one of my setup boys
videos well turns out that this is
actually not a Taser just by reading the
billions of comments you guys left me
which by the way thank you because you
saved my life
this isn't actually a Taser turns out
it's a plasma lighter yeah I don't want
to burn myself to death so you guys know
me I'm always a man of my word
so if this was a Taser I was ready to
tase myself but yeah I don't want to die
I don't want to get 10 degree burns so I
will do a different challenge of course

challenge a reasonable challenge please

with anything I recommend but here are
your five contestants for this week we
have Eli Felix
Gregory Jonathan and Josh
congratulations for making it on the
show so starting off the show we have
Eli and three 23 inch HP Pavilion
monitors on top of the IKEA lindeman
desk a fairly clean and straightforward
setup on the desk we have the Logitech
AK a 360 keyboard and mouse bundle on
top of the coop ex mousepad and we also
have a pair of Logitech z3 one three
speakers off to the sides the PC that
somehow pushing all of these pixels is
running on an FX 4300 and a geforce GT
720 seriously how the hell do you have a
triple monitor set up with those specs
surprisingly cable management is on
point we have the usual Signum rack
holding up the cable wait wait a minute
you didn't leave a like on my video
hello darkness my old friend I've come
to talk with you again
other than that we have a handmade clock
above the middle monitor a random light
meter and a pile of right on the
wall seriously though what's the purpose
of this and why is it on your drawer
okay then they fairly clean a pretty
interesting setup Thank You Eli for
entering felix is next up with a setup
on top of the piranha corner desk we
have a pro lights 22 inch monitor
sitting on top of a 34 inch ultra wide
from LG which looks like they are hooked
up to the wall well the top monitor is
but the ultra white is being held up by
the silverstone monitor arm which is
actually off to the side by the way a
quick tip if you guys want to get a soft
glow effect behind your monitor like
felix has done here then you need to
hook up a set of LED strips to the back
of the monitor this way you can combine
both of your LED strips and create a
very nice glowy effect of two different
colors below the monitors we have the
core circ 8:30 keyboard and a map cast
we're at three Mouse on top of the
courser extended mouse pad and on the
other side we have a 13 inch MacBook Pro
Retina and a pretty cool charging dock
in the back between both setups we have
a little stand for the Asus Strix gaming
headphones and Felix actually
custom-painted the orange wings to white
to better match his setup but look at
the cute little snow here too bad he
died just kidding you guys relax
speaking of headsets he also has a Razer
Kraken pro hanging next to his PC which
is rocking an i7 4790k overclocked to
4.4 and an msi r9 270x cable management
on the other hand looks pretty good I
love the fact that you drilled a hole in
your desk
throughout the keyboard and mouse wired
through and it seems like most of the
stuff is hooked up on that power strip
which is also attached on the roof of
the desk very clean and organized setup
no doubt I have nothing to recommend
Thank You Felix for entering at number
three we have Gregory with another
interesting set up we have a 24 inch
band cue monitor on the left hooked up
to another 34 inch LG ultra wide on the
homemade desk we have the Razer
Deathstalker
the Death Adder and the Logitech MX
master for his Mac setup we also have a
pair of course sir SP 2500 gaming
speakers and a blue Yeti mic off to the
left side next to his pc which by the
way is rocking a 4770k
and an EVGA GTX 770 excellent work with
cable management all the wires are off
the ground and they are neatly routed
across the roof of the desk and into a
power strip no complaints here I did
however notice that you have a few
remotes laying around and I would
suggest a drawer that you can install on
your desk to store miscellaneous items
like that
if there's space on there there also the
mic seems to be a bit far from your
monitors a simple fix to this is to pick
up a road boom arm and hook it up to the
desk behind your monitors now if you
don't want to hook them up to your desk
you can actually attach it to the
monitor arm instead like a few people
have done on setup Wars not only will
this look a lot cleaner since it's
technically not touching a table but you
will also have a much easier access to
it for recording audio I also like to
portrait paintings on the wall that
definitely adds some personality to your
setup but thank you so much Gregory for
entering next up is Jonathan with a
massive 43 inch vizio 4k TV sitting on
top of another homemade desk with some
acoustic foams in the back on the desk
we have a co prism keyboard logitech
g502 mouse and a rode nt1 mic hooked up
to the newer boom arm there's definitely
a lot going on here there's the halo 5
collector's edition items off to the
left side a halo 5 metal or Gundam model
which I'm sure took you long as time to
put together and finally we have a
pretty cool r2d2 applica underneath the
desk this thing actually looks pretty
legit I wonder if it does anything on
the right side we have an MSI prestige
gaming laptop sitting on top of the Xbox
one and finally a set of four Harman
Kardon surround sound speakers
positioned around the set up cable
management looks pretty clean from what
I can see one cable is routed alongside
the floor and the rest are routed
against the roof of the desk and down to
the PC which by the way has a 3770k and
a gtx 750ti also props on modding a side
panel for one of the legs on the desk I
guess since you technically have a side
panel you don't really need a side panel
on the actual case itself I mean it's
not the cleanest job I've ever seen but
it's not bad either
a pretty dope setup overall thank you
John for an entering finishing up the
episode we have Josh and his very
minimalistic setup a single 29 inch LG
monitor and a razer blackwidow keyboard
with a
Rapp who Mouse other than that we have a
phone stand holding up the iPhone a fake
IKEA plant and one badass-looking Walter
White ready to kick some ass but what is
that in his hand is that that meth so
you guys might be wondering where is the
PC well Josh decided to occupy an entire
cabinet just for his PC seriously
there's like nothing else in there the
specs he has in there however is the
5820k processor 16 gigs of Dominator
Platinum's and msi gtx 970 the wall
definitely needs some cleaning but cable
management does seem very organized we
have a Signum up top and a bunch of zip
ties keeping the wires together also a
plus one adding the USB hub under the
table as well I would recommend the
cable box for your dresser just to hide
the wireless routers and power strip but
I'm sure you don't care since none of
that is visible anyways when the door is
shut that's pretty much it though there
doesn't seem to be a consistent color
scheme going on here but overall a very
clean and straightforward setup well
aside from that dirty wall Thank You
