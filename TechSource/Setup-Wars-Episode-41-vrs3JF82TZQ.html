setup wars already has over 200,000
views you guys that's crazy and it's
only been out for a week I think that's
gonna be like the most-watched episode
on setup wars eventually and you guys
have like the best sense of humor it's
really cool for you to like relax not
take things seriously and have a laugh
with me while watching the video but
those are upset at me for doing a video
all that to say is don't take life too
seriously it's you know sometimes it's
okay to let loose and have fun I even
said in the beginning of the video which
I think a lot of people missed was don't
take anything I say in the video
seriously because I'm doing it for fun
but I get it I mean there are people out
there that just don't know how to have
fun but since most of you guys really
enjoy that episode I decided to bring
back the worst set up Edition and I'm
going to be doing it every 10 episode so
the next one will be set up for is
episode 50 so if you guys are excited
make sure to leave a like alright I
think this is officially the longest
intro for a set up or so without wasting
any more time let the setup wars begin
as always everyone's gear for their
setups will be linked down below as well
as anything I recommend in this episode
so that's it here are your five lucky
contestants we have Erik Jamal Johnny
low can use Minh congratulations for
making it to set-up wars episode 41
starting the show we have Eric and his
very clean dual display set up on top of
the Alex add-on unit we also have 2 a 3
20 3 inch monitors a Razer BlackWidow
chroma keyboard and coarser mousepad
cable management is on point with that
Signum rack and the PC powering this
setup has a 4790k that's overclocked to
4.4 and a GTX 970 GPU inside the fan
takes and through case the thing about
these simple minimalistic setups is that
they don't have a lot going on and it's
pretty easy to keep it clean
looks like you got everything under
control nothing I can really recommend
thank you Eric for entering next up we
have Jamal and his single 32 inch HP
monitor setup that's resting on top of a
monitor stand that he created by using a
shelf and two optical drives
I'm impressed already beneath that we
have the Razer BlackWidow stealth
keyboard and Logitech G 6500 Mouse on
top of the Goliath is extended mousepad
we also have a pair of Logitech Z 4
speakers near the back and a SteelSeries
h headset resting on the monitor cable
management is pretty good from what I
can see I'm not sure what that white
piece of furniture is doing there but
I'm assume it's helping keep the wires
hidden the PC that's powering the setup
has a 4690k paired with a gigabyte gtx
card unfortunately he didn't write down
which card it is so I don't know what
that is really clean setup overall I got
nothing to recommend Thank You Jamal for
entering Johnny is next up with two
24-inch BenQ monitors a logitech
wireless keyboard and Logitech MX
wireless mouse also no desk we have some
mattifier c6 xD speakers a blue Yeti mic
and a 12 South MacBook stand off to the
right side off to the left of that setup
you have a 32 inch sony bravia tv and on
the opposite side we have an ancient Mac
that he uses mainly for looks underneath
the desk we have an Xbox one with a
controller charging dock and cable
management is not the best but you do
have a lot of crap connected so I won't
give you any hate regardless every
situation can be
I'm glad you at least use some type of
Raceway to run the wire through and a
rack to keep most of that stuff off of
the ground I was like the fact that you
mounted your AppleTV against the alux
drawer and the same with the other side
we have several battery chargers and an
EBL charging Bay which by the way if you
guys missed my cool tag of December you
need to watch it because these things
are rechargeable batteries and they are
awesome
I'll have a link below if anyone is
interested I also noticed you have a USB
extension on your desk which is used to
connect your MX master receiver since
there's really no point in having that
in plain view what you can do is add
some 3m tape on the bottom of that and
stick it either behind your monitors or
better yet under your desk another thing
you can do is pick up a drawer that you
can install on your desk to keep your
tablet and other miscellaneous stuff
that you don't use often there's
definitely a lot going on but overall a
really sweet setup Thank You Johnny for
entering loke is next up with a triple
modern setup mounted against the wall we
have three issues 24-inch monitors a
Razer BlackWidow chroma keyboard and
naga chroma mouse the speakers are the
Hitachi a XM 137 s and to complete the
razor setup we have a razer kraken pro
chroma headset we also have the audio
technica at2020 mic hooked up to the
road boom arm and I really like what you
did with the monitor cables hiding them
on the top means that you don't have a
lot of wires running down to the floor
pretty good job with cable management
under the desk although there are some
wires still hanging around the PC that's
powering the setup has AG 32:58 that's
overclocked to 4 gigahertz and a gtx 960
okay first off you can get that cpu
easily to four point three gigahertz
especially with that cooler and secondly
you should probably move that graphics
card to the first PCIe slot for slightly
more performance not sure what a random
box with power beats is doing on your
desk but maybe put that on a shelf or
somewhere away from your actual setup
and since you have a wire running on
your desk for your headset a brainwaves
trust hanger would work really well with
your setup but I thought I got you have
a really sweet setup thank you look for
entering use man is next up with a white
and black set up a 23 inch Samsung
monitor
razor-like hosted gaming keyboard and a
Death Adder chroma Mouse on top of the
white extended mouse pad from glorious
we also have a pair of jec speakers and
for some reason an extra set of keyboard
and mouse resting near the monitor
really
great job with cable management good
choice on that spiral wrap I feel like
that not only looks a lot better than
regular black cables but also matches
your setup the PC that's powering the
setup is a 5820k paired with a gtx 980ti
and i'm glad you went with the white
sleeves but please move that GPU to the
top PCI slot like I mentioned before
you're not maxing out the performance of
that build other than removing that
extra keyboard and mouse from the desk
and maybe grabbing a pair of bad ass
white headphones for your setup I think
that you are pretty much set Thank You
