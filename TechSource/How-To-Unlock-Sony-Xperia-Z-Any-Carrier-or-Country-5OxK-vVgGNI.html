and today I'm going to show you how to
unlock your Sony Xperia Z smartphone so
you can use it on any carrier or country
you like for this demonstration I am
going to use a locked t-mobile Xperia Z
and unlock it so I can use it on my AT&amp;amp;T
network so first off we need to get the
unlock code for the phone before you
proceed with the unlocking procedure one
of the best unlocking sites that are
currently available is the unlocking
company and I always use them for my
unlocking needs because of their low
prices and really quick delivery speeds
so head on over to the unlocking company
once you're there you're going to be
selecting your phone manufacturer and
the phone model from the drop-down list
once you do that select get unlocking
code which will take you to the next
step which is to select what country you
purchase the phone from as well as the
carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it from the United States and
the carrier is t-mobile you will need
the phone's IMEI number to continue and
I'm going to show you how to look it up
on your phone once you open up your dial
pad enter in star pound zero six pound
and the number will immediately show up
and you will need to enter that on the
website to continue make sure you select
the correct currency for your country
before moving on to the next step so
once you select get unlocking code and
checkout securely with PayPal they will
email you the code the price and time
vary depending on the phone but they do
guarantee that you are getting the
lowest price and the fastest delivery
times once you receive your code via
email it's time to unlock your phone so
before we continue make sure that the
phone is powered off go ahead and remove
the SIM tray located on the side of the
phone and insert the SIM card that you
wish to use with the phone if your SIM
card is a different size then you have
to adjust it in order for it to fit I
have provided you with a link in the
description section to show you how
that's done after you insert the SIM
tray back into the phone go ahead and
power on your phone once the phone
powers up it will ask you to enter in
the lock pin and this is where you enter
the unlock code that you received via
email once you input the code and hit
unlock your phone becomes unlocked and
you can begin using it immediately as
you can see here it is a t-mobile phone
that now runs on AT&amp;amp;T
