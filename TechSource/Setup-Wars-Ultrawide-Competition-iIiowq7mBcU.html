source and I got a pretty cool treat for
you guys today
LG has partnered once again with me and
they're sponsoring a pretty cool contest
where they're going to be giving away
not one or two or three or even four but
wait nevermind they're doing four for
ultra light monitors - the winners of
the setup board's budget edition
episodes one two three all the way to
episode 106 I'm actually done something
like this before with them I think over
a year ago between episode 60 and 70 I
believe for those longtime followers out
there by basically there's going to be
four episodes and of course four winners
now I'm going to be doing this only for
the budget Edition because it just makes
sense these are four I want to ward
these ultra wide monitors to people who
actually need to upgrade their setup so
people who have multi-monitor setups or
even have ultralight setups already
unfortunately I will not accept those
submissions and of course you guys get
to decide on who takes home the ultra
light monitors I have nothing to do with
deciding on the winner but anyways
there's going to be four or five
monitors two different versions actually
the first two are the 34 you see 97g
gaming monitors which i did a video on
so be sure to check that out in case you
guys missed it and as 144 Hertz refresh
rate one millisecond motion blur
reduction with AMD freesync and it's a
curved 2560 by 1080p IPS panel the other
two monitors are the 34 um 88 which is
mostly for productivity with its 34 40
by 1440p quad HD IPS display 5
millisecond response time and a 60 Hertz
refresh rate so you guys actually get
the option to choose which monitor you
want to enter for now because I already
submitted your setup in the past few
months or recently even you guys can
also submit them again just for this
competition but this time make sure to
write down ultra wide or LG ultra light
Edition in the subject line so that I
can bundle all of you guys together
because this is a separate competition
instead of the usual set of fours that I
do every single Monday if you do when
the ultrawide monitor all I ask for you
to do is take a picture of your new
setup using the new ultra Lite monitor
and send it to me that way I can post it
on my Instagram
cap instructions to enter are very
simple it's basically the same
instructions as my previous one I'll
drop a link to it down below remember
guys please send me high-quality
pictures shoot them a landscape make
sure the lighting is perfect I prefer
you guys do this in daylight of course
so you can take advantage of the Sun and
send me in ten pictures as well anyways
all the instructions are in the video
make sure you guys follow that as
basically a huge thanks to LG for
reaching out and sponsoring this amazing
contest I'm very excited to check your
setup see you guys that is it thank you
so much for watching I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
