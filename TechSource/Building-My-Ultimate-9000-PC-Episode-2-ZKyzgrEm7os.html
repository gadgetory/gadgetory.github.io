even been months since I've worked on my
personal PC personal piece personal
personal computer so yeah if you guys
catch my first video on building my own
personal rig we ran into some issues
I'll leave a link below but this is
basically episode two the continuation
of building my very own custom
water-cooled PC as you guys can see we
started off doing an air-cooled version
well somewhat air-cooled because we are
using an AI air cooler obviously but the
GPUs are air cooled so now what we're
gonna do is take apart this entire PC
build the case that I'm gonna be putting
it in and basically swap all the parts
in here with the ek parts as well so
there's gonna be a full custom loop PC
and if you guys are new to the channel
you've gotta subscribe because it's
gonna be an epic build and I will
promise you guys that much the weight is
definitely gonna be worth it so anyways
I'm not gonna bore you guys by putting
together this case because I think I'll
take me about an hour there's so many
freakin pieces
it's like assembling IKEA furniture but
once I put together the hex gear r40 I
will come right back and we will
officially begin a bit
this video is sponsored by Dollar Shave
Club I'm sure you guys are sick of
overpaying for razors or having to wait
for someone to open up the razor section
and even then there are so many options
to choose from it's ridiculous
well this stops now thanks to Dollar
Shave Club for a limited time they are
basically giving away their starter set
to new members for only $5 the starter
set features an executive razor and
three trial size versions of their most
popular products that help you stay
fresh and clean in the first box you
will receive their shea butter body wash
and butt wipes which smell incredible by
the way I know the words smelling
incredible and but shouldn't be in the
same sentence however this is an
exception you also get their executive
razor which includes their premium
handle and a full cassette of cartridges
after the first box replacement
cartridges are sent for only a few bucks
a month this sounds like an awesome deal
that's because it's available for a
limited time exclusively at
dollarshaveclub.com/tekzilla and I'll
job a link below so make sure you guys
go and check them out
dollarshaveclub.com slash Texas if
putting together Legos is a1 and
building a rocket ship is a ten I would
say assembling this case is a nine point
five the only reason it's not a ten it's
because it's not an actual rocket guys
there's a reason why it's not available
in the US and I don't see a lot of
people building inside it it is a pain
in the ass to put this together there
are so many things that aren't designed
well I guess it's not seeing see machine
perfectly there are some holes that just
don't align perfectly even some parts of
the acrylic pieces I had to drill my own
hole just to make it big enough to screw
in the bolts so yeah very very difficult
case to work with every wasn't so damn
sexy and clean I would have tossed this
out the window already and went back to
the H 700 I believe it or not but
anyways it is what it is I finally
finally put it together and now let's
continue on with the actual build so but
with that said it is going to be a
multi-part series so if you're new to
the channel make sure to hit that
subscribe button because you're gonna
see me fail continuously already it's
like the second episode and I would have
troubles with the case so it's gonna be
an interesting ride to say the least as
you guys can see we took apart the
motherboard
and as well as the two GPUs from the
previous case all the other components
are taken out
now we're gonna basically convert this
into a water-cooled build and we are
doing hardline as well so it's gonna be
very very interesting build so anyways
it's going to take off the CPU and clean
it real quick because it's got the
previous I almost forgot the name of it
thermal paste so this is the 79 80 XC
guys is an 18 core processor and this is
actually the lidded thanks to Steven
from gamers Nexus so it's gonna perform
a lot better temps are gonna be better
which means I can push the overclock on
it further than a stock 79 ATX see if
that makes any sense so yeah very
excited to see how much I can push on
this once it's water-cooled but anyways
oh yeah let me clean this thing actually
it's mofo
you know what I've noticed this thermal
paste is so harder to clean this is from
thermal grizzly by the way guys I guess
that's why it works better than other
thermal paste all right beautiful I
guess the next step would be to put on
the CPU block so let's start off with
that I really wish I was able to use a
model block for this because I really do
want to cool the VRMs
which is gonna help it overclocking
obviously and thermals but there is no
available model block for the x2 99 from
msi unfortunately so I'm gonna have to
use a basic CPU block from ek it sucks
but you know there's nothing I can do if
I were to use a different X 299
motherboard I think I think ek those
have available model blocks but I don't
want to use any of those on motherboards
this is the one I want to use for my
build because of the features that it
comes with this one was actually RGB as
well so it's gonna light up I don't know
I think the inside area we're just gonna
look really cool
you guys know me I like to spread my
thermal paste I do not like doing the P
dot method I was loving when people in
the comments I liked do you're putting
way too much thermal paste in your on
your CPU and I'm like welcome to the
channel first of all have you not seen
my other previous builds I've built like
a hundred computers and I've never well
I've stopped doing the P dot method so
you guys can relax in the comments
section alright I think I know at this
point I think I know what I'm kind of
doing these aren't even spinning keep
spinning in place I don't know why I
keep spinning in place is this did they
send me the wrong water block
AMD why did it not say that on the
actual box just as waterblock
they sent me an AMD one guys okay it
makes sense now the way the screws on
going in because it's for the mother AMD
motherboard you might have to go with
the original original cpu block that
they sent me in the first package at
this point there's no going back guys I
don't want to have to go and order and
wait again I'm already doing my build so
I'm just gonna use whatever I have yep
it's going in alright so that definitely
fit so unfortunate we're gonna have to
go with the non RGB version which I'm ok
with long as it works that's only really
that's honestly the only difference
between that one and this one is one
lights up and the other one doesn't and
one fits and the other one doesn't so
yeah I don't care let's just move on
so ladies and gentlemen upon further
investigation I realized I don't have
any fans for the build the only thing I
have is this beautiful commander Pro and
a few 140 millimeter fans which don't
even fit in this case so I'm gonna have
to request some from course sir
which means which means I won't be able
to do a lot for this episode so if
you're watching this video that means I
somehow mustered enough content to
upload it on the channel but anyways I
think I'll probably just hook up the
power supply I'll hook up the reservoir
and see what else I can do oh oh yeah
and put on the GPU block so I think that
will be enough for part 1 or I should
say episode what episode is episode 2
episode 2 so yeah ladies and gentlemen
let's go ahead and put together the GPU
blocks whereas my babies yeah the twins
right over here you guys three from EVGA
of course unfortunately we'll take these
precious aparts and put on the GPU
blocks which must be in this box over
here alright so actually I think we have
for GPU blocks there's only two that I'm
gonna be using actually which i think is
the nickel plexi what do you see which
one that is
I hope there's two plates in here
because I'm missing
nope there is one and that's to be in
here somewhere
let's figure out which keep you block
I'm gonna be using let's pop this open
one Matt one because there's an old
black one and then there's a clear one I
want to use the one that's clear because
it looks the sexiest yes there you go
this is what I'm talking about what I'm
using two of these bad boys so just have
to find the other one
yep on the second one right over here so
this was the original one that was sent
to me what stuff does the same one okay
I think they sent me two extra by
accidents let me double check as that is
not supposed to happen oh yeah I guess I
guess they did
they sent me two extra ones what what
the heck is happening here okay I guess
I'll be up doing away because I'm not
gonna use them and I don't want to go
through the hassle of selling them so if
you guys want a GPU block for an EVGA
1080 TI FTW 3 card let me know by
dropping a comment stating specifically
that you want the GPU block and drop a
like on the video because I'm only gonna
select the people that want the GPU
block please don't insert a giveaway if
you guys aren't gonna use it and this is
us only so please please please then
again I might I might then again I'm
sure there's people out there gonna
enter to get it and sell it anyways
there's a there's a lot of Phillips out
there so whatever you guys want just let
me know in the comments section because
I do have two extra ones you can only
request one you can't have both though
so before I put on the back plate on the
GPU I have to put the GPU bracket on
there first but I do want a custom paint
both of these to read and I picked up
some paint from Home Depot
so we'll go downstairs actually paint
these and paint a few other things as
well so yeah that's let's go so we're
gonna do the reservoir mounting bracket
red PCI brackets red a GPU bracket red
and the m2 shields were actually gonna
paint in white so apparently there's
something going on with the pieces here
that it's not letting me paint over it
as you guys can see there's some white
spots on the PCI brackets and even the
reservoir mounting brackets so I don't
know what that is exactly why it's
preventing me from painting it's too
late to go back yeah so I'll try and add
in a few more coats
maybe that solves the issue otherwise we
might have to stand everything down and
try again because I have no idea what
these random white spots are like I
would paint over it and then it would
slowly come back up I don't know why
it's just weird I've never actually
experienced this before I don't know if
it's a type of metal or maybe there was
something on it but these are all clean
I cleaned them before I brought them
down here so I was gonna continue
painting the other stuff and then we're
gonna leave these to dry overnight and
it'll come back tomorrow check on them
all right so while we wait for the paint
to dry we're gonna hook up the power
supply and then probably come back
tomorrow and continue the build but for
you guys is gonna be only one video the
power supply is actually in an
interesting spot in this case it's in
the front and the fat it's gonna be
facing inside so it's gonna be popped
right over here so there's our two
things I can do to the power supply
option number one is I can add a power
supply cover that pretty much covers
this entire side or option number two I
can just skin the power supply or paint
it
so I can skin this side white or red and
I can paint the grills and this side
white or red the only reason why I'm
aiming towards option one is because let
me show you guys a side panel there's
not that many bezels as you guys can see
is only maybe about an inch and a half
on each side so if I were to cover the
front of the case you're still gonna see
the power supply and the rest of the
cables on here so that is why I really
want to just build a power supply cover
to cover this entire side over here
probably in white just so it goes to the
build and that way I can cover up the
power supply and all the cables so I
think that's what I will probably do so
in the meantime I guess we can hook up
the power supply hook up all the cables
that way I can use that and then measure
around it to see what exactly or how big
the power supply cover is going to be
you guys remember did an unboxing video
I did receive a an acrylic bender so
it's actually be the first time I'll be
using that and yeah it should be very
interesting and fun to see me actually
been the acrylic for the first time but
anyways let's go to hook up the power
supply
all right time to hook up the cables
these are from kala mod got the sexy
white and red pattern with the aluminum
white kala comb this is gonna look
really sick in this build these are
actually the replacement cables they
sent me because if you guys watched part
one the cables were the reason why my
computer wasn't running on it wasn't the
power supply so yeah I'm hoping that
these actually worked because I haven't
tested them but I trust in the cable mod
so yeah I should say I trust in cable
mod now
I know I told you guys I was gonna hook
up to SSDs and raid0 for my storage but
I think I'm just gonna do one two
terabyte SSD from a WD because two of
them is overkill because I already have
two one terabyte MDOT twos from Samsung
so I think that's gonna be plenty plus I
can use this as storage and the main
reason actually is because I have an 8
terabyte external storage device from
Seagate that I'm using to store most of
my files so that is why I don't to
bombard this PC with that much storage
space which I'm not gonna even use in
the first place to be honest of course I
got to go with a red SATA cable let's
look at this up I don't know where
exactly this is connected to it's
probably somewhere in the back let me
flip this over
all right I think it hooks up to here or
something I'm not really sure it goes in
like that but the only issue is I would
even stall them on the board how the
hell am I gonna screw it in from the
other side oh Jesus
oh I guess I can take the support I
didn't think these screws apart actually
mount the SSD on here and then mount it
back on so that's actually an easy fix
all right let's mount those closer to
the bottom because the SATA ports on the
motherboard are closer on the bottom so
they'll be easier to reach so somewhere
like this you know what I'm just
realizing look how much space I have to
work with for cable management it's
gonna be a pain in the ass
there wasn't any cable grommets there
wasn't any zip ties tie-downs I mean
it's gonna be a challenge to say the
least
oh oh so what do you guys think about go
cool trend stick mode let me know what
your feedback is in the comment section
I think looks like a pretty badass mural
painting to have in the background of my
videos but let me know what you guys
think I feel like it's a little too
distracting but halfway through the
video I feel like you guys would get
used to it all right here we go so
that's there put this back on here
all right so this is what the build
currently is looking like we had a bumpy
start but honestly I think we're finally
back on track we're still waiting for
the paint to dry for the graphics card
and a few other parts of the case in the
meantime I'm gonna order the fans so
that will be here hopefully in the next
few days and we can jump on that install
a radiators a reservoir all that's good
stuff so we're gonna go in and cut to
the next day and take a look at our
paint job so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
