and welcome to setup wars episode with
84 where you submit your desk setup to
get featured on the channel if you guys
want to participate make sure to watch
the video linked down below and before I
start this episode I'm gonna be doing a
few things differently here on setup
wars and also on the channel for
starters you guys have early access to
my setup wars and also a bunch of other
videos on youtube a few days sometimes
even a week early on my nice channel and
again guys it's a free app you don't
have to pay for anything to get early
access you can also browse through
products on there add some items to your
wishlist and even get notified on some
deals that you guys see sometimes on my
videos like cool tech or even setup wars
and a bunch of other videos that I do on
tech source I feel like the best way to
explain the app is basically if Amazon
had a baby with YouTube the nice app
would be the baby and the second
announcement is that now I'll be hosting
a giveaway on every single one of setup
wars starting today and to enter it's
very simple guys once you have the nice
app all you have to do is like some
products featured on each episode of
setup wars and add them to your wishlist
and depending on what you have on your
wish list you will win one of those
prizes I will randomly pick five winners
on each episode and I'll announce it via
the app with push notifications which is
a new feature they added on the app
recently what's also cool about this app
is that I can actually send you guys a
push notification not only announcing
the winner of the giveaway each week but
also the winner of setup wars as well so
you don't have to check my Instagram or
Twitter for any of that so if you guys
want to participate in these weekly
giveaways make sure to download the app
again it's completely free you guys
don't have to pay for anything so yeah
with that said and done let's go ahead
and start the show
if you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2
a.com because they have the cheapest CD
keys available for pretty much any game
I'll drop a link to him down below if
you want to check it out so starting up
the episode we have Christian and a
really sick black and red setup he's
rocking an ASIS 28 inch g-sync monitor
that's sitting on top of the black IKEA
make a desk which he added some white
vinyl to I gotta say that looks way
better and the contrast makes everything
on the desk pop good choice
he is also using a Razer BlackWidow
chroma keyboard a Razer Tartarus chroma
as well and a Mad Catz rat 7 Mouse on
top of the Razer Firefly mousepad for
audio he is using the Sennheiser PC 350
headset and a pair of can Tobin speakers
which complements the set up really
nicely
speaking of complimenting the set up
take a look at this beast wall mounted
PC it's equipped with a 6700 K and an
msi gtx 1070 and finally we got the
cable management not bad at all
looks like you use the Omni mount cable
sleeve to wrap and hide the cables near
the bottom excellent work the only
things I recommend to this setup is a
headphone hanger for your headset to
keep it hidden behind your monitor and
also a webcam mount for your webcam so
that way it's not just sitting on your
desk I'm guessing it doesn't fit on top
of your monitor which is why you left it
on the desk so this mouth will actually
help you keep the surface area cleaner a
very dope black-and-red setup Thank You
Christian for entering next up we have
Edwin with a very clean black and blue
setup so he's hooked up the LG 34 inch
ultra wide on your monitor arm and right
above that is the Pioneer sound bar the
desk looks pretty dope according to
Edwin it's custom made but I would love
to know where you picked up the tabletop
from for peripherals he has the Razer
BlackWidow chroma and a DeathAdder
chroma on top of another Razer Firefly
that's like two setups already with
Razer gear there's not much else on the
desk other than a plant and a phone
stand of course we have the PC as well
which has a 6400 and a gigabyte gtx 960
surprisingly it's water-cooled as well
he does have a tranche on vintage
microphone hiding off to the side when
he is not using it and below the desk
key mounted and Anchor USB hub and the
rest of the cable
very clean job with the cable management
there just overall a very clean set up
as well
Thank You Edwin for entering jumping
into multi-monitor setups we have Joshua
up next with three 24-inch LG monitors a
habbit keyboard and a cursor m65 Pro RGB
mouse on top of the reflex lab mouse pad
he also has a couple of Star Wars
figurines and a salt lamp for that mood
lighting and according to some articles
I found it can actually help reduce
allergy and asthma symptoms amongst
other things like improving mood
concentration and even better sleep it's
usually had no idea about any of this so
I actually picked one up for myself to
test it out cable management is also
pretty good all the wires are off the
ground and stored inside the rack so no
complaints here this part looks a bit
familiar from my previous perfect setups
looks like hooked up a USB hub and
routed the cloud to headphone cable
through here as well the PC that's
pushing all these pixels has a 4770k and
an EVGA GTX 1074 to win the set up
doesn't really have a theme nor does it
have any personality but it's put
together nicely and if that's all you
care about then more power to you looks
like you're a fan of Star Wars so
personally that was my setup I would add
a Star Wars mural right above your setup
I actually found a few badass ones on
eBay
and I'll have a link down below if you
want to check them out but actually
pretty cheap - a very nice setup indeed
Thank You Joshua for entering changing
things up we have a dual setup from lock
an rog inspired setup i should say this
room looks badass I'm definitely loving
that custom ROG plaque on the wall and
that's not the only piece - there's a
custom piece hanging right above the
couch and their ceiling are you kidding
me right now you can even change the
colors like wow alright so back to the
actual setup the left one has a 27-inch
asus rog swift monitor corsair k70
rapid-fire RGB keyboard and of course an
asus rog spatha mouse on top of the
Firefly mousepad data setup also has a
27-inch asus monitor but it's a slightly
different model and for peripherals he's
rocking a Corsair strafe RGB
Asus Gladius Mouse on top of an Asus RGB
wet stone mousepad I think that's how
you say I'm not sure if he shares this
setup with a sibling or if he's using
two setups for two different things
since you didn't clarify that in the
notes aside from all the cool in
this room I think the custom desk is
probably the coolest cable management on
the other hand is not so cool it can
definitely be improved with a channel
raceway that you can hook up on at a
desk with lots of 3m tape to keep stuff
off of the ground
PC number one is rocketing 68 50 K
overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz and an asus
rog Strix 10 80 with 32 gigs of ram
while pc number 2 has a 50 20 k also
overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz and an asus
strix 1060 i guess you only took a
picture of one of the pcs i mean what
can I say I'm definitely loving this rog
themed gaming room i think you guys did
an awesome job on all the custom work
and this is definitely worthy of a seal
of approval had you perfected the cable
management regardless thank you lock for
entering finishing up the episode we
have sama and his minimalistic setup
being powered by a 13-inch MacBook Pro
is rockin a 27-inch Asus monitor that's
in between some Sony speakers he's also
running a wireless setup using the Apple
magic keyboard and mouse I also liked
how he kept it symmetrical as well by
putting an award plaque on each side of
the desk Sava has also added a hook to
hold his lightning cable on the right
side and an anchor USB hub on the left
I'm not sure what the switch is for
maybe for the RGB lights but it's in a
very convenient place I don't see any
wires so I have nothing bad to say on
the cable management but overall a very
simple and clean setup no doubt Thank
You sama for entering so that is it for
this episode I've set up for it soon
guys so much for watching make sure to
drop your comments down below and vote
on who you think has the best desk setup
actually in the near future the nice app
will have a voting system so you guys
can actually go on there and check out
the real-time votes on each setup so
we're gonna be rolling that really soon
sometime in January so make sure you
guys stick around thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
