this is galih Dex the $5,800 ultimate
gaming and editing PC featuring Intel's
new 6950 x10 core processor and two GTX
1080s
and sli I wanted to do something a
little different than my usual PC builds
for each month so I decided to go with a
white and green build and add some
custom work to spice things up the most
important piece for this build to come
to life was the case I've been a huge
fan of NZXT for a long time and the
white s340 case was perfect for the type
of build I was going for a super compact
size with tons of space inside to fit
practically anything I wanted I also
loved the cable management areas making
my job extremely easy it's hard to
believe that you can get a case this
gorgeous with amazing durability for
such a low cost if you guys want to
check out the case for yourself I'll
drop a link down below along with the
rest of the parts are used for this
build for cooling I went with the
coarser h100 IV - a i/o cooler and added
a few coarser fans with the white rings
to match the color scheme I also
replaced the stock radiator fans with
Corsairs sp1 20s for ram I went with 32
gigs of Coursera's Dominator Platinum's
rated with a speed of 20 400 megahertz
and for storage I have one 400 gigabyte
Intel 750 series PCIe SSD
with ridiculous read and write speeds I
also have a 4 terabyte hard drive from
Western Digital and finally to 512
gigabyte the Samsung 850 pros which are
configured and raid 0 connecting all of
these parts together is none other than
the Asus x99 deluxe 2 motherboard with
white accents and RGB lighting powering
this entire PC is the courser ax 1200
eye power supply which is a little bit
overkill but then again what isn't in
this build every aspect of the PC was
carefully planned and I made sure to pay
attention to all the small details I cut
up some white carbon fiber venial and
skinned both of the SSDs so that it
blends in with the rest of the color
scheme the rest of the green areas were
painted using engine enamel paint which
won't come off during high temperatures
it's also resistant to scratches and
won't wear off any time
the most helpful tip I can give you guys
if you're going to paint your PC parts
is stay away from Plasti Dip I made the
mistake of using that in the past and it
was a complete disaster this type of
paint is more permanent but the results
are a hundred times better there are a
lot of parts that were painted like the
PCIe SSD the side of the radiator SSD
trays and RAM sticks along with the sli
bridge and the brackets for the PCIe
power supply and CPU coolers so yeah
lots and lots of paint was used even
with all that the bill just want to be
complete without the amazing custom
sleeves from the guys at and sourced
these are not extensions they're
actually full-length power supply cables
which is great when it comes to cable as
wrap because you don't have all that
extra clutter what I love about these
aside from the amazing quality is the
fact that you can fully customize the
colors and choose between a white or
black cable comb and connectors which I
thought was pretty sweet they also have
sleeving for both molex and SATA power
which is awesome I've used many custom
sleeves before but these are hands-down
the best I have seen yet if you guys are
looking into getting some custom
sleeping for your PC make sure to check
these guys out I highly recommend them
I'll drop a link to their website down
below and finally the last piece to this
amazing build are the back plates that I
picked up from v1 Tech I'm sure you guys
I've heard of them already I've used
them plenty of times in my previous
build and they do excellent work when it
comes to custom parts they may customize
leverages fangirls back plates along
with other amazing stuff so be sure to
check them out as well and I'll drop a
link to them down below so let's talk
performance not only is this PC
extremely quiet it's also a monster when
it comes to editing video I overclocked
it to 4.3 gigahertz and I managed to
render out a 60 second 4k video file in
just under a minute and 30 seconds for
productivity this thing is a beast for
gaming well that's another story
let's just say I can play GTA 5 maxed
out and 4k resolution and achieve over
100 FPS so yeah this PC is pretty much
future proof for a long long time the
only thing I'm going to switch up with
in the next few weeks is the second GPU
placement right now it's not getting
enough airflow since the SSD is blocking
the fan so I picked up a 2 slot as the
light bridge from
video which will give me the option of
moving a bottom GPU up one more slot
this way the card will get plenty of
airflow resulting in lower temps so that
will do for this video if you guys
really like the PC and enjoy these
monthly PC bills make sure to leave a
like to show your support and I will be
doing at our X 480 crossfire build
sometime in August so make sure you guys
are subscribed if you don't want to miss
out it's basically it as always thing
guys so much for your support and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
