guys is that back again from tech source
and welcome to setup wars episode 28 we
used to mate your desk setup to get
featured on that channel if you're new
to the series and want to submit your
setup make sure to watch the video
linked down below with all that said and
done let the setup wars begin never pay
full price for games ever again guys g2a
offers the cheapest cd-keys you can find
anywhere check them out by clicking on
the link below as always everyone's gear
for their setups will be linked down
below as well as anything I recommend in
this episode so here are your 5 lucky
contestants we have axel douglas eric
joey and kenneth congratulations for
making it to set-up wars episode 28
first up is axel with a triple display
setup we have three del 23 inch monitors
which are hooked up to the mounted
articulating arm on the desk we have a
wireless Logitech and mouse combo and an
s7 15 I portable iPhone speaker dock in
the center minimalism at its finest
great work with cable management and I
see that you have the rack underneath to
keep some stuff on I also like the USB
hub you have attached to the desk
you know it's small things like these
that make me really happy to see job
well done on this very clean setup axle
thank you for entering this next setup
is in the same room as Amber's from
episode 23 of setup wars I believe
Douglas is her boyfriend but moving on
we have three asus 24-inch monitors
hooked up to the Ergo tech triple desk
stand we have a corsair k70 RGB keyboard
and a Logitech g600 wireless gaming
mouse on the coarser mm 600 mouse pad we
also have a dope black and red gaming
chair from VX racer and a pair of astro
a40 s hanging from one of the monitors
this is a pretty sweet setup for co-op
games and I remember having something
like this back in a day when me my
brother were playing Warcraft 3
definitely some good times we also have
an Xbox one with a headphone amp right
next to it and just like amber I'm gonna
go ahead and recommend an Akers
headphone stand if you don't like to
keep your headphones on your desk and
instead have them hanging from the side
of your monitors but other than that
it's a really clean and sweet setup
Thank You Douglas for entering next up
we have Eric and his dual 24 inch dual
monitor setup on the desk we have the
Razer BlackWidow chroma key board and a
Logitech MX Performance Mouse I got to
stop real quick and say that the monitor
wallpapers are Baus a quick tip for
everyone that's entering a set up
competition wallpapers play an important
role in press
believe it or not it just brings
everything together so the next time you
decide to submit a set up think twice
about what you're displaying on those
monitors great work with cable
management I don't have any complaints
at all and I think that this is a very
clean set up indeed thank you Eric for
entering Joey is next up with a single
display setup we have one crossover for
o4k 40 inch 4k display why pick me while
I say that one on the desk and a
Roseville RK 9000 keyboard a Razer Naga
Mouse on top of Eagle is extended
mousepad we also have some speakers for
Logitech and some sine the basketballs
by Memphis Grizzlies mark Tony and
Lorenzen I probably butcher the crap out
of the name it definitely adds some
personality to the entire set up key
management is not bad it seems like you
hit the cables behind your PC and
speaking of pcs let's address that beast
little quick so what we have here is a
custom loop PC built by Joey running a
59 60 X at 4.6 gigahertz and 2 EVGA
Titan exits you might find a good taste
so the case is custom made by this
company in the UK called parvum and that
looks pretty damn cool definitely a
beast PC you got there you do need to
submit this for PC Wars pronto you know
I was just talking about wallpapers and
I feel like this setup would have looked
even more badass with a black and green
wallpaper but nonetheless you have a
pretty badass setup thank you joy for
entering last but not least we have
Kenneth a single 25 inch LG monitor a cm
storm quick fire keyboard Logitech MX
mouse and some Harman Kardon sound
sticks after the left we can see that
beats Mixr headphones and a custom
hangar made from a rubbermaid hose hook
I see that you're a fan of Justin Muller
facets as well definitely have some good
taste
other desk we have some other stuff
including an iPad 2 with the looks up to
tablet stand a 1968 Corvette model and
an HP 13 inch laptop there are quite a
few items on your desk but you have
everything organized and cable
management is clean as well great setup
