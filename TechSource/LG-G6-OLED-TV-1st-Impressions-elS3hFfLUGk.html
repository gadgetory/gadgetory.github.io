this video we're going to be taking a
look at LG's new g 60 LED TV with a
better viewing experience ultra vivid
LED colors and dolby HDR technology this
is probably the best image I've seen
from my TV ever the g6 has a bunch of
new hardware and software improvements
over the previous models of this TV
including better near black uniformity
more than a mag range and higher peak
brightness at 800 nits coming from last
year's 450 other features also include
OS 3.0 and probably the most interesting
for me Dolby vision HDR now HDR isn't
new to the TV market place but LG's new
lineup of TVs are the first with Dolby
HDR which basically analyzes the image
from scene to scene and uses metadata to
create an image that represents what a
director intended to be seen you really
have to see this TV in person to
experience the quality it produces the
g6 comes with two remotes one is a
standard remote with all the options you
need to mess around with a TV and it
even has a scroll wheel to navigate
anything that can be scrolled through
vertically the smaller more simpler
remote strips away all the extra buttons
and just leaves you with some main
controls like volume channel and input
taking a look at the newer sleeker web
OS 3.0 we can see that LG really put
some time into making it more
user-friendly all of the apps are
displayed very unobtrusively and you can
even now pin your favorite shows to the
left of the main interface and the TV
will automatically tell you where you
can watch these shows I can't wait to
get this in-house so I can do more
testing but so far this thing is turning
out to be one of the best tvs I have
ever seen but I'll do for this video
thank you guys so much for watching and
as always I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
