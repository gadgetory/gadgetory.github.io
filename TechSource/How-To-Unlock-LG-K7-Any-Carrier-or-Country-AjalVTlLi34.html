here to show you the process of
unlocking your LG k7 smartphone so you
can use it with any GSM carrier in the
world for this demonstration I will be
using my locked k7 and unlock it so I
can use it on my AT&amp;amp;T network but it's
the exact same process for any carrier
from any country so head on over to the
unlocking comedy comm and select your
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop-down list and on the next
page go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is t-mobile before
we continue we need the IMEI number of
the phone and the way you look that up
is to open up the dial pad and enter and
star pound zero six pound once the phone
displays the number you have to go back
on the website and enter that in once
everything is filled out slept get a
locking code and that will take you to
the final screen where you have to
checkout once you receive your unlock
code from your locking company it's time
to unlock the phone but before we
continue make sure that the phone is
powered off go ahead and remove the
backplate so you can gain access to the
SIM tray then you have to put in the SIM
card you want to use with the phone I
want to use the k7 on my eighteenth
network so I'm putting in my AT&amp;amp;T SIM
card if your SIM card doesn't fit then
you have to adjust the size in order for
it to work there is a link down below to
show you how that's done once the SIM
card is in place put back the backplate
and boot it up once the phone boots up
it will take you to the SIM unlock page
and this is where you enter the unlock
code that you received from your locking
company after any putting in the code
and hitting a lock you will get a
message stating that the unlock was
successful and the phone will take you
straight to the home screen and your
phone becomes permanently unlocked
please note that some newer devices
locks the US carriers are now remotely
unlocked so if it doesn't prompt for a
code then don't worry because the
unlocking company can still unlock it
without a problem so that's how you
unlock your LG k7 for any GSM carrier in
the world if this video helped you guys
out feel free leave a like and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
