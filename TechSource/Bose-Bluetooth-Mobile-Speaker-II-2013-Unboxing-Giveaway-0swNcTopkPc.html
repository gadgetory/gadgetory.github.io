another unboxing slash giveaway today we
are doing the new Bose Soundlink two
wireless speakers so let's get started
so this is the bluetooth mobile speaker
to sounding from bose and this is the
Nightline Edition which goes for $2.99
it's also available in a limited edition
and a leather edition both which are
priced at 349 each so let's take a look
at a few features on the side of the box
the new sound link has improved audio
performance compared to the last gens
model it obviously connects your
Bluetooth devices the battery is
rechargeable and it even has this cool
integrated by fault cover to add some
protection to your speaker as well as
it's serving as a stand it's very light
compact and really convenient to carry
around because it's only five point four
inches tall making it effortless to hold
it in one hand now there's not much
inside the box despite it being large it
only contains the speaker itself a dark
grey nylon cover which is attached to
the speaker and one power supply
honestly I expected a bunch of more
stuff with the price that I was paying
like maybe even a cool carrying case
would have been awesome but
unfortunately that's what it comes with
moving on with the unboxing let's get
this opened up and check out the
contents of the speaker first and
foremost you are greeted with the
unnecessary paperwork as always you have
your manual here it's really
straightforward how to operate this and
we'll show you how soon next you have
your warranty info let's go and toss
this aside and remove this cardboard
piece covering the speakers I'm gonna go
ahead and put this aside for now and
we'll take a closer look at it in a bit
and the last thing you'll find buried
down here is the power supply which of
course is needed to power and charge the
speaker itself I would love to compare
this to a jam box honestly which is like
half the price in size I would like to
see how well the jam box stands against
the sound link so if you guys want me to
do a comparison just hit the like button
below which tells me that you are
interested and I'll definitely upload a
video soon so you can see here that it
does easily fit in my hand I do have
somewhat larger hands but I'm sure it's
not much of a difference to everyone
else
the nylon cover does feel really great
in your hand and it does also provide
for a nice grip for the speaker's if you
pull on this tab here the cover comes
right off making the speaker's visible
and you can even fold alike this into a
stand which is super easy to do and you
are ready to go
overall I gotta say I'm impressed with
the build quality and how convenient it
is carrying it around I think Bose did a
good job on this wireless speaker which
is why we are going to do a quick review
on it and you will see the link at the
end of the video if you guys do want to
check it out looking at the back of the
device you will find your auxiliary port
your service port which is a mini USB
port to connect your
Peter to download the latest updates and
last but not least your charging port
now if you look at the top of the
speakers you will find all the necessary
controls you will need to operate this
first stop is your power button then you
have your auxiliary control Bluetooth
your mute button and of course your
volume controls at the end like I said
it's really straightforward you don't
even have to read the manual to get this
going so here's how it works you first
turn on the speaker by pressing the
power button then you get your Bluetooth
device in this case is the nexus 4 and
you navigate to your Bluetooth settings
page and make sure it's switched on once
you see on the list and click on the to
pair the device you can play music or
even watch a video in this case it's one
of the videos from the tech source that
wraps up this unboxing thank you for
watching and if you guys want to win a
some amazing speaker all you have to do
subscribe comment like the video and
favorite the video as well so once you
guys do all that sit back and relax
until I noun s' the winner on August
31st this is the tech source and we'll
see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
