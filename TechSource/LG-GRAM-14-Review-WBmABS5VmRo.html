also an i5 processor and the latest in
connectivity technology the LG gram 14
it seems to be an impressive package and
after a week of heavy use it definitely
grew on me so welcome to my review of
the LG gram 14 laptop in the world of
extremely portable computing there could
be only one that takes the title as the
lightest and most powerful and LG has
their eyes set on the drone with the
Graham 14 with a slogan like lighter
than air we can pretty much assume that
LG made a gram 14 to be a direct
competitor to the MacBook Air and we're
looking at the hardware differences
there really is no comparison they both
have i5 CPUs from Intel but the Graham
14 has a higher base clock than that on
the MacBook Air the grand 14 also comes
stock with 8 gigabytes of RAM compared
to the 4 from the MacBook but the most
notable difference is the increase in
screen size and decrease in weight all
while having the same size form factor
oh did I mention that they both start at
the same price around $1000 so as far as
value goes I'm have to give this one to
the gram 14 it's nice to see that LG
didn't skimp on the port's with this
laptop on the right side we've got a USB
3.0 port a micro USB port that turns
into an Ethernet port with the provided
dongle we also have a headphone out port
with a built-in DAC as well as a micro
SD card slot on the left side we've got
our power in another USB 3.0 port and a
full-sized HDMI port and some indicator
lights I really like how they included a
full size HDMI port here instead of one
of those annoying mini ones because it's
more convenient just plugging this thing
straight into a TV or monitor and
extending or duplicating that display I
was surprised at the grand 14 handled
outputting to a 1080p display while
staying lag free when I was watching
videos and working how LG was able to
get this laptop so light was by using
carbon and lithium magnesium but that
being said there are some negatives that
come with a build of this laptop there
is a good amount of flex in certain
parts of the laptop but when using a
normally you won't really notice it but
it's definitely something I should
mention the trackpad on the LG 14 is
nice and responsive but the construction
just doesn't feel up to par
when using the trackpad you can actually
feel it snapping in and out and I don't
know if this was a conscious design
choice but it's there and I find it
slightly annoying it's definitely not
the best trackpad out there but it will
get the job done I would however
recommend using a mouse with this laptop
the keyboard on the other hand is great
the distance of travel between the key
presses are very small and there is no
lag when typing the only complaint I
have with the keys is that there is no
backlighting which means that typing at
night will be slightly annoying on the
bottom of the laptop there are four
rubber feet that will do a great job of
keeping this laptop stationary when you
are using it so you won't have to worry
about this thing sliding around the LG
grab has a 14 inch full HD 1080p IPS
display which makes for very nice
viewing angles and vibrant colors I wish
you would have brighter options since
using the laptop in a bright room or on
a sunny day outside proved to be a
challenge under the monitor is the 1.3
megapixel HD camera so the camera on the
LG gran
14 is HD which is 720p and by the looks
of it I mean it's doable if you're going
to Skype with someone on FaceTime but it
isn't the crispiest I've seen that's for
sure one thing that could use
improvement are the speakers they don't
really get loud at all and the richness
of sound is lacking as well but here
take a listen for yourself
the model I have here is the i5 version
that comes with a 128 gigabyte up SSD
storage space but if you guys want you
can opt for the i7 model that starts at
$1,400 and comes with an upgraded 256
gigabytes of SSD space there is also a
13-inch model available for $900 if you
wanted something smaller than 14 inches
I loaded up here is of storm just to see
how this Ultrabook would handle some
light gaming and not to say I'm
impressed I did have to lower the
settings to low to achieve this but if
you're looking for something that can
handle lighter games then this laptop
has you covered just don't expect to
load any triple-a games on here as far
as software we get Windows 10 pre-loaded
on the gram 14 which is my favorite
version of Windows by far we also get
what LG is calling quick instant booting
which basically means that the computer
starts up fast now let's talk about the
battery the grand 14 has a 45 55 million
power battery and LG claims you can get
7.5 hours of use now I got around 3
hours of usage and that's from listening
to music some light gaming and other few
tasks you can definitely max out at 7
hours of use if you stick to web
browsing or streaming music another
notable feature is the built-in DAC
which is actually pretty great if you
like me like listening to music when
you're doing homework or working then
you will definitely be able to
appreciate the richer sound when
compared to a laptop that doesn't have a
DAC built-in the headphone jack overall
the LG gram 14 is a great laptop and a
great buy for anyone that's looking for
a super lightweight ultra portable
machine its power to body weight ratio
is ridiculous and even being able to
play heroes of the storm on something
that weighs less than 1 liter of water
is insane it could use some improvements
however in the battery department as
well as the trackpad but overall I give
this my two thumbs up well guys that
pretty much wraps up the review on the
LG 14 I want to give a huge shout out to
LG for setting this over for me to
review and as always I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
