was actually checking out the previous
vlog footage and it was disgusting so
basically it's very shaky the autofocus
sucks see guys saw that so I did some
researching and I purchased a new camera
set and that's what this is it arrived
today let's go ahead and check out and
see who exactly came with the package I
got a pretty good deal about on Amazon
I'll double link below in case you guys
want to check it out yourself
but this is the a 6500 it comes it's
pretty cool the Royal pause looking
black in my side body I just set my
monitor I'm sorry we've got a little
tiny camera back we also got a high
quality dust cleaner blower quick
release camera shoulder straps who got
close-up micro lenses that is
interesting 49 millimeters wow that is
really close photos it comes with a 3
piece filter kit that's pretty cool
64 gig SD card little brochure about the
photo and oh hello there
universal wireless remote control this
is a lens cleaner kit which I already
have one spare rechargeable batteries to
the Sony a 65 hundred who's got a slave
flash doesn't sound right
slave flash and of course we've got B
6500 itself this is the basic lens that
I usually comes with push you can buy
one without the lens kit but this is the
55 to 210 millimeter X 4.5 so we also
included two other lenses they are both
primes is a 19 millimeter that's 2.8 and
then you got the 30 millimeter of course
they're both actually from the art
series so that's pretty cool
I can with a sense these out and
actually switch over to the 6500 now and
continue this vlog because I'll use that
code and get $15 off your next purchase
from my website check feel free my good
news
so this is everything guys this is the
entire package that I picked up I'll
drop a link to the exact same kit down
below I think it was around $1,900 which
is actually a pretty good deal
considering you're getting two really
awesome lengths or three lenses plus the
camera and a bunch of accessories to
come with so pretty good deal I picked
up can't wait to test it out the best
small the 6500 is compared to my first
let me 4.6 get that is ridiculous huge
difference so yeah guys this is the
final shot I'm using with the g7 and I'm
going to switch to the a 6500 right now
welcome to the a 6500 let me know what
you guys think about the quality
difference between the g7 and a 6500 in
the comments section below allow me oh
it's pretty obvious what the mood winner
is but I'm also going to walk around let
me know what you think about the optical
image stabilization it's got a 5 axis
gimbal built-in so I think if you love
smoother to us for sure so pretty big
package just arrived let's check out and
see what exactly it is well pretty
obvious where it is actually if there's
TV so check it out go check it out and
see what it is right right
little little friend no okay okay
as soon as I put it down I just read
this there was cooking outside probably
the best way to unbox the TV but it's
been done so this is LG's new nano cell
technology TV it's a 55 inch and do a
pretty cool video with there so I'm
pretty certain so there's a few things I
want to do today the first one is I want
to fix up my filming this so with this
current setup is really difficult
recording with my heavy Ursa rig because
I have to constantly increase the height
of the tripod and lower it every time I
need to get some specific shots because
as you guys can see the thirstiest set
like this it's not height adjustable as
much as I love this surface I need a
just about desk but I got to thinking
why not just buy an adjustable base and
then mount this on it so that is what I
did I picked it up and I think it
arrived yesterday so I'm going to go to
install that so a things to swing over
here this long one is pretty heavy so
enough to bring that upstairs and enter
that's basically this is the electric
height adjustable desk frame that I
picked up from a vivo scene as the
company's name
so think the best route is to take it
out of the box and take the pieces in
here and assemble it in here because the
doorway is very small and I don't think
I can get that through there once it's
done that means I have to take apart the
desk I don't know what on earth I'm
going to be doing with the Alex yours
may be all sitting in the other room for
now but I'll keep the surface of the
desk here for now clean up the stuff in
the back and yeah it's going to be a
long day
so here's only the things that I liked
about the adjustable desk gives you the
option to adjust the width depending on
the width of your desk so the tabletop
over here is actually about 74 inches
wide so I need something that's going to
support this entire length so obviously
want to expand this one just a bit so it
kind of reaches most of the tabletop so
yeah that was a quick turnaround now
back to the g7 already but we got a
project to do let's finish up is dead
right so I'm pretty much done so far I'm
happy with the way it turned out the
build quality is really solid and the
instructions are very easy so I will
give them props on that I no problems at
all putting this together the best part
about this actually if you are going to
install it it will obviously install the
tabletop is that they even provide you
guys with the screws to do it so I
thought I didn't go to Lowe's and pick
up screws for this but nope guys I just
finished making the desk and this thing
is amazing honestly I really want to
make a video on this because this is
literally the best adjustable desk that
I've ever used and let me show you guys
why so compare the sound of this
standing desk
- the one I'm using right now that's
pretty loud medical thing about this
desk is that you can actually see that
current height which i think is an
inches curling's or ninety point five
inches and it's got a memory module so
you guys can program up to three
specific height that you need so for
example I programmed one already for
number two so basically for press number
two it goes all the way to the top so
obviously the next step is to work on
the cable management there is a bunch of
wires hanging loose and also got a hook
up that power strip in the corner and
hook up my RGB lights which I've added
in the back I can show you guys real
quick and here are the RGB lights in the
back so I got hook all of this up stick
them underneath the desk and clean up
the bottom real quick and the cable
management is done ladies and gentlemen
with the help of some cable clips and
velcro straps and 3m tape I was able to
finish this in just about 30 minutes but
I'll show you guys what it looks like
underneath as you can see I hooked up
the power strip and all the wires are
ran and kept up using the cable clips so
yeah very clean of course there is an
adjustable desk so there has to be at
least one cable getting plugged in to
the power outlet my final verdict with
the adjustable base it is completely
worth it every single penny it's also
got really high reviews which is one of
the reasons why I bought this one
instead of the apex one and the best
part is you guys can choose what surface
you want on the actual base itself so
you can shop around and IKEA pick the
one that actually matches your setup
matches your color scheme so that is
honestly an awesome trade-off it's a bit
pricey but you definitely are getting
what you pay for and I'm actually think
about picking up a few more of these for
my office so these also just came in
from Ikea I quickly assembled them these
are the hector LED lamps or hectar lamps
I guess I did pick up two of them and
help me shoot video as you can see the
lights in there are not white I replace
both of them with lie fix bugs and and I
can control them using my smartphone so
I got them labeled as filming lights on
here as you can see and I can control
the light on both of them which is
really sweet so I think I'm gonna have
to vlog here guys I've done a lot of
work today and I'm very exhausted
there's still a lot more to do I haven't
even started my PC build I'm seriously
like two three weeks behind but
hopefully I can do that Saturday and
obviously I'll show you guys a behind
the scenes of how I shoot my time-lapse
videos as well as my benchmarking but
anyways if you guys enjoy my vlogs let
me know by leaving a like and if you
guys don't like the vlog stupid dislike
and I'll see you in the next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
