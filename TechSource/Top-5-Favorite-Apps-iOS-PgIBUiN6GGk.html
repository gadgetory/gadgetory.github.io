tech source and in this video I'm gonna
show you my top 5 favorite apps on my
iPhone right now I'm not gonna be naming
any basic apps like Twitter YouTube or
Instagram because most of you guys
already know what those are so instead
I'm gonna be showing off the apps I use
daily that aren't as popular all the
apps featured in this video are either
free or have a free version in the App
Store so without wasting any more time
let's begin the first step we're going
to talk about is after ship now you guys
can trust me when I say I receive and
send out a lot of packages on a weekly
basis and having an app that
conveniently tracks all of my packages
is a must for me once you add your
tracking number you can see the packages
full history it scheduled delivery date
as well as being able to share the
tracking easily from within the app the
next step we're gonna talk about is
rainbow key now let's face it the iPhone
stock keyboard sucks pretty bad which is
why I use this third-party keyboard app
it does come with a good amount of
pre-made themes but what's cool about
the rainbow key is that you can make
your own themes from scratch you can
choose your own background or upload one
from your phone change the button shape
and style along with the font and color
you also have access to change the
layout straight from the keyboard and
also access to other styles of font and
settings I personally use the lightning
pre-made theme because I like the
animation when pressing a key next up we
have up flicks this app is essential if
you're a Netflix user honestly I love
Netflix but their interface is horrible
and I can never find any new content to
watch because their search system isn't
the best but with this app you don't
have to deal with any of that you can
easily see what's released new on
Netflix on a daily basis as well as
being able to search for specific actors
in the film or even specific directors
but the feature that I probably like the
most is roulette which as the name
suggests gives you a random movie based
on a genre and a minimum rating this is
basically a Flixter for Netflix musi as
the next app we're going to be talking
about is probably my most used app it
allows you to search for content on
YouTube and have a convenient playlist
of music you can play in the background
like the normal music app from Apple
this is really convenient because you no
longer have to leave your screen on
whenever you want to listen to some
music on you
- it works in the background even after
minimizing lastly we have YouTube studio
and this app is a must for any content
creator out there on YouTube this is a
convenient way to respond to
commentaries and engage with fans as
well as being an easy way to stay up to
date with all of your analytics this app
also allows you to edit some aspects of
an already uploaded video straight from
your phone all these features combined
makes it really easy for me and any
youtuber to keep on top of their channel
even when on the go one of the main
reasons why I'm so active with you guys
in the comments section is because I
spent a few hours each day constantly
checking my phone and responding to
comments straight from the app YouTube
studio is my most used app followed by
Twitter and Instagram well there you
have it these are the apps I use
constantly every single day on my iPhone
if there are any cool apps for iOS or
Android that you guys recommend for me
to check out then let me know by
dropping a comment down below so I can
add that to my list and possibly feature
that in an upcoming top 5 apps video
that I'll be starting on the channel
which leads me to my next question if
you guys would love to see a top 5 apps
of the month video on my channel for
both Android and iOS then hit that like
button and let me know in the comments
section down below thanks again for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
