welcome to my gaming PC buying guide for
the upcoming holidays I am making this
video in mid-november so by the time
you're watching it the prices have
either increased or decreased so please
keep that in mind also make sure you
guys are checking dual source tech
because it's gonna be crazy packed with
deals during the holidays I'm talking
pages and pages of PC hardware that are
going on sale so if you guys want to
save some money on tech make sure you're
bookmarking via source not tech I'm
gonna be giving you guys my personal
recommendation for two very powerful
budget gaming pcs on their $700 we're
gonna be doing one for Intel and one for
AMD and both these pcs will get you
60fps maxed out settings and 1080p for
most triple-a titles out there and fact
I'm actually gonna be building one of
these PCs and benchmarking it for
December and I want you guys to vote
using a strop holding below which one of
these pcs you want me to build and
benchmark and also maybe even do a build
guide the Intel PC or the rise in PC let
me know guys vote alright so let's click
off the video by looking at the rising
build so I'm gonna be going with the
rising 3 1200 which is a 3.1 gigahertz
quad-core processor that can easily be
overclocked to 3.9 gigahertz or if
you're lucky enough a 4 gigahertz clock
speed just using the stock cooler the
value you get out of the CPU after
overclocking is why it's so popular and
that is why I've included it in this
build we don't have to spend any money
on the cooler since the stock heatsink
is good enough but we do need a solid
motherboard that supports overclocking
right now the asrock AV 350 M has the
best value out there for risin that goes
for only $60 but I'm actually gonna be
going with the MSI B 350 M for only $20
more because this board is much better
and more reliable
based on my experience between these two
boards I've had way more luck with the
MSI the overclocking is more stable it's
more reliable compared to the asrock and
I think I've built three pcs using the
azrog a B 350 M and all three times I've
run into problems using that board now
I'm not saying that the boards
I'm sure a lot of people out there have
actual positive experiences with asrock
and for $60 it's actually a really good
deal but I'd rather spend extra $20 and
get a better motherboard oh and also the
MSI be 350 M supports faster memory
speeds for RAM I went with eight gigs
rated at twenty four hundred megahertz
because there will be little to no gain
by going with faster rated RAM sticks
twenty four hundred megahertz is the
sweet spot for Rison and I went with
team Vulcan this time around because of
the price and color scheme ddr4 prices
right now are all over the place and
currently these are the best ones that
fit the budget and color scheme for
storage we're going with the usual one
terabyte from WD however you can add any
other type of storage you like so for
example if you want add SSDs or I'm not
to drive you are welcome to do that
for the graphics card I picked up his
attack GTX 1060 mini which is the six
gigabyte variant and this card will
pretty much handle anything you throw at
it in max settings in 1080p when
compared to the rx 580 they're actually
both neck-and-neck this card isn't that
much better but looking at overall
performance the 1060 does come out on
top it's also the most affordable 1060
available at the time of purchase coming
in at only $240 but I guess it's back up
to the original price of $260 which is
still the lowest price next to EVGA both
of these cards are going for $260 the
EVGA does have a slightly higher boost
clock and in case they raise the prices
of the zotac 1060 again I'll leave a
link to the EVGA version as well
powering the build is a 450 watt power
supply from EVGA
and the case we are going to use cost
only $27 and it also has a clear side
panel with four USB ports two of which
are USB 3 and it comes with two fans
pre-installed we got a 1/2 20 millimeter
fan in the front and an 80 millimeter
rear fan for $26 and free shipping this
is really hard to be the entire build
will cost you a little under $650 and
it's one of the best budget gaming PC's
you can build to achieve 1080p gaming
and high settings this next build is
very similar we're going to be using the
same graphics card the same power supply
and storage
however we're going with a different CPU
and the total build is gonna cost around
$80 more so we're going with the new i3
8100 quad-core CPU it is a locked
processor with no hyper threading or
turbo clock however does feature for
physical cores and clock speed of 3.6
gigahertz which should hurt through
games without a problem
it is a locked CPU which means that we
can stick with the stock cooler since we
can't overclock anyways and since this
is a coffee like CPU we do need a Z 370
board and currently the most affordable
option is from MSI it features two PCI
by 16 slots it also has four dimm slots
and that to support an eight USB 3 ports
in the back it has all the essentials
for a low-end a Z 370 board and in the
near future if you guys ever want to
upgrade it to an unlocked CPU and
overclock it you can do that easily with
this board now for RAM I'm actually
going to be using the g.skill ripjaws 5
instead of the Patriots because these
have a higher clock speed 3200 megahertz
compared to 2400 and according to
benchmarks everywhere the i3 8100 shows
a noticeable performance increase with
faster memory you can see potentially up
to 10% more FPS going with the 32
hundred megahertz compared to a 20 400
megahertz rated memory stick and I'll go
ahead and drop a link to this article
below if you guys want to see the full
benchmarks finally the case we are using
is the DIY pcp 48 just to change things
up a bit
it's a white mid tower chassis with a
closed side panel but it does feature a
front panel USB 3.0 port and it can
support up to three hard drives and two
SSDs
the entire build will cost you a little
over $700 as always I'll leave a link to
everything down below so yeah guys those
are my two personal recommendations for
budget build in fact these are the pcs I
would build for a friend or relative if
they had a budget of around $700 it's
definitely hard to beat but let me know
guys again vote using the scroll polling
which one of these pcs you want me to
physically build and do a benchmark the
intel or the Rison build let me know by
clicking that strawpoll link and voting
as well as in the comment section
let me know if you guys want to see a
build guide because I haven't done one
of those in a long time so I think I'd
be a pretty cool package for December
again I think I so much for watching I
love your faces I will see you in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
