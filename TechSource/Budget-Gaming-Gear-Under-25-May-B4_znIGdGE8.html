and welcome to my new series on the
channel another freakin series yay right
basically go and find budget gaming gear
under a certain dollar amount and I
share my experience with you whether
it's good or bad
and I best part about this episode is
that you guys can try these products out
for free using the app called nice and
I'm sure you guys have heard me talk
about it in the past you guys can try
the products up for free if you don't
like it send it back for free and that's
basically it I'll jump a link to the app
down below if you guys want to check it
out without wasting any more time let's
begin so Before we jump into PC gaming
gear I wanted to share this pretty cool
charging dock for the ps4 that I found
it features green blue and red LEDs that
pulsate and they're only visible in low
lights and even then they're actually
not that bright so I think the room has
to be completely dark in order for you
guys to see it but what's cool about
this dock is that it can charge both of
your controllers at the same time using
only one USB port which is located on
the side if the light on the controller
pulsates orange it means that it's still
charging and if no light shows up then
it means the controller is fully charged
by the way if you guys want to pick up
some dope skins for your consoles like I
have then be sure to check out the first
link below next up on the list is the
red dragon central forest Gaming Mouse
most of you guys have seen this featured
before but I included it in this video
simply because this is one of the best
budget gaming mice for the money
it features a 2,000 dpi sensor with a
dedicated button up top to cycle through
the different dpi modes and it also has
two programmable buttons on the side
even though this mouse is for both left
and right-handed users due to the
symmetrical design left-handed users
would find it difficult to use since
there are no back and four buttons on
the right side of the mouse with that
said the construction is solid and
features red LEDs and no I did not
choose this mouse because its red and
black it's personally one of my favorite
budget mice out there the mouse also
comes with replaceable weights to give
you the resistance you desire during
gaming and speaking of gaming the
responsiveness was OnPoint and they
don't really notice any lag while
playing the division
and it slides really well on my mousepad
and overall extremely comfortable to
grip
I do wish it was a bit larger though
since my large hands completely devoured
a mouse but it's not something that
really bothers me next up on the list is
the Ola gaming keyboard that features
three backlit colors you get blue red
and purple you can also adjust the
brightness level by pressing a few
buttons as well as give it a pulsating
effect the entire construction the
keyboard is made out of plastic and it
feels a bit flimsy but they obviously
have to cut costs somewhere in order to
bring you guys something under $25 the
key caps have this semi matte gloss
finish whereas the faceplate of a
keyboard has a glossy finish which
easily picks up fingerprints so if you
don't have a person who eats Doritos and
uses a keyboard at the same time I would
think twice before picking this up this
keyboard kind of reminds me of the
Microsoft x4 Sidewinder with the super
short keys and comfortable yet silent
feedback it also comes with a set of
clear key caps in case you want to
replace the WASD and arrow keys overall
I don't really have any complaints other
than the wrist pad being smaller than I
would have liked for 25 bucks this is a
really solid budget gaming keyboard last
but not least we have the seeds as a 708
gaming headset that's compatible with
the Xbox one and PC it features red LEDs
and a mic which can be pulled out
whenever you need the build quality
isn't the best I mean everything is made
out of plastic and feels like it would
break if you don't take good care of
them but for sixteen dollars what more
can you expect the cushions on the other
hand are made out of PU leather and are
pretty soft
I played the division for about an hour
with these on and they didn't seem to
bother me despite it being a bit small
on my head the ear cups are also small
so expect them to rest on your ears
instead of completely surrounding them
surprisingly there was a good amount of
noise isolation but nothing too crazy
the sound quality also wasn't bad either
it's a bit heavy on the deep end with
decent mids and highs something I
noticed is that the volume doesn't go up
that loud I maxed it out on the remote
and achieve nothing near what I expected
on
gaming headset increasing the volume in
game would be strongly recommended
something to point out the USB is
actually needed to power on the LEDs so
if you want to use the mic and hear
sound you will need to use the other two
plugs here's what the mic sounds like
the Bologna jumped on the trampoline and
then fell off into the grass where the
dog ate it
overall this entire setup will cost you
around 60 bucks so if you want to try
all or even some of these out for free
make sure to download the app by
visiting the link below depending on how
many likes this video gets I will either
stop doing this series or I will
continue them but that will depend all
on you guys let me know what you think
by dropping a comment down below and as
always thank you so much for watching
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
