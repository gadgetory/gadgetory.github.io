numerous devices do you happen to know
anybody well I like so sinc I legit just
broke my glasses taking it off like that
they ask you how your you say that
you're fine you're not really fine you
just can't get into it because they
would never what's up guys is that from
tech source and it's that time with a
month again and no it's not that time of
the month you perverted perverted people
actually I can't even say that because
usually I do these every month but I
kind of went AWOL and I completely
forgot about the series to be honest but
anyways I reached out to Twitter and
asked you guys to send in your questions
and Here I am answering them in a video
if you guys want to participate make
sure to follow me on twatter let's begin
could you give me a PC well since you
asked so nicely No can you get the NZXT
s340 elite and do a build with it I

and it's sitting in a storage but I do
have a few other builds to get to before
I jump into the s340 elite sit tight any
tips on starting youtube looking to
start and give it a go very soon the
only tip I can tell you is just start go
with it and do not give up momentum
consistency is very important focus on
your content and just focus on the
consistency of the uploads not so much
quality I mean obviously shoot in at
least 1080p but you don't have to spend
$15,000 on a camera to shoot youtube
videos just focus on content and
consistency and you can watch your
channel grow if people like your content
they will subscribe if not well there's
always monster calm at what age did you
start YouTube and what were you always
planning on doing for a job parenthesis
what was your dream job so I mentioned
this a bunch of times but I worked for a
bank before I started YouTube and I was
actually working at a bank full time and
doing YouTube part-time for a good year
before I quit and started pursuing this
full-time actually February 2015 is when
I quit my bank job and
doing YouTube even before YouTube came
into the picture I always pictured
myself having an IT job or just
something to do with programming or
something to do with computers in
general and to answer your other
question I started doing YouTube and May
2013 so I was 25 when I started YouTube
what a convenient follow-up how old are
you I am now 28 my birthday is on April
8th 1988 by the way here's my p.o box in
case you guys want to send me some stuff
how big will your giveaway be when you
hit 1 million subs on YouTube Jason you
beautiful beautiful boy this giveaway is
gonna be massive I'm gonna have at least
10 prizes to give away maybe more so
yeah I can't wait for it it's gonna be
exciting hopefully by the end of
November
what does iPhone do that you can't find
in a comparable Android phone pumpkin
spice latte thank you for asking that
question
I think the best analogy I can use is
iPhone is like Sony Vegas Pro 13 and
then Android is like Adobe Premiere you
can do so much more with Adobe Premiere
then you can with iPhone but I like Sony
Vegas just because of the simplicity I
love how easy it is to use and how easy
it is to learn can you come to New
Hampshire so we can climb Mount
Monadnock Monadnock so we can climb
mount Madonna together
why not Scott why not where did you
learn everything you know about tech
from so that's actually a funny question
I learn everything that I know now all
from YouTube actually 90% of the stuff I
know is from YouTube the rest of the
stuff I just googled online I knew a lot
about tech but I didn't know too much
about tech if that kind of makes sense
so even before learning about building
pcs I learned by watching youtube videos
out of all your PC builds which is your
favorite hands-down I have to say Trigon
because it was just an interesting build
overall and it was really fun to build
will you lick a graphics card guys I
appreciate the random like questions
like these buzz try and stay on topic
and something to do with tech hey I
almost got you guys
how successful have your gains been in
the gym thank you so much for asking
those of you I don't know I started
working out again two weeks ago about
depending on when you're watching this
video and I've been bulking because I'm
extremely skinny and I lost I went down
from 194 pounds to 152 so I lost a lot
of weight and so far I've gained 5
pounds back so it's a slow progress
here's some of the gains preview as you
can see it's not it's not that big but
I'm getting there will you ever make a
draw my life video I actually had this
question asked many times and I think
the best time to do this is when I hit a
million subscribers so definitely
sometime November maybe you in December
if I have the time so but yeah I am
definitely planning on doing one of
these thank you for asking
will you ever make a set of words
episode as Deadpool I haven't even
thought about this for a long time but
those of you who are new to the channel
I did a very special episode of setup
wars episode 50 I will never forget that
in case you guys missed it check it out
it's an interesting episode but um yeah
I don't know I I feel like if I do
tadpole Deadpool if I do that pool that
I would make a joke out of myself I
don't think I can ever do a exact copy
of Deadpool so I think will be a
complete disaster so probably not maybe
a different person I don't know we'll
see are you ever going to do a black and
blue gaming PC bills
I've actually never done one I don't
think I've ever done a black and blue
bill then this actually always comes up

will not be spending five figures on a
camera anytime soon to do YouTube videos

subscribers just from using a gh4 and a
sigma lens so that kind of tells you a
lot about the camera gear it's not that
important when it comes to YouTube
