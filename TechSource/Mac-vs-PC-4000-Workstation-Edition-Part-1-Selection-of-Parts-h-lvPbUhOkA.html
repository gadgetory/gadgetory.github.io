possible by Squarespace what's up guys
ed here from Texas and it's finally time
we have received all of our parts for
the Mac versus PC projects what you see
here is $4,000 worth of workstation
parts for the PC build and once
completed we will be comparing it to the
$4,000 Mac Pro model to find out what
computer performs the best for the same
price the series will be split into five
videos this video which you are watching
is the introduction and selection of
parts the second video will be the
unboxing video of all the parts the
third video will be the build process
where we show you step-by-step on how to
build a workstation PC or just any PC in
general fourth and fifth videos will be
the comparison videos one of the videos
will have the PC running with Windows
8.1 while the Mac Pro runs
OSX Mavericks and the other video both
computers will run Windows 8.1 to make
sure we cover all ends of this
comparison so without further ado let's
introduce the parts let's start off with
the tower this is the fractal excel r2
and it's basically a larger version of
the define r4 which is the tower I used
for my custom PC this goes for 100 bucks
and we chose this case because we want
to go with a silent build after all the
Mac Pro is really quiet and we want to
match every aspect as close as possible
we could have bought a smaller Tower to
be comparable to the Mac Pro but we
opted for a bigger tower for future
expandability moving on to the
motherboard we went with the Asus p9 x79
WS and as the name implies the ws series
arm a TV workstation motherboards with
support for ECC memory LGA 2011 socket
support and Asus brand reliability the
p9 x79 was the best choice for the price
tag of 384 the graphics card we went
with the AMD FirePro
w 7000 we were debating whether or not
to go with workstation graphics cards
for this build
after all a gtx 780 Ti will easily beat
the performance of this card with some
tweaks the 780 Ti can also be recognized
as a workstation card and it can be used
with intense editing programs however we
did go with the
card to make this a fair comparison for
the process everyone with the best core
i7 processor you can buy today we bought
the Intel six core 49 60 X processor
because it's compatible with the LGA
2011 platform that the Mac is also based
on to keep being similar as well as it
being in our budget we could have bought
the 49 30 K in say 500 bucks I mean the
performance difference is only 8% but we
did have an extra room for 500 bucks
worth of parts so we decided to go with
the 49 60 X instead when it comes down
to power supply we have to go with a
trusted brand which is why we went with
the courser CX 750 m nothing special
here is 750 watts is plenty of power for
this build and for the price of 90 bucks
you really can't go wrong so the storage
in the Mac Pro is PCIe based which gives
an insane amount of read and write
speeds and that's why we had to go with
a o WC 240 gigabyte mercury excelsior
this goes for 400 bucks and it delivers
speeds up to eight hundred twenty
megabytes per second which gives us
similar performance to that of the Mac
Pro with a great price tag we went with
the Noctua NHD 14 CPU cooler because
it's pretty much the best air cooler you
can get your hands on in the market
doctor is well known for their quality
and ugly design in fact my current PC
uses all Noctua fans we picked this up
for 85 bucks and it's performance is
very close to that of the H 100 i but
with a smaller price tag this is a
silent cooler as well and can be used on
LGA 2011 CPUs and should keep things
nice and cool when we overclock the CPU
moving on to ram we went with 16
gigabytes of Crucial ram sticks because
these are rated for a speed of 1866
which is the highest natively supported
on the 4960 x we also wanted to keep the
comparison fair as the mac pro also uses
1866 weighted ram just like the mac pro
these are also ECC Ram sticks which
means that there is an extra chip on the
board itself that checks for errors and
reduces the amount of problems that a
computer can run into last but not least
we had to go with the latest operating
system for the PC so we went ahead and
picked up Windows 8 for just under 100
bucks so that is all the parts that we
are going to use for this build the
total comes out to 39 57
seventy-eight cents which is just below
the $39.99 price tag for the Mac part
that we are going to compare to you we
have listed all the parts that we use in
the description below for those of you
that are interested and I wanted to ask
you guys what you think about the parts
selected is there anything you guys
might have picked differently if so let
us know in the comments down below
also which system do you think will that
perform the other the Apple made
computer or our custom made PC you guys
don't want to miss out on this epic
conclusion so make sure to hit that
subscribe button if you haven't already
