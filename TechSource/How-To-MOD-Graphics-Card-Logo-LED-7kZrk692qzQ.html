gaming PC and you pick yourself up a
geforce gtx card but there's only one
problem the ugly green gtx logo does not
match your current build let's do
something about that so this video i'm
going to show you guys how you can
modify the green gtx logo into a white
one which virtually goes well with any
color scheme it's actually quite simple
so here's what you'll need to do to mod
your graphics card please note that
these apply to the nvidia geforce
reference cards so if you have a
different GPU then these steps may not
apply to you so you will need a fine
grit sandpaper the one i'm using in this
video is a 320 grit and by the way i
will leave links to all of these down
below i would recommend getting a sponge
version of the sandpaper like i did in
this video instead of the regular paper
version for convenience you will also
need two hex bits in the following sizes
and one phillips screwdriver with a very
small head first step is to place your
GPU on a flat surface i would recommend
putting it on some cardboard or
something similar so you don't damage
your graphics card oh and a disclaimer
before you start not only are you
voiding the warranty by doing this but
continue at your own risk i do not take
responsibility if you end up damaging
your card next step is to remove the
screws off of the GPU the four screws
around the fan required a smaller hex
bit and the four screws on the left
require the larger ones some of the
screws are glued in tight so you will
need some force to twist them out the
next set of screws you can remove are
from the sides there i total of two
silver screws holding the silver plate
on each side of the card after that
there are two more smaller screws near
the back of the GPU and two more in the
front that need to be removed once those
are all out you are ready to slide out
the piece with the word tighten on it so
gently raise it and slide it away from
the fan until it pops out completely
before we can remove the other piece
there are four tiny screws that need to
be removed first and that's where the
tiny head screwdriver comes in once all
four screws are removed gently raise the
final piece until it comes off but be
careful not to pull it out completely
grab something with a pointy edge and
push off the geforce logo from the metal
piece use the same tool to press against
the small
clip that's connecting the logo to the
GPU and pull it out now comes the fun
part this is going to take a while so
make sure to take lots of breaks and
don't overdo it
grab the sandpaper and start sending off
the green paint off of the logo do your
best to make sure it gets sanded off
evenly every five seconds stop and make
sure that you are not sending too much
you only supposed to scrape off the
green paint until you see white only if
you stand up too much you will start
seeing the black rubber part which means
it's time to stop feel free to fall the
sandpaper any way you like to scrape off
the letters that still have some green
on them it's okay if there are black
spots here and there the LEDs are strong
enough to shine through them so don't
worry too much about that it's a long
and tedious task especially when you
want left with some small green spots on
a few letters so after about 20 minutes
I managed to scrape off the majority of
the green paint and as you can see there
are still some green spots left over so
I went back into care of those once you
are satisfied with the outcome it's time
to put everything back together just
repeat the same process backwards and
put everything back the way it was in
the end you should have something that
looks similar to this the black spots
are normal it's pretty much impossible
to do a perfect job but once you hook it
up and power it on into your system it
will look immaculate so that's it for
the video if you guys enjoyed it make
sure to hit that like button especially
if you want to see more modding videos
like these in the near future and also
let me know in the comment section down
below if you want a detailed video on
how to custom paint your graphics cards
it's actually a really simple process
and I'll go ahead and do this for you if
you guys want to watch it but yeah let
me know by dropping a comment down below
and as always thank you so much for
watching I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
