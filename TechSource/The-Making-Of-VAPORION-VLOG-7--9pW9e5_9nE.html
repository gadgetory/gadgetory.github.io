build another PC all right so for the
case we're gonna go with the fractal
core 1000 CPU we're going to be using is
none other than the AMD x4 860 K it's
going to storerooms see what other parts
you can pick up yes I still haven't done
the shelves
I am slacking I have so many projects to
do that our priority right now um but I
will get to it I don't know where I put
my other stuff oh here we go
the sniper ram from g.skill 500 watts of
goodness see what's in this box
oh there we go I guess we'll use this
for the GPU got a sapphire vapor-x
online 270x they should do just fine and
then the motherboard we can use
gigabytes
f2a 8:8 XM d3h lots of you guys ask me
what I do my PC parts everything why is
that missing so a lot of guys have been
asking me what I do my PC after I'm done
building them I take them apart and I
put them in the storage unit until I
need to use the parts again for another
PC build so yeah that's what I do
there you have a ladies and gentlemen
and that right there is the 450 dollar
budget PC build for the month of
December I know I'm supposed to get this
out for November but other pilots came
and I had to get those done came at the
cheese so it's not time to put the parts
together and I'm gonna be filming the
time-lapse build like I do on all my PC
builds you guys seem to like that stuff
so I'll continue to do that and then
after that it will be the benchmarks
video and then the how to build videos
so yeah that the budget builds always
have to be videos the time lapse the
benchmarks and the how to build in case
you guys want to buy the parts and do it
yourself will there be a giveaway I
don't know so a budget builds are a bit
trickier to do in the sense that have to
do the time-lapse build and then they
help to build guide at the same time so
while I'm doing the time-lapse build I
have to stop slow down and then get some
close-up shots to use for the how to
build guide so it does take longer to do
much longer than the ultimate gaming pcs
right just do the time-lapse build put
it together in the new the benchmark so
yeah it's never fun doing these guys but
I do it because you guys like watching
them so let's do this
all right so far everything is going
great I just finished putting in the
motherboard the RAM sticks and CPU
heatsink so now I'm going to do is just
screw in the motherboard into the case
and I can finish up with the power
supply grab his card hard drive and that
thing that's basically it go to power
this bad boy and do the benchmarks just
a quick tip on anyone that's building
pcs it's always a good idea to pick up a
power supply testing unit like this I
picked this one up way too late after
receiving like two or three dead power
supplies just made my life so much
easier
testing it before I actually begin the
build so I'll leave a link down below
one where you guys can pick it up but
I'll show you real quick on how easy it
is to use this so it's quite easy to get
this set up all you do is make sure the
power supply is hooked up to the wall
make sure it's off of course and then
you can be plugging and the 24 pin
connector on one side and then your
other motherboard either 4 pin 6 or 8
pin on the other side depending on what
the power supply you have so everything
is hooked up turn on the power supply
and then you just look at the display
and make sure all the numbers are
correct that's come with a piece of
paper basically telling you guys what
numbers look for or what codes to look
for if your power supply is not
functioning correctly so basically if it
shows LL or HH on LCD then basically the
power supply is not running correctly
and it's going to make sure that the
power supply is delivering enough
voltage as you can see the ranges are
listed here we have based on everything
uh functioning normally of course
because I tested this before so yeah
let's move on with the build
taking a break will quick and eating
some delicious cake that Brianne made
for me
guys it's finally here the final two
pieces to finish up my acoustic wall god
damn it
looks like I need another freakin gray
one to finish this ah I swear it's like
an endless battle I'll never win so just
notice I'm shooting a time-lapse video
of me shooting a time-lapse video of the
PC build time my perception
Vaporeon is now complete now it's time
for the fun part
the cable management so it's looking
pretty good so far it's gonna split up
the cables a bit got my trusty little
spinning table turntable thing on the
bottom to help with cable management a
lot of you has been asking me where I
got this alright I get this from and
I'll go to leave a link down below but I
picked it up from Amazon it makes
building pcs so much easier because I
can turn them around basically and work
on the cables we also all of the parts
for this will be linked down below if
you guys want to check out what parts
I'm using for the PC if you haven't seen
my PC build already here we go is the
first ever boot three two one
whoa did you see that boot speed that
was ridiculous crazy-fast boot up speeds
for Vaporeon way faster than Zeon or any
other PC I've built
alright so love the games and drivers
have been downloaded and updated the
only thing else left to do is basically
run the games and do the gaming
benchmark but it's getting late now so
I'm going to leave that for tomorrow and
I'm gonna go and end this vlog but
actually I want to show you guys
something real quick look how quiet the
PC is right now I'm going to shut up for
a second this is how it this is how
quiet it is on idle mode pretty damn
impressive especially with the stock
heatsink way more quiet than big red
over there
speaking of big red I guess I'll give
you an update since I'm talking about it
that's a Titan X in there at the moment
probably won't even run dual tines dual
10 X's in my PC just because I don't
really need it I think one is fine for
now until I finally build my skylight PC
which I hope I can get done by the end
of December so got my two 780 Ti is over
here as you can see probably locked them
up somewhere but I don't know the green
just doesn't look nice there so I would
update video on how to mod GPOs coming
up soon so that's kind of why I'm
leaving this open for now because I'm
gonna be working on that video soon
anyways I'm done thinking as much
watching as always yeah as always if you
enjoy these vlogs make sure that I like
lime he'll see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
