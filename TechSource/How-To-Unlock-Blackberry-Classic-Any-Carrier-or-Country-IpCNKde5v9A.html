to show you the process of a locking
your blackberry classic so you can use
it with any carrier or country for this
demonstration I will be using my locked
AT&amp;amp;T blackberry classic and unlock it so
I can use it on my t-mobile network but
you can use this video as a guide for
any carrier first off we need to get the
unlock code to start the unlocking
process one of the best and most
trusting websites that I used to get all
my unlock codes is the unlocking company
comm because the prices are unbeatable
and their customer service is the best
in the market so head on over to the
unlocking company comm and select your
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop-down list and on the next
page go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States an
original carrier is AT&amp;amp;T before we
continue we do need the IMEI number of
the phone and the way you look that up
on your phone is to open up the dial pad
and enter in star pound zero six pound
once the phone displays the IMEI number
you have to go back on the website and
enter that in once everything is filled
out select get a locking code and that
will take you to the final screen where
you have to check out after checking out
they will email you the unlock code the
price and delivery time of your code
varies by phone but don't worry because
the prices are always the cheapest in
the market than any other unlocking
website so once you receive your unlock
code from the locking company it's time
to unlock your phone all you have to do
is swipe down from the main screen and
click on mobile network once you are in
that menu select SIM card settings which
will then give you the option to unlock
your network and from here all you have
to do is enter in the unlock code that
you received from the unlocking company
after submitting the code a prompt will
show up stating that the code is
successful that basically means your
phone is permanently unlocked and it's
ready to go as you can see here I am
using my AT&amp;amp;T blackberry classic on my
t-mobile network so that's how you
unlock your blackberry classic if this
video helped you out please hit that
like button and if you have any
questions at all feel free to leave them
in the comment section and I will
respond as soon as possible this is that
from Texas Elsie
