in this video we're going to be taking a
look at one of the smallest the V
already gaming pcs ever created ladies
and gentleman this is the msi trident
and this thing packs some serious power
so it starts at 899 MSRP but the model
I'm featuring in this video has an i7
6700 which is paired with a custom MSI
GTX 1060 it also has eight gigs of ram
which can be upgraded to 32 gigs and for
storage it has a single one terabyte
hard drive and a 256 gigabyte m2 SSD now
if I were to build a custom PC with all
of these specs it would come out to a
little over 900 so surprisingly this
isn't overpriced what you are paying
extra for in this case is the warranty
and extremely quiet and portable form
factor not to mention you get a free
copy of mafia 3 with your purchase
speaking of free copies MSI is actually
giving out 20-game codes for mafia 3 and
more info on that later in this video
the msi trident only weighs just under 7
pounds and it's actually small enough to
fit most conventional backpacks making
it perfect for travel design-wise it's
actually pretty cool-looking although
I'm not too sure about the Mafia 3 arts
I personally would have preferred the
default brushed aluminum black look
instead there are four rubber feet near
the back if you decide to lay the PC
down or you can even stand it up
vertically with the included base
there's also a triangular LED section on
the PC and you can change the colors
using the MSI gaming center app which
comes pre-loaded with the software near
the top is where the power button is
located and further down on the front
end is where you'll find a plethora of
ports for easy access audio jacks USB
type-c 2 USB 3.1 and an HDMI out for VR
but it doesn't stop there you also get a
ton of ports near the back out of the
GPU you get the usual DisplayPort 1.4
HDMI 2.0 B and the dual link DVI further
up is a set of USB 2.0 ports your an
Ethernet another USB 3 HDMI as well and
also audio jacks with the Trident comes
MSI's exclusive cooling technology which
they are calling silent storm cooling -
this features two independent chambers
for CPU and GPU cooling this way each
component has the
own separated airflow and surprisingly
this isn't a marketing term it actually
works during idle the CPU gets up to 42
degrees Celsius and on full load it
spikes up to 78 degrees which is
actually pretty good
considering the size of the case and the
fact that you have all these components
cramped up inside and finally let's take
a look at the gaming benchmarks all
these are done in 1080p
there you have a guy this little thing
can get you over 60 FPS and high
settings on most triple-a titles and on
some other games you might need to
adjust the settings a bit if you want
over 60 fps honestly this is something I
would buy either for myself or for a
gift the price is not that far off
compared to a custom-built PC as I've
shown you guys in the beginning of the
video the fact that this tiny thing
packs this much power and still remains
cool and quiet is very impressive so
with that said if you guys are looking
around for a VR ready gaming PC for
travel or maybe you're just shopping
around for your first ever gaming PC and
I strongly recommend you guys to at
least check out the msi trident i'll
drop a link to it down below and now for
the giveaway guys i told you earlier
that msi is giving away 20 copies of
mafia 3 and for the instructions all you
have to do is click on the gleam link
down below and follow those instructions
announce the winners on the end of
November on my Twitter account so make
sure you guys are following me there I
want to give a huge thanks to them aside
for setting this out for review as
always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
