today we are going to be comparing the
two best budget 4k monitors that are
currently on the market
the Samsung and Asus 28 inch 4k monitors
so without wasting any more time let's
start by comparing their sizes it's
pretty obvious that the asus monitor is
much bulkier than the Samsung's but
measuring at its thinnest point they are
relatively the same coming in a little
under one inch
taking a look at the back of the
monitors we can see that this is where
the buttons are located the asus monitor
uses multiple buttons that make
operating the menu system confusing and
we find the support choice from asus and
which they did something more like
samsung which implemented a joystick
like control to navigate through the
menu system and if you click on it the
panel will turn on and off also on the
back are the ports asus has a panel that
can be removed to access the ports more
easily which is still kind of
inconvenient as the ports become more
recessed and harder to access as I said
in my boxing video of this monitor I
prefer a vertical connection layout
instead of a horizontal set up like asus
has here for the simple reason of it
being more convenient to access the
monitors connections connections located
at the back of the monitor include a
power n 2 hdmi s1 DisplayPort 1.2 and
your audio jacks Samsung however has no
covers and it's much more easier to
connect your cables with it also has a
power n2 HDMI is one DisplayPort 1.2 and
an audio jack if you decide to use the
speakers on the monitor so how flimsy
are the mounts
well since the Samsung stand is
connected right under the monitor it
really isn't that sturdy the Asus mount
however has a much more solid setup
since it is mounted right on the back of
the display adjustability wise both
monitors can tilt a fair amount however
that's pretty much all the Samsung
monitor can do ASIS on the other hand
can adjust its height and it can also be
rotated up to 90 degrees for a vertical
setup the Asus monitor can also be
connected to a VESA mount while the
Samsung monitor cannot which gives it
the automatic win in this category since
both monitors are matte I wanted to see
which monitors matte coating would do
better against glare from light sources
so we use one of our studio lights for
this test which is very bright and it
would simulate what it would be like
if you were to use the monitor close to
a window when the Sun is out and facing
the monitor if you pay close attention
to the top corners of the start you can
still see them even with the glare right
on top of the monitor now if you look at
the same location on the Asus monitor it
is barely visible which means that the
display on the Samsung monitor is more
resistant to glare from other light
sources now let's take a look at some 4k
video samples the panels are very
similar when looking at the spec list
both monitors use 10-bit color which
provide for smooth color gradations for
a more natural-looking transition
between hues the Asus huan'er does
however use flicker free technology to
eliminate any flickering that may
present itself
reducing eye strain now when it comes to
actual color both monitors are
strikingly similar however I believe
that the Samsung monitors colors are a
tad bit lighter than the Asus model if
you look really closely I did not mess
up the color settings on both monitors I
did use the default settings for the
sake of the video and I'm sure with some
tweaking you guys can find the best
settings for your needs
you
the viewing angles are also similar no
matter the position of the monitor and
honestly this isn't something to be even
concerned about because once you find
the perfect angle then you don't need to
change it
you
for 4k gaming both doing awesome
sixty Hertz I didn't notice any lag or
screen tearing I can definitely say that
you can't go wrong with either monitor
when it comes to gaming they both
deliver
you
so that is our comparison on the two
best budget 4k monitors that are
currently available based on my time
with both monitors I have to say that I
went with the Samsung model I like the
overall design I have no problem with it
being more flimsy because I never come
into contact with my monitor at all I
really don't need a VESA mount option on
the Asus model because I don't mount my
monitors anymore but for those of you
that want a more sturdy mount or want to
mount your monitors then Asus is
probably the best choice for you at the
moment
Asus also has a three year warranty with
one year of zero bright coverage which
is better than Samsung's one year
general warranty to their monitor so
which monitor would you guys choose if
you wanted to buy a 4k monitor the Asus
or the Samsung model let me know in the
comment section down below as always we
have a lot of awesome videos coming soon
including the ultimate PC build which
you guys have been waiting for for weeks
we are still working on that but make
sure you guys stick around because
that's coming up pretty soon this is
that from Texas and I will see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
