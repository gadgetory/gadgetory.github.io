is a beautiful day here at tech source
headquarters I got my stuff ready to go
we're going to see how much we can get
done
in this video so my tube cutter came in
today I ordered because it didn't come
with the rest of the parts now my tube
cleaner got my PPG P what PE TG tubing
I'm not going with acrylic of course
because there's a lot easier to bend and
I got my silicone tube which is needed
and of course my I was going to say
hairdryer on steroids but this is the
heat gun that came with all my stuff so
there it is i'm mocchi i decided to work
on the cable management after I get some
tubing done just in case I might need to
rework the cables in case it gets in the
way so yeah it's going to be a lot of
work I'm always going to make a lot of
mistakes but I did watch it to youtube
videos to see point view to get it right
but this is going to be pretty
disastrous I think but well whatever
happens we'll see is a learning process
like I said guys is my first water cool
build and I've never done standing ever
in my life and I was actually going to
stick with fittings for the Bend points
but I'm like you know what I know
eventually I'm going to need to know how
to bend tubing for my other water cool
bills obviously so I decided to just go
with it for my first build anyways just
so I can get some experience so I'm
going to start small I guess will do
from will start from the end CPU block
to the GPU block bridge or whatever you
want to call this and then from there
we'll move on to the bottom portion to
the pump and then the pump to the top
radiator so yeah it should be fun
so the band that needs to happen as I
would say around this point now
obviously am I using any sort of
measuring tools I'm kind of just eyeing
it like I said guys there's gonna be
lots of mistakes so I'm going to try and
get this right the first time which I'm
pretty sure it's not gonna happen but
we'll see
I got start doubting I got stop doubting
myself but anyways
so there it is guys
my first I think successful 45-degree
angle Bend I'm not sure yet
it kind of looks tiny blisters on here I
don't see any cracks so I think I think
this looks good I don't know
you guys do a judge okay so the angle
came out right it's I think to me it
looks like a perfect 45-degree angle
straight down to the bridge now it's
obviously a little too long so I'm going
to cut off a piece from here but the
only hard part about this is as you can
see it's not really straight it doesn't
align align with it so I'm gonna have to
then again somewhere over here slightly
45 degree angle and then Blanche great
down and of course I'm enough to cut
that cut off a little piece of this too
because it is extending a bit too long I
was always told or I should say common
sense is always to cut a little extra
that way you guys have some room to work
with in case you messed up because
because you always cut off a piece of
the tube to make it shorter but if you
make it too short then you pretty much
screwed and you have to start all over
again but
you
oh my god I think I got it right guys I
can't believe it into the first time
let's check it out it looks like the
Ingalls right look at that perfectly
straight in there Wow Wow
I said to cut off a little piece from
there because it's extending of it too
much but this is I can't believe I do
this I guess water cooling isn't that
hard apparently
another beautiful 90 degree Bend I think
I'm getting really good at this so it's
going to basically extend all the way
here into the top rated hole over here
and of course as you can see it's a bit
extending a bit too long so I'm not too
cut up maybe an inch or two so and I
think the cables might get in the way so
I might have to position it a little at
an angle so it kind of comes upwards but
yeah so far so good
the
you
all right so after three tries the most
complicated band is finally done which
is this one starts from here comes down
here and straight into the reservoir
holy crap this took me four hours I
think I lost track actually was a
far-our things like more like two hours
to do when I wasted actually three full
tubes to do this it's just figuring out
when to bend the tube is like the worst
is like the hardest part I would say
especially for something that long but
it's not perfect guys it really isn't
it's not 100% perpendicular or even
parallel to anything it's just if I can
assure you from this angle I mean it's
close enough I guess it's not really
like there's some Michael for example
over here is a little small kink all of
you guys can tell but yeah anyways I got
one more left and that is from the
bottom of the bridge to the bottom of
the lens and for Ike I want to put this
in there too it's kind of like a flow
meter I think it'll look pretty cool
somewhere in the middle over here is
because the bottom part here is empty
and I figured if I just put this in here
be a nice little thing to spice up the
build but
there you have it ladies and gentlemen
the tubing is finally done after two
months it is by far the most frustrating
thing of building and water-cooled PC
that is for sure
it's not perfect I know that but I just
want to finish this at this point things
I don't like the kinks on the tubes
tubing over here in the corner there's
one right there it's really obvious and
there's one in that corner as well but
the rest of it is actually pretty close
to perfect if I say so myself and also
for those people asking me why I'm
running the CPU block to the GPU if I
have two GPUs and only one waiter it's
not going to be much difference in times
guys maybe one or two degrees as most so
that's not really an issue and also for
those of you asking me to put the waiter
on the bottom trust me I've tried that
as well
first of all there's no mounting holes
on the bottom to mount the radiator also
it's really close to the GPU it's
basically touching the GPU the fans so
it's the a doesn't fit down there as
much as I wanted to work ladies
gentleman at a time to flush the system
and then we can pull in the coolant also
I burned myself yesterday with the heat
gun so if yeah if you're building if
your pending tubes make sure you have a
guardian or parent nearby serious
business seriously do I need these I
mean but like I'm at a lab trying to
create the next atomic bomb or something
like I don't I notice did anybody even
use goggles for cleaning flushing
assistances this is crazy do not use in
a water cooling loop step one we move
the radiator from your water cooling
loop
all right so this says I need the
solution in the radiator for between 6
to 12 hours and then I can drain so
seconds can take another day just on
flushing the radiator and then part two
is basically where I can actually clean
the entire loop with the radiator back
on the system so and this one actually
doesn't take that long actually no it
does 12 to 24 hours so another day on
that the two full days just on flushing
the system so yeah but like I said guys
it's all going to be one video for you
guys alright the part I want to finally
done all the liquid is inside here all
the holes are filled and I'll still wait
12 hours before I can flush it out and
then rinse it with actual water so you
guys think
oh it's been 12 hours it's go ahead and
flush this thing I can get it open
all right so now that strains ought to
do is flush on the remainder stuff with
water to do it four times so yeah I'm
going to get take care of that and I'll
be right back so you guys know that I
try to be a perfectionist and this one
food was really bothering me I just I
don't I can't let it go for some reason
it's no surprise there and the thing is
I got one tube left so I'm going to try
and we Bend it is that even the term but
I want to try and fix this by making a
completely new Bend to try and hopefully
match that exact same one and if it
doesn't work out I'm basically attitudes
and I'm gonna have to accept my state
and move on but I want to give you one
more shot why do I still have an extra
tube laying around what's the worst that
can happen I'm also not happy with this
bottom two but as you can see it's
slowly declining it's not really
parallels with the case so I think what
I need to do is shave off a little bit
from this end and this should help
screen it up a bit so let me work on
that real quick
success perfect bends on every single
corner as you can see so I pretty much
nailed down the bending aspect it just
now I have issues of figuring out when
to bend the tube so the only problem I
ran into now is as you can see so this
is the before or the previous tube and
this is the one app so as you can see I
bend it a bit too late near the top so
now what happens is it's going to reach
all the way to the top of the case so I
have to make some changes over here in
order for the tube to sit on the fitting
or sit in the fitting so not bad I mean
I still made it work so at least now I
can move on
much better so yeah as you can see the
sitting is pretty much touching the top
of the radiator bracket but everything
else is pretty good the tube isn't
really touching the case something is
like barely a few millimeters clearance
there but overall definitely satisfied
with the second try much better before
so as I was disconnecting one of the
cables this happened yep one of the
cables from the 24-pin completely ripped
off
I wasn't even pulling on anything so I
think this is the last time I'm going to
be using their cables so I just
contacted v1 tech and they're going to
hook me up with some things to not only
fix the fans and the back plates but
also I'm going to be replacing this
entire cable set because this is the
beginning honestly I've been having
problems with this company so oh look
another problem occurred the fan molex
connector will not really the molex but
the three pin and four pin ripped off of
the one of the cables so yeah this is a
fun build so far
all right so things were learning about
18 hours or so and looks like the liquid
turned light blue was originally clear
liquids looks like is this doing this
job and now I'm going to shut off the
pump and shop that annoying as beeping
sound and then flush out the system
three more times with regular water
according to what the paper says and
then afterwards I can put on or pour in
an actual liquid or coolant I should say
and actually guys I think this is going
to be the final build log until the
finale which I'll be showing you the
benchmarks and stuff obviously so I got
away for the cables to come in the back
plates the fangirls and all that stuff
so and then you pump of course because
that's pretty much destroyed when I was
about to end the video this is just the
rise in the male watch from v1 tech
hooking me up with some black blades
soap on the several friction yet I think
I would anything crazy this time around
there's some good-looking black plates
to be honest where you are
the yellow black plate that's a more
yellow to the entire bill overpowered
and black and check this out guys and
thick black and yellow in video fan
grill
for all six of the fans I also picked up
some black and yellow electrical tape
just in case I need to cover up some
logos or some wires that are sticking
out essentially if it's not black and
yellow it shouldn't belong in my build
so that as well I got some electrical
tape to do some slice model so the back
please don't sit these are a bit too
wide they're wider than the GPU block
and I just spoke with this on and you
said you sent the flaw the black plates
for the GTX 1084 the win I guess you
must somehow mister that I told it was
for my GPU blocks because
so it's about half an inch wider I
should say than the GPU blocks that
cinnamon email is going to overnight
some freshly cut one and this time I
actually decided to put a logo because
this is a bit too blank for me what you
blend so it's going to have the NVIDIA
claw just like the manual just to kind
of match with the entire color scheme
and style of the build
so especially P equals someone take this
time and say goodbye thank you guys so
much for watching that build log I know
it's been so long since the beginning
I'm very excited to start my next
water-cooled project and I thought I'll
take months obviously it's going to take
maybe weeks at most and it's actually
going to be from my personal system
we're talking about a 69 50 X to 1080 t
is 64 gigs around mean this thing is
going to be absolutely beast and
obviously it's going to be my color
scheme
so if excited about that leave a like if
you guys enjoyed the build log style
videos I guess let me know in the
comments section otherwise my next water
cool bill will just be a simple time
lapse without me talking but whatever
you guys prefer obviously I believe is
for you guys now I'm going to edit this
video I don't how long this video is
going to be probably over at least to 10
minutes that's for sure but next time
you guys see Electra box it's going to
be the finale it's going to be some
quality cinematic shots we got benchmark
stamps gaming everything you name it
thank you again so much for following me
on this journey I've learned a lot very
excited actually that I started this I'm
like pointing out a different build it's
actually down there I'm like I'm
surprised I kept my sanity anyways guys
thank you so much seriously your
feedback has been very important I'd
actually been reading your comments and
I've been adjusting the build according
to according to the comments that I read
every single video that I upload but
anyways I'm gonna rambling
thank you again for your feedback and
your support I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
