welcome to another episode of what's in
the box I'm very excited for this
particular episode because I just came
from the post office and I opened up my
p.o box and I was like no way are all of
these packages mine I didn't get
anything for like the past few weeks and
all of a sudden I open them up here box
and this is what I got a bunch of fan
mail so at least I hope they're family
but honestly I want to thank each and
every one of the guys who sent these
packages and I'm very excited to open
these up so let's dive right in so I'm
going to start out by opening up the
letters first and then the package is
and then we can move on to the rest of
the boxes for the episode so the first
one is from miles holy I think that's
what it says from Massachusetts let's
see what he sent me what's a bad I love
your videos I've been a sub to your
YouTube since 100k subs that is a long
time thank you so much for that I've
seen almost every one of your videos
you've inspired me to build my first
gaming PC I don't have a lot of money I
can only build a $300 computer and then
he goes about talking about his PC specs
and then says I would love to have a
setup like yours thanks for making the
videos you make and giving me
entertainment keep up the good work and
I do have a YouTube channel it's called
Julio games I'll drop a link to it down
below if you want to check it out thank
you very much for the letter this next
one is from Ethan okay Wow so this is
like a two-page letter obviously I'm not
going to read the entire thing on camera
so I'll read the first few sentences
dear Edgar my name is Connor and I'm one
of your subscribers on YouTube I am a
sophomore in high school and I've been
watching videos ever since you build big
red that is a very long time Wow
since then your channel has grown so
much I enjoyed every bit of it I was
inspired to write this letter because
you are almost out of million
subscribers and because of the recent
drama that happened on the channel and
Twitter I want to let you know that I
have even more respect for you as a
person now that I have ever did before
admittedly you did make some mistakes
however the way you took ownership of
your actions and apologized shows that
you have learned from this and grown as
a person
thank you very much Connor that means a
lot to me by the way I will read all
these letters that you guys sent me and
I'll actually have a special box for
these I'm gonna put in so whenever I'm
feeling down
or basically not in the mood I'm gonna
go in and read these letters to kind of
cheer me up a bit so thank you again so
much for setting this in Connor all
right so this one is from coal and looks
like he's asking for some parts and
actually had a few these letters today
guys and here's my thing about that
please don't send me any letters asking
for free stuff I get a bunch of those on
my email address and I get a bunch of
those on YouTube comments Twitter
messages and still getting DMS please
keep these the only gifts or some
encouraging letters you want to send me
that's fine I just get away too many
that's why I do giveaways to try and
give it back but if everybody keeps
asking for free stuff that I have to
give it to everyone else who asks for
free stuff so it's just not fair if I
give out free stuff to whoever asks so I
apologize Cole but I can add to that I
hope this letter gets read by you in one
of your boxing videos if it does I might
faint with excitement while watching we
do that faith thank you for inspiring me
ed and keep making videos I especially
like the unboxing videos but they are
all great if you have any questions hit
me up Thank You Bryan so much for this
letter that's awesome
this one is from Scott and he says you
know he's actually one of the giveaway
winners of but Ron so he says I'm a
wicked big fan of yours
I found you randomly on YouTube one day
ever since then I watch your videos the
second you upload them on to vessel and
YouTube oh one of my vessel fans that's
awesome unless I'm doing homework
of course school is always priority I've
entered into every giveaway you've done
the day that I want but Ron August 2016
I was the happiest person alive that is
awesome I just want to thank you for the
amazing content you produce and for
hashtag bite Ron from Scott
congratulations Scott again well
deserved and thank you again please
letter so that is it for all the letters
think you guys so much for saying them
and now let's open up the packages that
were sent to me by you guys this one is
from China and I am both scared and
excited so it looks like a wash of some
sort this is a really clean looking
watch thank you so much whoever it was
that sent this to me there is no note in
here but I'm gonna start wearing these
in some of my videos in fact I'm gonna
put this on right
I have such a flimsy wrist but this is
an awesome watch thank you so much for
sending this in I wish you would have
send me a note but thank you if you're
watching get tested protect yourself
oh is this what I think it is oh my god
this is it was a matter of time it was a
matter of time before I got something
sexual I will gladly accept these thank
you so much I'm actually never heard of
this brand lifestyle so I trust that
they are good glide and then these are
lubricant packets whoever sent this to
me you are awesome thank you so much but
the question is will they fit this
immediately became rated R I don't think
I can even do this anymore
I'm going to upload this portion on
vessel only so my YouTube audience will
not get to see this woo nice and lubed
so yeah that was fun
thank you again so much for setting that
end I'm definitely gonna use them by the
way I am NOT throwing them away
oh no way I got a blade medic sharpener
this is freaking amazing
I came out sharp in my unboxing knives
because these are getting pretty dull
really quickly so this is awesome is
there a note in here no there is no note
but thank you so much forever sent this
to me I'm seriously going to be using
this before every single episode you

got two more boxes guys and then we can
move on to the regular unboxing no way

quiet for sending this in I will make
good use of these it is here it is here
they ask you how you're you say thank
you so guys these other parts that are
going in the five hundred dollar budget
build for late October I talked a lot
about this on periscope and on Twitter
but this is going to be one of the best
budget build on the channel without a
doubt and there is going to be a build
guide a time-lapse and as well and
benchmarks as well so make sure you guys
stick around I'm going to be using the
black version of the thermal tape core
v1 so very Stokes do this build and
bring it to you guys so stick around
guys we have a package from a suit so
you know what that means
I already know what's in here but you
guys don't know what's in here the asus
strix RX 460 once again it's going in
that five hundred dollar bill that I
talked about
very Stokes to put this in the build and
show you guys some benchmarks it's going
to be fun last but not least we have a
very special package from Lenovo I think
this is their gaming monitor I'm not
exactly sure that's open this up whoa
this is very thin that's what she said
damn this panel is thin look how thin
this thing is guys well if you're
looking at the top portion over here but
this bottom portion where the ports are
obviously is a little thick but this is
a very good-looking monitor looks like
it's a 27-inch correct me if I'm wrong
and I don't really know the specs on
here so I will list it somewhere on the
screen in case you guys want to check it
out but there will be a video on this I
don't know exactly what to do maybe just
a solid review but let me know if you
guys have any ideas that you want to see
done with this monitor it is basic
compatible it does come with its own
stand it's adjustable for tilt and
height as well and looks like reports
you have an HDMI one display port 2 USB
3.0 oh there's actually 2 more USB 3.0
on the side over here with a headphone
jack so very stocks to give this a shot
thank you Lenovo for sending this in as
always think you guys so much for
watching and especially thanks for those
who sent me gifts you guys are seriously
amazing I'm not gonna throw any of those
away especially this little guy here and
the letters especially I'm gonna put
those in a box and save them so again

you're doing these videos be sure to
leave a like and I'll see you in the
