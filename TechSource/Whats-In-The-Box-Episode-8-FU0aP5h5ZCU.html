many boxes to open up and they're just
keep on piling on every single week so
I'm gonna have to move on so I am so
sorry
I'm just with you guys obviously I'm not

the box let's not waste any more time
and big right and as you can see we got
quite a few boxes in this the Train

going to start off with the smallest box
and then we can move our way up to the
biggest which i think is the Asus box

stuff so I'm very excited to open that
up and that will be the last one oh okay
