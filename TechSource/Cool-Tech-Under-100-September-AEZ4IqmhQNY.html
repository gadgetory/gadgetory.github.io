Texas and welcome to cool tech under a
hundred bucks for the month of September
you guys are new to the series and
somehow miss my previous episodes I'll
go to leave a playlist linked down below
so you guys can catch up after the video
now without wasting any more time let's
begin by the way all the products
mentioned in this video will be listed
down below in the order that they appear
so it's easier for you guys to find them
so with that said let's start off by the
most requested item from my desk set up
the LEDs so these are from friends of
you and what sets these LEDs apart from
most of the other ones is that you can
control them wirelessly through your
smartphone or tablet there's a dedicated
app that gives you full control on
selecting the perfect color for your
setup you can even save them into
something called a scene which gives you
quick access to it you can also adjust
the intensity of the color which I find
awesome but the one thing I absolutely
love about this app is that I don't need
to log in to it to access my scenes I
just pull down the notifications tab
from wherever I am and select the
pre-configured settings from there also
typing the same color a second time will
disable the lights it states that the
LED strip is 6 feet long but it managed
to fit the entire length of my desk
which is 72 inches and I still managed
to have some extra left over that
wrapped around the other side of the
desk so it's more like 6 and a half feet
if you ask me you can also cut the
strip's anywhere you like to make it
shorter so the starter pack is less than
100 bucks but unfortunately you will
need to buy the bridge which is sold
separately if you want to be able to
control the lights using your smart
phone but I'll go to leave a link to
both of them down below for you guys
next up we have a 14 port USB aluminum
hub from anchor it features 13 USB 3.0
ports and a single smart charging port
that delivers up to 2.1 amps for
charging your devices on one side we
have the USB pass-through port with the
DCN and on the other side as the power
button this is great for anyone that is
a crap-ton of accessories or devices
that need USB 3.0 I on the other hand I
found a slightly different use for it
this is my little docking station for my
smart phones that I have one micro USB
cable running from each phone to a power
brick which is then connected
an outlet so I have a bunch of cables
and power bricks below so I thought of a
great idea I can just hook this up on
the roof of the table get some short
micro USB cables and connect it all to
the USB hub and only have one wire go
directly into the power now I know that
USB 3.0 only outputs 0.9 amps which is
half the speeds of regular USB charging
ports but I'll leave these to charge
overnight anyway so I'm never in a hurry
by the way I will leave a link down
below to where I got these awesome
carbon fiber skins from if anyone is
interested next up we have a power bank
from zero lemon but this is no regular
power bank this is actually solar
powered twenty thousand milliamp
portable charger that's actually rain
resistant as well you can charge the
power bank using direct sunlight or by
the micro USB port on the side on the
other side is the power button and when
pressed will indicate how much juice is
left and if you hold it down they will
activate the built-in flashlight
it also features two USB ports that you
can use to charge two devices at the
same time now the solar charging feature
is only one-fifth of the speed of
regular charging ports but it's still a
really nice feature if you're out
camping for days or weeks at a time this
next product is one of my favorite
products featured in this video this is
the SanDisk I expand mobile flash drive
for iPhones and iPads Apple keeps
shafting us every year by releasing
sixteen gigabyte models and not giving
us the 32 gigabyte versions which means
that we have to pay extra to make the
jump to 64 gigabytes this forces a lot
of us to stick with the 16 gigabyte
model and we all know that's just not
enough space for all our music photos
and videos well this is where the 64
gigabyte I expand comes in it's
basically like a USB flash drive but for
iPhones you can sync all your photos
from your phone to the flash drive and
delete them right after to save you
space or you can store your music and
movies all on this flash drive and only
transfer them to your phone when you
want to listen or watch them or better
yet if you don't have enough space on
your phone you can watch it straight
from the flash drive itself
I'm definitely sticking with the 16
gigabyte model next year as well since I
now have expandable storage this next
product is a simple one this is a tablet
stand by I prop but it's a unique tablet
stand which is why I included it in my
cool tech video the stand itself is made
out of non-slip silicon which holds all
tablets under 18 millimeters of
thickness and behind that is a mesh type
material with microbeads that is
catchable and machine washable it's
basically a beanbag chair for your
tablet because of the micro bead base
you are guaranteed to find the perfect
viewing angle regardless of your
position whether you are lying in a bed
sitting on the sofa or even a chair
absolutely a brilliant invention and I
recommend this to anyone who watches
movies or videos on their tablets a lot
these next three products are all from
nyko and work with the PlayStation 4
first up is the charging dock that
offers a much more convenient way of
charging the controllers it connects to
the front two USB ports and comes with
two dongles that you can connect up to
two controllers just drop the controller
off near the port and it will snap in
place magnetically this will also charge
your controllers in rest mode which is
awesome so since its hook up the front
two USB ports you get those back near
the end which is a lot better if you ask
me since you can run the cables to the
back which obviously much cleaner look
at number two is the Nyko data bank if
you're hardcore gamer either on the Xbox
or Playstation 4 and have tons of games
on your console and need more space then
this has your name written all over it
with the data bank you are able to
expand your original storage up to 2
terabytes of space using a standard hard
drive which you can either buy
separately or use one that you already
have the last item from Nyko is an
attachable type pad that you can hook up
to your controller you no longer have to
use the lame directional keys to type
words one letter at a time
if it's right in front of the controller
with ease and it doesn't mess with the
ergonomics in fact it's slightly more
comfortable holding the controller with
this equipped because it covers the
audio jack you get another one using the
type pad so you can still connect your
headset it's also Bluetooth compatible
meaning you can connect it to virtually
anything from smartphones to tablets TVs
and more which is awesome by the way all
these three items are also available for
the Xbox one version and I'll leave
links to that as well this next one is
very popular which I'm sure a lot of you
probably already have seen this is tile
and it's basically an item finder put it
on your keys your luggage your baby
wallet underwear PC or anything that you
don't want to lose or probably lose
often if you do lose it you simply use
the app and find it I have like eight of
these and a bunch of my stuff that I
want to keep an eye on in case they are
stolen or lost and I can track them all
using the tile app which makes it super
convenient one of them is actually
attached to my dog snowy I simply hook
that up to his collar
and he barely even notices it there it's
super lightweight weighing only at one
point three ounces and little snowy will
no longer go missing I can simply use
the app and pinpoint his exact location
and go to his rescue now let's say you
get really close to the item you're
tracking or it's at your house well the
map won't do you good since you still
need to look for it that's where the
fine option comes in handy simply
tapping it once will activate a loud
jingle that you can hear and find your
item next up we have an all-in-one video
security system called guardzilla this
thing has it all I have lots of tech
items here at the office and I never
leave without arming this thing
unlike most surveillance cameras that
make you pay for a subscription to
upload recorded files this one actually
has a built-in SD card slot which means
that it supports up to 32 gigabytes of
space you can store up to five days of
video files on you can check up anytime
you want no matter where you are just by
opening the app up and you can take
quick screenshots which is pretty cool
it also features two-way audio so you
can hear everything that's going on as
well as communicate back and forth since
it has a built-in speaker
other features include motion detection
which alerts you by sending an email or
text straight to your smartphone within
seconds there's also an option for pet
immunity as well but the coolest and my
personal favorite feature of them all is
the night vision the only downside is
that it's not rechargeable so it has to
be plugged in for it to work but overall
the quality is really amazing compared
to other security cameras I've seen and
the fact that you get all of this in one
compact device for around 100 bucks is
what makes this a really cool tech item
this next product is pretty awesome this
is the noon virtual reality headset it's
compatible with Android and iPhones and
it's an experience to have I'll tell you
that much it supports screen sizes from
4.7 to 5.5 inches virtual reality
content is becoming extremely popular
not only is it starting to surface on
YouTube but developers are constantly
making apps for it I tried on a few of
your headsets before and honestly most
of them are overpriced and feels super
flimsy but the new headset is on a
different level not only do they have an
awesome app with tons of videos but the
quality of the headset is solid I try to
capture a little bit of what was going
on inside there but it's a completely
different experience once you put it on
if you're looking to get into it or
maybe
curious about it then I strongly
recommend you guys to check out the noon
VR headset first you won't regret it
these next two items are single
Bluetooth speakers and first up we have
the X power it will give you up to 20
hours of music and it's great for
outdoors whether you are camping or
hiking it's protected in a rubber casing
which will prevent the speaker from
getting damaged if you manage to drop it
on one side you have the media controls
and on the other side covered by a seal
is the USB port to charge your devices
yep that's right the speaker does double
as a 7,000 milliamp hour power bank it
also has a line in for non bluetooth
connectivity and features a built-in mic
for taking calls this next one is the
anchor premium speaker that features 20
watt drivers and dual subwoofers the
name says it all this is a premium built
speaker that features Bluetooth 4.0 and
offers up to 10 hours of music it has a
beautiful glossy finish on top along
with the media controls the speaker
features max based technology which
improves the bass performance and gives
you amazing highs in deep lows
here's a quick sound comparison between
the X power and the anchor speakers
these next set of speakers have been in
my setup for a pretty long time and I
have been constantly been asked about
them so I decided to feature them in
this video so everyone knows these are
the Boehm mate speakers they sell them
individually but I'll explain in a bit
why I have two of them so the speakers
feature Bluetooth 4.0 technology and
will get you up to 18 hours of music on
a full charge on the side you will find
the power button earphone jack audio
input and micro USB port for charging on
the top are the media controls and it
does come with a built-in mic so you can
accept calls now then I have two of
these because they feature dual link
technology which means that I can pair
them together for a wireless surround
sound experience these speakers are
amazing and I've been using them all the
time to watch movies on my ultrawide
monitor I basically have my very own
mini theater experience
there is one last set of speakers I do
want to mention this is the go groove
bass pulse led speaker sound system it
comes in red blue or green LED options
and contains 40 watts of peak power you
get dynamic highs warm mid-tones and a
deep a very powerful bass on the front
of the subwoofer you have a knob to
control the volume and the other to
control the amount of bass it outputs
followed by an LED switch on the bottom
the speaker system not only looks
amazing but produces really high quality
sound which is surprising because the
speaker's itself are super thin and I
was shocked to hear how great the
quality of the sound was if you guys are
looking for really cool speakers to go
along with your setup then I strongly
recommend these you will definitely go
lost in your game or movie with these in
the fact that it contains an equaliser
makes this a solid choice for parties
here's a quick sound demo
these last two items are gaming gear for
my gamers out there first up is probably
one of the most comfortable and
responsive gaming mice I have ever used
this is the me onyx caster optical
gaming mouse now for those of you that
haven't heard of me onyx they make some
of the most comfortable gaming mice in
the world the caster is their latest
entry in their lineup of premium mice it
features six programmable buttons up to
sixteen point eight million LED color
options and a dpi sensor of up to ten
thousand the gaming great optical sensor
has no positive or negative hardware
acceleration it has amazing accuracy and
smooth tracking and I definitely noticed
that while gaming they state that it's
widely considered as the best gaming
sensor currently available it also comes
with it's very own software with it you
can program all six buttons as well as
control the speed of scrolling and
pointer acceleration or get into more
detailed settings for sensor performance
you also get the usual macro settings
and LED options it's so accurate that
you can actually manually input your RGB
code if you're looking for a specific
shade of color last but not least and my
personal favorite out of all the items I
featured is the HyperX cloud 2 gaming
headset it's compatible with PC Xbox ps4
and practically everything else that has
a 3.5 millimeter jack like smartphones
tablets and other devices
it features 7.1 surround sound and has a
premium USB sound card which will give
you really rich sound quality with
crystal-clear lows mids and high tones
along with an enhanced bass when I
swapped my eth and 50 X's to these I
immediately noticed how much louder and
clearer the sound was the build quality
is outstanding as well with aluminum
sliders and it's pretty flexible too
dear cups are made out of memory foam
and are really comfortable to wear for
hours at a time
they're also interchangeable and come
with a set of velar cushions which are
also super comfortable however my ears
tend to warm up quickly with those on so
it's probably best to save them for a
cold day additionally the cloud 2 comes
with a detachable mic which is awesome
because it gives you the choice whether
to wear it or not I mentioned earlier
that these headphones have 7.1 surround
sound well you will need to connect the
audio control box to enable that feature
and to be able to use the mic if you do
this the connection becomes USB and you
will have to connect it straight to your
PC or console instead of using the audio
jack now because of the clothes
cup design it fits around your ear and
doesn't press against your ear which
means that you can wear them for long
periods of time without fatigue the
longest I can wear my m50x is our for
only two hours before my ears start to
hurt but with the cloud tubes
I practically wore them for over four
hours until it was lunchtime but I'm
definitely sure I can go on the entire
day with them on without a problem
honestly there's not much else I can ask
for this headset has it all and it's my
favorite it's now officially part of my
desk setup there is one more product I
want to mention but it's currently not
out yet but it deserves to be in this
video because it's honestly really cool
this is the 3d Simo mini one of the most
versatile 3d pens on the market it's
basically a four in one pen it's capable
of 3d printing soldering cutting and
burning things with the soldering nozzle
you can fix or create any electrical
component and the tip can reach
temperatures of up to four hundred
ninety degrees the wooden tool gives you
options of decorating stuff like wooden
spoons your wallet shoes or even shape
3d printed models or printouts and
lastly if you're a model maker the
cutting tool is an awesome way to cut
them plastic or foam creating whatever
it is that you need the possibilities
are endless with the 3d Simo mini but
I'm going to leave a link down below for
more details for anyone that is
