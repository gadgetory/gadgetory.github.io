this video we're gonna be taking a look
at some gaming gear from cougar we've
got the revenger a premium gaming mouse
the bunker a mouse bungee which is
actually the first I've used with a
suction cup and finally the e mersa a
pair of budget headphones so let's kick
things off with the Revengers and yes it
looks just as badass as it sounds it's
light at about 111 grams and here's a
quick tour of the mouse it has an
ergonomic design for comfortable
stretches of use there's two buttons on
the left side
dpi indicators at the front lights on
the back textured rubber for a solid
grip and a cable coming off of the left
side in total there are four buttons two
on the side the DPI control as well as
the scroll wheel button the mouse does
have a slight hump near the back which
is comfortable for palm grippers but
this mouse design accommodates four claw
and finger tight grip players as well
let's move on to the 3360 optical
sensors so we have a twelve thousand dpi
1,000 Hertz polling rate and a maximum
tracking speed of 250 IPS so what this
all translates to is an accurate gaming
experience the tracking is smooth and
there is no noticeable jitter when
panning in game the on-the-fly dpi
control was also a nice touch it allowed
me to switch the speed in a game
depending on character selection so for
example if I was using a character that
required more precision such as a sniper
I would tone the dpi down for a more
accurate aim and vice versa moving on to
the buttons usually listen on the click
sound
left and right we have Imran switches
and they provide good audible feedback
and they're all so tight the other
buttons are all so tight so there is no
accidental clicks here there is no extra
sound when tapping it and no rattle when
shaking the mouse around either and
overall it just feels very well made on
the base there are three large mouse
feed which glide really smoothly across
any mouse pad in the Cougar software you
get a few controls you can change the
performance from one hundred to twelve
thousand dpi you can reroute the buttons
with basic commands record macros and of
course change the RGB color a slight
detail I noticed here was the gradient
it would go through before switching
colors this is the first time I've seen
this and it's pretty badass overall it's
a solid gaming mouse especially at sixty
dollars so I use the Revengers with the
bunker from cougar as well and before
all of this I used to think that mouse
bungees were an overhyped gaming
accessory but with my time spent with
this it's actually pretty useful it's
nice not having to worry about the
cables being kinked or caught while
gaming so what makes the bunker special
as the suction cup and unlike other ones
this won't move around your desk at all
looking around the bunker we see this
lever here which controls the suction
cup the top is flexible and the bottom
is solid plastic it's about 10
centimeters tall and six centimeters
wide with no height adjustment but
almost all Mouse cables will be
compatible with this in conclusion is
really nice using the mouse bungee and
it might have a place on my main desk I
can be moving my mouse around a lot and
there will be no issues with cables
getting snagged which is really
important when it comes to FPS games
it's around $20 on Amazon so a bit steep
for a mouse bungee but it is a long term
investment nevertheless and finally the
last product we have from cougar is the
immerser their budget headset solution
so right after bad I must say that these
aren't going to compete with higher
priced headsets in terms of audio
quality but with a 40 millimeter driver
and a noise cancelling microphone the
$54 package you get overall is
impressive there
double microphone is flexible and it's
11 centimeters in length and holds its
shape really well here's a quick
unedited audio sample the microphone
number sir the audios untouched and
ordered through audacity I've also tried
according to my phone and the sound
quality carries over as you can hear
there's very little background noise
picked up from the microphone as you can
hear it's pretty good with very low
background noise pick up and this is all
achieved without a driver filtering the
noise so this quality carries over to
when you plug it into your smartphone
for example the sound quality of the
headset lacks punch in the bass the mids
are a bit mushy and the highs aren't
there quite either but when I stopped
analyzing the sound and just enjoy the
experience of gaming and listening to
music
I didn't notice its shortcoming after
all I'm no audio file it's one size fits
all with its leather like headband that
adjusts when you put it on I use the
immerses for long stretches of editing
and gaming and there wasn't any
discomfort at all the ear cups are well
padded for comfort the cable is braided
and about two meters long with a main
volume control and mute toggle here's a
quick audio test on the amount of sound
bleed one with the headsets on my head
and one with them off
so in conclusion these are all solid
gaming peripherals for the price if you
guys are looking to pick up your next
Mouse or headset or even Mouse bungee
check these guys out I'll drop a link to
them down below but that's pretty much
it for the video thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
