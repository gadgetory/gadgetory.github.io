and welcome to day four of the dwell
twelve twelve days of tech in this video
we'll be focusing on gaming headsets now
I know there's a ton of amazing headsets
out there and there's no way I can
feature all of them in this video
something instead I'm gonna be going
over my top picks and also keep in mind
that these are headsets not headphones
so these do come with a built in mic so
if you guys want to see a separate
version on just headphones by itself let
me know in the comment section down
below also guys keep in mind that the
purpose of these videos are to give you
gift ideas for the holidays these are
not reviews of the headphones or
headsets I should say so if you find
something interesting on the channel
make sure you do some research make sure
you look at a few reviews before you
pull the trigger so starting off the
video we have the Aki headset which is
going for a crazy 15 dollars and it
works with Mac Windows and even Android
right out of the box the ear cups are
made out of memory foam and they do sit
on the ear so you won't be getting much
noise isolation compared to and over the
ear design it does come with a remote
box which lets you mute the mic and
adjust the volume it's not a USB headset
so you will need a 3.5 millimeter jack
for both the microphone and speakers the
Bangu is also a very solid gaming
headset for under $20 and features seven
breathing LED colors at cycle and it's
only compatible with PC so if you're
looking for a console headset you should
pick up the first headset in this video
there is plenty of padding for ear cups
and the head bridge for long hours of
use especially since the ear cups go
over your ears which by the way also
provides excellent noise isolation the
USB cable powers the LEDs and the 3.5
millimeter Jack's power these speakers
and microphone venturing into mid-range
headsets the HyperX cloud stinger is
easily one of the best gaming headsets
for 50 bucks and this feature two sets
it in my cool tech video so if you guys
want to learn more make sure to watch
that video I'll have a link down below
but the headset feature is large 50
millimeter audio drivers adjustable
steel sliders and comfy memory-foam ear
cups the mic on this headset is also
very good compared to other headsets
within this price bracket it's extremely
lightweight and very comfortable to wear
for long hours at a time and the best
part is that it's compatible with PC
Xbox one and even ps4 the Logitech G 231
prodigy
at set features 40 millimeter speaker
drivers soft ear cups and a folding
microphone with intuitive controls the
ear cups have a breathable cloth
material which means that heat doesn't
build up during the summer and they are
removable for an easy wash it's
compatible with PCs consoles smartphones
even tablets since it has a 3.5
millimeter input the new series of
gaming headsets by SteelSeries consists
of three models the Octus three five and
seven each model features a sleek design
the same high quality audio drivers as
the Siberia 800 headsets and
exceptionally comfortable ear pads and
headband every artists headset supports
7.1 surround sound however the three and
five have a plastic build while the
arktech 7 has steel alloy elements in
the build the microphone is also
retractable which is nice and the volume
controls are located on the back of the
headset if you looking for a wireless
headset then the corsair void is a solid
pick with a 2.5 gigahertz wireless
connection and 16 hours of battery life
this headset is perfect for anyone
trying to keep a minimalistic set up the
headset does feature Dolby 7.1 surround
sound and RGB lighting which honestly
seems a bit pointless on a headset but
if that's your thing then you will enjoy
these the earcup cushions are made out
of microfiber which will keep your ears
nice and cool and it offers great noise
isolation since the ear cups go over
your entire ear the HyperX cloud tools
still remain one of the best gaming
headsets that I've ever used these are
extremely comfortable to wear for long
hours at a time the ear cups are made
out of memory foam and they completely
cover your ears it also comes with an
extra set of little ear pads and a
detachable microphone it's a bit on the
pricey side but I show you guys these
are worth every penny and it's also
compatible with both PC and ps4 now if
you guys want to save a few extra bucks
you can actually pick up the original
hyper access for $80 instead the main
difference is that the cloud 2's have
7.1 virtual surround sound noise and
echo cancellation as well as more
padding for the headband the Sennheiser
Game one PC is well known for being one
of the best gaming headsets out there
not just for gaming but for listening to
music and watching videos as well the
sound is very clear and accurate as well
I might even go as far as to say that
you can use these for light audio
monitoring nothing too serious or
extreme obviously plenty of velour
padding
which will keep your ears nice and
toasty they also go over the ear and
although they don't offer any noise
isolation since they are open-back
headphones they are extremely
comfortable to wear for long hours at a
time if you're willing to spend almost
$170 on these then you won't be
disappointed but the competitive gamers
out there the Turtle Beach Elite Pro
tournament gaming headset is a very
solid choice coming in at $200 it isn't
cheap but you are getting one of the
best gaming headsets out there 50
millimeter nano clear speakers and large
Aero fit ear cushions make sure to block
at all the outside noise and lets you
focus on the game the set set also looks
great with people who wear glasses
because of their pressure relieving
technology if you want the best headset
out there for competitive gaming then
you're going to have to pay for it
so that is it for this episode of twelve
days of tech as always let me know what
the category of take you want me to
cover next down below and if you enjoy
the series leave a like thank you guys
so much for watching and I will see you
