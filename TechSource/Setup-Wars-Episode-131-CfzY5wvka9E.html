welcome to setup wars episode 131 where
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel so if you guys
want to participate make sure to watch a
video linked down below but what that
said ladies and gentlemen welcome to
setup Wars starting off Tepes ode is
roland with an interesting setup not
because of his custom open-air pc build
but because he has an LED lamp built out
of cassette tapes okay he's got an ultra
wide monitor from LG however this is the
29 inch version and he's also using the
hammer Raj or regard and mouse combo I'm
actually never heard of that before
for REO he's got to genius speakers and
after the far-left
are a pair of Beats headphones which he
got for a gift pretty straightforward
stuff on a desk but let's take a look at
this awesome
PC so this is actually designed by him
and it was manufactured by a local
company
I love these stealth silver and white
color scheme I think it did a great job
on designing the case overall especially
the backside it looks like you added
some extra space to hide the power
supply and the cables nicely done I
would however replace that 4 gig ram
stick to something that has the same
speed and timing otherwise you're losing
out on performance because your PC is
currently under clocking the faster Ram
stick I don't know what's going on with
the cables behind the setup because the
back board is blocking it however I
don't see any wires on the ground so
that's always good the only complaints I
had were the carpet stains and the mural
paintings on the wall that are off
centered but you already beat me to the
punch by telling me in the notes
apparently the carpet and the pictures
belong to the owner and he's currently
working on replacing them in terms of
recommendations I feel like your
headphones are a bit too far to the left
maybe replace them with the LED lamp so
that they are closer to you you should
definitely face the speaker's more
towards you since they are kind of
spread out and believe me they do make a
difference believe it or not if you do
have the budget for it I would recommend
mounting your monitor against the wall
or on a desk and putting those speakers
closer in the center
underneath the monitor and finally I
would recommend running the mouse wire
underneath the keyboard and wrapping
both keyboard and mouse together while
running it's great across on the left
side of the monitor standard it will
look a lot cleaner
so yeah those are my recommendations on
improving your setup use them if you
want to but thank you Roland for
entering next up is Josh and his gaming
setup featuring the Acer x34 ultra wide
that's hooked up to the freedom arm
below that we got the logitech g930 95
keyboard with custom key caps from max
keyboard comm I do want to point out the
direction of his Corsair mousepad why on
earth have I not thought of this
it's such a simple ingenious way of
hiding the cable coming out of it just
basically rotated to its side and run
the cable underneath the keyboard pure
genius and I'm over here recommending
people who drill holes in their desk and
stuff I mean this way you're able to run
both the keyboard and mouse pad wire
directly across the desk so it looks
much cleaner and of course there's the
option of drilling a hole in the desk
underneath the keyboard if you really do
want to hide the wires completely
speaking of the desk its motorized and
us from EVO desk these things are
actually pretty sweet and they can go up
to $1,000 or more and actually fully
customizable you can set the length
color finish you can even add custom
skins on the top and select the type of
cable management accessories you want
with a desk I mean there are like 10
pages of options that you can choose
from evil desk if you're watching this
video maybe we can team up and do
something I would love to do an ultimate
desk setup featuring one of your desks
Josh isn't using any speakers and
instead he's got three pairs of headsets
we got the wireless arctic sevens
resting on a hanger and below his desk
are the sony MDR 7 506 s and the popular
hyper x cloud twos looks like josh opted
for the evo desk pod which essentially
adds storage space underneath the desk
that's definitely a nice add-on the
cables are also managed very well with a
bunch of velcro straps to tie the wires
together and a cable rack to hold
everything up by the way that cable rack
is also another option that you can
select while customizing the death
the Jew CPC powering this entire setup
has a 7700 K 32 gigs of Dominator
Platinum's and the GT X 1080 founders
Edition very nice cable management
behind the PC by the way it's looking
really clean Georgia definitely has a
weird color scheme he said that he was
going for a brown silver black and a
little bit of white aside from the
inconsistency of the color scheme this
is a very clean and powerful gaming
setup Thank You Josh for entering up
next is Marco all the way from
Switzerland with another clean ultra
wide gaming setup featuring the asus rog
pg3 for 8q monitor that he hooked up
against the wall the desk is made up of
the ikea wobbly countertop and to alex'
your units very nice the keyboard of
choices from Logitech and he also paired
that with the G 900 mouse which is still
even til today after one year my
favorite Mouse of all time for audio
he's got the blue yeti pro microphone
that he hooked up to his focus right
audio interface and if he's not using
the msr7 headphones from audio technica
he's using the KRK Rokit five speakers
one thing I like about the setup are the
shelves that he installed against the
wall and the many items and props on top
of it he's got a glass shelf on the
right side holding up some photography
gear and gaming consoles while he hooked
up an alux add-on unit against the wall
on the other side it's definitely
strange to see this on a wall
considering is usually seen on a desk
holding up monitors but it actually
looks pretty good cable management
underneath the desk is looking pretty
good all the wires are off the ground so
no complaints here and finally we got
his custom PC that he uses for gaming
though it's definitely not the most
aesthetically pleasing build I've seen
but it definitely packs some heat I feel
like once you put any Noctua fans in
your PC it automatically looks like a
dumpster
I mean it's 2017 you would think they
would add some RGB or change up that
color scheme
I'm sorry Noctua you make really great
fans out there but please change the
hideous color scheme it's actually one
of the reasons why I haven't used any of
your fans since 2013 in any of my PC
builds also why did you go with 64 gigs
of ram if you're only using the PC for
gaming
I hope it wasn't because you wanted to
fill up the slots on the motherboard
because that huge jet engine cooling fan
is blocking the RAM sticks anyways it's
just a waste of money if you ask me I
would have used that money towards
custom cables but again that's just me
either way you have a very clean set up
with an overkill gaming PC Thank You
Marco for entering from Vietnam
we got Tong who is a student and this is
the setup he uses for gaming editing and
the occasional fab session according to
the notes ok I love the low-light
pictures in the dark especially if the
quality is this good but please it would
be nice to include a few daytime shots
to see what your setup would normally
look like but anyways moving on so we
got another ultrawide monitor wow this
is actually for ultra whites in a row
already I feel like everybody is
switching over to ultra eyes or
something what the hell is going on we
do have some RGB gear as well the CM
storm quickfire xti keyboard and the
logitech g502 mouse with an RGB lamp it
looks like he's got a few smartphones on
the desk as well as a random AMD cooler
ok look I don't mind random PC parts
just laying around on your desk but if
they have no purpose and they're just
sitting there it kind of looks dumb to
be honest it would have been way cooler
if you can mod it somehow and give it
some function held even if you use it as
a speaker stand or a coaster it would
have been better so there are no
speakers in this setup however Tong uses
the wireless arc test 3 headphones from
SteelSeries as his main audio source by
the way I do want to point out that you
didn't even leave a like on my video am
I not good enough for you Tong's pc is
beast you would have never guessed that
it's running on the horizon 5 1600 CPU
the color scheme cable management and
the par selection is on point excellent
job with that PC build one of the things
I recommend for your setup is maybe a
headphone hangar to hold the arc test 3
underneath your desk this is the one I
recently featured in my budget tech on
the $25 and it comes with two USB ports
so you can charge your headset while
it's not being used
I would also pick up a phone stand for
your g6 now if you want to charge your
phone at the same time this phone stand
from lamech Cal is pretty
straightforward and it will
the job done however if you want to be
more creative you can pick up something
like the adora solid grip and attach
that to your desk and you can basically
have it hold your smartphone with this
standing it tons of flexibility to move
your smartphone wherever you want on
your setup I think it's a pretty cool
add-on and as always I'll drop a link to
everything I recommend in this video
down below with some minor tweaks I
think that you can improve your setup
greatly thank you tongue for entering
wrapping up the episode is Warley coming
from the Philippines he's 25 years old
and his occupation is an SEO expert and
web developer and this is the setup that
he uses mainly for productivity with
some mild gaming finally a setup that
doesn't have an ultra-light instead he's
got 323 inch monitors from LG that are
hooked up to a desk mount and below that
he's rocking the coarser K 55 RGB
keyboard and the Logitech G 102 Mouse
the first thing that stood out to me
were those tiny Logitech speakers it's
funny seeing these massive monitors and
then looking down to find two tiny
speakers he doesn't microphone setup as
well which he hooked up in a smart
location it's actually right behind the
monitors so basically when he's not
using it he can hide it in the back and
they won't get in the way of anything
however the headset stand is in a weird
spot and personally I wouldn't recommend
using that headphone stand if your
headset or headphones have a wire
because it's gonna be annoying
throughout the cable around the stand
every single time you have to put it
back or take it out I would recommend a
hanger instead of a stand I see so many
people using one of these and hanging
their headphones and I just leave the
cable alone and it's like hanging down
which does not look cool so I'm going to
show you guys real quickly how you can
hang your headphones with a wire
attached so these are my sennheiser HD
800 as custom-painted headphones and of
course it has a wire on there what I
normally do is I would grab maybe about
six inches of the cable I would hold it
with my pinky and then I would start
wrapping the wire around the top headset
portion
takes about five seconds and once I get
to the top I you I plug in the jack
right inside just like this I tuck it in
and then BOOM
I hang it on the hanger I've seen a lot
of people who just leave their wires
hanging out of their headphones which
kind of the piece the purpose of
cleaning up your setup but anyways this
is the method I prefer instead of using
one of those headphone stands and
putting your headphones on top I feel
like you will clean up your setup a lot
by keeping it hidden underneath your
desk again I'm sure most of you guys
watching already know about this but
there are so many setups I've seen that
don't know how to do it or just don't
care but anyways moving on really good
work with the cable management I can see
that you used a cable raceway to run
some cables through and you hooked up
your power strip underneath the table
the only issue I have is with the two
cables running down those monitors I
would strongly recommend running them
behind the monitors towards the center
display and running both the wires down
alongside the monitor mount that way
it's hidden neatly behind it I'm
assuming those cables aren't long enough
to do that so in that case I would
recommend a 10 feet DisplayPort cable or
HDMI cable depending on what you're
using and once again I'll drop a link to
it down below simple modifications like
these would really improve the look of
your setup also down here we got the PC
and it's equipped with the horizon 5
1400 16 gigs of ram and you gigabyte gtx
1050 graphics card some minor tweaks are
needed to improve your setup but overall
it's a great start Thank You Wally for
entering so that is the finis episode of
setup wars as always make sure you guys
drop your comments down below and vote
on who you think has the best desk set
up and as always I'll announce it on my
social media platforms then guys so much
for watching if you love setup wars past
I like to show your support if you don't
please dislike it I'd rather take you
dislike rather than no ratings at all
anyways I love your faces thank you from
what thank you for much thank you so
much for watching and I will see who in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
