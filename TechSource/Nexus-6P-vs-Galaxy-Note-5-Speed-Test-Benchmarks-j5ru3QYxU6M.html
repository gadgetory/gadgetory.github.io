tech source and in this video we're
gonna be doing a detailed speed test
between the Nexus 6p
and the galaxy note 5 for those of you
who are new to my speed test videos I
basically compare the speeds of both of
these phones when it comes to booting up
opening up apps and browsing the web and
also some multitasking and other
benchmarks as well all in the effort to
see which one of these two phones is the
fastest so without wasting any more time
let's begin so before I jump into the
speed test let's compare some of the
hardware differences between these two
phones so the Nexus 6p is powered by a
Snapdragon 810 processor and three
gigabytes of RAM and the galaxy note 5
is rocking on Exynos 7420 processor with
4 gigabytes of RAM they both also share
the same screen resolution so they are
on equal playing grounds when it comes
to debt both phones are running the
latest versions of their software and
all apps have been killed in the
background they also have been connected
to the same Wi-Fi so it all that being
said let's start the show with a fresh
reboot I hope you guys enjoy the show
alright as you saw there the galaxy
note5 is pretty much faster in most
tests when comparing it to the Nexus 6p
but the Nexus did shine in the
multitasking test let me know down below
if you guys want to see any other
devices put up against the Nexus 6p and
as always thank you so much for watching
if you guys enjoyed a speed test make
sure to hit that like button to show
your support and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
