where they unveiled a new lineup of
vehicles including three amazing
concepts the starters show was of course
the futuristic BMW vision M next which
sort of resembles the shape and
proportions of the current I ate the
vision M next will be a plug-in hybrid
with a 2-liter four-cylinder turbo
engine and twin electric motors the
combination was claimed by BMW to
deliver 600 horsepower or enough for 0
to 62 miles per hour in 3 seconds with a
top speed of 186 miles per hour we're
looking at production dates in early
2023 which will replace the current ia
Tandy lineup now obviously electric
vehicles don't produce any engine noise
so BMW did something rather interesting
to give drivers an acoustic and
emotional experience they brought over
Hans Zimmer who was well known for his
films Blade Runner The Dark Knight
trilogy interstellar and more who
produced a sound for the car that feels
like it's straight out of a movie
imagine being in the cockpit of your
vehicle and hearing this every time you
accelerate
obviously you can turn the sounds off
but that's just one of the few sounds
that hound zimmer composed with the help
of Renzo Vitali who was the sound
designer for BMW I think it's a pretty
cool feature that adds a little bit of
fun to your driving experience this
sound was specifically designed for the
vision M NEX but each car will have its
very own sound profile the other concept
that caught my attention was the vision
I next a fully electric vehicle that's
supposed to last up to 373 miles on a
single charge it can reach 60 miles per
hour in less than 4 seconds and offers
level 3 autonomy which means you can
take your hands and eyes off the road
but you still need to be conscious and
be ready to take the wheel when you need
to the design of the vision I next kind
of makes you feel like you're at home
specifically your grandmother's living
room the interior is split into two
sections and it kind of gives off a warm
relaxing vibe the dashboard looks pretty
cool there are no visible buttons
anywhere just two massive rectangular
displays BMW is calling the technology
in this car saitec instead of high-tech
meaning that I will stay out of sight
and hidden until the moment you need to
use them the ennoble you says that there
will be a new car based on this concept
arriving in 2021 also at the next-gen a
vent BMW premiered the next generation
of its adaptive cruise control system
which will be able to detect and
automatically stop at red lights the
system uses these same cameras that are
already built into virtually all new
BMWs today which can already detect
speed limits and pass those on to the
cruise control system so the car will
automatically stop and hold at a red
light until the light changes to green
and that's when the driver has to tap
the cruise control button to continue
now because it's a new software feature
BMW will be able to upgrade existing
cars with this feature in the future
although remains a mystery about when
exactly it will launch and which cars
will get it first all of this technology
will eventually lead us to full
automation where the car doesn't need a
driver and can perform any and all
driving tasks I had a chance to
experience this at the next-gen event
before we even got into the car the
person used a smartphone to summon the
car which was already mind blowing on
the phone you can pretty much set a
pickup and destination location and the
car does the
the vehicle uses all the cameras and
scans for obstacles continuously while
driving it's amazing to see how far
technology has come I feel like it won't
be long until we start seeing driverless
cars in the streets I had such an
amazing time at the next-gen event in
Munich Germany I want to give a huge
thanks to BMW for flying me out there
and getting a good glimpse of what can
be possible and in here future if you
guys want to check out any of the cool
stuff I mentioned in this video I'll
drop a link to everything down below
things again so much for watching as
always I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
