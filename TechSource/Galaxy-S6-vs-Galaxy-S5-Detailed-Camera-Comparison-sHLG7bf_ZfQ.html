below for more info what's up guys and
welcome to another ultimate camera
comparison video this time we are facing
off the galaxy s6 against the last
year's model the s5 but Before we jump
into samples let's take a quick look at
their specs so the galaxy s6 and s6 edge
both had the same exact camera which is
a 16 megapixel rear-facing camera with
an aperture of 1.9 that can shoot up to
4k resolution at 30fps the galaxy s5
also has a 16 megapixel camera with an
aperture of 2.2 that can also shoot up
to 4k resolution in 30fps for
front-facing cameras both the Galaxy
phones have a 5 megapixel camera that
can shoot in 1440p at 30fps
whereas a 2 megapixel front-facing
camera on the s5 can only shoot up to
1080p at 30fps so that's it for all
those specs now let's sit back relax and
enjoy the show
the continuous auto focusing on the
galaxy s6 is really fast as you can see
here and it quickly detects the object
and focuses within milliseconds the
accuracy is also spot-on I've actually
used this phone for many camera
comparisons and not once has it not
focused on the object I'm trying to
shoot the galaxy s5 also does a great
job of those not as fast as the galaxy
s6 it certainly gets the job done I have
no complaints on either phone when it
comes to focusing so both deserve a
point for daylight 4k video both phones
deliver exceptional 4k footage the
Galaxy s5 is more towards the warmer
side and the galaxy s6 has more sharper
footage and a wider field of view giving
it that cinematic look once again I'm
going to give the point to both phones
for 4k video I really have nothing bad
to say about either one of them moving
to the low-light video is where the
galaxy s6 takes the lead the footage is
more clear on the galaxy s6 thanks to
its 1.9 aperture lens and even though
the footage is more sharper on the
galaxy s5 the s6 takes the point for
clarity after all if you're going to
take video at night you want to be able
to see what you're filming what does it
be guys it's edy from tech source and
this is basically the stabilization and
microphone test between the two phones
on the screen there will be an audio
icon somewhere on the screen and that
will basically tell you which phone's
audio is being used
both the phones are strapped on to one
device to ensure a very accurate
stabilization reading and they're also
being filmed in 1080p to make sure that
optical image stabilization is enabled
if that feature is available on the
phones for microphone quality the s6
takes the point mainly because of how
crisp the audio is compared to the s5 if
you go back and listen to it carefully
you can hear that the s5 has a lot more
white noise for stabilization the
obvious point goes to the s6 by far the
best stabilization I have seen in any
smartphone camera so far if the galaxy
s5 had optical image stabilization like
the s6 it might have stood a chance
moving today like pictures once again
both phones do a fantastic job although
this time the galaxy s6 has warmer
colors whereas the s5 tends to be a bit
on the cooler side both do an amazing
job capturing detail the sharpness and
both pics are amazing no doubt however
the s6 takes the point because it has
more chewer to live colors and because
of its excellent dynamic range shots
compared to the galaxy s5 the
front-facing camera is also a lot better
on the s6 my red shirt isn't as red as
it appears on the s5 the s6 actually has
the accurate color moving indoors and
away from the Sun the s6 captures more
detail once again you can especially
tell by looking at the ps4 trackpad you
can see the texture on that whereas you
can't really see any of that on the s5
another good example is looking at the
texture on this red cup so the s6 takes
the point for low-light pictures when it
comes to flash I think they both are
pretty much equal both do a great job
capturing the object but also suffer
when it comes to taking pictures of
white objects so I guess both deserve a
point for flash pics so the final
verdict I think that the galaxy s5 still
does a pretty good job for being last
year's model it was pretty much neck and
neck for some of the comparisons however
the real winner is the galaxy s6 so far
it has managed to beat the iPhone 6 the
HTC One m9 and now the galaxy s5 next up
we have the Xperia z3 the note 4 and the
Nexus 6 but anyways that is it for the
video I hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did please hit that like button if you
didn't feel peter dislike and let me
know what you think about my results do
you agree or disagree with me if you
want to see my previous camera
