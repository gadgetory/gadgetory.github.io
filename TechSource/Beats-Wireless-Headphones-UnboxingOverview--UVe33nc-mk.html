another unboxing today we're looking at
the beats wireless headphones so let's
get started
so these are the beats by dre wireless
headphones these go about 270 $9.99 on
retail and they are available in either
white or black so I'll be doing an
in-depth review of this as well the next
three days and I'll be going over the
controls the sound quality and even show
you guys how to pair this with your
phone so for this video I'm just going
to stick with unbox and do a simple
overview if you guys want to be into it
for this giveaway all you have to do is
subscribe comment and like the video and
I'll throw you in the drawing for May
7th
ok so let's continue on with unboxing I
would like the quality of the beats
boxes they always have the same theme
it's a red box or the magnetic tab you
can already feel the quality and I just
buy unboxing it the sound quality and
these are so crisp that it makes you
enjoy listening to the music let me
release it does to me so the box itself
is basically just hard cardboard covered
in our red finish let's go to and open
up this box and see what's inside it
real quick right there you see their
headphones itself already in its pouch
I'll take a look at it that later
actually we're going to go through its
accessories first and it seems that I've
been skipping my gym days because I
can't get this to open come on almost
there and there we go ok so here the
cables that comes with this first one is
actually the straight Jack with the
remote mic this obviously obviously
gives you access to your mp3 controls
for volume control pausing or skipping
your songs this is the standard 3.5
millimeter jack that fits all the
standard mp3s and even your smartphones
and just like all Beats cables of course
these don't get entangled I think that's
just another one of the reasons that
beats are notorious for okay so let's
move on this second set of cables are
the same as the previous ones only
difference is that the jack is an
l-shape instead and this does not come
with the remote mic okay so comes with a
total of three cables two of them we
just saw and this last one is the
charger itself it's a micro USB cable
that connects to your computer or any
device rather that is made for USB
charging and of course you can still
listen to your music while charging the
headphone okay so let's move on and see
what else they have in this box of
here this looks like a patch where they
keep all their warranty information and
product information and stuff like that
so let's go ahead and take a look at a
little quick this looks like a catalog
actually what all their products listed
on here and honestly bees just has so
many different products out there and it
just makes it really difficult to choose
just one okay moving on let's see what
else we got here this looks like a
sticker a simple sticker they provide to
you
this is warranty information they give
you a standard one-year warranty for
free replacement parts if it breaks down
which is always great to have we have an
information page to consumers about the
product no one really reads any of these
and the last but not least we got the
wireless guide showing you guys how to
pair the headphones what each button
does and some more useful tips basically
on charging and things like that this
actually also comes with a microfiber
cloth I failed to mention that in the
video or even show it to you but it's
basically uses to wipe off the
fingertips and stuff on the headphones
or the glossy section of the the
headband okay so moving on to the actual
headphones itself it comes with this
neat carrying pouch that comes with a
zipper I myself prefer zipping up things
instead of using buttons because it's
much more secure and I'm sure that's why
beats one with this kind of setup okay
so let's go to unzip this up and see
what's inside the pouch well I mean
obviously the headphones are inside
there but I'm going to put that aside
and see what the pouch actually has
inside of it so it's actually really
neat how you can fold these making it
really convenient to store in small
places so I think that's a really great
feature on these headphones so inside
the pouch here you can see a small slit
actually on the side of it and I'm
guessing this is the way you can store
all the charging cables so that the
headphone jacks it's actually it's big
and it looks big enough to store all
three cables if you even like so that's
it for the pouch I mean it's really not
much to say I mean it looks like a
sturdy really nice material so let's
actually bring up the headphones and
take a look at that real closely okay so
let's look at the functions on the side
of it basically shows you what each
button does I'll go over them later in
this video but honestly I think the
glossy finish they implemented on these
headbands really gives it a nice premium
look to it instead of using a cheap
plastic just like the other headphones
just overall great build quality in your
cellphones and I think that's just one
of the reasons why the price is a bit
higher compared to the other brands so
these questions actually feel extremely
so
I've had many head phones in the past
where the ear cushions I'm not putting
my ear after using them for about 15
minutes or so I actually put this on for
about an hour listening music and it
didn't bother me at all it feels so
light that you can barely tell it's
there so these headphones also extend
out a little in case you have a giant
head and the material is made out of
aluminum which looks pretty sweet I just
love how it's really easy to adjust the
headpiece making it really effortless to
putting them away I think honestly beats
did a really good job on the design okay
so the last thing I look at is the buns
on the side well quickly I'm just going
to go over them the top on you have the
actual power button you have your track
back and forward buttons the usual
volume down over here and the volume up
ons and that middle one over there is
the actual indicator light and last
button in the middle here is the play
and pause button you press it once for
it to play and you press it once for it
to pause and I think that's the easiest
button to find obviously because it's
the biggest okay so that's it for the
buttons I'm going to turn this upside
down real quick and here's actually with
a microphone is that I was talking about
earlier and of course you have your
headphone jack as well right next to it
so on the other side is I'm going to
show you a quick this is where your
charging cable connects to if you're
going to be charging your headphones
right there in between the cushion and
the outside right over there
so repair the system it's actually
fairly easy all you have to do is push
the power button and this lights up at
LED as you can see here and blinks
lighting your notes waiting to connect
to your Bluetooth device so that's it
for the unboxing guys if you want to get
