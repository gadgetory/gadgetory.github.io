from Texas and this is the instructional
video on how to build Ori on the five
hundred dollar gaming PC that I built
for the month of July if you want to
build yourself the best possible gaming
PC for only five hundred bucks then you
came to the right place but be sure to
check out the original video as well if
you want to see benchmarks and gaming
performance tests as well alright so all
you need to start building a PC is
basically a Phillips screwdriver and a
flat surface to work on that way things
don't roll off the table and get lost by
the way for those of you that are
working on carpet make sure you are
constantly touching the PC case that way
static doesn't build up in your body and
end up damaging the components also be
showing you how to install Windows 8.1
for free so definitely thumbs up on that
but that's basically it let's go ahead
and start the build process alright so
the first step is to lay the PC down and
move the cables aside next you have to
install the standoffs on the case but if
you want to know which holes to screw
them in you can bring your motherboard
over the case for a few seconds while
you determine which holes correspond
with the motherboard if you did
everything correctly you should have six
standoffs installed in these exact same
locations next up you have to install
the i/o shield now this is pretty easy
just make sure it's facing the correct
way by holding it next to the
motherboard for a second before you
install it go ahead and place the i/o
shield in the cutout near the back of
the case and apply some pressure to snap
it in place a good way to tell if it's
completely in is by checking it from the
outside and if all four corners are
visible then it's all the way in if it's
not then the motherboard won't fit so
that's another way to tell if you do not
install it correctly next we are ready
to install the CPU on the motherboard so
go ahead and press down on the log metal
piece and release it next you have to
match the embedded triangle on the
motherboard
with the gold triangle on the processor
so once you figure that out gently leave
the CPU on the socket now make sure not
to apply any pressure if everything is
correct it should easily fall in place
press down on the bar to lock the CPU in
place then we can move on to installing
the CPU cooler general rule before
installing the cooler is to figure out
how
you want to route the wire to connect it
to the motherboard I personally want the
absolute minimum cable slack so that the
case doesn't have a bunch of wires
hanging around so this is the way I am
installing the fan and I strongly
recommend you to do it as well
slowly bring the cooler towards the CPU
and with one motion lower it completely
down trying to match the brackets on the
sides with the hooks on the motherboard
do your best to try not to move the
cooler once it's set on the CPU
next up attach the metal brackets to the
hooks on the motherboard to the side
without the lock first and then once you
do that go ahead and do the other side
turn the handle all the way to the
opposite side to lock the CPU cooler in
place then you can proceed to connect
the cooler to the motherboard via CPU
fan connection after all that make sure
that the cooler is tight and does not
budge before moving on next we are ready
to install both RAM sticks match the gap
on the RAM sticks to the notches on the
motherboard before installing them slide
in both sides at the same time while
applying pressure equally with both
hands until it snaps in place you may
have to apply a lot of pressure to make
them snap in place so don't worry if you
do you won't break them repeat the same
step for the second Ram slot if you are
installing two RAM sticks now we are
ready to put the motherboard inside the
case grabbing the motherboard from these
sides gently lower it into the case and
be careful not to hit anything with the
motherboard as you can damage it once
the motherboard is flat you will need to
align the standoffs from the case to the
holes of the motherboard and also make
sure that the i/o shield perfectly
aligns with the connections from the
motherboard like this next up we will
need six of these silver screws along
with six rubber gaskets obviously the
gasket goes around the screw and the
screw gets inserted into these standoffs
you may need to move the motherboard
slightly to align the holes while
screwing them in which is completely
fine but it's important that you guys
don't over tighten the screws just yet
just simply install them until it's
comfortable we will tighten them later I
normally install screws in a crisscross
pattern so after installing one on the
top right corner I would move to the
bottom left corner and then the top left
corner and so on and so forth once all
six screws have been installed you can
now go through each one in a crisscross
pattern once again and tighten them to
where it's comfortable
don't over-tighten them as you can
damage the motherboard the best way I
can say this is by tightening them using
your fingers instead of your whole hand
if that makes sense so once all six
screws have been somewhat tightened it's
time to install the power supply so go
ahead and look for a bag like this that
came with the unit and take out the four
tiny screws that you are going to need
make sure to peel off the sticker in the
center of the power supply before
installing it also make sure that the
fan is facing downward otherwise you
will block the airflow and that can
cause some serious problems so with one
hand holding the power supply up use the
other hand and install the screws now
once again a crisscross pattern is
recommended once you get to the screws
in you can let go of the power supply
and focus on putting in the other two
screws once again don't tighten them
until all of the four screws are inside
next it's time to install the hard drive
make sure that the exposed area is
facing downwards and that the cable
ports are facing outwards before you
slide it in the bay now you can install
it on the bottom base as well but make
sure you do that first before you
install the motherboard because it kind
of got in the way so I had no choice but
to install them on the top which isn't a
big deal you will need two screws to
mount the hard drive in place they do
come with the case so make sure you
check your plastic bags and find them
you will need to install one screw on
each side you might need to fiddle
around with the hard drive to make the
hole up here but once it's visible like
it is here then go ahead and install the
screws and then same thing goes for the
opposite side so this is basically what
your PC is supposed to look like a
complete mess so we're gonna take this
time to connect the cables and do some
wire management first up is the 24 pin
connector that's connected to the power
supply we need to plug this inside the
motherboard and in case you ever get
stuck remember this simple rule if it
doesn't fit it doesn't belong there so
find the only 24 pin female connector on
the motherboard which is usually all the
way on the right side and connect it now
this is the hardest cable to connect
since you do need a lot of pressure so
don't be afraid to give it some force
you won't damage the motherboard unless
you purposely come in contact with the
components most of the time you won't
hear it's snaps so just make sure that
the hook is fully seated
another useful tip while you're
connecting all of these cables is to
make sure that
you are routing them in a way that they
don't interfere with other cables it
will help with the cable management in
the end next cable we are connecting is
the blue USB 3.0 it's actually the only
blue cable that comes out of the PC case
itself so it's really hard to miss this
one connects to the blue port labeled
USB 3.0 it's actually pretty
self-explanatory
make sure that the notch is facing down
before you insert it in next two cables
are the HD audio and the USB for the
front panel please go along the bottom
of the motherboard the USB connects to
the port labeled J USB one which is to
the right of the USB 3.0 and the HD
audio cable connects to the port labeled
J AUD one which is to the left of the
USB 3.0 the next set of cables are a
little tricky it's actually really easy
once you learn it but you have to check
your manual to see which one of these
connects to which pin as you can see
here it's easily labeled for me first
off they connect to the J fp1 connection
and illustrated above is the order that
you have to connect them to so locate DJ
fp1 connection on your motherboard which
should be to the right of the USB one
and connect the HD LED to the
bottom-left two pins and right next to
it connect the reset switch after that
connect the power switch right on top of
the reset switch followed by the power
LED negative and then the power LED
positive there is an extra pin sticking
out on the bottom right which is fine
that's actually reserved next we have
two cables labeled CPU and this is
needed to power the CPU but you will
only need one of these since the
motherboard has only a four pin
connector you can find that on the top
left of the motherboard right next to
the exhaust fan and the power supply
it's really hard to miss next up you
have to set up the hard drive so look
for something like this that comes out
of the power supply it doesn't really
matter which end you use I did end up
using the first one so go ahead and find
the back of the hard drive and go ahead
and insert the cable to the far left
side of the hard drive next you have to
connect the SATA cable and it should be
a black cable with white ends if you're
using a different motherboard look at
the manual and find out which ports are
the fastest in this case ports seven to
eight are the fastest and luckily the
ports are color-coded so it makes
everyone's job a lot easier make sure to
connect the SATA cable to the
onam connection instead of the top
because it will interfere with the GPU
if you have extra hard drives to connect
just follow the same process and use one
of the other ends from the same cable to
connect to your second or even third
hard drive also don't forget to install
the SATA cables for each one of them as
well next up we are ready to install the
graphics card but before we do we need
to remove these metal pieces near the
back always install the GPU in the first
PCIe slot for optimal performance but we
do need to remove these second and third
pieces from the back
I accidentally removed the top one as
well but it's not a big deal if you do
actually before we install the GPU let's
go ahead and hook up the exhaust fan
it's actually right next to it and it's
labeled system fan one so this is what
we have so far most of the cables and
hardware are installed the only thing
left is the graphics card and the PCIe
cables to power them up take this time
to do some cable management run the
cables near the top and around the case
away from the center of the case to
clean things up zip ties all your
friends so make sure to group up as many
cables as you can together and just
shove them to the side and away from you
as much as you can as you can see there
is a huge difference than before the
case really limits the cable management
so just do your best ok so now you're
ready to fit the final piece into the
puzzle the graphics card just simply
snap it into place and install both of
the thumb screws after that you need to
connect both of these 6 pin PCI cables
into the GPU now don't worry about the
extra 2 pin connecter hanging loose
that's actually normal so there you have
it a $500 gaming PC with all of the
parts installed the next step is to
install Windows on it and I'm going to
show you how to do that the free way the
first thing you're going to want to do
is to get on another PC and open up the
link listed in the description section
down below once you are here you need to
download the files labeled mount windows
and windows 8 is au once both files are
downloaded you will need a USB Drive to
mount the OS on to so insert your USB
into your PC and then run the windows
download tool step one is to select the
ISO file which you should have already
downloaded from my Google Drive and step
two is choosing the media type in this
case we need to select the USB device
because you want to mount the ISO on the
USB stick on step three you need to
select the USB Drive and then after that
click on begin copying this process
usually takes around 10 to 20 minutes to
complete and it will format the USB so
make sure that you don't have anything
important on them before continuing once
it's complete the bar will turn green
and you can go ahead and close the
program open up your my computer to
double-check the USB if you did
everything correctly you should have
these files installed inside including
the setup.exe file make sure all you
want to hook it up to your monitor and
that the keyboard and mouse are also
connected next go ahead and insert the
USB device in the USB 2.0 slot on the
left and not the USB 3.0 on the right
since it won't read from it just yet and
then go ahead and power on the PC once
it starts the boot sequence keep hitting
the Delete key on the keyboard so that
we can access the BIOS once you are in
the BIOS navigate to the advanced BIOS
features and hit enter for the boot
sequence we need to switch the USB 3.0
to the top so your boot sequence should
match what I have on the screen here if
it's not go ahead and change it once you
have finished hit the f10 key which will
save the configuration and reboot the PC
while it's booting up just sit back and
wait for it to load windows as you can
see it did read the USB Drive and it
will bring you to the Windows setup
screen so just go ahead and go through
the setup process and fill out all of
the required information and once you
get to the product activation window you
do need to type in the code that you see
on the screen I also left a link to the
code in the description section down
below as well once you enter the code
and hit next and accept the license
agreement you will come to this page
make sure to select Custom Install and
select the hard drive you want windows
to be installed on if you have only one
that it should already be selected by
default
once you click Next it will begin
installing Windows it should take you
less than 30 minutes to complete the
installation and at the end the PC needs
to be restarted as soon as I start to
remove the USB Drive and hit the Delete
key to access the BIOS once again go
back in the advanced BIOS features and
select the boot sequence once again and
over here make sure that the Hitachi is
set to the first boot device and
infinity is set to the second boot
device and then hit f10 to save the
changes and reboot once again after
reboots it will take you to the Windows
screen and it will set everything up for
you it will most likely reboot a few
times which is normal
go to the entire setup process for
Windows and once you are done with it it
will take you to the main page next step
is to install the GPU driver and the
Start menu I did leave a link to the
website down below just simply visit the
site and download the graphics card
drivers and install it after that you
are ready to install the Start menu
while this is optional and you don't
have to install it if you don't want to
I strongly recommend it since it will
make your life a lot easier so go back
to my Google Drive and download the star
dock program and run it it's already
cracked so you do get a free copy of
Start 8 and once you have finished
installing you now have a Windows Start
menu you are welcome anyways that's it
for the video I hope this guide helped
you guys on building a gaming PC and if
it did definitely let me know by leaving
a like on the video if you guys run into
any problems who have any questions at
all feel free to drop a comment down
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as possible also make sure you guys are
following me on Twitter Instagram for
all these sneak peeks and behind the
scenes for all my PC projects I got an
ultimate gaming PC coming up really soon
and it's going to be really awesome
but anyways thanks again for watching
this is that from tech source I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
