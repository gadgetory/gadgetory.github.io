welcome to setup wars episode 94 we used
to make your desk set up to get featured
on the channel wanna participate you
know what to do make sure to watch the
video linked down below let the set up
for is begin if you guys are shopping
around for your next game make sure to
check out g2 a.com because they have the
cheapest cd-keys available for pretty
much any game I'll drop a link to them
down below if you want to check it out
starting up the show we got a very
mellow and relaxing setup from Michael
he's got a 27 inch band cue monitor
hooked up on the wall along with a pair
of wave master speakers up top and a
pretty cool galaxy mural as well oh yeah
and that Joker poster on the other wall
I feel like adding any Heath Ledger
Joker poster in your room automatically
increases the badass level I don't know
maybe it's just me so on the desk we got
the Corsair strafe RGB keyboard and
Roccat Kone up your mouse sitting on top
of the perixx mousepad and it appears
that he drilled a hole for both the
liars
nicely done in addition to those
speakers on the wall he's also using the
popular hyper x cloud 2 headset which is
resting on a self-made headphone stand
which honestly just looks like a piece
of wood I mean it looks good though I'm
not bashing it at all I don't know what
that tiny robot thing is from but it's a
nice little props here set up along with
that wooden pencil holder next to your
PC
speaking of which it's packed with an
i-5 45 90 and an EVGA GTX 1080 and
finally we've got the cable management
no complaints at all everything is under
control I'm definitely loving the
atmosphere of the setup
job well done putting everything
together thank you Michael for entering
I love it when I come across music
production setups there's a nice change
from the usual gaming and Mac
workstations it's interesting to see
what music producers or mixers work with
so we got the 34 inch ultra lite from
Dell that's sandwiched by a pair of Adam
a 7x speakers and below that he's got
his MIDI or my tie out even how you say
that keyboard which is hooked up to the
Native Instruments audio interface can I
just call it a piano keyboard he's also
using the Corsair strafe RGB keyboard
and Logitech G 500 miles for gaming he's
rocking a total Beach Air Force Recon
320 which are hanging under the desk and
mixing music he's got the bear that I
make DP 770 pros which are sitting on a
really cool headphone hanger I'm not
sure where that's from but if you guys
figure it out make sure to leave a link
down below I might pick that up for
myself he's got someone who's mixing you
on a desk adjacent to his setup like the
DJ turntable and mixer from behringer
along with a rode nt1 microphone the
entire room also appears to be lightly
padded with some acoustic foam cable
management is spot-on
looks like the rackets holding up
everything and down here he's got the PC
that's powering this entire setup it's
equipped with an i7 4770k and an r9 280x
that pretty much wraps up this entire
setup we're keeping everything so
organized and clean thank you Nick for
entering enemy 3 we have row e with a
pretty dope looking triple display setup
so he's rocking 324 inch Samsung
monitors that are sitting on a self-made
custom-built desk which apparently 3d
modeled Wow under the desk on the right
side he's got his PC sitting on a shelf
which has an i7 35 70 K and an EVGA GTX
970
by the way props I'm coloring those SSDs
to match the color scheme for audio he's
using a Logitech v4 43 speakers and he
also has the logitech g930 wireless
headset I'm not sure about the wood
color on those combined with the black
and blue color scheme of the entire
setup to me it just doesn't blend well
together but to each its own he's also
using the Roccat is q FX gaming keyboard
and logitech g502 spectrum mouse that's
pretty much it on the desk cutter than a
few Rubik's Cube looking props once
again in wood excellent work with cable
management it looks like the monitor
cables are hooked up on the wall and the
rest of the wires are hidden neatly
behind the back board in some sort of a
rack if you stay consistent with the
black and blue color scheme I would have
liked your setup even more but
regardless it's a badass setup
nonetheless thank you ro e for entering
speaking of triple monitor setups we got
Scott next up with three 24-inch BenQ
monitors a Razer BlackWidow Ultimate
keyboard and a Razer Ouroboros mouse the
first thing that I noticed were not the
monitors but the two ps4s that he has
behind his PC like what possible reason
would you need to be stacked on each
other is one of them
affective or something I guess that
explains why you have six ps4
controllers to anywho the PC that's
pushing these pixels is powered by an
asus strix 1070 and an i7 6700 K cable
management is pretty good I mean there's
a rack holding up the power strip and
most of the cables and the wires V and
the PC are also wrapped together nicely
so I can't complain I also like that
mini-fridge you got down there by the
way that's pretty much it a
straightforward triple monitor setup
with a bunch of Star Wars posters and
figurines on the shelves thank you Scott
for entering plus but at least we have a
very interesting split setup from Thomas
looks like he's using an AC x34 ultra
light as his main monitor and a smaller
Acer version on the other side I would
guess for console gaming but he doesn't
have a console and it's hooked up to the
same PC so maybe he was using it to
watch videos or something I honestly
have no idea why he would have watched
videos on his ultra light because that's
what I do
the keyboard is the ducky fire 69
Edition and he's paired that with the
cougar 700 M Mouse both of which are
resting on the extended mousepad from
Corsair and I will give you props on
drilling that hole for cable management
I always love to see that I also like
how you're positioned your Logitech V
five or six speakers in all four corners
of your desk that's pretty interesting
he does have a pair of Astro 850 in the
corner as well the PCI starting to set
up is a beast
it's equipped with a 59 60 X and an EVGA
1070 superclocked Edition and cable
management holy this guy took it to
the next level and mounted literally
everything under the desk we're talking
routers power strips and even it's
freaking subwoofer that's a bit extreme
but hey look at how clean it looks Bravo
and very clean and better setup no doubt
