and in this video I'm gonna show you how
you can build an affordable gaming PC to
game comfortably in 1080p this build is
gonna cost you around $450 and if you
want to see the performance of this PC
and how it handles most of the games out
there make sure to check out the
benchmark video which I will link below
by the way you guys can use this build
guide for any PC you don't have to have
the exact same parts as I do because the
installation process is pretty much the
same across all computers even if you
have a different processor so before we
begin obviously you will need a screw
driver to install the components also a
large surface area to work with
preferably something that doesn't
generate static like a wooden surface
for example I also recommend using some
sort of a tray to hold the screws in
that way doesn't roll around and get
lost I don't have a tray with me now so
I'm gonna be using this mug instead and
finally you guys will need an 8 gigabyte
USB stick because this is where we're
gonna be installing the Windows
operating system and so make sure you
guys have at least 8 gigs but yeah other
than that I think we pretty much have
everything else let's begin the belt
guide alright guys so before we begin
this is what you'll need to do take out
the motherboard and put it on top of its
box when you guys are handling the
motherboard always grab it from the
sides do not touch the backside and not
touch any of the components on top
you'll also need the i/o shield and take
out the SATA cables that come inside the
motherboard one for each drive you are
connecting we are connecting one hard
drive so we're going to need one SATA
cable other than that obviously you'll
need your screwdriver and we're gonna
need the CPU as well where is it here it
is so yeah you'll need the CPU and the
heatsink now step one is to pop the CPU
inside the cover I'm going to show you
guys how to do that so what you guys
have to do is match the gold triangle to
the triangle on the actual cover so mine
is located over here simply just lift
the lever up open the cover once again
make sure the triangle on the CPU is
matching the triangle on the board
itself and just gently place it down do
not apply any force let it gently sit on
the socket once it's fully seated lower
to cover and then just lock it in place
by lowering down the lever this plastic
piece usually pops off if it doesn't
don't worry about it just peel it off
right now ready to install the RAM so
grab your RAM sticks whether you have
one or two and we're basically gonna
install them on the motherboard and
here's how you do that you can open
these up on the side and if you only
have two amp slots and you're installing
two m6 obviously just insert them you
don't have to worry about what order
they go in you guys are gonna have to
match the gap in the RAM with the notch
on the actual slot so as you guys can
see that does not match so I'm gonna
flip it around and it matches this way
so what I'm gonna do is gently lower the
RAM stick down evenly and apply pressure
from the top of hill it snaps in place
just like that if it snaps in place
you'll see that it's locked and fully
seated from the side so basically you do
the same thing for your other Ram stick
apply pressure at the same time boom
locked in place you get to go now if
your motherboard has four Ram slots and
you only have two sticks then there's a
certain order you have to install them
on your board is usually written right
on the motherboard itself on which slots
to occupy first and you can also find
that exact diagram on the motherboard
manual I know it's time to install the
heatsink I'm using the stock heatsink
that came with our CPU if you guys are
using a third-party cooler make sure to
follow the instructions listed in the
manual so that you can install that
instead now to install the heatsink it's
very simple all you have to do is match
the four pins to the four holes on the
motherboard make sure you position it in
a way that the cable reaches the CPU fan
header on the top here now one more
thing guys the heatsink usually comes
pre applied with thermal paste as you
guys can see so there's no need to
actually put in thermal paste however if
your cooler does not come with thermal
paste it's very important to apply some
in the center of the CPU
alright so once the four pins are
aligned with the holes it just gently
lower it down do not apply any force
make sure it just sits flush once it's
sitting down on the CPU you can then
push down on each pin in a crisscross
pattern so I'm gonna start off with this
one
then we're going to move across to this
one you guys can hear it snap in place
in this one and then finally this one
over here
alright so now that the heatsink is
installed we're gonna grab the cable
coming out of it and we're gonna hook it
to the CPU fan header on the motherboard
so grab a cable with the white tip make
sure that the pins align with the holes
and then gently insert it in just like
that alright now we're ready to put the
entire thing inside the case so go ahead
and grab your case put it flat on the
desk I'll lower this a little bit now
before we put the motherboard inside we
got installed the i/o shield so here's
what you're gonna have to do make sure
that the three circles over here the
holes are facing the bottom of the case
as you guys can see the holes are facing
the bottom I'm gonna turn it around this
way and essentially just press on the
shield until it snaps in place the trick
is to apply pressure on all four two
corners one by one until it snaps in
place just like that so if you did it
quickly you should see that the entire
shield is kind of sticking out from the
case it's not sitting flush with the
backside all right next we're gonna go
ahead and remove the back panel of the
case because this is usually where they
put the the screws that you need to
install the motherboards let's back here
just go ahead and remove it real quick
you're gonna need this bag of screws to
install the rest of the components so
make sure to hold on to this all right
I'm gonna put the case flat on the
surface so most cases have the standoffs
already pre-installed inside there so I
don't have to do anything other than
just lower down the motherboard if your
case does not have them installed you
have to grab these standoffs from the
bag and basically install them in the
exact spots you need to align with the
holes on the motherboard it's actually
really easy to figure out where it goes
so just gently lower the motherboard
down and don't place it down yet guys
just kind of hover it around
and trying to line the holes on the
motherboard with the holes on the case
and that's how you'll know where to
install this standoffs alright now it's
time to lower the motherboard inside the
case once again guys grab it from the
side you can even grab it from the
heatsink as you lower it down so make
sure to align the i/o back of your
motherboard to the hole cut out from the
i/o shield so gently lower it down make
sure you're aligning the holes okay if
your motherboard aligns perfectly with
the standoffs you'll hear it snap in
place once you lower the motherboard and
if it still moves around as you guys can
see it's not budging anymore
so if your motherboard is still moving
around it's not sitting flush on with
the standoffs so make sure it is sitting
flush guys alright now it's time to
secure the motherboard
against the case and we're going to do
that by using these screws you're going
to need five or six of these
now you can screw them in one by one
make sure you guys are tying the screws
with your wrist do not over tighten them
doesn't that have to be super tight
alright so our case comes with a single
fan and we're gonna hook this up right
now so instead of running the cable
across the board and just plugging it
down here it's gonna look really dumb so
what I'm gonna do is route it behind
that the case for better cable
management so I'm gonna run it through
here and then out from the bottom and
we're gonna hook it up to the fan header
on the motherboard this is what it looks
like
smash the pins and slide it in just like
that now if your case has more than one
fan or you could be installing more fans
in your PC then you can use the fan
headers that look just like that on your
motherboard and connect your fans to
that instead but for this build we only
have one so that is all we need to hook
up all right now it's time to install
the power supply so grab the power
supply out of the box along with the
small bag which comes with four of these
screws because we're gonna need them to
hook up the power supply to the case
alright so with the fan facing down and
from the back of the case we're going to
slide the power supply in just like this
and we're gonna align the holes on the
back of the case with the holes on the
power supply before we screw them in
alright so once the holes are aligned
just insert the screw don't over tighten
it just yet guys just enough until the
power supply is in place and then you
can go and finish up tightening the rest
of it so once all four screws are and
then you can go back and tighten each
one
all right now it's time to hook up these
storage devices I'm going to show you
guys how to install both a hard drive as
well as an SSD depending on what you're
installing in your own PC if you're
gonna be installing your hard drive make
sure you guys grab the bag that says HDD
if you're gonna install an SSD grab the
bag that says SSD pretty straightforward
for the SSD we're gonna need three of
these screws and three of these rubber
grommets
here's we're gonna do we're gonna slide
the screw through the rubber grommet
just like this here's what it looks like
you can install these screws on these
three holes guys we're gonna leave this
one empty pit so once all three two
screws are installed here's how you hook
this up to your case you're basically
going to insert these screws inside the
big hole first and then we're gonna
shift the entire SSD to the left that
way it locks in place so here's what it
looks like
just like that
shift it to the left and it locks in
place you guys can see it doesn't move
this isn't really required but if you
guys want you can tighten the SS da to
the back of the case by screwing it in
from this final hole over here it's the
same exact screw as the other three but
this is basically kind of like a safety
measure so that the SSD doesn't pop out
of place so this case supports up to two
hard drives guys you can mount it on the
bottom of the case you guys can see the
cutouts or on the top portion of the
case as you guys can see so just for
demonstration purposes I'm going to show
you guys how to install the hard drive
on the surface over here now for the
hard drive it's the exact same process
the only difference is we're gonna be
using the screws from the hard drive bag
like I mentioned earlier so we're gonna
get three screws and three grommets just
like last time and we're gonna install
them on these three holes over here so
these are the three screws we're gonna
occupy and I'm gonna leave this one
empty so with the screws facing upwards
and the ports facing outwards you guys
are gonna insert it from the back like
this while you align the screws with the
bigger circle as you guys can see so
you're just gonna have to wiggle it
around a little bit
pop the rubber grommet through just like
that and then slide it inwards
just like that you guys can hear it snap
in place just like before guys you can
use the forth screw and tighten the hard
drive to the case if you guys want
alright now it's time to hook up the
cables to your storage device so we're
gonna need one SATA cable that came in
the motherboard box and one of these
which is connected to the power supply
this is gonna be supplying the power to
your SSD or your hard drive so you guys
going to need one of these each for each
device you are plugging in so if you're
doing two drives you'll need two of
these and then two of these cables
luckily most power supplies have three
of these connectors
hooked up as you guys can see so here's
what you gonna do so gonna be connecting
these SATA data cable to the smaller
portion behind the hard drive by the way
guys these connections are exactly the
same for the SSD as well so just follow
along you know grab the cable and then
insert it slowly in until it snaps in
place and now for the SATA power cable
same thing just hook it up in the back
he's only going one way guys so if it
doesn't connect obviously flip it around
and try it the other way so once it
connects in you're pretty much set now
we're gonna be hooking up the other end
of the SATA data cable into the
motherboard so I'm just gonna route it
underneath here we're gonna plug this
cable in to any of these SATA ports over
here I like to usually start off on the
top so just grab your cable make sure
the clip is facing outwards and then
insert it in until it clicks just like
that
alright now it's time to hook up the
cables to the motherboard the first one
we're gonna start off with is the 24 pin
so I'm gonna route it through here make
sure both of these are connected
together first before you insert it in
this plugs into the 24 pin socket on the
motherboard it's really hard to miss
make sure the clip is facing to the
right by the way you guys are having
trouble just make sure to wiggle it
around a little bit until it snaps in
place it's important that this cable is
fully seated guys so make sure that
there is no gap between the actual cable
and the socket on the motherboard
make sure the clip is fully seated
alright the next cable is labeled CPU
I'm going to run the cable from the back
from the top well you're gonna connect
one of the four pins to the socket on
the motherboard slowly insert it in and
then you'll hear it snap in place once
again make sure this cable is fully
seated okay next up is the USB 3 cable
and this one has a blue tip I'm gonna go
ahead and route this one from here same
as the 24 pin cable and this connects to
the USB 3 header on the board
here be very careful with these pins you
guys if you insert the cable at an angle
you can easily bend them and it's gonna
be really hard to hook this cable up so
make sure you are inserting it straight
in just like that
next cable is the HD audio and this one
plugs in to the far bottom-left header
okay next cable is labeled USB and this
one plugs in right underneath the USB 3
cable that we just connected so it goes
in right here
okay finally I'm gonna be hooking up
these small cables for the front IO
these actually plug in to the pins right
underneath that these SATA ports alright
so the first cable gonna plug in is the
reset switch so with the letters facing
to the right we're gonna plug it in to
the third and fourth pin from the bottom
right I'm gonna need that we're gonna
put the HDD led once again with the
white letters facing to the right I'm
gonna plug it right underneath that now
directly to the left of the reset switch
we're gonna be plugging in the power
switch this one it doesn't matter which
direction it's facing and then right
below the power switch we're gonna be
plugging in the power LED - and then the
furthest on the bottom is the power LED
plus also guys here is a quick diagram
to show you where exactly to plug these
pins in if you need additional help
alright guys so now that you finished
plugging in all the cables the final
piece to completing the build is the GPU
of course so before we plug that in
we're gonna have to remove one of the
PCIe brackets from the back so we're
gonna go ahead and unscrew these real
quick
so we're actually gonna remove the top
and the second piece a bracket by the
way guys a quick tip it's always
recommended to install the GPU on the
top PCI slot on your motherboard for
optimum performance so we're gonna bring
it up close make sure it's aligned
perfectly and snap it in place until you
hear a click
afterwards grab one of the screws that
you removed from the PCI bracket and
tighten the GPU back in place alright
guys so if you follow my instructions
this is what your pc would look like
this is usually the time where I would
say work on your cable management but
because the case doesn't have a clear
side panel it doesn't really matter
because you're not gonna see through it
anyway so if you guys won't spend time
on cable management if not it doesn't
even matter if you guys know how to
install your operating system and the
drivers then you don't have to watch the
rest of the video you guys can just end
it here but if you guys enjoyed the
build guide and if it helped you at all
to build a PC or if you even learn
something dropping a like would be
awesome but for those of you who want to
know how to install windows and drivers
into your PC then you're gonna have to
follow along as mentioned earlier you
will need an 8 gigabyte flash drive as
well as a computer or a laptop that has
internet access
so grab your drive and head over to the
computer that has Internet access go
ahead and plug in the flash drive into
the PC and then follow these
instructions alright so once the USB is
inside the computer we're gonna have to
download the windows operating files and
to do that you guys have to visit the
website which I will link down below
once you're on this page you guys have
to go down here where it says create
Windows 10 installation media and I'm
gonna be clicking on download tool now
once this is downloaded go ahead and
click on it and open it up give it a few
moments for it to get ready and then
you'll see the license and Terms
obviously going to hit accept
so on this page just make sure
everything is correct the language
Edition and the architecture we are
installing Windows 10 64 bit and then
I'm gonna hit next and over here I'm
gonna be selecting what media we're
gonna be using obviously we're gonna be
installing the files on a USB flash
drive it says every I need at least
eight gigs of space just like I've said
before so make sure the USB flash drive
option is selected hit next and over
you're obviously going to click on the
USB Drive you guys I'm gonna double
check what drive that is but for me it's
gonna be the letter e so by default
that's already selected because that is
the only thing plugged in I'm gonna
going in next and let windows do its
thing it's gonna go ahead and download
the windows operating system onto the
USB so this product might take anywhere
from five to ten minutes depending on
your internet speed all right so once
all the files are downloaded and
installed on the drive you'll have a
message saying that your USB flash drive
is ready all I got to do is just click
finish and remove the USB from your PC
all right so once you have USB go ahead
and plug it into the PC that we just
built and then I'm gonna hit the power
button to turn it on now this is your
first boot you'll get a similar message
like this that says to hit f2 or delete
to run setup or f1 to continue so we're
gonna go in f1 and it should
automatically detect the USB Drive and
boot straight from the USB so there you
hope the detective the USB and the
Windows operating files on there so it's
basically going to take you to the
Windows setup page okay here we are in
Windows setup we're gonna go ahead next
install now so this is where you would
put in your Windows key if you guys
didn't buy one you can actually pick one
up for around 20 dollars it's really
cheap I'll drop a link down below it's
from SCT key comm and if you guys put in
the code TSS 2 you can actually get an
extra 10% off so after you put in your
Windows key go ahead and hit next
I guess over here we're gonna be
selecting which operating system we want
to install this is really important this
has to match the same operating system
as your Windows key so the Windows key
that I put in it was actually for
Windows 10 Pro not the Home Edition so
whichever Edition you have make sure you
select the correct one and then hit next
if you select the wrong one then you're
gonna get an error so on this page just
hit the accept license terms and then
hit next
over here it's very important make sure
you guys click on custom on this page
you're gonna be selecting where we want
to install the Windows operating system
on now obviously we only have one drive
it's the one terabyte Seagate drive so
you're only gonna see one option on here
if you guys have additional drives for
example an extra SSD or an MDOT two then
over here you can select which drive you
want windows to be installed on I do
prefer installing windows on an SSD
instead of a hard drive for a faster
boot and lo times so anyway is gonna be
selecting our hard drive and then we're
gonna hit next and now we sit back and
wait and let windows install the
operating system onto our hard drive
this process can take anywhere from 10
to even 30 minutes depending on the
drive speed so just sit back and relax
and I'll be back once it's done so once
the files get installed to the hard
drive your PC will restart a few times
until it finally takes you to the
desktop alright so once you get to this
screen just follow the instructions on
here and finish setting up Windows now
you guys will need internet access once
again so if you don't have a Wi-Fi
adapter or an Ethernet cable to plug
into your PC that you just built then
you can go back to your other laptop or
PC that has internet access because
we're gonna need that to download the
drivers for now I'm just gonna skip this
step
so once you finish all that it will take
you straight to the desktop so let's the
set up is complete it will take you
straight to the desktop and you're
pretty much done
the next step is to download and install
the drivers and you guys can do that on
your PC if you have internet access
unfortunately I don't have internet on
this computer so I'm going to go back to
my other PC download the drivers on a
USB stick and then bring it back and
install it over here alright so here are
the drivers that you need to install for
your PC if you're using the same parts
as I am because using different parts
obviously go to the manufacturers
website whether it's the motherboard or
the graphics card and download those
drivers instead so the motherboard we're
using in the build is the B 250 M H TV
from asrock so I'm on the asrock website
I'm going to scroll down here click on
support and then we're gonna be clicking
on download and these are the drivers
that we're gonna need to download so
first up is the realtek high-definition
audio driver so click on that for China
we're also going to download the Intel
LAN driver same thing China server and
finally the Intel management engine
driver those are the three drivers we're
gonna have to download from the
motherboard website next we're gonna
download the graphics driver so since we
are using an NVIDIA GPU we're gonna
download a GeForce experience once again
I'll drop a link to this website down
below so we have to do is click on it
and then go over here and click download
once all the files are downloaded just
open them up extract them to the desktop
and install them to your PC it's very
easy and obviously if you're using an
AMD GPU you're gonna have to go to the
AMD drivers website and select which
graphics card you're using for example
let's just say it's a 500 series and the
RX 580 you're gonna have to select that
and then hit submit
select which windows you're using and
then download the appropriate Radeon
software make sure you guys are
downloading the latest driver for me at
September 26 2008 een and just click on
download once all the files are
downloaded just open them up and extract
them to your desktop and install them
I'll show you guys an example because
some of you are actually confused on how
to extract files so here's one of the
drivers that I downloaded I'm gonna open
it up double click on the setup this
window will pop up asking you to extract
the files we're gonna click on extract
all you can leave it on the default path
which is the Downloads folder and just
hit extract once everything's extracted
this one that will pop up again same
exact thing open it up and click on the
setup but this time it's gonna ask you
to install the drivers instead of
extracting the files there was one thing
I forgot to mention about this PC and
that is regarding the power plan it is
very important guys that you hit the
windows button search for power plan and
set it to high performance by default
it's always set to balanced what it does
is once you set it to high-performance
the PC will run at its full potential if
it's set to balanced or power saver then
it's gonna under clock a few things and
the PC won't be running at its full
potential like it should so it's very
important guys make sure to switch that
in the power plan options and that wraps
up the build guide if you enjoy the
video or if it was that all helpful to
you guys dropping a like would be
awesome and if you didn't enjoy the
video please feel free to hit that
