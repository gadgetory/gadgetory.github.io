s6 in the camera comparison and
currently has the best camera you can
find in any smartphone but how will it
do against the s6 in terms of speed
let's go ahead and find out the twenty
two thousand four hundred million power
bank from EC technology is the most
affordable charger you can buy in its
class you can charge up to three devices
at the same time using the fastest
charging speeds for your device and it
even comes with a built in flashlight it
has an awesome compact design and comes
in several colors click on the link in
the description for more info so before
I jump into the speed test let's take a
quick look at these specs on both
devices the g4 is rocking a Snapdragon
808 chipset with a 6 core processor with
three gigs of RAM and the s6 is winning
at Exynos 7420 chipset with an 8 core
processor and 3 gigabytes of RAM so on
paper the s6 appears to be the more
powerful phone but as we have seen in
the past on my speed test specs aren't
everything
so both phones have their background
cleared and they are connected to the
same Wi-Fi network with their brightness
maxed out
they are also running the latest version
of Android on their respective devices
so with that said I'm gonna go ahead and
start the speed test with a fresh reboot
and let you guys enjoy the show
what's the weather like tomorrow where's
the closest Taco Bell what's the square
root of three thousand four hundred and
fifty six what time is it in Paris
all right so that was some pretty
interesting results even though the
galaxy s6 had better specs the g4 wasn't
really that far behind in some instances
the s6 was only faster by milliseconds
which is irrelevant in real-world use
the g4 is definitely better at
multitasking since it kept the apps
running constantly in the background for
faster access and the g4 proved to have
a faster browser in the JavaScript
benchmark and chrome tests so really I
think that the g4 one the speed test not
the galaxy s6 but what do you guys think
how much sitting hearing your thoughts
if you doing these types of videos and
want to see more then let me know by
hitting that like button and if you want
to see the g4 go up against another
phone and my speed test series then let
me know which phone you want to see next
by dropping a comment down below anyway
since again for watching this is that
from tech source I will catch you guys
in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
