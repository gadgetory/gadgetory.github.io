a video on the top five CPUs and GPUs
for 2015 so I figured I'd go ahead and
start off by doing the CPU version and
later the top five GPUs later this month
so with that said this is the top five
CPUs that you can currently buy for the
year 2015 so starting off the list is
the intel pentium g 32:58 coming in at
70 bucks this is a 3.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor with an unlocked
multiplier which means that you can
overclock it
it supports ddr3 RAM up to 1333
megahertz and it fits all LGA 1150
motherboards if you guys are in a very
tight budget and want to go in an Intel
build then this is the processor for you
next up is the AMD athlon x4 860 K black
Edition for just five dollars more this
is a 3.7 gigahertz quad-core processor
that can be overclocked up to 4.0
gigahertz and supports up to 2133
megahertz of ddr3 memory when comparing
the benchmark scores to the G 32:58 the
Intel processor actually offers more for
only five dollars less it beats the AMD
processor and single core performance
and overclocking as well however if
you're going with an AMD build with the
am3+ socket and you want to spend as
little as possible
then I recommend going with the x4 to
take advantage of the extra cores for
number three we have the popular AMD FX
6300 coming in at $89 with six cores at
3.5 gigahertz that can be overclocked to
4.1 gigahertz it's no wonder why this is
the most popular choice for budget
gaming builds especially since the price
has decreased from the original $100
price tag it supports 1866 megahertz of
ddr3 memory and fits all am3+
sockets when comparing it to the x-48 60
k processor the performance almost seems
identical however the 6300 remains on
the top for benchmark performance and
overclocking so if you're doing a budget
AMD build and have an extra 100 bucks to
spare then this is the CPU I strongly
recommend you guys to go with in fact
this is the CPU I'm gonna be using for
my next budget build coming in at number
four is the i3 41 74 around 130 bucks
quite easily
Intel CPU you can buy for budget builds
it's a dual-core 3.7 gigahertz processor
that has an integrated graphics chip so
if you really want to cut costs you can
simply use the CPU and not buy an
additional graphics card if you're not
going to be gaming or editing since the
CPU has a lock multiplier it's very
limited when it comes to overclocking
but nonetheless it's a solid CPU once
you pair it with a graphics card last
but not least we have the AMD FX 8350
bucks which is the same CPU I used in
the oriole filled with amazing benchmark
scores it's an 8 core processor clocked
in at 3.5 gigahertz which can be easily
overclocked to 4.0 and supports 1866
megahertz
of ddr3 memory on an am3+ socket when
comparing it to the FX 6300 the 8320
pretty much beats it in every aspect
except single core performance and even
then not by that much
the FX 8320 is a solid cpu for both
gaming and productivity but if you guys
are strictly building a gaming PC and
want to save 50 bucks then I recommend
sticking with the FX 6300 instead I do
want to give an honourable mention to
the i5 4690k as an all-around awesome
CPU for gaming that comes in at 230
bucks it's a 4 core 3.5 gigahertz
processor with an unlocked multiplier
that can be overclocked and it's only
$30 more than the 4590 with similar
performance compared to the i7 4790k
as you can tell by looking at the
benchmarks anyways that's it for the
video if you guys enjoyed it let me know
by hitting that like button to show your
support the top 5 GPU videos should be
uploaded within a few weeks if it's
uploaded I'll go and leave a link to
that down below so make sure you guys
stick around for that if there's a
specific video you guys want me to do
top 5 on next let me know on what
product by dropping a comment down below
also make sure you guys are following me
on Twitter because I'm going to start
building the budget bill for the month
of September and that is where I'm going
to be uploading all of the updates and
progress it's basically a thank you guys
so much for watching I will see you in
the next video
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
