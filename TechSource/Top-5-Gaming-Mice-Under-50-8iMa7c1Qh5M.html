past the top 5 gaming headsets monitors
keyboards and even mice but since it's a
new year I figured I'd continue this
series and show you guys my 5 personal
picks for the best gaming mice on their
50 bucks let's start the video first up
is the popular Logitech G 300s Mouse it
features 9 programmable controls and a
gaming grade optical sensor that can be
set anywhere between 250 and 2500 dpi
you can also customize the led using an
RGB chart through the software to better
match your color scheme and has a much
smaller form factor than others which is
perfect for anyone that isn't looking
for a larger gaming mouse also thanks to
its symmetrical organ AMA cosine both
left and right handed users will find it
quite comfortable to use next up on my
list is the Logitech G 700 s and now
this one is both a wired and wireless
laser gaming mouse with 13 programmable
controls for on the side 3 on the left
of the top left mouse button and 2 more
under the wheel scroll you can perform
simple commands or intricate macros with
a single click of a button
which is great for anyone that plays
mmo's you can configure up to 5 DPI
settings per profile from 200 to 8200
dpi and one of the main selling points
of the G 700 s is the responsiveness it
claims to execute commands up to 8 times
faster than standard USB mice regardless
if it's wired or Wireless it is
rechargeable and you can get anywhere
from 8 to 10 hours of pure constant
gaming and this is one of the mice that
doubles as a great productivity mouse as
well if you prefer a more simple Mouse
with less buttons the Razer abysus is
one of the best out there now normally
I'm not a big fan of Razer products
because of how overpriced they are but I
do make exceptions from time to time the
business is a straightforward simple and
clean 3,500 DPI Gaming Mouse with only
three buttons and as asymmetrical organ
AMA cos I niche is great for both left
and right-handed users and it has
dedicated switches on the bottom to
adjust dpi and polling rate of the mouse
one of the downsides of this Mouse is
the fact that you can't change the LED
color you are basically stuck with blue
so Thea
different color scheme for your setup
you might want to look elsewhere it also
has a flat surface which is great for
palm grippers but if you're a clock
gripper like me and are a fan of Razer
products then the DeathAdder is your
next best choice that's under fifty
bucks it has more of an arch which claw
grippers can appreciate and features two
additional buttons on the left side for
going back and forward once again the
downside of this mouse is that you can't
change the LED colors and it's only made
for right-handed users a great gaming
mouse for both left and right-handed
users is the SteelSeries sensei it's
well known for being one of the most
durable gaming mice out there it
features seven programmable buttons and
tournament grade components you can't
change the color of the LEDs but you can
turn it on and off if you want or have
it pulsate instead overall this is a
really solid gaming mouse for
competitive play and honestly I don't
think you can find a better one 450
bucks
there is a rubberized black version as
well if white doesn't quite go well with
your setup I do want to give an
honorable mention to one of my favorite
mice of all time the red dragon samsara
that has a 16,000 400 dpi sensor with 13
programmable buttons and 5 color modes
and lastly the M 901 Perdition which is
targeted for MMO gamers with 18
programmable buttons up to 16,000 400
dpi and even comes at an eight-piece
weight tuning set the only these are
also fully customizable and it's
available in a black model as well so
that does it for my top 5 favorite
gaming mice on their 50 bucks if you
guys enjoy these top 5 series make sure
to hit that like button and let me know
