same week on Saturday and I announce the
winner on Sunday on my social media
accounts and if you guys are new to the
set up series and want to submit your
desk setup and you have to watch the
video link down below for the
instructions and requirements this week
actually we have a special guest Frank
from random Frank P and he's gonna be
showing off his setup at the end of this
video but with all that said let the set
up Wars finally begin
already so the five lucky contestants
for this week are Jen caliper Dan Rolly
and LPG congratulations for making it
this week of setup Wars by the way all
the products I mentioned in this video
will be linked down below in the
description section for those of you
that are interested all right so first
up we have Jen and it looks like we have
a bumblebee setup we have a black and
yellow color theme going on with a
single dell 24 inch monitor and krk
speakers one thing I would strongly
recommend for you to pick up is an
extended mousepad
by the way due to popular request on my
previous setup war videos the products
that I actually recommend in these
videos will have its own special section
down below so it's easy for you guys to
find them also on the desk it looks like
you have the surface pro 3 which is an
excellent choice for a laptop tablet
hybrid and you also have the black and
yellow theme dxracer chair to go along
with your theme cable management is
great no complaints there and I'm really
liking your style you have an overall
very clean setup I don't see any
headphones on your desk so I actually
did spend some time on Amazon looking
for a pair of really awesome black and
yellow gaming headphones and I let the
link to that down below as well but I
hope you liked it and thank you so much
for entering setup wars next is Mark and
we have here an apple setup for the most
part starting from the left we have the
Apple 27 inch cinema display a 2012
MacBook Pro and an HP 23 inch monitor
hooked up to an HP PC this is more along
the lines of a Productivity set up with
your Logitech M 186 Mouse and Apple
wireless keyboards which is great
because we don't get to see many of
these on set up videos on the wall you
have a Star Wars and Ironman poster
along with some license plates which I
think has a really nice vibe to your
setup especially with those mkbhd
wallpapers cable management is also
great and it does look like you are very
organized with your stuff so a really
great job there one thing I would
strongly recommend for you to pick up is
the new Logitech MX master wireless
mouse your setup is perfect for the
features it comes with you can connect
up to three pcs to the mouse and you can
swap between them by hitting a button
which will not only eliminate the need
for your extra mice and clean up your
desk
you also have access to the same
gestures you would on a regular Apple
Mouse so it works great for your MacBook
as well I did do a review on it so we
should definitely check it out if you're
interested and also a bigger mousepad
would definitely help you out as well
but really a great productivity setup
you got there mark thank you so much for
entering setup pores next up is done and
it looks like we have a dual monitor
gaming setup now I can't tell if the
chair is orange or red but either way it
would have master setup better if you
picked up the same dxracer chair but
with green accents instead and maybe
even a wallpaper to match that as well
we have two BenQ 24-inch gaming monitors
on VESA mounts and on the desk is a
black widow gaming keyboard a sharkpoon
mouse a razer chimera headphones and
Samsung speakers all on top of a Razer
Goliath extended mousepad by the way
great choice on the extended mousepad I
like the collection of sunglasses you
have on the side there and once again I
am jealous that you get to sit in front
of a window great job on cable
management as well I don't see any
cables touching the ground okay now for
a few things that stood out to me first
thing is that the right speaker is way
too close to your mouse I know for a
fact that it'll be bothering you on
gaming so I would suggest that you maybe
move the speakers to the top shelf or
move the headphone hangar to the other
side and push the speaker to the right a
little bit to give you more space again
all of these recommendations are
personal to me and they're my own
opinions and basically what I would do
if I had that particular set up so I
hope you guys aren't taking it the wrong
way or getting upset when I say stuff
like that so another thing I noticed is
the gap between the monitors now I'm not
sure if that's how the mount is made or
if that's just your style but I
definitely think that it would not only
look better closer together but it also
helped productivity wise under those two
minor changes you have a pretty cool
setup so thank you dean for submitting
your desk setup
next up we have Raleigh a dual 21 inch
BenQ monitor setup ducky keyboard and a
SteelSeries mouse and mouse pad do you
have your red astro a40 s on the bottom
left of the screen I wish you would have
taken a pic of it but it looks like it's
hooked up to the side of your table
really great job with cable management
it looks like you use velcro straps to
tie the cables together and then you tie
the cables to the desk legs so a pretty
good job there I'd
any complaints one thing that bothers me
is the pen holder and the yellow cat
thing in the middle of the test I think
if you move those to the right side next
to your PC it wouldn't be as distracting
and also what's with the random hair
comb on your desk
but anyway is a really cool simple setup
by Rolly thank you for entering setup
words last but not least we have LPG and
it looks like he went with a triple
display setup from ALC attached to a
desk mount on the desk we see his mic
extension arm hooked up to his blue mic
and a Logitech G 430 headset hanging
from it also on the desk is the Cherry
MX keyboard and a Razer DeathAdder Mouse
I'm also going to give you a point for
using a GPU or whatever that is as a
coaster excellent job on the wire
management and you have a pretty sweet
PC in that Corsair 500 our case AMD FX
8350 the specs and parts down below as
well I'm not gonna give you crap not
having three the same monitors because
I'm in a good mood so instead I'm just
going to recommend some stuff view first
off is an actual headphone hanger that
you can attach to the side of your desk
near your PC you will definitely clean
up your desk and you won't have any
cables hanging down since you can route
the wire through the back of the desk
and straight into your PC second thing
is an extended mousepad and I always say
these in my setup or videos but if
you're going with a triple monitor setup
or even an ultra wide modernist setup an
extended mousepad goes really well with
it other than that you have a solid
setup thank you lpg for entering setup
pores alright so that's all the
submissions for this week voting begins
now so make sure you guys drop a
comments down below on who has the best
desk setup voting will end Saturday the
same week and now that's a winner on
Sunday on my social media account so
make sure you guys are following me
there if you want to know who win all
right so the special guests for this
week's episode is Frank from random
Frank P and he's gonna be showing off
his desk set up to you guys but keep in
mind that he is not part of the contest
so voting for his setup will not count
but with that said go ahead and take it
away Frank so starting off I'll show you
guys a desk tour first going off all my
pc hardware and peripherals and it's
really just to go along with my black
and white theme that i have it think it
looks really nice and clean that's the
style I was going for you can see I
haven't set up there and on top some
boxes in my router and stuff like that
but I keep it nice and organized so
quickly going over the desktop I will
start off with the stuff that I use
daily my daily peripherals and we'll get
into some of the more detailed stuff in
a bit I have the ATH m50x headphones in
white I use them as my secondary pair of
headphones the coarser gaming k70
keyboard which is really nice with the
white key caps getting along with my
theme and the lights are always
customizable this is my logitech g502
proteus core Gaming Mouse it enhances my
gaming experience greatly and my daily
headphones are the master op Edition AKG
k7 x axis they are open backs have a
great soundstage amazing for gaming and
I have them hooked up to my file a 10k
headphone amp and DAC which is mounted
as well as a USB 3.0 hub and a
controller from my desk but I'll show
you guys that in a minute this is my
random Frank P custom mzx th for 40
nothing special inside at the AM dat 350
gigabyte r9 290 and these are the LG 34
um 67 ultra wide monitors they are
absolutely great for gaming never gamed
on 21 by 9 ratio before so it's really
cool as you can see I have them in the
back rigged up with this custom kind of
a monitor mount so I can have the one on
the bottom at my primary monitor and the
one on top is like my overhead it works
really well so I can be gaming on the
bottom and on top I can have like
Twitter twitch OBS or xsplit just like
that as an overhead these are some other
headphones I have on the side if I want
to switch them out they get different
sound stage sound signatures and a few
bins and cubbies just to like throw
random papers in or cables and pretty
much just like jumped roads underneath
my desk and now going over to the
control that I talked about before I
have the uplift desk 900 and as you can
see it moves up and down at the touch of
a button I have it set for usual around
34 inches when I'm sitting down and
gaming it can go as low as 24 inches all
the way up to forty nine point five
inches for like a standing desk so you
want to switch it up and it's good for
your back you can do that and it goes
really really high as you can see this
is my custom built entertainment center
it looks like it's floating and on top
of that I have my mounted 42 inch vizio
tv with the Ambilight LED strips and the
back I said I can change the color
depending on what game I'm playing this
is my vizio soundbar they connect to the
TV obviously and also has a subwoofer
underneath my bed which is great for the
bass and explosions but I'm playing
games like Battlefield as well as these
two wireless satellite speakers and it
all adds to that 5.1 surround sound
experience and I just like the way how
it looks like everything is floating
there
just my overall setup I can lounge back
on my bed and console game or whatever
to my battle station in game and it's
all a really great unique experience all
right so that's it for his desk setup I
hope you guys enjoyed it a huge thanks
to Frank for coming on the show he also
has a tech channel with a bunch of cool
