and welcome to another build right here
on the channel and as you guys can see
the format is slightly different so
we're gonna be building a custom black
and blue gaming and productivity PC with
water cooling parts and I know I haven't
done a water-cooled build in such a long
time so I figured now's the time to
bring those back on tech source and I'm
actually gonna start doing more of these
in the next few months so stick around
this is also a very special project for
me because once I'm done building it
we're gonna be auctioning this through
ebay for one of the charities that I
picked which is I have a Dream
Foundation the charity provides support
to young people from low-income
communities from kindergarten all the
way through college so all the proceeds
that I make from the auction will go
directly to them and to help with this I
have teamed up with Intel and Seagate so
huge thanks to them for partnering with
me and making this video possible so
let's take a look at the parts real
quick that I picked up just for this
build starting out with the processor
we're gonna be going with the i7 8700 k
it's a six core processor which is great
for CPU intensive tasks whether they're
screaming games or doing graphic design
or editing video and stuff like that so
a very solid pick for that over here we
got the case that we're gonna be using
this is the courser 740 courser err 740
case it's a full ATX chassis zand one of
things I really like about the case is
not only is it large enough especially
for a water-cooled build but also the
airflow is amazing and it's split into
two parts so I can hide the power supply
extra cables and even the hard drives
behind the actual case usually when I do
these types of builds I don't put too
much focus on the actual storage device
so we're gonna change that up this time
around because we're gonna be doing
something a little different we're gonna
be using the Intel obtained memory and
we're gonna combine it with the Seagate
4 terabyte barracuda hard drive but
those of you that are familiar with
Intel obtain memory it essentially gives
you the ability to achieve as as these
speeds but at a cost of a hard drive
this is really great for people who are
on a tight budget people who can't
necessarily afford high storage as says
these because essentially you're paying
for a hard drive and you're combining it
with the OP tape memory stick which
doesn't cost that much more and you're
getting SSD speeds and more storage at
the same time since we are using a
coffee like CPU I went with the MS
z3 70 gaming pro motherboard ok so a few
other parts I picked up they pick up
some blue paint because I'll be custom
painting some parts of the case I feel
like there's just way too much black in
there and this is a black and blue build
so I want to add some blue contrast in
there to kind of blend nicely with the
overall color scheme a few other things
I picked up of course I have to have my
custom cables these are from cable mod
and each of these cables already come
sleeved with their brand-new aluminum
cable comb and then we got some fittings
of course we got some in blue and some
black fully soft tubing and program I
want the tried and Zeo RGB sticks of
course these are 32 gigs and I went with
4 sticks because I wanted to occupy all
4 slots on the motherboard I almost
forgot about the GPU and a lot of you
guys know I love doing overkill builds
with SLI which is unnecessary
it's the text sort of style but I
decided to change things up a bit and go
with a single GPU and we're going with
none other than a single Titan X P
ladies and gentlemen I'm not too
concerned about the green GeForce logo
on the side here because we are going to
be taking this apart and I'm gonna be
adding a GPU block on here so it can't
even see that and finally we have to
stop the show guys this is e Ches fluid
gaming kit this is the Olin one water
cooling solution perfect for beginners
who want to get into water cooling and
also it doesn't break the bank they have
several different kits to choose from I
think it starts at $150 and it goes up
to 240 for the high end fluid gaming kit
which is actually the one I'm using
right here this is the a 240 G this kit
comes with everything you need to do a
fully custom water cold bill that comes
with a CPU block GPU block it's got soft
tubing and of course you get a pump and
reservoir combo with a 240 millimeter
radiator now because this kit comes at
only a single 240 millimeter radiator
you guys do have the option of adding
more on the side UK does sell these
separately these are expansion packs for
the fluid gaming kit you have options to
add a 120 millimeter radiator as well as
a 240 millimeter meter as well these
come with their fans already included
which is pretty cool one thing I do want
to mention is that the entire fluid
gaming kit is May
out of aluminum parts which is why
they're lighter and they're more
affordable there's a lot of people out
there that are paranoid about galvanic
corrosion by mixing metals but the thing
about the fluid gaming kit is that it's
all made out of aluminum even the
expansion packs so you guys don't have
to worry about mixing metals and that
way galvanic corrosion does not even
occur in fact the performance difference
is not that much when you compare eks
gaming fluid kit to a high-end custom
loo PC featuring brass or even copper
parts but anyways with that said let's
finally take these apart and put
together the PC I'm also going to show
you guys the installation process of the
Intel octane memory let's begin so the
fan configuration is going to be
slightly different in this case because
it's so big and there's so many places
to mount radiators and fans basically
what I've decided is I want the top
radiator to be an exhaust and everything
else will be essentially intake so cold
air coming in from the side over here
cold air coming in from the bottom and
cold air coming in from the side over
here I'll be mounting one radiator on
the top here and the other 240 will go
on the side and that is the
configuration I'm going with and I'm
going to be using the new coarser RGB
fans that way I can just sync them all
together with the commander Pro and
control the RGB lights
so the build is finally complete and I'm
calling it glacier it's powerful yet
silent and I think I did a great job
putting it together the custom paint job
combined with the custom cables from
cable mod as well as the blue coolant
really makes the entire build pop the
backplate on the GPU was looking a bit
too bland and I don't like showing off
those silver screws so I reached out to
v1 tech and they sent over one of their
custom-made back plates for the Titan XP
and it's looking a lot better I also
wanted to cover up the backside of the
fans that are facing down because the
cables are visible so I decided to throw
in some fan grilles again from v1 tech
alright so before you dive into the
temps and performance I do want to talk
a little bit more about the octane
memory since that is what this PC is
running on to set it up it's very simple
just insert the opt in memory module
into your supported motherboards m dot 2
slot and screw it in place afterwards
you will need to get into your BIOS and
change up a few settings you will need
to switch the SATA mode to obtain mode
as well as changing the following
settings as well
whichever options are available to you
next step is to download and install the
optin memory software which i will link
below and once you are done with those
just open up the application enable
update memory and restart your PC it's
as easy as that so as you begin using
your PC the optin memory module
will learn what data you need to access
frequently and cache it on its memory to
speed things up basically what this
means is that if you constantly use the
same applications over and over again
your PC will take note of those
applications and open up them faster
this affects a lot of things like boot
I'm launching games loading saved games
and everyday tasks like transferring
data using email applications and even
window search in fact I tested this out
by comparing the loading speeds to my
SSD and it's actually shocking to see
that even in some tests the optin memory
combined with the Seagate hard drive
proved to be faster than the traditional
SSD the only downside is that you won't
be able to fully optimize the obtained
memory for applications that you don't
use often as well as large file
transfers those will be transferred from
the hard drive normally overall I do
think the investment is worth it because
you save a lot of money in the process
you get crazy high-capacity I think up
to 12 terabytes and you get SSD speeds
imagine having a 10 terabyte SSD right
in your PC - the premium price you would
have paid for it
but anyways because want to check out
the obtain memory and the Seagate
Barracuda hard drive I'll leave a link
to them below now let's get into the
good stuff the performance this all in
one fluid gaming kit from ek is amazing
I don't know if you guys are ready for
this but check this out I was able to
push my 87 under K to 5 gigahertz and
just for reference this comes stocked
with a base clock of 3.7 gigahertz so
that is a 1.3 gigahertz overclock I had
to push the voltage all the way up to
one point four volts in order to achieve
this but the system is stable with great
temps thanks to the fluid gaming kit the
GPU temps are also very impressive 31
degrees on idle and only 55 degrees on
full load that is with an overclock by
the way an extra 200 megahertz on the
core clock and 600 megahertz on the
memory pushing the Titan XP to a stable
boost clock of 2012 megahertz
needless to say gaming was a joke in 4k
resolution over 60fps and high settings
for pop G well over 100 for GTA 5 on
very high settings and over 60 FPS on
destiny - on the highest settings there
is nothing this PC can do and the best
part about all this is how quiet it
remains I lower the fan speed on all the
fans to 60% which is around a thousand
rpm per fan and the entire PC is dead
silent
I can say without a doubt the fluid
gaming kit from ek is hands-down one of
the best investments you can make for
your PC if you want to get into water
cooling but aren't experienced enough or
maybe you just want a silent PC with
cool temps and better performance I mean
this is the kit for you no need to
stress over what parts are compatible
with your PC what size fittings you'll
need with reservoir pump combo spending
hours of your life bending tubes I mean
everything is already included in this
kit like I said earlier they do have
different tiers starting at just 150
dollars depending on what parts you want
water-cooled in your PC if you ever want
to expand your loop ek does offer
expansion packs which are sold
separately whether you want a larger
radiator different colored fittings a
larger reservoir different colored
coolant I mean there is a bunch of
options to fully customize the gaming
kit to fit your color scheme but please
keep in mind that if you end up using
the fluid gaming kit you have to stick
to aluminum parts because mixing metals
will damage your PC from my time using
the ek fluid gaming kit I have to say I
am very impressed not only because of
how easy it was to put together but also
the performance you get by spending just
a little bit more anyways I hope you
guys enjoy this video if you did tossing
a like would be awesome but if you guys
didn't I encourage you to leave a
dislike that's completely fine too
again a huge thanks to Intel and CJ for
sponsoring this video if you guys want
to boost the speeds of your PC make sure
to check out the Intel update memory
with the Barracuda hard drive from
Seagate I'll drop everything mention
this video down below as I said earlier
in this video this build is being
auctioned off for charity and the
organization that I chose is the I have
a dream foundation where they provide
support to young people from low-income
communities from kindergarten all the
way through college and you guys can
find more information for the charity
link below as well thank you again so
much for watching I do appreciate it and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
