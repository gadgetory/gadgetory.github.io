appears to be one of the best
smartphones so far for 2015 Samsung has
greatly improved their design from last
year's cheap plastic build for the
galaxy lineup but no phone is perfect
which is why I'm here to give you ten
reasons why you should hold off on
buying the Galaxy Note 5 before all the
dislikes start pouring in I want to
quickly say that these are all my
opinions and you guys might not agree
with them so with that said let's go
ahead and start the video all right so
I'm gonna start off with the obvious
reasons with number one being that the
note 5 does not come with a micro SD
card slot I'm sure there were a lot of
people upset when they found out that
the phone does not come with an
expansion slot unfortunately you can't
expand this memory which means that you
are stuck with the 32 gigabyte model or
you can pay more for either these 64 or
even the 128 gigabyte versions reason
number 2 is the removable battery
feature
unfortunately users can no longer remove
the backplate and swap in a new battery
whenever they want instead Samsung has
added a quick Wireless charge feature
which juices up the smartphone faster
than standard wireless charging another
missing feature is the IR blaster you no
longer can use your smart phone to
control devices like your TV or
basically anything else with a built-in
infrared blaster lots of people that use
this feature daily will definitely be
upset but there are plenty of other
smart phones that have an infrared
blaster like the HTC One m9 LG g4 galaxy
s6 and the s6 edge not only is the phone
a major fingerprint magnet but the glass
can also get easily scratched just from
normal use in fact that managed to get a
few minor scratches on the back already
just from moving it in and out of my
pocket instead of adding a case on the
phone there is an easy fix to this
without adding any Bowl to the smart
phone an awesome skin from the brands
will not only protect it from scratches
but it will also solve the fingerprint
problems but I'll go in and leave a link
down below on where you guys can get
some for anyone that's interested
Ouiser number five is the speakers I
mean it's 2015 and Samsung has yet to
implement front-facing speakers normally
a lot of people don't care about having
speakers on the side but for me it's
actually a big deal when I'm watching
videos or movies I hold my smartphone up
with both of my hands and that gets in
the way of the speaker grills
which ends up distorting the sound I'm
basically forced to either use earphones
or watch it on my PC besides the
inconvenience the experience you get
from fun facing speakers is noticeably
better number six has to do with the
capacitive buttons I was never a fan of
the on screen buttons unless they are
actually on the display itself the note
5 has them located on the bottom next to
the home button which is not only
inconvenient to reach but are really
sensitive as well since the phone has a
large screen I naturally have my hand at
the center for a good grip well because
the buttons are located all the way on
the bottom it kind of defeats the
purpose of using it one-handed
if the capacitive buttons were located
on the actual screen then it would have
been a lot more convenient another issue
I had to deal with is the sensitivity I
find my self consistently touching the
buttons by accident and it becomes
extremely frustrating at times this
leads me to number 7 the phone size I
personally think that five point seven
inches is way too big a five or even a
five point one inch display is the sweet
spot for a lot of people and I would
have even been fine with a 5.5 inch
display I get that this is the note
series but this is borderline of it
becoming a small tablet this makes it
unusable with one hand and if you're
thinking about adding a case to it then
it'll be that much more difficult
carrying it around in your pockets
reason number eight is TouchWiz we all
love to hate Samsung's skin on their
smartphones even though it dramatically
improved from last year I still hate the
look of it and the features it offers I
know you can download and install
launchers that will change most of the
appearance but in the end it's still
TouchWiz for example why doesn't
TouchWiz offer a search option for apps
what if I have a bunch of apps and I
want to quickly search for one and open
it up instead of digging through folders
you would think something so simple
would have already been implemented I'm
not a simple feature that's missing from
TouchWiz is the quick scroll to the top
while browsing I mean really Samsung why
can't I just tap on the top of the
screen like I do on my iPhone and have
it quick scroll to the top I mean I can
go on and give a lot more examples but
for the sake of the video I'm just gonna
stop there reason number 9 is that the
phone is in waterproof and this is more
of a personal preference but I do like
to go out swimming during hot days and
having a waterproof phone really adds to
the fun with my z3 I'm able to film
underwater or even listen to music right
next to the pool without worrying about
getting water on
to damage the phone I can't do that with
the note 5 the last and final reason is
the lack of a vibrate switch this is
something I use every single day and it
really becomes annoying having to turn
the phone on just to switch it all the
way down to vibrate I mean you can't
even switch it to vibrate while the
phone is off which I would have settled
for anyways that's up for the video if
you guys haven't disliked the video yet
go ahead and do it right now since I
went ahead and reminded you but if you
guys did enjoy the video let me know by
leaving a like also if there's a reason
I did not mention in the video about
things that you don't like about the
note 5 then let me know by dropping a
comment down below but that's basically
it thank you so much for watching as
always and I'll see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
