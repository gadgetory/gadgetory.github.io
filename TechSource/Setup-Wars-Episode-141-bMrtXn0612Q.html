but nonetheless we are back on track
welcome to set up wars episode 141 where
you so much a desk set up you get
featured on the channel so if you guys
want to participate make sure to watch
the video linked below
with that said let the setup boys begin
okay so yeah I'm just gonna I'm just
gonna hand this over to you right now
this is this is your seal of approval I
mean there's no explanation needed I
mean look at this setup actually this
isn't even a setup it's a freaking
battle station so yeah normally I wait
to do the episode and then review the
pictures and then determine if it's seal
of approval worthy but in this case I
looked at one picture I'm like yep
without a doubt that is the setup of the
gods
so I've see if you're watching this
congratulations you see was ready to get
shipped out so toss me an email you also
get a hundred dollars in cash and a text
source t-shirt so if you're interested
any other surprises again toss me an
email so let's try and break this down
starting from the massive quad display
setup he's using 338 inch Acer monitors
I mean these are 38 40 by 1600 freesync
monitors with a 75 Hertz refresh rate
and there's a single 29 inch LG ultra
light on top as an overhead absolutely
mind-blowing the TV up top is a 65-inch
4k TV from LG and surrounding the
displays are custom made acoustic panels
each individual piece sticking out is
actually made out of wood that he
painted and I gotta say it looks awesome
and that's not the only thing that's
custom-made the massive 15-foot desk was
built with cable management in
that a single wire is in sight other
than the headset cable hanging from
underneath the desk and speaking of
cable management look at where his PC is
mounted all the way on the left side
against the wall I just look out for the
PC is from the monitors and his keyboard
and mouse
this means idea to drill a hole in the
wall and use extension cables to run it
all the way to the back of his desk this
is definitely the cleanest cable work I
have seen in a very very long time on
the massive desk he's got a white Tesoro
grand keyboard with the razor Mamba
Mouse in the middle and on the far left
he's got his console setup a white ps4
and the HTC vive VR headset while on the
right side is a regal planner 2
turntable for audio he's got two massive
r500 floor speakers from keV on each
side along with a central speaker and a
subwoofer both of which are underneath
his desk if he isn't waking up the
neighbors with those massive speakers he
uses these Sennheiser HD 558 headphones
which is connected to his PC directly
from underneath the desk and speaking of
connecting directly to his PC he even
hooked up a USB hub with an SD card
reader on there here so it's easy to
access I mean this guy literally came up
with everything beautifully executed I
also got to give huge props to FC for
balancing the lighting so well I mean he
put them in the perfect places to make
the setup pop we got some behind the
monitor underneath the TV stand and in
the corners I also like both of those
custom-made base traps on these sides of
the wall with the built-in lighting as
well it's definitely a nice touch the
icing on the cake has to be the built-in
hundred thirty five inch projector that
literally comes down from nowhere
there's a custom slit that he cut in the
roof which is where he pulls it out of
and there was no way I would have
noticed it if you didn't take a picture
of it as if the 65 inch 4k TV isn't big
enough this guy's rocking a hundred
thirty five inch projector
powering the beast of a battle station
is his PC that's equipped with a 1950 X
thread Ripper 128 gigs of ram and two
Asus Strix 1080 T eyes for storage
disguise walking to one terabyte 960
Perl m2 SSDs very very nice this is
hands-down the best setup I have seen on
the show and it's gonna be really
difficult to beat we got the master of
symmetry cable management and creativity
right in front of your eyes ladies and
gentlemen congrats on winning the seal
of approval and the key to my heart and
most importantly thank you for entering
if you guys want to check out his
channel I'll drop a link below he also
made a video on his setup so you guys
want to see how he put it together
make sure to check him out ro heat is up
next with a triple monitor setup which
kind of looks like big PS Vita's and
actually looking at the notes it looks
like these are PlayStation 3d displays
that actually makes more sense he's only
16 and this is the setup he uses for
mostly editing and casual gaming what's
interesting about this setup are his
speakers normally people put speakers on
top of wall shelves but he decided to
hang them upside down which is an
interesting approach
I'm guessing he did this so that he can
run the speaker cables straight down
from the center because there's no way
to actually route it behind the wall
shelf so that's actually pretty clever
right smack in the center is a kylo Ren
LED light saber and below that we got
the Razer Tartarus chroma key board the
Death Adder chroma Mouse and what in
God's name is that a ten dollar keyboard
from Walmart surely I have taught you
better
Rohith I am honestly disappointed there
are even some amazing keyboards for
around $20 on Amazon even if it's
temporary I would recommend getting
something like this in the mean time
which I will link below but a keyboard
from Walmart Y on the left we got his
ps4 console with two pairs of Astral
headsets the a 50s for the ps4 and the a
40s for the PC personally I think Astros
are overpriced for what they offer and
you could have used that extra money
towards something better but that's just
my opinion
great work with the cable management we
got a Signum holding up all the cables
and there's Eve
a custom shelf built on the other desk
to hold up your MacBook Pro nicely done
also on the side we got a blue Yeti Mike
Huckabee a boom arm and his PC that's
built inside the sv40 elite it's got
assembly some hundred K 32 gigs of RAM
and he gigabyte gtx 1070 there are a lot
of things I can recommend for this setup
but since you've stated in the notes
that you are going to redo your entire
setup I'll just leave it as is until
next time just don't forget a similar
setup again once it's ready Thank You
Rohit for entering a number 3 we got
Gabriel from Austin Texas and his setup
for gaming and editing it's a
minimalistic setup featuring a 34 inch
ultra wide from LG we also got the ant
rail compact keyboard and the Razer
DeathAdder Mouse I know the keyboard is
Wireless and you can connect it to your
PC via bluetooth so I'm curious if there
is noticeable latency which made you use
the wired connection instead I also feel
like the mousepad is a bit overkill
since you have such a small keyboard for
audio is rocking a pair of fluent
speakers and the HyperX cloud 2 gaming
headset clean work with the cable
management under the desk I can see that
you used a Raceway to run the cables
through and into your PC which by the
way is packed with a 77 1 to K and an
EVGA 1080 hybrid GPU and perhaps I'm
using the a is leaving kit from cable
mod to hide those nasty black cables a
very clean and minimalistic setup Thank
You Gabriel for entering up next a Zane
from Australia and his gaming and music
production setup featuring three 27-inch
AOC monitors and a 40 inch TV for
console gaming I mean it's obvious he's
a fan of Star Wars judging by the
wallpaper the poster on the wall and all
three of the lightsabers around his
setup
desk itself is made from the popular
linman tabletop which is supported by
two Alex Shores now obviously when you
mount three displays like this on a desk
and put it in the center you're gonna
get some bowing as we can clearly see on
Zane's desk I do applaud them for
drilling a hole for the keyboard and
mouse charger although I don't know why
that Xbox controller is just sitting
there for audio is rocking a pair of
a two plus speakers and the courser void
gaming headsets really great work with
the cable management the Signum is the
MVP once again and the rest of the wires
are sleeved nicely there was one cable
running from the back into his MIDI
keyboard obviously I would find another
way to route that cable and set up
directly underneath the setup which
looks nasty
but I'm positive he knows what he's
doing and there's a valid reason for
this alright so remember when I said
that he was a Star Wars fan well I just
found out that he has actually way more
collectibles throughout his room inside
these cabinets three full cabinets to be
exact these things probably cost
thousands of dollars if you sold it last
but not least the PC powering it all has
a 7700 K 32 gigs of ram and the MSI 1080
it's an awesome set up no doubt but it's
kind of all over the place the
lightsabers don't have a pattern the
painting is off-center there's no
symmetry and I feel like the TV is the
culprit that's making you put those
things like that I feel like if the TV
was centered then it'll be a lot easier
to organize but regardless if it works
it works Thank You Zane for entering
wrapping up the episode with some
symmetry porn is Jamal and his simple
and symmetric setup featuring a 24 inch
asus monitor and the wasd compact
keyboard with the MX master mouse for
audio is rocking a pair of m50x
headphones a road and two USB microphone
and the audio engine a 2 plus speakers
if you ask me I think that they are in a
weird location I feel like part of the
desk is blocking the sound direction if
you don't want to replace the headphone
and the mic with the speakers then maybe
you should consider mounting them
against the wall using these speaker
mounts instead I promise you you will
definitely hear the difference the only
other thing on the setup is the PC
that's underneath the desk and it's
rockin 860 700 and no GPU but yeah it's
a pretty straightforward black-and-white
setup Thank You Jamal for a train so
ladies and gentleman that is it for this
episode make sure you guys drop your
comments and vote on who you think has
the best desk setup although we pretty
much know who on already but anyways
drop your feedback below let me know
what you guys think about epsy setup in
the comments section and as always I
will see you guys in the next video also
make sure to double
if you guys missed the series and still
enjoy the show
but anyways I'm out thank you for
watching I'll see you guys very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
