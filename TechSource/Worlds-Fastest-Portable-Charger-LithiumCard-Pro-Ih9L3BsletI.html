and in this video I'm going to do a
quick review of the new lithium card pro
hyper charger now this isn't your
typical portable charger this is in fact
the hyper charger which means that it
charges your device at least twice the
speed of a traditional wall outlet and I
will be testing that at the end of this
video so the lithium card comes in this
pretty simple packaging that also
includes a nano stick which allows you
to stick the charger on to your device
or just keep it near you so you don't
end up losing it you can stick it on
your PC for easy access or even hide it
under your desk when it gets dirty you
just have to wash it with warm water and
it's practically new again never losing
its stickiness the lithium car pro is
linear fluxes second lithium card and
this is essentially the original one but
on steroids it has three times the
capacity and power and only double the
size of the original lithium card Pro
has a 3000 milliamp battery capable of
fully charging your iPhone 6 and more
one of the things that I love about this
charger is the fact that it comes
equipped with the cables that you need
you have your lightning cable on one
side to charge your Apple devices and
then you have your USB cable to charge
the lithium card via your PC USB wall
outlet or through other means using a
USB port now you can also pick up a
lithium card Pro that has a micro USB
cable instead of a lightning cable for
you Android users out there so taking a
look at the charger you can see some new
additions from their previous model on
the right side there is a USB out which
gives you the option to hook up any USB
cable so that you can charger other
devices that work wire a micro USB such
as wireless speakers tablets or even
Android smartphones over here I'm using
the USB to micro USB cable to charge my
amp our Bluetooth speaker and you can
even charge another USB device while
charging your phone at the same time
thanks to its hyper port feature on the
opposite side you will find the power
button and when pressed will activate
the card and start charging whatever it
is that you connect it to the light will
also indicate how much juice is left
over on the charger if it's white that
means it's over 90% charged if it's blue
it's over 10% charged and finally if
it's blinking red it has less
then 10% charge left right below the
power button is the microUSB slot which
is kind of a backup feature so that you
can charge the lithium card itself
what's awesome about the lithium car pro
is that it features simultaneous
charging so you can charge your phone
while charging a lithium part at the
same time instead of having to wait for
the car to juice up and then charging
your phone which saves you a lot of time
another awesome feature is that you can
access your iPhone from your PC using a
charger you don't need any extra cables
just hook up the USB part to your PC or
laptop and the Lightning connector part
to your phone and you have access to
your files the same goes for the Android
version of the lithium card pro okay so
what's this hyper charging thing and can
really charge your devices at double the
speeds compared to wall outlets well I
was curious enough to conduct a test and
find out as you can see here my iPhone 6
plus is completely dead and the hyper
charger is fully charged
I will now run a timer and see how much
percent the lithium card can charge from
iphone 6 plus before it dies and then I
will pause the clock and repeat the same
test by plugging it in the wall instead
so skipping to the end it looks like I
got a solid 71 percent charge in 1 hour
and 13 minutes of time before the
charger dying now let's do the same
exact test but this time plugging the
iPhone in the wall as you can see the
iPhone 6 plus is completely dead once
again it's kind of hard to see but if
you look carefully you can see the
battery logo alright so skipping to the
end it looks like it took about an hour
and 52 minutes to charge the iPhone 6
plus to 73 percent so slightly more than
before but it took an extra 40 minutes
to do so compared to 1 hour and 13
minutes from the charger so in
conclusion the charging speeds will vary
depending on the device and the power
source but you can definitely be sure
that it will charge your phone a lot
faster than connecting it to the wall
overall this is an amazing portable
charger not only is this the only hyper
charger in the world that boosts
charging speeds of your devices but it
also comes with a lot of awesome
features all packed in a convenient
compact size with that being said this
is definitely going to be my main daily
charger anyways that's it for the video
