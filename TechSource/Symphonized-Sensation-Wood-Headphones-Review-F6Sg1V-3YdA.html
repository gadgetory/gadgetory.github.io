and in this video we're gonna be taking
a look at the sensation headphones from
symfon eyes with literally over a
million results for wireless headphones
on Amazon you may be asking yourself
what makes the sensation so special that
wood wood provides the best sound
reproduction there is or at least that's
what sympathised claims with claims like
that and a pretty reasonable price tag
of $80.00 I had to check them out
especially since I'm a huge fan of their
NRG 2.0 earphones the packaging is plain
well except for what I can only describe
as a flaming demon hood printed on both
forms seriously you also get all the
technical details listed on the back now
inside the box we get a protective case
two cords one that has a microphone and
one that doesn't as well as a micro USB
cable taking a look at the included case
it features a solid zipper has a nice
accent stitching along the outside it
also has a pouch on the inside and most
importantly it's hard shelled so you
basically won't have to worry about your
headphones breaking in these if you are
traveling I've been using the sensation
headphones for about a week now and I
have to say that I'm pretty impressed
not only do the headphones look very
stylish with its wood backing and chrome
accents but it's also very sturdy thanks
to the inner metal band and outer hard
plastic Symphony has made the decision
to include NFC in one of the ear cups
and I have to say that's a pretty nice
feature all those kind of useless to me
since I use an iPhone 6s plus it
basically makes pairing on the NFC
enabled devices super easy just turn the
headphones on and tap your device on the
NFC sticker and you are ready to go not
only are the controls in one area
they're also very clicky and provide
excellent feedback these headphones are
not true over the ear headphones which
means it's designed for the pads to rest
on the ears instead of surrounding it
this is probably my only gripe with this
product however the cushions are very
soft and I didn't once feel discomfort
from using them the sound on the other
hand is impressive the aren't super bass
heavy headphones however the sound
signature is warm and fun with good
detail and rich mids if you want to plug
in the included auxiliary cable the
sound actually gets slightly more
detailed but you have to really be
paying attention to hear the difference
these are closed back headphones so
there is a good amount of passive sound
isolation but not being active so if
you're trying to mute all the outside
noise around you then you might want to
look elsewhere a few things that plagued
low-priced Bluetooth headphones are the
Bluetooth range and battery life however
I'm happy to report that that's not the
case here the sensations easily got me
through a whole day of use and charging
times from zero to full in about 40
minutes which is pretty impressive now
that me to be next to your phone is
great and I was able to get thirty feet
away from my phone and not have any
connection issues at all the sensation
headphones overall is a very solid
product that has strengths like NFC
solid Bluetooth range and great sound
for anyone that's looking for a solid
Bluetooth headphones under $100 I would
definitely recommend trying these out
but if you're someone that needs to have
noise isolation or super bass heavy
headphones I would definitely look
elsewhere I will drop a link to the
headphones down below if you guys are
interested in checking them out but as
always thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
