called the ultimate desk setup because
there is no such thing as a perfect
setup
it may be perfect to me but other people
have different tastes whether they
prefer a certain color scheme they don't
like the keyboard choice or just they
don't like the theme in general so I
threw away the WordPerfect and now
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the
ultimate desk setup
Wolverine edition
so I know how much you guys love
time-lapse videos my time-lapse PC
builds on one of the most popular ones
on YouTube so I put together a very long
time lapse build of this entire setup
actually I think it's over 20 minutes
long I'm not really sure but if it's
already available I'll drop a link to us
down below you guys should have some fun
with that so let's start off with the PC
that's powering everything now this is a
lecture box
my very first custom water-cooled PC
that I built on the channel I did do a
video on it to be sure to check it out
in case you haven't already but it's
rockin a 67 gk2 GTX 1080s founders
edition in sli and 16 gigs of ram from
g.skill I built it inside the allele EP
co9 case and it was definitely an
adventure to say the least it's actually
resting on four custom 3d printed risers
on a separate Alex your so that it
doesn't take up any extra space from the
main desk and speaking of the custom
printed risers there I total of eight
more that are holding up the concrete
tabletop from Ikea a huge things to
David for working with me on these and
designing some really cool Wolverine
style risers that fit perfectly with a
set up steam he also custom printed the
coaster and the phone stand but more on
that later
he did do a video on how he came up with
a design as well as how he 3d printed
them so if you guys are into the kind of
stuff make sure to check out his channel
and this video I'll have the links below
it's actually some pretty cool stuff I
just noticed it looks like I've horns
sticking out of my head because of the
claws that's hilarious
so I decided to opt for an ultra wide
monitor instead of the usual
multi-monitor setup so I hit up Asus and
I told them to send over their best
ultra light gaming monitor so what you
guys are looking at is the PG 3 4 8 Q
g-sync
quad HD monitor with 800 Hertz
overclockable panel which I was able to
hit within their menu this is a beast
gaming monitor which is also great for
productivity with it's 34 40 by 1440 p
display I always tell everyone once you
go ultra wide you never go back I got
the monitor hooked up on a wall mount
and hid the cables using a
channel and for the rest of the cables I
used a cable Raceway and ran all the
cables through it and into a surge
protector from anchor when you're
putting together a pricey setup like
this you want to make sure your
investment is protected from random
surges or circuit breaks the anchor six
outlet power strip does just that and it
comes with four additional USB ports
with 2.4 amps per port giving your
device's the fastest possible charge I
also drilled holes for the keyboard and
mouse and one more for the charging
cable that's attached to the phone stand
which was also 3d printed by David I ran
a lightning cable through it and into
the back of the monitor so whenever I
need to charge I can dock my iPhone and
use it up my iPhone also has the
Wolverine theme with the yellow rubber
inserts for the Advent case we got black
carbon fiber skins for the back and my
badass Wolverine wallpaper I won't tell
you guys the price of the case that I'm
using because a lot of you will freak
out so I'll drop a link to the video I
did with it if you want to check it out
you guys already know how I get with
symmetry so in order to balance the
phone stand I had to add something on
the other side so I decided to throw in
a simple 3d printed coaster with
Wolverine etched on it after all I want
to protect the countertop as much as I
can from scratches and if you think
about it one of the most common things
we put on our desks are drinks I also
decided to keep a console for those
exclusive games out there now this is no
ordinary ps4 slim it's actually slightly
modded besides the awesome skins that I
applied on the ps4 I also upgraded a
storage inside
thanks to Seagate which by the way
sponsored this episode I have created a
500 gigabyte internal hard drive to a
total of 7 terabytes of space we got 2
terabytes from Seagate internal fire
CUDA hard drive and 5 terabytes from
their external hard drives as you guys
know the standard 500 gigabytes
sometimes one terabyte of hard drive
space that comes with these consoles
just isn't enough for serious gamers out
there I think games nowadays take up to
25 to 30 gigs of space and that's just
by running off the hard disk I'm not
even talking about digital downloads
this means that you have to constantly
delete games to make room for new ones
but with Seagate's fire CUDA gaming sshd
you can not only increase the capacity
to make room for more games but also
increase load times I up to 5 times
faster
compared to standard hard drive discs
and that's because these drives are
flash accelerated installation was also
very easy all I did was pop off the side
cover remove one screw and pull out the
hard drive cage and then swap out the
old hard drive with the Seagate
Barracuda after all that I downloaded
the newest firmware for the ps4 and
transferred it to the new drives along
with all the previous files and games I
backed up from the old drive of course
there is a more detailed step-by-step
video on how this is done I'll drop a
link to that down below there's also the
external drive route for those that want
a more convenient way of storing games
the benefits of having an external drive
is convenience lots more storage space
and the ability to be mobile let's say
you're going over to your friend's house
well you can simply bring your external
hard drive with you instead of the
entire ps4 just plug it in and launch
any game you want straight from the
external drive but do keep in mind that
the saved data does not get transferred
so you guys have to transfer the save
data from ps4 to ps4
via USB or the PlayStation Plus online
storage so if you need more space or
faster load times than your ps4 then
these sigue drivers will get the job
done I'll drop a link to them down below
if anyone is interested and just for my
subscribers out there I'm giving away
two PlayStation 4s and two of each of
the drives I just talked about all you
guys have to do to enter is just comment
down below whether you want the
PlayStation 4 or one of the Seagate
drives you can pick either the two
terabyte internal fire CUDA or the five
terabyte external drive for the winners
will be selected in the comment section
and I'll announce them on Twitter at the
end of June but back to the ps4 so as I
mentioned before I did slap on some dban
skins and I didn't go with the yellow
because their color didn't match the
yellow I had throughout the setup and it
wouldn't have looked good so instead I
went with concrete which actually ended
up working better because it gives up a
nice contrast with the darker concrete
tabletop if you guys want to check out
some for yourself I'll drop a link below
in case you guys are wondering the wall
going decal on it was actually added
separately and I think it adds to the
theme of the set up along with the decal
on the reservoir of the PC the keyboard
is from royal grudge and it's actually
custom painted in yellow with custom
black key caps from two different
keyboards and also picked up the
SteelSeries rival 100 gaming mouse which
perfectly now the mascot is one of my
favorite pieces of this setup and it's
actually custom made by inked gaming I
couldn't be more happier with the design
that came up with and the quality of
their mouse pads are some of the best
I've seen anywhere you can basically
send in your design and pick the size of
the mousepad you want and then they will
send it over as simple as that as long
as the image is not copyrighted you are
good to go I mean sure there are a bunch
of mouse pads out there with a variety
of different colors sizes even designs
to choose from but having one custom
made just for you with the perfect color
scheme and design and size that's pretty
awesome
but anyways check them out guys I'll
leave a link down below I think they
actually have an excel on the website if
you guys use text or ten you guys get
10% off their entire store and also if
you guys like my mousepad they do have a
variety of different options to choose
from that you can pick up for yourself
as well so what else do we have here
some painted IKEA shelves that are
holding up the Edifier e 25 speakers and
if you guys have been following the
channel for a while then you already
know how awesome these speakers are
since I talked a lot about them before I
actually have a pair of these for my set
up in red and I just love the alien-like
design and the sound quality is amazing
I use them mainly for watching videos
and listening to music but when I'm
gaming I like to throw on the coarser
void wireless headset which is resting
on a hanger underneath a desk I love the
fact that these are wireless and the
best part is that I can switch between
the PC and a ps4 through the USB
receiver also down here I like to keep
the controllers and I stand that way
they are easy to reach and don't end up
scratching the surface and while we're
down here let's talk about cable
management it was actually pretty easy
thanks to the channel Raceway which is
holding up most of the cables I was able
to run the wires from the monitor
keyboard and mouse through here and out
the other end which is then plugged in
to the inker outlet you guys can't see
the outlet now because I use some 3m
tape and hooked it up behind the alux
drawer I also use some cable clips to
ensure that some of the wires don't hang
down overall I think it did a pretty
decent job other than that I did add a
few figurines and props near the top to
add to the overall personality of the
setup we got the popular Logan
bobblehead a Wolverine statue for Marvel
now and in the middle are you watering
claws made out of real stainless steel
everything was carefully measured and
planned out to make sure the distance
between the shelves are equal as well as
it being parallel with the monitor and
desk same with the speaker shelves and
pretty much everything else you see in
this setup symmetry is important to me
and I feel like I did a good job putting
all of this together but you guys be the
judge so that is if it is video hope you
guys enjoyed it believe it or not it
took me about five months to make this
video from planning it to ordering the
parts dealing with brands and even
setting it up I mean it took a long time
so if you did enjoy leaving a like
honestly I would appreciate it if you
guys didn't like it feel free to dislike
as well and leave me your constructive
criticisms down below what you didn't
like about the setup maybe what you
liked what you would have changed
differently anyways if you guys need to
the channel also consider subscribing
because I love making these setup videos
in case you missed episode 2 I'll leave
that down below it's a really cool white
and green cell setup anyways I love you
guys thank you so much for watching I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
