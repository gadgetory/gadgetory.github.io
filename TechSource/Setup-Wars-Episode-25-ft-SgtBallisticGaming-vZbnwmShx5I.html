GTA is your one-stop shop for extremely
cheap cd-keys for any game out there
never pay full price again for your
favorite games guys check it out by
clicking on the link down below so you
guys can see i'm kind of in a new set
setup wars is usually done with me
sitting on my couch but the living room
is currently being furnished and it's
not quite ready for setup wars hopefully
it will be completed and ready to go for
next week's episode so this week we have
a very special guest brian from sergeant
ballistic gaming he has a pretty cool
tech channel he will be showing off his
setup at the end of this video and you
guys can find the link to his channel
down below so make sure to check him out
as always all of the gear for everyone
setup will be linked down below along
with anything I recommend in this
episode so without wasting any more time
here are your 5 lucky contestants Aaron
Chris Daniel Eric and Harry Potter
you're a wizard
everyone is first up with an interesting
setup so we have a dell 24-inch monitor
on the left and a 24-inch BenQ on the
right and both of them are hooked up to
a monitor arm I gotta say this is a very
clever way to hook up two displays on
such a tiny desk we also have the CM
storm devastated keyboard and mouse
combo a charging station for the
PlayStation 4 controllers and a raft
power 6 port USB hub to charge your
devices kale management is okay although
I would have loved to see the cables
wrapped up together instead of having
them just came down like that but it's
not really a big deal on the other side
of his room we have a giant 65 inch
samsung 1080p TV which is hooked up to
an Xbox one alright that shelf either
has to go or you need to line that
directly in the center of your TV I mean
your bed is right next to it how do you
sleep at night but I'm really liking
this setup you made everything work in
such a small space
I like the shelf that's holding up your
PC underneath that you have the
PlayStation 4
speaking of PC's we have a 5820k
processor and a gtx 960 in this bad boy
well yeah not a bad setup at all thank
you a room for entering setup boards is
it a ruler Arun next up is Chris with
his battle station we have three million
24 inch monitors on top of a custom-made
monitor stand and on the desk we have a
trust LED keyboard and a trust GXT 152
mouse on top of the Goliath this
extended mouse pad also no desk we have
a blue snowball Mike a total Beach px4
headset resting on one of the shelves
really great work with cable management
and the LEDs everything is nicely
coordinated and symmetrical absolutely
love how you setup the two speakers
below the middle shelf and how you have
the Assassin's Creed figurine looking
down at you with that LED spotlight on
it there's definitely some personality
in this setup no doubt a few things that
bothers me are those creases from the
posters I mean they are kind of obvious
and I think that it takes away a little
from your setup but I gotta say though
that monitors that is bitching man job
well done
I don't even know what to say about that
original ps3 you have hung on the wall
that's definitely cool in a strange way
but yeah overall a very unique setup
indeed thank you Chris for entering a
number three we have Danielle with a
dual display setup we have 2 a 3 24 inch
monitors a logitech k5 20 keyboard and
mouse we also have a pair of Z 200
speakers and a Sony pulse elite
headphones but you have an Xbox one
cable management can definitely be
better if you replace that 2 outlet
power strip with something that has more
plug and sources that way you can just
hook up all of your cables into one
source and just have
one cable connecting to your wall outlet
also I don't like how the Xbox one is
just sitting there with an extra
keyboard right next to it
if you must have those next to your PC
might I suggest a stand for the Xbox not
only does it add a little spice to your
setup but you will have room underneath
to keep your extra keyboard it will
definitely clean up your desk set up now
there are a bunch of cool stands
available so I'll link a few of them
down below for you or anyone to choose
from with some minor modifications I
think this black and white setup has
real potential Thank You Daniel for
entering next up is Eric with another
triple display setup we have three BenQ
24-inch monitors on top of the ikea
Galant desk we also have a Razer
Tartarus keypad Manticore keyboard and a
bloody r9 mouse kale management is
pretty bad I suggest you buy an 8 outlet
surge protector and hook up all your
devices to it and put the surge
protector on that rack under your desk
after all it's there for a reason now if
you want to be more organized you can
actually pick up an omni mount cable
cloth and wrap all your cables together
it will really clean up your cable
management I do like the fact that you
drilled a hole in your desk to out the
keyboard and mouse wires through and a
lot of guys actually been asking me to
do the same for my set up but I don't
know maybe one day I'll give in and
actually do it I do want to point out
those speaker stands you have on the
sides of your setup this is great for
anyone that doesn't have any space or
wants to free up some space on their
desks you guys can actually pick up
speaker stands like these and have them
set up on both sides of your desk I'll
go ahead and drop a link down below for
a few good ones if anyone's interested
but yeah you're pretty simple and
straightforward triple display set up
just fix up your cable management and
you will definitely earn my approval but
nonetheless thank you for entering last
but not least we have Harry with his
black and red quad monitors set up three
twenty six inch Acer monitors below with
a 23 inch hands monitor up top under
desk we have a mad cat strike three
keyboard a rat three Mouse on top of the
Aki large mouse pad which I didn't even
know they made mouse pads we also have a
HyperX cloud two gaming headset which
I've personally used for gaming too and
a phone stand from me shop
excellent work with cable management
this makes me very happy
person seeing the cables tied together
and mounted on the roof of your desk but
why the hell do you have a Swiss Army
knife attached on the desk as well is
that in case someone tries to bother you
while gaming and wanna go watch movie
today
speaking of gaming I really like that
custom MSI side window you have on your
PC that looks pretty badass it's also
rocking to 960 GPUs and 16 gigabytes of
RAM unfortunately you didn't tell me
what type of processor it's running a
few things I'll recommend to clean up
your desk first a drawer that you can
install on your desk to keep your
remotes and other miscellaneous items in
an a headphone hangar for your HyperX
headset so it's just not lying on your
desk like that but yeah overall a really
really sweet setup Thank You Harry
Potter for anything so that's it for
this week's episode of setup wars make
sure you guys drop your comments down
below and vote on who has the best desk
setup and as always I'll announce the
winner on Sunday on my Twitter and
Instagram accounts so make sure you guys
are following me there if you want to
know who wins
alright so onto the main event we have
Brian from sergeant ballistic gaming
he's gonna be showing off his setup
Brian go in and take it away
what is up i'm sergeant ballistic but
you guys can call me Brian welcome to my
setup so I like to refer to this setup
as a work hard play hard setup I produce
most of my youtube videos here but I
also like to get down on a lot of games
in this setup so in terms of YouTube
production I've got a dedicated IKEA
linman setup over in the corner so I can
film unboxings and do b-roll for reviews
my main camera is a Canon 60d and I've
got a few lenses I got this konova k2
slider that I've modified to get some
nice smooth slides and I use a mono
proto tripod and tripod head combo to
get some nice b-roll moving over to this
other corner of my room I try to store
and organize things over here in order
to keep my main setup as clean as
possible I've got stuff I've already
reviewed over here stuff I'm waiting the
review processors getting ready to go
into build tool supplies and just other
stuff I like to show off all right now
getting into the first PC build this is
my editing rig it's an AMD FX 8350
system I would ask for name suggestions
but it's
going to be completely overhauled and
changed to housing intel i7 59 60 X base
build pretty soon the entire right side
of my setup is dedicated to production
and productivity get these three older
monitors including the Samsung sync
master below that you can see a lot of
the stuff that helps me produce my
videos I've got a Logitech g600
gaming mouse the Kingston USB 3.0 card
reader these M audio studio monitors a
focusrite scarlett 2i2 audio interface
and of course audio technica m50x in
terms of recording audio I mainly use
this audio technica at2020 five XLR mic
on a boom stand on the left side of my
setup I've got an area completely
dedicated to gaming lately most of my
gaming has actually been going down on
this bad boy I like to call the mo can
its military scene build with another
AMD FX 8350 the AC sabertooths 990 FX
motherboard and EVGA gtx 770 this guy
will soon be replaced by an all-white i7
4790k build along with a gtx 980 in
terms of peripherals i've got two BenQ
24-inch 144 hertz one millisecond panels
stacked on top of each other
the older 1080 displays but they're
great for getting max frame rates out of
my rig you can also see my logitech c920
webcam other peripherals include the
Logitech G 15 and next to it I've got
the G 500 Mouse instead of a normal
headset I've opted for a pair of audio
technica ath 8700 X's with an attached
mod mic these have amazing sound
localization for playing shooters we got
a number of controllers and some cool
items like the Nvidia shield portable
and in the video shield tablet these are
great so I can game on the go and one
final thing I wanted to show was my
cable management I know that's kind of
weird but you can always benefit from
having good cable management so thanks
again to Edgar for having me on peace
