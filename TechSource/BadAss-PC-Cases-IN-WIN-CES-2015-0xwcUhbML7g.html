in win booth which is hands-down my
favorite PC case company right now right
above NZXT for those of you that I've
never heard of in wind they are
essentially the Lamborghini of PC towers
this is where the innovation meets
design in fact our next ultimate gaming
PC will be in one of these cases so
anyone really didn't announce anything
new for 2015 but it did manage to pick
up a few innovation awards for their
amazing s frame pc tower surprisingly in
one has been in business since 1985 and
they are based in taiwan they did bring
a few their cases to show off here at
CES however there were two of them that
really caught my attention one of them
is the d frame mini which is basically
an open mini ITX case i mean talk about
air flow it does cost around 300 bucks
and it's made out of aluminum tubes with
a four millimeter aluminum motherboard
plate with two tempered glass side
panels and who says you can't water cool
a mini-itx build the water cooling tubes
don't come with the tower unfortunately
but you can certainly purchase them
separately from bitspower to spice up
your rig I'm definitely going to try and
build my next mini ITX build in one of
these cases the question is what color
should I go with if you guys want to
leave a suggestion drop a comment down
below one thing I also noticed is
despite it having an open frame
structure it's insanely quiet I couldn't
even hear a single fan noise and that's
pretty impressive okay so the other case
that caught my attention is there s
frame tower and like the D frame case
this too has an open frame chassis I
mean look at the design this is art
right here it's not a boring rectangle
or square shaped box I mean yes dust
will get inside the case easily from the
top but if you're buying an expensive
case like this in the first place it
means that you really care for your pc
and dusting it once every two weeks
shouldn't be a problem so this frame
starts at eight hundred bucks and even
though the black and gold color looks
dope I'm gonna have to go with the black
and red combo hands down all aluminum
body with tempered glass side panels and
enough space for a micro or regular ATX
motherboard there is one graphics card
installed in the setup but I don't see
why you can't hook up another one in sli
this build also is water cooled using
bitspower parts but lies
said before it is optional and you don't
have to have a water cooled system to
use this case it also has four base for
either hard drives or SSDs and a power
supply up to 300 millimeters in length
no doubt that this case is more geared
towards aesthetic stand functionality if
you're looking to hook up for graphics
cards together with a custom loop then
this case might not be a wise choice
it's definitely catered to a select few
consumers anyways that wraps up the
video and our coverage for CES 2015 let
me know what you guys think about this
case company and whether or not you will
build your pc in one of these cases i'm
interested to hear your thoughts so feel
free to drop them down below once again
this is that from text source and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
