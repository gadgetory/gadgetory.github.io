welcome to the final episode of 12 days
of tech I tried so in this video I'm
gonna be going over some last-minute
gift ideas for my slackers out there I
mean it's better late than never right
so before I start the episode I'm gonna
throw this in first because it's
technically not considered tech but I
thought it would be an awesome gift for
any Star Wars fan out there it's
basically a cute little bb-8 ceramic mug
which is part of a collectible I think
there's one for Darth Vader and a
stormtrooper as well so starting up the
episode we have a pair of sweat proof
earphones for those fitness junkies out
there it will ask you up to 6 hours on a
single charge and comes with a built-in
mic the sound quality is pretty good you
get clear highs and a pretty deep bass
which is hard to find on earphones in
this price bracket then we got a few
projectors on the list first up is the
leaf on a video projector that supports
1080p via HDMI and scales anywhere
between 30 to 120 inches which is insane
it's perfect for anyone that wants a
home theater or gaming setup imagine
playing Final Fantasy or Gears of War on
a screen of this size the projector also
has really great color reproduction
compared to other projectors in this
price bracket but keep in mind that the
native resolution is 800 by 480 so the
larger the screen is the more pixelated
it gets for $10 less you can pick up a
different version of the projector now
the quality isn't better than the one I
just talked about because it doesn't
have the same 1200 lumens meaning that
the image won't be as bright but if
you're trying to save some money then
you should consider this option he also
makes some pretty good cameras so this
one is a 1080p wireless camera with
two-way audio and motion detection with
night vision it shoots in 30fps using
h.264 and the best part is that you can
actually access the camera on your phone
within the app now even though it says
Wireless it still needs to be plugged in
for power it's wireless in the sense
that you don't need to connect it to
your router via ethernet cable and
instead you can use Wi-Fi for only $80
this is a really great deal on a 1080p
camera with night vision the omae's
sports 2 wireless speaker is not only
the number one bestseller in amazon but
it's also a great sounding speaker as
well it's waterproof with an IP x7
certification for up to 1 meter
submersion for 30 minutes it features 20
watt speakers and it can be paired with
another one of the same speakers for a
sound experienced the eighteen hundred
million of our battery life gets you
around ten hours of music playback and
some pretty cool features include a
tripod mount near the bottom so that you
can actually hook this up to your bike
or equivalent mount and also comes with
a built in mic so you can accept calls
for fifty bucks this is a very solid
Bluetooth speaker and he'll make an
awesome gift for anyone who enjoys music
now here's an interesting gift for
console gamers out there so it's called
the Console tuner and this will pretty
much mod your controllers without having
you do any physical changes it's all in
the software so for example if you're
playing an FBS game and have a weapon
that shoots in burst mode you can adjust
the number of bullets fired per burst as
well as the time between the bursts so
technically I guess it's considered
cheating but it's on Amazon and if this
is something you guys are interested be
sure to check them out now I do only
that some people in the review state
that it doesn't work with some games so
if you're not happy with it you can
always return it for a full refund
through Amazon here's a pretty simple
gift for practically anyone a twelve
thousand million of our Peres Bank from
wrath power that won't break the bank
it features dual 2.4 AB outputs with eye
smart technology which will provide
simultaneous charging on two devices at
full speed also takes five or six hours
for a full recharge on the power bank
and currently for this holiday season
it's actually on sale now here's a
pretty cool tech that will look good on
anyone's desk this is the dive ohm or a
box and it's pretty much a cube that
lets you design your own art using their
app or set it to a pre-configured
notification for example if you get any
notifications from Facebook Twitter
emails etc the cube will display the
appropriate icon along with a sound to
notify you or if you don't care for any
of those we can simply pick a solid
color and use it as a desk light for
your setup speaking of lights this next
one is pretty pricey but it's a really
awesome thing to have in any room you
get nine triangular panels and some
mounting tape which allows you to hook
these up to any wall and you can control
the lights of each individual piece
using their app this is definitely a
great gift and a sweet piece of tech to
spice up any room or set up the edify
our e 25 lunar eclipse speakers are no
stranger to the channel these have
appeared many times on tech stores and
they're actually the speakers that I'm
using right now on a daily basis I can't
praise these enough it's some of the
best sounding speakers I've ever owned
and I recommend these to anyone that's
not only looking for amazing sound
audio but also something that's
aesthetically pleasing as well you can
knock these up via 3.5 millimeter Jack
Bluetooth and through optical cables
which is what I've done with my own
setup and finally here's another cool
tech for the Star Wars junkies out there
it's a simple bb-8 desk lamp you tap on
its head to turn it off and on and it
comes with three different temperature
modes natural white amber and warm white
it's constructed out of aluminum and
weighs about one pound so it's not your
average cheap desk lamp as always you
guys can find everything I talked about
in this video links down below in the
order that they appeared thank you guys
so much for watching I hope this video
was helpful and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
