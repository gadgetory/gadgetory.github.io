welcome back to another what's in the
Fox episode this time we have five boxes
and one bag so let's not waste any more
time and dig right in
I'm going to start off with the bag
actually get this out of the way uh-huh
so this is my textures t-shirt gray down
is a freaking dense hello darkness my
old friend so this is my Texas t-shirt
that arrived finally these are one of my
many designs that I have and I think
this is a perfect time to plug in my
t-shirts t-shirt t-shirt store if you
guys want to pick up a few designs I
have a bunch of designs check the link
down below I don't know let's move on
this one is from Newegg I didn't order
anything oh I lied so I guess I ordered
a 60 70 case sometime last week uh what
took them so long to send this in I'm
doing a build for my cousin Bob and this
is going in his PC looks like they sent
over it you sure there's something - oh
what the hell is this
well I really crammed this in that
little container look it is it's a
lame-ass Intel shirt they level up all
right moving on to D aces we have
another package from Asus ladies and
gentlemen the last package I got from
them was awesome so I wonder what's in
this one hmm that's what I'm talking
about
boom this is the upside out bail ladies
and gentlemen the asus rog Strix gaming
1080 I am so damn excited to test this
baby out when I put this inside and
maybe y'all unbox it for you guys
actually why not
very nice packaging don't expect
anything less from our would you would
you look at that that is pretty badass
now this does have all G B lighting near
the top and bottom so it will light up
and check take a look at the back plate
this looks pretty sick so satisfying
very very nice I'm not sure if this
lights up looks like it does but I'm
very stoked in checking this out I'll be
benchmarking this entire week and I'll
bring you guys a review sometime next
week next up is a package from China I
don't know what the hell this is
description says toy so prepare all
you'd have $30 you can tell which
package is from Shenzhen with the nasty
and ugly yellow color tape these are
always so difficult to open I swear hell
I don't even oh Jesus Christ I remember
what this is this is a little
embarrassing actually holy Sh that is a
very very nice poster
I love the little diagram of the
positions what is going on right now
okay so I probably to explain some
things there's a company that reached
out to me a few weeks ago I think over a
month now and they said if I wanted to
review their toy and as a joke I replied
yes I will because I plan on making a
top five WTF tech video and this was
going to be in it I add this whole thing
plan there's gonna be a very funny video
but mistakes were made
okay yeah this is this this isn't
appropriate I can't believe they
actually send this to me oh my god
alright so moving on to the fourth box
oh there we go so these are actually
earbuds from ghost tech that I need to
do a video on so I'm pretty excited not
sure why you sent me two but I'll take
it so it's kind of built in mic an
inline remote control dedicated MFI
music buttons and a bunch of other cool
features so yeah definitely will check
this out later video maybe in two to
three weeks can't promise anything of
course fine ladies gentle ladies and
gentlemen let us
ladies and gentlemen finally to the last
box
this is a pretty short episode actually
oh yes
yes this one's by side up ladies and
gentlemen the gigabyte geforce gtx 1070
very stoked to do a video on this as
well lots of GPUs in this episode this
is the g1 gaming supposedly these
overclock higher than the founded
Edition so I will check that out this is
enormous check that out guys
fun fact actually I've never done a
video on any of the gigabytes graphics
cards so this would be the first on tech
