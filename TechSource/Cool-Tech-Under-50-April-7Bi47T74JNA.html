and welcome to April's cool tech episode
this time I'm going to be looking at
tech under 50 so without wasting any
more time let's begin so starting up the
video is the TMP charging station for
the ps4 controllers this is a really
great way to charge both of your
controllers by using only one of the USB
ports on the ps4 just simply hook up the
micro USB cable which was provided in
the back of the charging station and
plug the USB portion into your ps4 and
you are set to go
it stated that you will get a full
charge within two hours when charging a
single controller or four hours when
charging both at the same time there are
also LEDs which will indicate the charge
status blue for when it's fully charged
and red when it's still charging if you
guys want to pick up some awesome carbon
fiber skins for your ps4 or Xbox one
like I've done in the video then be sure
to check out the first link below next
up on the list is a beanie with
Bluetooth speakers built-in for 12 bucks
not only do you get a very comfortable
beanie to keep your head warm when it's
called out but you can also listen to
music with it did I mention it's only 12
bucks pairing it with your phone is
super easy just press and hold on the
play button until the LED starts
flashing and then open up your Bluetooth
settings on your phone and connect to it
what's cool about this beanie is that it
also comes they built-in mic which means
that you are able to take calls with it
it states that it will give you up to 5
hours of music playback 8 hours of
talktime and 60 hours of standby
charging is done via the micro USB port
located under the controls however
finding the actual port may require you
to move it around a bit as far as the
sound quality is concerned I'm actually
really surprised that it doesn't suck I
mean 4 speakers that are built in a
beanie for only 12 bucks these sound
pretty damn good the bass is pretty weak
and you don't get much noise isolation
but the mids and highs are good enough
to enjoy whatever it is that you are
listening to for 12 bucks this is a
piece of really cool tech that's perfect
for snowboarding skiing and places where
cold weather is present speaking of
sound this next item is called a sound
box and it's a Bluetooth speaker with
two 4 watt drivers a connection range of
up to 33 feet and 12 hours of music
played on box is a solid Bluetooth
speaker the top of the speaker has all
the necessary media controls like
pausing or skipping tracks while the
back has the
our button line in micro SD card and the
charging port the quality of the sound
however is great you get a clear sound
and a good amount of bass slow turning
faster nice paper it will turn in this
would say okay overall this is a pretty
good Bluetooth speaker compared to
others in the same price range this next
item is pretty cool this is the smart
turtle an intelligent holder for
smartphones and tablets the way it works
is pretty cool there is this adhesive
gel pad that sticks to practically any
surface whether it's a tablet smartphone
or even an actual pocket-sized camera
you can use it as a regular phone stand
for your setup or even use it as a
tripod to hold your phone or small
camera for recording video the adhesive
is actually strong enough to even hold
up a tablet and I feature this in my
cool tech video mainly because of what
it can do giving it's super compact and
portable form factor want to watch a
movie on your tablet while laying down
on your bed no problem just slap the
tablet on the smart turtle and you are
good to go the adhesive can also be
washed and still maintain its stickiness
which is pretty awesome next up we have
some noise canceling wireless Bluetooth
earphones from mpow actually featured a
few empower wireless earbuds before on
the channel but this is a different
model called the antelope it's a little
bit more than the previous models and
that's because it features noise
cancellation 6.0 which reduces outside
noises and outputs clear audio from the
built-in microphone however that really
wasn't the case when I tested them out I
actually made a call with these on at my
local Walmart and the mic was just too
sensitive and it picked up the sounds
around me and the person on the other
end had trouble hearing me on one of the
earpieces you can find the media
controls and on the other is the
microUSB port needed to charge the
earphones it stated to give the user up
to eight hours of music played it's
sweat-proof
which is perfect for joggers or people
that hit the gym hard overall the sound
is good the bass is decent and at high
volume the music doesn't get distorted
which is great if you're into fitness I
would recommend trying these out last
not least we have which is now my main
pair of earbuds that I use the NRG 2.0
earbuds these are actually made out of
genuine wood and the earbuds do come
with a built in mic and a neat carrying
bag with a set of replaceable earbuds
and different sizes the wood housing on
these earbuds provide better bass
response and acoustic performance at
least that's what they are claiming my
experience with these earbuds these past
few weeks have been nothing but great I
love love the sound
I mean it's even comparable to some
high-end earbuds that I've used in the
past that costs over a hundred bucks the
bass is an overpowering but clean and
the highs are also very clear honestly
for the price point you guys won't find
a better sounding pair of earphones and
you guys can quote me on that
I just love how snug these are inside my
ear which also provide excellent nose
isolation I mean these guys nailed every
single aspect of these ear buds finally
before I go I wanted to share a really
cool tech deal with you guys from mass
