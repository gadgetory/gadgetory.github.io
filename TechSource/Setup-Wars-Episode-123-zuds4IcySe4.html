and welcome to setup wars episode 123
where you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the show if you guys want to
participate if you have a pretty
interesting setup and you want to join
the show make sure to watch the video
linked all the way down below let that
set up words begin starting off the show
we got Alex and his Game of Thrones
themed setup he even matched the colors
of the three schedules to the rest of
the setup very nice
he's got the banners on the wall got the
wallpaper on the rog swift monitor I
mean this guy is dedicated even the RGB
lighting on his k7e keyboard and the m65
Mouse are matching the theme and it's in
the same order as well for audio is
rocking a pair of bose companion
speakers and it doesn't look like he's
using any headphones most people would
put the PC on the right side of the desk
even if the side panel is facing forward
so it's interesting that he placed it on
the left side instead I definitely agree
with that because not only does it look
a lot better in that corner giving you
extra space on your actual desk to work
with but you don't see any cables as
well speaking of cables looks like the
Signum Rack is holding up majority of
the wires and he even managed to hook up
a parish dip against the wall the PC is
rocking is a beast it's equipped with
the 7700 K and an asus strix 980ti
overclocked edition and I'm definitely
loving those custom mods the v1 tech GPU
backplate SSD covers and the fan grills
I'm not sure if you painted the side of
your radiator or if that's a wrap but
whatever it is you did a really great
job on that and the CPU cooler as well
notice how is RGB fans up top are
matching the order of the schedule of
the Game of Thrones I mean this guy like
I said is dedicated a very beast setup
thank you Alex for starting off the show
Dominic is up next with a very simple
ultrawide monitor setup featuring the
Acer predator X 34 which is hooked up to
the wall and then below that we got the
cursor case sixty five rapid-fire
keyboard and the logitech g502 mouse for
symmetry reasons he added his Nikon
camera on the left side to offset the
IKEA plant
on the right honestly though it kind of
looks out of place I would just buy
another plant and use that instead if
you really care about the symmetry I do
want to give you some points on being
creative with your acoustic foams
because most people including myself use
the entire square piece and design
something with it but you took it to the
next level and you cut it up to create
your very own pattern also if you guys
look very closely you can see that he
routed the monitor cables through the
back of the foams to try and hide it
personally I would use a wall Raceway
and run the wire straight down and to
this side just like how I did in my
Wolverine setup I only say this because
it will look a lot cleaner this way and
the wires running across the foam stick
out and ruin the aesthetics of this
beautiful setup also for all future
contestants please don't move stuff
around just to take pictures because you
think it will look a lot cleaner
obviously I can tell that your t-bone
microphone belongs on that mount near
the front of your desk so why not just
leave it there I promise I won't rip you
a new one if the placement is convenient
for you then by all means stick with it
there's no need to hide and shame so the
setup doesn't have any actual speakers
but what he does have is a pair of
headphones from v-moda
looks like these are the popular m100
crossfades and it's hanging under the
desk on a hanger and it looks like the
cable is running through the front of
the setup which is a no-no I always
recommend running the cables through the
back of this setup and into the PC using
some cable clips underneath the desk to
keep the wire
from hanging down and if you're worried
about the length you can always pick up
an extension cable which I will link
below another thing I'd recommend for
your setup is a channel raceway because
it doesn't look like you have that many
cables to begin with I mean sure you can
use tape but that looks horrible I would
recommend either a 48 inch channel
raceway or you can actually pick up
smaller 12-inch pieces and I'll drop a
link below if you want to check those
out the PC powering the setup is a
really nice one actually that's rockin
the 4790k and an asus strix 10 8
we got some custom sleeping cables for
the GPU and the red Ram sticks and
accents from your motherboard really
make it pop and it blends nicely with
your overall setups theme the final
thing I'll recommend for your set up are
some wall shelves and maybe you can put
some stuff in them that reflect your
personality or taste and since your
setup has a lot of polygons and the
square acoustic foams I went ahead and
pick the shelves that would fit nicely
with your setup if you don't like those
you can stick with the usual rectangular
IKEA wall shelves and if shelves aren't
your thing maybe you can pick up some
art for the walls because it's looking a
bit empty above your setup this is
actually the canvas I picked up for my
setup if you watch my logs and I think
you'll blend nicely with your setup so
I'll drop a link below in case you or
anyone else wants to check it out you
have an awesome setup but it definitely
needs some tweaks to improve it Thank
You Dominic for entering mr. Skywalker
is next up with a black and orange set
up featuring fanatic here he's walking
three 27-inch BenQ monitors and below
that he's got the corsair k70 RGB
keyboard with rapid-fire switches and
you also got the m65 Pro RGB Mouse the
Tusk is using is the local white
Crescent desk and he kept it fairly
clean there's not a lot of things on it
he's got a pair of bose companion 2
speakers a phone doc from JBL for his
iphone and his Asheville 850 wireless
gaming headset that's sitting on a
walnut wood stand okay so I like that
you drilled a hole in your mouse pad for
the keyboard and mouse but I would I
prefer to drill only one hole instead
the keyboard hole you have up there what
I've worked just fine and all you had to
do was just run the mouse wire
underneath the keyboard and through the
hole it would have looked a lot cleaner
in my opinion speaking of cables not
much going on under here looks like the
majority of the wires are behind the
back board so I can't really give you
any opinions here also down here is the
fanatic themed PC rocking a 6800 K and
an EVGA 1084 de Winne gravis card I love
that the motherboard has red accents
even though the entire color scheme of
his setup is black and orange but
honestly the tinted glass panel pretty
much blocked that out and the orange
LEDs are the only thing that's visible
through it so it kind of worked out a
very impressive and symmetrical
setup indeed Thank You Luke for entering
who says you need a large ass desk to
make a ridiculous gaming setup
I mean if Molson can do all this on a
crappy wooden table then no one should
complain about space issues seriously
look how small that desk is compared to
everything else around it Wow
I don't even know how practical this is
I mean you have to be really close to
the monitor and TV to use that keyboard
and mouse and you're gonna have some
serious neck problems it's like sitting
in the front row seat at a movie theater
that's insane
so apparently the desk is custom made by
him I mean if it's custom built
why didn't you at least make it slightly
bigger it is a black and green setup so
obviously that means razor gear he's
rocking a black widow X keyboard with
the Death Adder elite mouse on top of
the razor Goliath is extended mousepad
those two giant light things on the
sides are Wireless RGB light poles
apparently and on the left one he built
a custom VR stand for his HTC vive it's
actually screwed in the wall it's
technically not sitting on the light
pole for audio he's got the Logitech z5o
6 speaker set and the razor Man O'War
wireless headphones all the cables are
hidden behind the green back boards he
made but let's take a look at the PC
which I'm sure you guys have been
eyeballing since the beginning because I
know I have it's a custom water-cooled
build featuring the 59 30 k-6 core
processor and we got 2 Nvidia Titan X
Peas in SLI holy cow
is even custom painted some of the parts
like the PSU cover the fans and even the
i/o cover to match the rest of his setup
looks like the sli bridge is also custom
made very impressive this is definitely
one badass razor themed gaming setup
dinky most importantly wrapping up the
video we got nasco and a very clean
white black and red set up between the
28 inch Samsung monitor we also got the
Razer BlackWidow X tournament edition
chroma keyboard with the cursor m65 Pro
Mouse this is definitely an interesting
way to manage the wires from your
peripherals which I haven't seen yet it
looks like he hooked up two of the
raceways underneath the Alex add-on unit
and he routed the cables through them
that's interesting so on the add-on unit
he's got a pair of SteelSeries artist 7
wireless gaming headsets with a custom
stormtrooper vinyl sticker on it
and on the right side is the JBL
wireless charge speaker I gotta say I
love the presentation of this setup the
contrast color consistency and the
cleanliness everything is on point
I can tell nasco definitely spent some
time in perfecting this notice how he
moved the Alex drawer on the right side
slightly out so that he has some space
to put his custom skin ps4 and by the
way that art was actually drawn by him
very impressive
he also has custom skin ps4 controllers
which he hooked up underneath the desk
and while we're down here let's take a
look at what he did with the cables okay
so we can't see anything from the front
but nasca was kind enough to pull his
desk forward to show behind it and just
as expected it's managed very well if
you got the guts to pull your desk
forward and show what's behind it then
you my friend have nothing to hide a lot
of cable clips 3m tape and patience was
required to get this one done beautiful
work with the cable management I
absolutely love the white on red
contrast and it really brings together
the entire setup I was just about to
recommend a storm troopers mural so that
he can hook it up on the top of his
setup but apparently he already has one
I just don't know where you hung them
that's either way up there on top of
your monitor or it's probably on a
different wall but at least you have one
in your room the PC that's powering this
setup is actually a laptop it's the
ISTEP editor which is equipped with a
6700 HQ and a GTX 1060 I actually did a
video on the newer version of his laptop
and it's the best one you can buy under
eleven hundred dollars so make sure you
guys check it out in case you missed it
I'll drop a link below I'm huge fan of
your setup excellent work on it Thank
You NASSCO for entering so that is it
for this episode I've set up Wars make
sure you guys drop your comments down
below and vote on who you think has the
best desk setup as always unless the
winners on my Twitter Instagram accounts
on the weekend so make sure you guys are
following me there if you want thank you
so much for watching I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
