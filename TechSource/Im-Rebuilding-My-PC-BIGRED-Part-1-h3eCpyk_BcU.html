this part of the video now onto the
build so guys I've been busy building
pcs and setups for my subscribers and my
friends and even recently gave away the
original big red to an Instagram
follower I've actually used that PC for
the longest time on the channel and that
was my first ever custom PC I built for
myself and I was very happy with it so
before I give it to an Instagram
follower I actually gave it to my
brother and then I built myself this big
red version - you know what guys it's
been a while since I've treated myself
and I think it's finally time that I
upgrade my very own PC truth be told I
was not happy with this build at all it
was rushed and it did not come out the
way I expected it to be it came out
pretty bad for starters the case is
really bad for airflow and the bends
aren't garbage it looks like a
third-grader did it and on top of all
that the fans stopped working the RGB
lighting on the bottom three fans are
completely out and the lighting from the
other fans and even the RGB strips
cannot be changed and we install the
software and even reconnected the cables
and nothing I can't even control the
speed of the fan so there's something
wrong with the commander Pro or the fans
itself it's also pretty loud for a
water-cooled build the pump noise gets
really annoying and you can even hear
the liquid going through the flow meter
let me turn this on and show you guys
oh yeah long story short it was a big
disappointment in myself you know I talk
pretty big when it comes to being a
perfectionist and then I build something
like this even the flow direction is
incorrect on here the inlet of the top
GPU is going into the inlet of the CPU
block I don't know what on earth I was
smoking while I was building this but it
was probably something really good so
not only am I gonna build myself a brand
new PC but I'm also gonna redeem myself
and my reputation I'm not gonna put this
out until it is completely done and it
comes out exactly the way that I want it
this videos gonna have a three-part
series part one is gonna be putting out
all the parts together and testing all
the components making sure everything's
working part two will be the actual
build process and the modding and then
the finale will be basically
benchmarking overclocking and thermals
I'm gonna focus one video just on all
that so yeah with that said let's go
over some parts so the biggest change is
the case this is the pan it's an
open-air mid tower case from Raja Tech
and actually did a water cooling
tutorial on it and I fell in love with
it I guess you can say it was love at
first sight I'm gonna throw in to RTX 20
80 TI founders edition and this is gonna
replace both of the 1080 T eyes from my
current build I eventually went a game
in 4k or I guess 3k since I'm using an
ultra light but I do want max out
settings I want smooth gameplay as much
frames as I can squeeze out of these bad
boys and I know it's overkill guys
believe me but it is my personal build
so we got to stick with the overkill
theme so the cooler we're gonna be using
temporarily to cool the CPU just to make
sure all the parts are functioning is
the courser h1 15 i RGB platinum we are
going to be using the same cpu from my
current PCB 79 80 XC it's an 18 core
processor and it's deleted by Steven
from gamers Nexus but just for this
video we are going with I don't know
what CPUs in here actually take a look
at it ok so this is the I 970 900 X the
muezzin is temporarily just to make sure
all the parts are working I'm not quite
ready to bring over to CPU just yet
because I am still using that PC for
gaming and editing so until all the
parts are here ready to go that is when
I'll be doing the transplant in fact the
only parts I'm not changing are the CPU
and the storage I'm gonna bring over
both of my end back to us as these but
check this out guys I'm gonna be adding
this beast this year is a 9th
gigabyte intel obtained SSD the 905
p-series and this thing has incredible
read and write speed 20 700 megabytes
read and 2200 right
I'm definitely switching my operating
system on here along with my video
editing software and any other games
that I'm playing a lot of which is
currently Resident Evil 2
Darksiders 3 and black ops 4 but yeah
very excited to put this in the build
I'm gonna paint this white obviously so
it matches the theme my other two I'm
got to us as these are gonna be used
mainly for storage
I'm also upgrading the RAM from 32 gigs
at 3200 megahertz to 64 gigs at 3600
megahertz of the Corsair Vengeance RGB
pros since this is a super high-end
water-cooled build with heavy
overclocking emphasis on heavy
overclocking there is only one board
that can get the job done ladies and
gentlemen introducing you to the asus
rog rampage 6 apex the purpose of the
apex motherboard is actually to break
performance records as they say it has
two eight-penny PC connectors which will
aid in a very stable overclock we got
four separated them slots and four PCI x
16 slots with lots of connectivity we
got wireless AC USB type-c and a dual
them that 2 socket for my m2 SSD this is
gonna be a power-hungry system
especially since we're gonna be pushing
both GPUs and the CPU to its limit so I
have to give it enough power hence why I
picked up the 8 X 16 in July from
coarser oh yeah guys is that pretty much
all the parts I'm gonna be using inside
my new PC - the water cooling parts
which will arrive before episode 2 I'm
very excited to finally build myself a
new PC if you guys are excited as well
make sure to drop a like and I'm gonna
shut up for the rest of the video and
let you guys enjoy this montage
and we are finally done ladies and
gentlemen big red is alive and kicking
good news is that all the parts are
functioning perfectly the bad news
however is that we came across a few
snags which is okay that's the point of
this video not only testing the parts
out but also making sure that we're not
gonna run into any problems on the
actual build itself so the first mistake
was actually a very new mistake of mine
I miscounted the spacing for the PCI
slots I picked up a three slot nbme link
when in reality I needed a two slot so I
went back on the website and I ordered
that so that is on the way so the second
issue has to do with the expansion kit
so normally this case only supports up
to a three sixty millimeter radiator
which fits on this side I just put three
fans here just to showcase where the
other radiator would go but does it
support any other radiators unless you
guys buy the optional expansion kit
which sits on the top over here and
ratchet like actually was kind enough to
send that to me so the kit comes with
three aluminum bars that mounts on the
top of the case giving you mounting
options to add another 360 millimeter or
smaller radiator and then you put this
giant piece of tempered glass on top and
screw it well if you guys pay attention
over here you can see that it covers the
USB ports and the power button so right
now I have an easy way of turning on the
system the only option I have right now
is right on the motherboard itself so
have to reach my hand inside and click
on the power button right now it's not
really a big deal because I can reach it
easily but once the PC is done with all
the tubing it's gonna get kind of
annoying constantly reaching in there
and switching the PC on so I had to find
an alternate solution so I went on
Amazon and I bought this remote so that
I can turn the PC on wirelessly the
other issue still remains I can't access
the USB ports on the top which isn't a
big deal for me I don't really use the
USB ports on the front or the top of the
case anyways what I usually do is I use
a USB hub so I plug it in the back and
then I route it underneath my desk for
convenience so that is not a big deal
for me I got to say I do love the wide
extension cables that I got from courser
I personally think it's gonna blend
beautifully with the build
once everything is painted white what
else oh I don't really like how the PCI
cables are kind of going down and to the
side so what I'm gonna do is
is drill a hole right underneath the
motherboard so that I can run the GPU
cables straight down it's gonna look way
cleaner that way and of course custom
cables are on the way as well but yeah
guys that's pretty much over the video I
really love how the case turned out with
the expansion kit I think the build is
gonna be pretty damn sick once it's all
done again I could be biased but it's
gonna be like I said guys the best build
on the channel thus far it is my own PC
after all so that's why you guys have to
subscribe with notifications because
part two is going to be an awesome video
if you guys enjoyed it make sure to toss
a like and if you guys did enjoy the
video feel free to dislike as well if
you guys have any recommendations or any
feedback on this case or the build
itself please let me know in the comment
section I will be reading them and
that's pretty much it I'll drop a link
to all the parts mentioned below if you
guys want to check them out I love your
beautiful faces and helpful see you in
the next one peace
you can go
