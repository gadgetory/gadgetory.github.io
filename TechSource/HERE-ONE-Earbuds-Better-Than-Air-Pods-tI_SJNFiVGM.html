in this video we'll be taking a look at
the here.one wireless earbuds from
Doppler lab now first glance you guys
might think that these are regular
wireless earbuds for audio listening but
it's actually the technology and the
connected app that makes these truly
different opening up the clean packaging
you will find the here 1 earbuds inside
the accompanying portable charging case
Quick Start Guide micro USB charging
cable as well as additional foam and
silicone ear tips the here 1 earbuds are
truly Wireless and fit perfectly inside
the sleek charging case this included
accessories great because it makes
storing the here.one earbuds extremely
easy and prevents them from getting lost
via buzz itself have a battery life of 2
hours while the tragic case can provide
an additional 3 more charges there's a
set of LED indicators inside a case that
indicates the amount of juice left the
case can be fully charged in just two
and a half hours and it takes about an
hour to fully charge up your buds inside
the case via the provided micro USB
cable to get started all you have to do
is download the here one app on your iOS
or Android device and then sync the
earbuds via bluetooth upon first use I
immediately noticed how well the earbuds
fit inside my ears and the tight seal
they create to help block out
surrounding noises the first feature
that I tried was adjusting the volume of
the sounds around me and this worked
extremely well and in real time at that
bringing the sound down resulted in a
gradual reduction in the overall sound
it didn't completely eliminate the noise
but they were no longer a distraction
bringing up everything to the maximum of
6 decibels also works just as well you
can also keep these changes in effects
while listening to your favorite audio
content via the layered listening
feature
Dobler labs aims to remove the guesswork
out of creating a comfortable listening
scenario by offering smart noise
cancellation and the upcoming smart
suggests smart noise cancellation
provides a list of common sounds that
would be considered an interruption to
your listening experience and can be
easily muted with a toggle
Smart's suggests coming to the here one
system and a later update will
intelligently provide audio suggestions
based on your location the time of day
as well as listening preferences this is
just one of the features we can expect
as valve Labs plans to constantly
further evolve to hear one ear buds
through software and firmware update if
you rather fine-tune it sounds yourself
you can do that with the live mix EQ
it's very intuitive and works in real
time just like any of the other
modifications that can be done with the
here.one earbuds doubler labs also
provides fun effect to radically change
what you here including bass we've herb
and even flange the here when earbuds
are fully integrated with your
smartphone offering the same touch
controls you find on other wireless
earbuds you can easily play and pause
your music talk to Siri or Google
assistance as well as answer phone calls
without the need for your phone there's
also a pair of noise cancelling
microphones built-in so a phone call
quality will remain crisp no matter
where you are as far as I was concerned
for wireless earbuds these actually
sound pretty good I feel like they have
a very balanced sound signature and with
a prominent treble
however they could definitely use some
more bass so I did have two gripes with
the earbuds
first up the initial connectivity isn't
as convenient since the here.one earbuds
use a regular Bluetooth connection for
each side but they seem to stay
connected relatively well after the
initial process the second gripe is the
charging case now it does hold the
earbuds in a portable form factor which
is great but the hinge construction
could be better and I found that the
earbuds were easily prone to falling out
of the case and advertently while open I
definitely expected better construction
for the case for something that cost
this much we're comparing the here.one
earbuds to an alternative such as the
air pods the difference is immediately
noticeable air pods only provide a way
for you to listen to your music but the
hero one allows for creating an entirely
new experience and how you listen to
your music this makes here one earbuds a
better choice in any environment you may
be in the here.one earbuds are currently
available online for $2.99
at WWWE so that is a video thing as so
much for watching leave a like if you
enjoyed it I'll drop a link down below

check them out I've also got my hands on
one of the very first pairs of these and
I'm going to be giving away two
guys so if you're interested make sure

your chance to win them thanks again for
watching and I will see you in the next
