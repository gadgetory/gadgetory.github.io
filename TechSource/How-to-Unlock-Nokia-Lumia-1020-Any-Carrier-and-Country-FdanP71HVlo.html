today I'm going to show you how to
unlock your Nokia Lumia 1020 for all
countries regardless of what carrier you
have unlocking your phone allows you to
use your phone with other networks and
the process is completely safe and does
not harm your phone in any way so first
up we need to get the unlock code for
the phone before we proceed with the
unlocking procedure I personally use the
unlocking company for all my devices
because not only are they the largest
unlocking company to date but they also
unlock almost every gsm model ever made
and on top of all that they have the
lowest prices available in the market
with 24/7 customer support
so to demonstrate this process I'm going
to use the AT&amp;amp;T version and unlock it so
I can use it on my t-mobile network like
I said earlier it's the same exact steps
for all countries and carriers worldwide
so head over to the unlocking
company.com and over there you're gonna
be selecting your phone manufacturer and
phone model from the drop-down list so I
selected a Nokia and my model is the
AT&amp;amp;T Lumia 1020 once you do that click
on get unlocking code which takes you to
the next step which is to select what
country you purchase the phone from as
well as the carrier of the phone this is
the carrier that the phone is originally
purchased from in my case it's AT&amp;amp;T step
6 you will need the phone's IMEI number
to continue and I'm going to show you
how to look it up on your phone you can
either type star pound zero six pound in
your dial pad I'll open up the settings
and scroll all the way down and tap on
about and then tap on more info to
display your IMEI number step eight go
back to the website and type in your
IMEI number and select the currency for
your country before moving on
once you select get unlocking code and
purchases securely with PayPal they will
email you the code I mean the price and
time vary depending on the phone which
is why I don't list it but they
guarantee that you are getting in lowest
price and the fastest delivery times
once you receive your code to be your
email it's time to unlock your phone so
turn on your phone and remove the SIM
tray which should be located on the top
of your phone you can use either a
paperclip or something else with a sharp
M to do this once the tray is removed
insert your SIM card in the tray by
snapping it in place please note though
if your SIM card is too big or
too small to fit the tray then you are
going to need to adjust the size
accordingly for it to fit in the tray I
actually provided you with a link in the
description of where you can buy it
either the sim adapter or the cutting
tool as well as an instructional video
on how to use them unless you know how
to do it yourself step 13 insert the sim
tray back into your phone and wait for
the phone to restart once we started it
will ask you to enter the pin and this
is where you enter the unlocking code
that was sent to you in the email once
accepted your phone will be unlocked
immediately and it will display your
signal strength and data speeds I mean
unfortunately for me the area where I
live has a lot of mountains which gives
me horrible reception as you can see so
that's basically how you unlock your
Lumia 1020 phone if you found this video

I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
