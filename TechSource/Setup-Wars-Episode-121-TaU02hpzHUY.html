source and welcome to my new setup and
fun on the camera it's literally right
next to my other studio and the reason
why I moved all my stuff here is because
I dedicated this room for recording
video basically that way I can just have
my camera and my acoustic foams and all
of my lighting in one spot instead of
constantly moving things in and out of a
closet
but anyways oh I also bought back the
acoustic films back there with the
silver play button because I feel like
it's missing the old tech source touch
so I hope you guys enjoy that enjoy this
new setup but anyways with that said
welcome to setup boards episode 121 I
love the setup words begin this video is
sponsored by a rock they make quality
watches for men with a women collection
coming soon in September and you guys
can get 10% off using the Kotex source
or by clicking on the link below so
before I begin this episode I want to
talk about the roasts my setup that
happened last week so I've been reading
the comments section you guys it's a
mixed bag but overall I would say based
on the views and likes that it was a
positive episode and most of you guys
enjoyed it and of course there was a lot
of you as well that didn't enjoy the
video the either the roasts weren't that
great the editing was kind of bland -
forced laughter and all that stuff so I
feel like it does definitely need some
tweaks I will probably do one more time
for episode 130 and if the results are
mixed just like the last episode I'll
probably just stop doing it there were
some roasts in there that were a little
too much I feel like some of the roasts
in there were a bit tasteless they were
over at the top and inappropriate even
though it was a joke I feel like I
shouldn't have put it in there so yeah
there definitely some roast that went
overboard I should have not put it in
the episode at all it wasn't even funny
but you know you learn from your
mistakes
so obviously I'm gonna be doing some
tweaks change things up again
and hopefully make it more entertaining
for you guys for episode 130 and if it
tanks again or if it doesn't do well
then I'm probably just stop doing it and
go back to the potato edition but
anyways I'm done rambling thank you guys
so much for your feedback in the
comments section I really do read all
the comments
I should say most of the comments
because there's literally thousands of
comments that come in every single video
but anyways when I'm done rambling let
the show begin starting off the episode
we got black beard and his all-in-one
setup straight out of a sci-fi movie
this isn't the first time we've seen
something this crazy the last time we
saw something like this was in episode
37 I've set up Wars where all he was
rocking the Emperor 1510 but in
Blackbeard setup he was actually
inspired by the Emperor 1510 so he built
his very own from a car seat major props
so he hooked up a 39 inch Samsung
monitor and also a recycled laptop
monitor which he installed vertically
right next to the samsung Display around
the monitors he's got a set of Logitech
X 530 speakers which were painted to
match the gaming chair the gaming gear
he is using consists of ECM storm
keyboard
we got the eraser Nostromo keypad and he
very famous Naga chroma Mouse I also
like how everything is within reach on
his setup he's got his PC the gaming
headset and a mini control panel on the
left side the switches actually control
a monitor and he can move it up or down
and there's even a USB hub right next to
him he literally doesn't have to move
ever again
there's even a cup holder here I mean
the only thing that's missing is a crap
bucket and he is pretty much set I got
to give this man some credit on the
cable management he did such a better
job than Olly and he had all the wires
underneath the table and used a bunch of
cable clips and wraps to manage the
wires all around well done
if it weren't for the monitors and a few
other miscellaneous things I would have
easily given this the seal of approval
but regardless thank you for entering
breath is up next with two setups so
he's got two thirty-two inch IPS
monitors from LG with a 25 inch ultra
light up top but on the other side is
the Acer monitor that's hooked up to a
15-inch MacBook Pro the first set up
kind of threw me off because there's an
extended mouse pad on his desk without a
keyboard or mouse on top of it
apparently he keeps them in a pullout
drawer right below he's rocking the
Rosewill apollo blue mechanical keyboard
with the Logitech g600 mouse the other
set up has the MSI
five wireless mouse and a solar keyboard
both from Logitech Ferrario is rocking
bookshelf speakers from Sony for his
computer but he's also rocking a set of
Helios speakers for surround sound and
his entire room he also has quite the
headset collection we got a pair of high
five man re-400 eye headphones the shure
SRH 15 20s we also got a pair of Beats
Pro and the Logitech G 430 gaming
headset not a bad lineup except the
beats pro of course K Weismann seems to
be on the control I do see a power strip
that's mounted underneath the desk and
majority of the wires are hidden so nice
job here the PC powering the main setup
has a 7700 K and a gtx 1070 and
apparently a crap ton of storage looks
like you need a bigger case with more
hard drive bays or better yet you should
probably consider consolidating all of
your data into larger hard drives I mean
you've got several one terabyte hard
drives I mean those things fill up
pretty quick there's definitely a lot
going on here but overall it's a solid
gaming and productivity setup with
purpose thank you so much Brett for
entering at number three we have Edward
with a very clean and simple white and
black setup featuring two 24-inch ultra
sharp monitors from Dell and the
Logitech G 610 keyboard and the MX
master mouse other than the large tech Z
623 speakers the only other thing he's
got on his desk is the PC it's a bit
outdated but it still gets the job done
with a 6600 K and an EVGA 980 TI a very
beautiful and clean PC build to go along
with the set up cable management is also
perfect the Signum rack is holding up
majority of the cables and the power
outlets while the cable spiral is
wrapping up the rest of the wires
together and I love that it's also in
white to match his setup I mean it's a
bit bland but some people prefer simple
and clean setups like this compared to
something that looks more busy Thank You
Edward for entering speaking of busy
Jason setup is precisely what I was just
talking about he's got a 32 inch vizio
tv up top that's hooked up to his ps4
and below that we got another set of
ultra sharp monitors from Dell believe
it or not his setup is being powered by
iliyan where are 17 laptop on the left
side
I like his placement of his speakers
it's not mounted on the wall
nor is it on the actual desk somehow he
managed to hook them up on the top of
the monitors aside from that he also has
an RCA sound bar underneath the monitors
for peripherals he's rocking the Corsair
k70 RGB keyboard and the logitech g930
on top of the just Niall extended mouse
pad which by the way it looks really
cool cable management is done really
well not only did he tie all the cables
together using velcro but he had all the
plugs and the power outlets and his
drawer it's a busy set up but it's
organized very well and everything has
purpose thank you Jason for entering
last but not least we got Johan and
another clean white and black setup
I feel like old white and black setups
are very clean for some reason I just
have to start off by saying that the
wall art is a bit too high up there and
there's just too much space between that
and the monitor but that's just me
complaining the monitor he is using is
none other than the Asus PG 3 for 8 Q
ultra wide and he's got that hooked up
on the freedom arm which is the same one
I'm using for my display I absolutely
love it he also went wireless for the
peripherals he's using the drive o
calibre mechanical keyboard and the
white MX master by the way that keyboard
is awesome I did a video on it that I'll
drop a link to it if you guys want to
watch it for 60 bucks you get a wireless
mechanical gaming keyboard with RGB
lighting 60 bucks guys that's crazy for
audio is rocking a pair of audio engine
a 2 plus speakers and white and devoid
wireless gaming headsets now here's an
interesting mod I haven't seen yet so
apparently Johan removed all four of the
trays inside the drawers to make room
for his PC inside that's creative I'll
give you that but is it worth it losing
out on all of that storage but in his
defense he did add a pencil drawer
underneath the desk but that's still a
lot of space wasted if you ask me I
guess you really didn't want his PC on
the ground or have it visible on top of
the desk finally the cable management
it's flawless beautiful work with the
channel raceways and the cable clips he
even added a USB hub underneath a desk
this is definitely one of the cleanest
setups I've seen excellent work and
thank
Yohann for entering this video was
sponsored by hey rock
they make high-end watches at affordable
prices compared to similar brands in the
market one of the things I love about
their watches is the minimalistic and
clean design I was like the fact that
their watchers are stainless steel and
water resistant they do have a wide
variety of styles to match your unique
tastes and the best part is that they
offer free worldwide shipping with free
returns they will be coming out with a
women's collection sometime in September
