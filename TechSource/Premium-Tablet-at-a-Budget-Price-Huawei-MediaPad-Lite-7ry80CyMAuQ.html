and in this video we're gonna be taking
a look at a budget Android tablet from
Huawei this is the media pad m3 light
and after using this device for about
two weeks I wanted to give you guys my
full review and let you know if it's
worth picking up the version of the
media pad I have here in this video is
packing three gigs of RAM 16 gigs of
internal storage and a 10.1 inch 1080p
display the screen is actually very
impressive considering its budget price
tag and the bezels make the tablet very
easy to hold on the front we find the
selfie camera and a fingerprint scanner
which is really accurate in my testing
and on the other sides of a device we
find the usual volume rockers the power
button and the headphone jack a really
cool addition is the micro SD card and
the SIM slot which we don't always find
on tablets the mini pad also has a
Harman Kardon audio system with both
bottom and top firing speakers which not
only have good audio quality but get
pretty loud as well and on the back we
only find the rear facing camera which
is an 8 megapixel shooter and also the
metallic Huawei logo overall the design
is very clean in my opinion and the
metal frame paired with the plastic back
make the tablet feel light but still
look premium in the box you will find a
2 amp charging brick mark a USB cable
and a tool to open up the micro SD card
slot and optional SIM card slot for the
LTE version of the tablet getting back
to the device I have to say I'm really
impressed with how fluid the user
interface is navigating around the home
screens and the app menu is very snappy
while I'm not a fan of the manufacturer
of bloatware Huawei actually included
some really useful apps like the notepad
which is a lot more organized from
Google keep Huawei skin is also fairly
light especially compared to most
popular Android OMS and this skin
actually does a good job with optimizing
performance and battery life UI aside
the tablet also performed well in most
games I threw at it like Mario run
asphalt 8 and my overall experience was
very pleasant with web browsing and even
running social media apps multitasking
on the tablet is also snappy thanks to
his three gigs of ram and Huawei's user
interface which makes split-screen view
very
easier to access and navigate moving on
to the display Huawei has gone with a
1080p panel which does a great job at
conserving battery life and it still
looks sharp saturation is on point and
even viewing angles are pleasant but the
only drawback I found is that the
display doesn't get too bright
the front and rear cameras are nothing
special but they will definitely get you
by for the occasional video call or
pictures and document scanning phone
call and text capability is also present
on LTE version of the media pad and
lastly we're going to talk about the
battery life which is a make-or-break
aspect for tablets in my opinion the
immediate pad is rocking a six thousand
six hundred million of our battery which
got me around seven and a half hours of
on-screen time
with moderate to heavy use a quick note
about the charging brick it's actually
not quick charge labeled but in my
testing the device actually charged up
relatively quickly compared to the
larger iPads overall I think that Huawei
has delivered on what they promised the
m3 light is a fantastic budget tablet
for the price tag and it even packs some
features that aren't even found on some
high-end devices now pretty much wraps
up this video if you guys enjoyed it
tossing a like would be awesome and if
you guys didn't like it feel free to
dislike as well that is cool too if you
guys want interested in checking out the
media pad I'll drop a link to it down
below huge thanks to huawei for sending
it out for review and as always thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
