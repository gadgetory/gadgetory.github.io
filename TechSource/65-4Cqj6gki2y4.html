you guys want to check it out make sure
to click on the link below what's up
guys is that some tech stores and we are
back again taking a look at another
awesome TV but this time we're gonna be
looking at LG's new 4k OLED smart TV to
e7 I reviewed LG z 6 last year and since
then I've been using it as my main TV in
my home I found out this year's model is
more of a refresh than a complete
overhaul and to LG's credit the e7 is a
great place to start if you don't
already own a really cool-looking
super-thin gorgeous OLED TV like this
but I'm not really convinced that the 5k
upgrade is worth it if you already own
the LG e6 is definitely designed to be
modern with the OLED film mounted onto
glass with a ridiculous thinness of a
few millimeter
the rear houses all the hardware so it
is thicker with its thickest point
measuring at two inches you can also
mount this on the wall which is a nice
plus also on the bottom there is this
built-in sound bar with Dolby Atmos
built-in for those that didn't know this
technology delivers full surround audio
experiences when implemented right
unfortunately the e7 falls short
regarding a reproduction of audio coming
from behind you but somehow it manages
to recreate sound placement well that's
for the audio itself it has good range
and keeps its clarity even at higher
volumes
the speaker looks great on its own I
don't have any major complaints but
personally I would install a full
surround sound system for connections we
get for 4k HDR capable HDMI ports
through USBs we get antenna connections
a LAN port we also get a digital audio
port headphone out and an audio line out
turning on the TV we were greeted to one
of the best if not the best panels we
have seen on the channel as of yet
quality wise it's similar to last year's
ecig so the resolution of 4k which is to
say it's great it is a lid so we get 2
blacks that everyone wants as well as
improved color with the e7 reaching 99%
of the DCI color space compared to last
year's 90% it also now gets much
brighter with peak levels hitting 1000
it's once again when compared to last
year's 652 nits
it's a substantial difference even with
its improved brightness all the panels
are dimmer when compared to that of LCD
but of course on an LCD you don't get
those true blacks
there's also a great uniformity across
the panel I haven't noticed any color
shift for my time of use and of course
being an OLED panel we get great viewing
angles with these picture improvements
we're finally able to say that HDR is a
good home on OLED unfortunately LG
removed the 3d capabilities coming from
the e6 switch personally I do not care
too much about the e7 does get an
upgrade in its upscaling technology so
when comparing it to the e6 it has more
detailed 2 HD pictures as well as it
enhances the up scaled images overall
Chris penis and clarity in game mode you
get a 60 Hertz refresh rate which I
found to be fine for first-person
shooters and online gaming with that
said it's obviously not going to compare
to faster refresh rate and response time
from gaming monitors LG's OS 3.5 which
is new this year is not more polished LG
claims that is up to 40% quicker now I
don't know how I can rate that number
really is but it is definitely snappier
it comes to well remote and it's
feature-packed
it has a pointer and even a microphone
to make searching easy there are also
pre-programmed buttons that launch apps
like Netflix and even a scroll wheel
that makes navigation easy
your valve design hasn't really changed
much from the e6 it brings many
improvements to the e6 that make this
use model a compelling by the improved
business and image processing make this
a serious competitor against the top and
LCD TVs on the market but that pretty
much wraps up my review of LG's new OLED
e7 Smart TV if you guys want to check it
out I'll drop a link to it down below

to dislike honest guys if you haven't
seen a TV like this before then you
aren't missing out it's definitely worth
