wanted to share an awesome power break
that I stumbled upon a few days ago this
is the viv aspire Bank and not only does
this beast have 13,000 milliamps which
is enough to power seven iPhones but it
has a pretty cool design and a spot to
stick your phone in and watch videos
which I will show you later in this
video so there isn't really much to
unbox here after removing the item from
its plastic container you will find the
power bank sitting on top of the user
manual which shows you how you can use
the product and how the charging works
by beneath the plastic tray is the
microUSB to USB which is needed to
charge the power bank and finally a
pretty cool carrying case which kind of
feels like velvet material if he asked
me I'm definitely diggin the awesome
carrying case something you don't see
often when buying power banks now the
material has a leather feel and look to
it and the sides are gold-plated which
brings a pretty cool look to it instead
of being a plain old brick like most
power banks are honestly if you ask me I
would have left to seen a black and red
combo with this it would have looked a
lot better so the power bank has one USB
port up top to connect iPhones or any
other electronics that work wire USBs
like cameras handheld gaming and such
and on the back side is where the
built-in micro USB is tucked in when not
in use on the side of the power bank is
the LED indicator button which if
pressed will display how much juice is
left inside the power bank right next to
the indicators is the micro USB port
which is used to charge the power bank
so so far it seems like an ordinary
power brick so you might be wondering
why I decided to do a video on this well
what sold me on this power brick was
such a simple feature it has a section
to hold your phone and charge it at the
same time which means that you can watch
hours of video without worrying about
your phone dying I have like 6 or 7
power banks over here at the office
sitting around that do only one thing
charge your device so when I came across
this I was definitely impressed I would
however love to see more color options
available in the near future for example
black in red and maybe a larger power
bank with twenty or even thirty thousand
milliamps
but overall this is a very solid power
bank and I'm extremely happy with it
so that is why I wanted to share this
with you guys I will leave links in the
description section about the product if
you guys are interested in checking them
out but anyways this is that from tech
source and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
