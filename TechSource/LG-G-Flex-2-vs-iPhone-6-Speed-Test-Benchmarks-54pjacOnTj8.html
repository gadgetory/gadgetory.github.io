cashier comm they compare iPhone prices
on the Internet and give you a quick
quote and the most cash for your iPhone
what's up guys it's ed from tech source
and in this video I'm gonna be
conducting my famous detailed speed test
and benchmarks between the LG G flex 2
and the iPhone six-plus but before we
continue let's take a quick look at
their specs the flex 2 is rocking a
Snapdragon 810 chipset with two
quad-core processors clocked at 1.5 and
two bigger Hertz with three gigabytes of
RAM while the six plus uses Apple's a8
chip and a dual-core processor clocked
at 1.4 gigahertz and one gigabyte of RAM
both phones have their apps cleared and
their brightness maxed out while
connected to the same Wi-Fi network I'm
gonna go ahead and turn these phones off
and start with a fresh reboot and that
you guys enjoy the rest of the show
what is the closest McDonald's here are
the listings for McDonald's with what
time is it in London what's the square
root of 1,000 square root 1000 is thirty
one point six two
well there you have it a clear winner it
seems like the iPhone 6 plus is not only
faster than the Flex 2 but it also has
higher benchmark scores the Flex 2
however did pretty well for multitasking
since it kept the apps running in the
background which minimized the loading
times however the 6 plus proved to be
the overall faster phone if you guys
enjoyed the video please hit that like
button if you didn't feel free to
dislike and let me know what you guys
think about the test results it's always
interesting to see brand new flagship
lose against a smartphone from last year
but anyways if you like these types of
videos and make sure you subscribe to
the channel so you don't miss out on all
future speed tests this is FM tech
source I will see you guys in the next
video so before I go I wanted to share
an awesome website which you guys sell
