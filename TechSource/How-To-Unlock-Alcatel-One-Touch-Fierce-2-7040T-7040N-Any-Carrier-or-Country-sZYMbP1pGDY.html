I'm here to show you the process of
unlocking your Alcatel fears to
smartphone so you can use it with any
carrier or country for the cementation I
will be using my locked t-mobile fears -
and unlock it so I can use it on my AT&amp;amp;T
network but you can use this video as a
guide for any carrier so first off we
need to get the unlock code to start the
unlocking process one of the best and
most trusting websites that I used to
get my unlock codes is the unlocking
company comm because the prices are
unbeatable and their customer service is
the best in the market so head on over
to the unlocking company comm and select
your phone manufacturer and the phone
model from the drop-down list and on the
next page go ahead and select the
country the phone was originally
purchased from and the carrier of the
phone in my case I purchased it in the
United States and the original carrier
is t-mobile so before we continue we do
need the IMEI number of the phone and
the way you look that up on your phone
is to open up the dial pad and enter in
star pound zero six pound once the phone
displays the IMEI number you have to go
back on the website and enter that in
once everything is filled out so let's
get a locking code and that will take
you to the final screen where you have
to check out after checking out they
will email you your unlock code the
price and delivery time of your code
varies by phone but don't worry because
the prices are always the cheapest in
the market than any other unlocking
website so before we continue make sure
that the phone is powered off next go
ahead and remove the backplate of the
phone so you can gain access to the SIM
tray and here is where you put in the
SIM card that you want to use with the
phone I want to use the fears to on my
18 t Network so I am putting in my AT&amp;amp;T
SIM card if the SIM card is a different
size and you have to adjust it in order
for it to fit I have left a link in the
description section to show you how
that's done so after you insert your SIM
card in the tray go ahead and put back
the backplate and power on your device
once the phone boots up go ahead and
leave the lock screen and immediately
after you will get a prompt asking you
for the unlock code this is where you
put in the unlock code that was sent to
you by the unlocking company so after
putting in the code your phone will take
you straight to the home screen and your
phone will be permanently unlocked as
you can see I'm using my t-mobile fears
to on my AT&amp;amp;T network so that's how you
unlock you
