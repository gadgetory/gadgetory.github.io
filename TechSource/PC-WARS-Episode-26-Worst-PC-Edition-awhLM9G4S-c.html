welcome to PC Wars worst PC Edition
where we're gonna be looking at some
potato rigs and I'm gonna be giving the
person with the worst PC $100 and again
guys this video is just for fun please
don't take anything I say seriously this
video is a great reminder that your PCs
aren't that bad
maybe it is I don't know what the PC
wars begin I do want to thank Samsung
for partnering with me to make this
video possible if your PC is booting up
very slowly or taking longer than
expected to load up games and
applications then an upgrade is what you
need the samsung 960 pearl m2 SSD will
supercharge your PC with incredible read
and write speeds allowing your programs
and games to load much faster especially
if you're coming from a hard drive
supercharge your PC today by using the
samsung 960 Pro MDOT - SSD I'll drop a
link to it down below this is first up
with a beautiful budget PC and this is
actually the only build in this episode
that looks this good but I've decided to
include it anyways because it is a
budget build so the processor he is
still using is the Intel Q 8200 quad
core with eight gigs of ddr2 RAM and an
asus strix 960 I can also appreciate the
extra effort he put in moving the PC
outside and taking wonderful pictures
for the firestrike benchmark it scored
55 17 and it's probably gonna be the
best PC for this episode thank you desks
for entering Lewis is next up with a
true potato PC it's running on the e
5200 Pentium chip with an Asus GT 710
but the worst part about this PC is
actually the power supply that's hanging
on for dear life it looks like the power
supply is too small for the case and
what's up put the hard drive that's just
laying on the bottom where are the drive
cages in this case this tower is
supposed to have a cage near the bottom
that can store up to three hard drives
cable management is also something to
cringe at it's even worse than the fire
strike score of 721 playing this PC and
second place overall but thank you Louis
for entering and number three we have
Phillip with a PC so bad
doesn't even have a side panel mainly
because the power supply doesn't even
fit in this case causing it to stick out
a bit from the side cable management
also hurts my eyes but the actual specs
aren't that bad it's running on the cue
6700 quad-core processor with 6 gigs of
ddr2 RAM and the msi RX 470 I mean at
least this case has an actual drive cage
for his 320 gigabyte hard drive so a
point sturb I don't have any 5 spec
scores for this PC so automatically it
takes last place Thank You Philip for
entering and good luck so Nina is next
up with a respectable budget bill
because it does look like he worked on
the cable management a bit and I can
definitely appreciate that singing even
went with a closed side panel because
he's smart enough to know that there's
nothing really good to show off inside
his PC and he's able to save money in
the process in terms of specs it's
actually the worst PC so far on the show
rocking a Pentium II 5300 and an AMD HD
7450 with 2 gigs of ddr2 ram he's even
got the fire strike score to prove it
332 putting this PC in third place I
also love the fact that Windows isn't
even activated on his PC but who knows
maybe I'll end up winning and you can
use the hundred dollars for a fresh copy
of Windows Thank You Sania for entering
last but not least we got rake and his
badass styrofoam themed PC build rocking
not only one but two nvidia gtx 980ti s
but if you like you bought those
graphics cards from Craigslist or
somewhere shady because GeForce is
actually misspelled on them it's missing
the e he also picked up the 77 decay and
added a cooler master 212 Evo cooler
with 32 gigs of tried and z-r GB RAM
sticks definitely some interesting
choices when it comes to hardware first
of all I would have gone with a beefier
cooler than the 212 Evo especially if
you're gonna be overclocking and 32 gigs
of ram is a bit overkill for gaming and
finally your PC looks like it's missing
some cables so I can't even judge it for
cable management
I mean how on earth are you even
powering this rig maybe instead of
spending money on that Glock you could
have picked up some nice sleeve cables
from cable mod no fire effects cores
the PC doesn't even have any cables to
power it up but I admire the effort you
put into this build think you rake for
entering but that wraps up this episode
of PC Wars make sure you guys use a
strawpoll link down below and vote on
who you think has the worst PC because
that person is gonna take home $100 also
don't forget to check out the samsung
960 pro m2 SSD if you guys want to boost
your PC speeds I'll drop a link to that
down below thank you so much for
watching and again a huge things to
Samsung for sponsoring this video I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
