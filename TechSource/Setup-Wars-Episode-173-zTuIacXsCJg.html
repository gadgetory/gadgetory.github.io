welcome to set up or is episode 170 what
number every year on I keep forgetting
well gonna settle for his episode 173
where you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel do you guys want
to participate you know what to do make
sure to watch the video linked down
below but with that said let the setup
wars begin

device sync so make sure to visit the
website listed on the screen or click
the link below and install it for free
on your desktop or smartphone thanks
again to LastPass for sponsoring this
portion in the video now let's get back
to support kicking off Depa so is
brandon from ohio and his setup wars
inspired setup he uses this for gaming
editing and homework so we have a single
ultra-wide from LG and some corsair gear
TK 55 keyboard and the dark core mouse
for audio he has a hyper x stinger
gaming headset and a blue Yeti
microphone hooked up to a boom arm which
appears to be not connected to anything
I noticed there are a few unnecessary
items on the desk which takes up a lot
of space like the VR headset and the
controllers there are many ways around
this a headphone hanger for the headset
is the most obvious one you can also
hook up these clips on the side of your
desk to hold your controllers and even
your headset or simply install a pullout
drawer like this one to store your small
items in either of these would make a
great addition to your setup and will
help clean up the surface a lot adding
some black and red skins to your ps4 is
optional but it will make it stand out
more but also contributes to the color
scheme you have going on one thing you
can do with the mouse wire is run it
underneath the keyboard and tied with
the keyboard wire so that there is only
one cable going across your setup just
make sure to leave enough cable slack
for the mouse and finally a wall Raceway
to hide the single cable going down from
the TV I know it's a very small
recommendation but every little bit
helps the PC powering it all has a Rison
5 2600
of RAM in the MSI GTX 970 which is
decent for 1080p gaming
however Brandon mostly plays on his ps4
he is also picking up some black and red
acoustic foams very soon to decorate the
wall and a poke sound bar which needs to
be mounted on the wall lots of work
definitely needs to be done to perfect
this setup but this is a great start
Thank You Brandon for sharing your setup
with us and by the way props on keeping
your carpet so damn clean I don't know
why that makes me so happy
Joey from New Jersey has a more
minimalistic setup that he built on a
custom made desk there's a couple two by
fours being used as a TV mount and he
used the backside of that to route the
cables straight down there wasn't that
many things on the desk just some
miscellaneous items and wireless
peripherals he's using the HP soft touch
keyboard and the e blue Razer wireless
mouse
I don't know how Joey can sit in front
of that massive screen a 40 inch TV is
just too big for me that close up I'm
hoping he's able to sit a bit further on
the edge of the desk otherwise he can go
blind pretty quickly that's pretty much
it on the surface other than the PC on
the far right it is a bit outdated with
the FX 6300 and a Radeon r9 380 but it
is a clean-looking build apparently he
uses this setup for gaming and video
editing one cool thing about the TV
mount is that he can swivel it I'm gonna
take a guess and say that he watches
videos while he works out judging by the
weights on the ground what can I say
it's a pretty straightforward setup that
does what it's supposed to really great
job on keeping it clean and organized
thank you Joey for entering a number 3
is Keith and a gorgeous gaming setup
featuring a 34 inch ultra wide that's
mounted against the wall and we have a
24 inch Dell monitor mounted vertically
on the desk he didn't say what the
purpose of the setup is but I'm gonna
jump in and assume it's for gaming and
productivity judging by the monitor
layout he's rocking the corsair k70 RGB
keyboard and white and a logitech g502
mouse if i'm not mistaken the k7 the mk2
has a USB pass-through near the top so
i'm curious why you didn't plug your
mouse in the keyboard and just have one
cable going across your desk I do want
to point out the position of the RGB
mouse pad though because I think it's
really clever
Keith's position in this way so that he
can run the cable underneath the desk
nicely done
Ferrari oh he's using the popular
Logitech Z 506 speakers and the void
headset hanging beautifully underneath
the desk cables are managed pretty good
I guess
I mean I personally wouldn't have used
tape on the cables it just doesn't look
good but hey if it works it works right
the PC pushing all those pixels as a
7700 K and a gtx 1080i liquid-cooled
and i got to say the color scheme in the
build is pretty sweet blue and purple
with white accents is not only unique
but actually looks pretty good I don't
know why but the funkopop collection up
top kind of bothers me not because it's
not centered but I feel like it will
have looked way better with the two
shelves on the outside and the posters
in the middle I don't know that just
might three cents awesome setup by the
way Thank You Keith for entering now
here's a pretty interesting setup coming
from Nick
apparently it's used mainly as a machine
learning workstation whatever on earth
that means but it does occasionally game
as well it consists of a ninety eight
inch carve the countertop and four
24-inch monitor is mounted on the desk
in a very unusual way first thing that
comes to mind when looking at this setup
is that Nick seems like a very serious
person
it's very intelligent but serious person
there isn't anything extra or decorative
in this setup nothing that screams
personality is just straight to the
point with the essentials you got his
monitors his PC and the peripherals
he's using the k68 RGB keyboard and a
scimitar Pro RGB mouse even the PC is
simple it's water-cooled but it doesn't
have any flashy RGB lighting custom
cables or even colored coolant the cable
management is also spot-on
I feel like Nick definitely knows what
it's doing there's nothing I can really
recommend to improve this setup and I
feel like he's the type of person I just
get done Thank You Nick for sharing
this exquisite setup
last but not least we have sorrow coming
in all the way from Switzerland and his
extremely clean gaming setup he also
uses it for CAD CNC and cam work he's
rocking two different 27-inch monitors
that I mounted against the wall and
right underneath the nano leaf panels I
love that he added a wall Raceway to
cover up all the cables running all the
way down to the wall outlet beautiful
work
he kept a desk fairly minimal with just
his k95 keyboard and he logitech g502
spectrum RGB mouse and a few dragon
figurines per audio he's using a sound
bar and a sub from Teufel I think that's
how you say it and a pair of AKG Pro
headphones hanging from underneath the
desk the PC is a custom-built
water-cooled beast using the 87 VK 32
gigs of ram and the Asus GTX 1080 Ti I
love the color scheme of this build I
mean the bends are done really well and
the clear coolant actually looks really
good in this build I feel like clear
coolant only looks the best in a white
themed PC cables I managed beautifully
with the help of cable clips and he even
drilled a small hole in the back board
to help with routing excellent job with
a setup and I just love how clean and
minimalistic it is with a hint of
personality and spice thank you Sarah
for entering and that's it for this
episode of setup words as always make
sure you guys vote in the comments

one because we got some pretty badass
setups and in this episode if you guys
want to see sneak peeks on upcoming
