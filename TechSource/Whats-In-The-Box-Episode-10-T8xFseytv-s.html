and I haven't done one of these in such
a long time as you can see because of
that I have accumulated some packages so
without wasting overtime let s begin
actually I'm going to start off this
episode with some fan mail that I
received and then we can move on to the
actual packages so I believe these are
actual fan mail and this one as well so
let's go and open these up and check
them out so the first one is from haha
prank calm I don't even know if I should
open this but why not a bomb is it party
pooper
spark up a party with this surprisingly
oh my god this is I actually came up
with an amazing idea I'm gonna use this
I'm breanne holy crap literally this is
gonna be such a great prank
maybe I'll post it on Twitter I don't
know whoever said that to me thank you
what's in there
did you do that alright next up we have
something from Amazon which was sent
directly to me oh no way somebody sent
me a knife so this is just a gift
receipt there's actually no note in the
box so I don't know who it's from but
whoever sent me this knife you're
freaking awesome thank you so much this
may even be my new unboxing knife check
it out oh no way dude is the exact same
knife it's the exact same knife but it's
brand new this is awesome this one's
getting rusty as you can see we're not
rusty but the paint is scraping off and
stuff so I'm definitely gonna start
using this on the next episode thank you
so much if you're watching this for
setting this knife and this means a lot
to me thank you
alright so these next two ones are
letters and this first one is labeled to
miss tech source source so I think
that's pretty hilarious this is from
flora USA Inc I'm not sure what they're
sending me but it's check it ads so it
looks like I have an old purpose plant
vitalizer and there's like a small
sample in here I'm not sure if this was
for promotional reasons but Thank You
flora USA Inc for sending this in I have
no plans unfortunately alright last one
is from Ethan let's check out what Ethan
is sending me looks like we got a letter
hey my name is Ethan and you've inspired
me to make a YouTube channel I've even
made tech videos and stuff
I've been blocking out my family and
eating less to upload more videos that
is not healthy man my channel is called
glutes or glutes my favorite video is
when you talked about the computer I've
actually learned a lot your best friend
Ethan and it's like a little picture of
me or my face I should say Photoshop on
there that's definitely not healthy man
to block out your family and eating less
I think health is more no health is
definitely more important learner for me
I went through some illness the past few
months and I've learned my lesson you
need to put your health first before
making youtube videos alright so now
let's move on to the boxes and start up
with the right side and open up this
package over here oh and as always guys
if you want to send me stuff all
unboxing in these episodes make sure you
can check out my PA box link below so
these are actually bumper cases these
arm upper cases from Rhino shield these
are for the iPhone 7 and 7 plus so I'm
going to be doing a drop test using
these can't wait to test these out thank
you I know shield for setting these out
cannot wait oh yeah these are the RAM
sticks the new Ram sticks from g.skill
these are the trident disease which are
most likely probably the sexiest RAM
sticks on this planet so one is in black
and yellow one is a black and white
these are coming up in a build the black
and white is actually going in a water
cool build that I'm working on for
October so very excited for that one
Thank You G skill for setting these in
so we have an iPad pro and it looks like
a head phone case that I ordered for
myself kind of like a black and red
hardcover
carrying case for my earphones and I
ordered the iPad pro because I'm going
to be doing a video using this so I
needed this
alright onto the long box
oh so these are basically accessories
that HP sent me as a thank you for doing
the laptop videos so you got a few
things in here this is all from the omen
lineup so we have a keyboard I think
it's mechanical let me check nope these
are not mechanical these are membrane
and looks like SteelSeries partnered up
with them to create this keyboard so
that's pretty cool it is RGB and looks
like we have a mousepad for some reason
I called a mouse in the last episode a
mousepad
I'm not even sure why like 10 times in a
row looks like we have a mouse as well
and of course to complete the
peripherals a gaming headset again
partnered with Steel series looks like
they partnered with Steel series on all
of these so let me know if you guys are
interested in making a video on this I'm
not required to make a video these are
just a thank-you gift and maybe you're
gonna give away hopefully there's an
come up on reddit anyways if you guys
want to see videos on these make sure to
let me know in the comments
alright four more boxes to go where is
my knife what's in this entire box
there's only a small bluetooth speaker
and a rocket book so this thing is
pretty cool this company reached out to
me and said hey if you want to check out
this sweet looking notebook basically
you can write in it with the provided
utensil and you can delete it by
throwing it in the microwave and it just
wipes the entire thing clean so this is
like the best notebook for school or
anything and you don't have to waste any
pages because you can clean it up with a
microwave so so yeah pretty much this is
the notebook it's got like a little grid
with a bunch of dots on there and this
is the pen that we provide it's pretty
cool actually what this what's also
really cool about this is when you write
something on here you can actually scan
the QR and it saves this page so you can
share it online which is pretty cool so
yeah this is going to be in my cool tech
video can't wait to feature it but if
you guys want to check it out early I'll
drop a link to it down below and this is
pretty much just a
a SmartMusic lamp it's a lamp that glows
and plays music you can change the
colors I thought it's pretty cool maybe
