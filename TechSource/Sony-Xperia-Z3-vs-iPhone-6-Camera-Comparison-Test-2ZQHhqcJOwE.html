cell cashier compares iPhone prices on
the Internet and gives you a quick quote
and the most cash for your iPhone so if
you're looking to get the best price for
your iPhone definitely check them out
it's simple fast and secure what's up
guys it's ed from tech source and in
this video I will be comparing the
cameras on the Xperia z3 and the iPhone
6 but Before we jump into samples let's
take a quick look at their camera specs
the z3 has a twenty point seven
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.0 some notable camera
features include autofocus during
recording touch to focus slow motion at
120 fps and digital image stabilization
the camera can also record in 4k
resolution at 30fps and 1080p and 60fps
the iPhone 6 has an 8 megapixel camera
with an aperture of 2.2 and some notable
camera features include autofocus during
recording tap to focus slow motion at
240 FPS and digital image stabilization
the 6 can also shoot in 1080p at 30fps
for front-facing cameras as III has a
two point two megapixel camera that can
shoot in 1080p or as the iPhone 6 is 1.2
megapixel front-facing camera can only
shoot in 720p at 30fps
okay so that's enough about the specs
let's sit back relax and take a look at
some samples I hope you guys enjoy the
video
what does up you guys that sat back
again from Texas and once again we are
comparing the cameras on both of the
phones that you see above there will be
an audio icon displayed on each video
and I'll basically tell you which bones
audio is being used at the time both of
the phones are strapped onto one device
and they are both secure so whatever you
are seeing right now on the footage is
basically very accurate in terms of
stability so in other words if one phone
shakes so does the other those of you
that are new to my channel I do these
types of videos all the time especially
for new phones and I compare them to the
other flagships so these are type of
videos that you're interested in then
you should consider subscribing because
there's definitely a lot more to come
when it comes to autofocusing the z3
does a decent job it's not the fastest
when it comes to focusing speeds but it
still gets the job done it's also really
accurate it doesn't have a problem
detecting the object that I'm trying to
focus on so overall that has a very
solid sensors
the iPhone 6 however does a much better
job it uses its focused pixels to
quickly focus on the target and it is
insanely accurate as you can tell from
this video the only other smartphone
that I have used that comes close to
these speeds is the LG g3 which I have
also done a comparison on as well all
right so this was an interesting test
first off I want to talk about the date
pics both phones did a pretty good job
however the z3 has a bit more contrast
and saturation than it's supposed to if
I had to choose which phone had more
true-to-life colors it has to be the
iPhone 6 I mean look at the flowers in
this pic these are supposed to be red
not pink the z3 however does have
sharper images that's for sure if you
pay close attention to this pic you can
see more detail on the petals in the z3
compared to the iPhone 6 I have to give
another point to the 6 for indoor shots
as well the whites are just more white
and overall the quality is much more
crisp and clear now when it comes to
night pics with flash I was extremely
disappointed with the z3 its flash is
actually even worse than the note 4 is
it over exposes the object and it just
comes out horrible the 6 definitely
takes the point here as well no question
for daytime video of both phones did a
great job on the quality of the image
however the z3 just sounds more crisp
and clear to me than the iPhone 6 and
even though both have digital image
stabilization the z3 looks a lot more
stable than the iPhone 6 so I'm gonna
give the point to the z3 for daylight
video for low-light video however I
think it's pretty clear that the iPhone
6 does a better job yes it does have a
lot more noise than the z3 but at least
you can see more in the iPhone 6 video I
also noticed at some points that the z3
had trouble focusing at night so that's
definitely something to factor in as
well I guess I'll have to give the point
to the iPhone 6 for low-light
performance so overall I think that the
iPhone 6 has a much better camera than
the z3 it's really a shame because I was
expecting the z3 to win in this category
since I was going to make this my daily
driver but I wanted to know what you
guys think about the test do you agree
or disagree with me let me know by
dropping a comment down below I will be
reading all the comments if you're
interested in seeing more z3 content

down below as there will be links to
other videos
that I have done with the z3 anyways
