some more CES coverage what you're
looking at is Toshiba's new home
entertainment experience it has multiple
displays inside the black mirror this is
the kind of things you see in movies
that take place in the future you can
project multiple images freely wherever
you desire or even decide to view one
big image that covers the entire mirror
the displays are very crisp and clear as
you can see and you control the device
with a remote from what we can see in
here there currently is no audio
probably because you can view multiple
videos at once and it wouldn't sound
that great as of today Toshiba hasn't
revealed a price nor release date on
this product the next product we looked
at was very similar to the first one
except that it had an interactive
interface you can view the weather
create memos for yourself or even read
the news all while brushing your teeth
in the morning the sensor gets mounted
on the top of the mirror and you use
your hand as the mouse to navigate
through the screen to select an item you
basically hold your hand in place for
one second and it registers that as a
click it's not the most accurate device
in the world but then again it is still
a prototype I mean it'd be pretty cool
to review one of these in the new future
but that's basically all I wanted to
show you guys for this segment this is
just one of the innovative products that
Toshiba is currently working on they
definitely have a few other awesome
stuff you at CES if you guys don't want
to miss out any cool stuff being
announced and hit that subscribe button
this is add here a text source and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
