myself and D brand skins when a video
which 50,000 likes or something like
that well I'll see if we can do that
again just because I'm feeling a bit
bored I want to spice up these videos
once again so this video is 50,000 likes
I will not only cover my face and head
indie brands but my entire arm and upper
body as well so I'm not gonna be wearing
a shirt or a shirt or anything and it's
going to be covering everything indie
band skin so that should be pretty
interesting so welcome to Star Wars
Episode a 96 where you submit your desk
setup to get featured on the channel if
you want to participate make sure to
watch the video linked down below
that's it setup boys begin
starting off the show is alesandro's
white-and-black gaming setup featuring
two 27-inch asus monitors and the first
thing i noticed is how cluttered the
surface of the desk is we have two mice
a pair of headphone and xbox controller
and an external hard drive taking up
some space on the desk the only logical
explanation I can think of why he has
both an MX master and a Logitech g600
mouse is for gaming and productivity but
even then I would at least put the other
mouse and the extra stuff in a drawer
somewhere instead of leaving it on the
desk he also has the corsair strafe RGB
keyboard and that's pretty much all
that's on the desk except for some Star
Wars figurines we got my boy Kyle over
there chilling next to his PC which by
the way seriously needs some cable
management tips so what on earth is this
disaster if you're going to go with a
clear side panel like I keep saying
please work on your cable management
especially if it's a badass PC I mean
this thing is rocking a 68 50 K + 2 GTX
1080s if you're spending that much money
on your parts why not spend some extra
money on cables or the very least work
on the cable management speaking of
which the entire setup needs work on
that as well we're talking some velcro
straps cable boxes and even sleeves to
fix this monstrosity I definitely see a
lot of potential here you stay true to
the color scheme and have an awesome
desk to work with just gotta split up a
few things I'll recommend putting the PC
on the bottom of the desk since the
insides aren't lily worth looking at and
instead I would put a desk organizer on
the top to keep most of your stuff in
like the extra Mouse and the external
hard drive I found a few good ones on
Amazon which I will link below if anyone
is interested regardless thank you
alessandro for entering changing things
up we got a pretty wicked triple display
set up from Colin he's walking three
24-inch Dell monitors hooked up to the
vivo hex band and below that we got the
Corsair Vengeance k-6 t5 keyboard and
Corsair m65 mouse sitting on top of the
perixx mousepad now even though he
didn't drill a hole for those cables I
will give him some credit because it's
hardly noticeable for my distance from
the way he routed them around the
monitor stand for audio he's using a
pair of clip speakers and the Sennheiser
HD 380 pro headphones and he also has a
blue snowball mic right in the center I
mean
the tree is definitely there I think
Colin did a great job putting all of
this together it's symmetrical it's
organized and that desk mod looks pretty
damn cool it appears you installed for
capital eggs on the top of the IKEA Alex
yours and hooked up the IKEA ham our
countertop right above it very nice and
also props on keeping everything
organized under the desk as well the PC
that's pushing all these pixels has a
4690k and two gigabytes 770's Colin does
have another set up which I'm assuming
is for productivity and it's powered by
a 15-inch MacBook Pro that's sitting on
the M stand and that's also hooked up to
a 2 terabyte external hard drives from
WD pretty straightforward and nothing
too crazy here and finally if you want
to mention the wall of Lego models
I honestly didn't even know that Lego
had architecture versions until I saw
this set up it's kind of like Legos for
adults but that's pretty nice display of
some of your creations you got there no
major complaints this is a
well-put-together setup and I like it
Thank You Colin for entering and number
three we got Gabe was a pretty cool
single monitor setup he's got the 24
inch asus monitor right below a 42 inch
Samsung Smart TV which is using as an
overhead we do got some acoustic bottoms
on the wall for aesthetics since I don't
see a microphone set up anywhere but we
do have a pair of can tell you five
speakers and it looks like that's the
only audio source he has for his setup
the keyboard and mouse combo are both
from Logitech she's using the G 9 10 and
g502 proteus spectrum the set up
definitely feels full as in there isn't
any empty spaces and at the same time
it's not cramped which is perfect adding
some props like the halo energy sword on
the wall are a great way to add some
personality to this setup I also love
that it didn't force this PC on the desk
and instead put it on top of this drawer
next to it looks like it's a mini ITX
build with an i-5 6500 and an Asus 1060
I like how he not only kept with the
color scheme of a set up but also the
LEDs are matching has set up as well
nicely done and finally we've got the
cable management everything is hooked up
on the Signum and he mounted his power
strip on the top as well as a hole
drilled for the keyboard and mouse not a
bad setup Thank You Gabe for entering
now here is a setup that will mesmerize
you with a full-blown space theme
the Samsung 55 inch 4k curved TV as the
centerpiece of this entire setup I mean
this dude's room is the perfect
definition of a mancave there's a lot
going on from the dozens of posters on
the wall to the massive Diablo 3 props
against the space wall and even the
retro game collection he has on the
other side displays screams I'm a gamer
and I don't give a what you think I love
it we're talking classics here Zelda
Perfect Dark Castlevania Goldeneye but
where the hell is Super Smash Bros this
dude even as comic books and collector's
edition items which I'm sure cost a lot
of money but enough drooling over to use
let's get back to the actual setup he's
also using the Razer BlackWidow chroma
keyboard and Mambo Mouse which is
sitting on a firefly mousepad but what's
interesting is that he also has a giant
space mouse pad on his desk
the commitment to the space theme is
truly admire about it doesn't look like
he's using any speakers so the only
audio source is the Modi blue headphones
I'm not sure about the cable management
situation as well since there is a giant
backboard covering everything so if I
can't see it I can't complain about it I
also think that Josh picked the perfect
case that matches his setups team this
is the in win 805 case and he also has a
custom-made infinity mirror desk just
for his PC like I said the level of
commitment is next level the color
scheme and cable management inside the
PC though that's a different story it's
rocking a 6700 K and 2 980ti s and SLI
I'm definitely not a fan of the color
scheme and I feel like those GPU cables
can definitely be improved but
everything else in this entire room is
awesome it's definitely in my top 5 man
cave I've seen on the show Thank You
Josh for entering last not least we have
Jonas and a very simple yet gorgeous
setup featuring the 29 inch ultra wide
monitor from LG presentation is
definitely their symmetry color scheme
and even cable management who says you
need to have your PC on the desk to have
a good-looking setup although I think
using red foams instead of black or even
a combination of both would have looked
much better than just speaking with
black but I will give you props on how
you mounted that monitor against the
wall and using those foams around it to
hide the cables running down under the
desk that's where
clever on the desk you got the Vengeance
k70 keyboard and hero cat time Mouse
that's sitting on top of the
cool-looking trust GXT extended mousepad
he's also using the HyperX cloud 2
headset but he also has a pair of
Edifier M 20 to 80 speakers it's such a
clean and minimalistic setup and I feel
like that keyboard wire really ruins it
regardless the rest of the cable
management is excellent and the PC
that's powering this setup has the 47 70
and a single ZOTAC gtx 980ti not much
else to say job well done a very clean
very organized
