this video I'm only going over a really
cool anonymous app which lets you
basically voice your opinions without
any backlash or judgment if I can
summarize it is basically a really cool
and clean version of reddit and I've
actually teamed up with the creator's to
give you guys three five hundred dollar
gaming PC's to three separate winners
but more info on that later in this
video so this is candid and what this
app really does is connect you with
people who have the same interest as you
whether that be tech or some really
weird stuff can it pretty much has it
all the first step to get started is by
downloading the app which is available
on Android and iOS then you can launch
the application and select your age
group and choose your interests the tech
category for example has well over
20,000 members who actively voice their
opinion on the latest devices such as
the galaxy note 7 recall incident or
Apple removing the headphone jack on the
iphone 7 you can also ask questions and
recommendations from other users some of
the posts I found were asking for
headphones and a certain price budget or
PC cases and even though it was one dude
who wanted ideas and how to destroy his
iPhone on these posts you can then
choose a variety of actions such as like
or dislike share and even comment the
feed is split up between new friends
posts and hot which is basically the
trending topics I've actually created
our own texturas group page so feel free
to join and three random people will be
selected to win a five-hundred-dollar
gaming PC so basically to enter to win
one of the five hundred dollar gaming
PC's all you have to do is join the
group and post a picture of your pc
setup or your desk setup it's pretty
much that simple and also be hanging
around on the group and answering your
questions and also be taking a look at
your setups as well by the way you don't
have to have a PC it could be your cell
phone setup it could be your tablet set
up it could be your laptop setup it
could even be your gaming setup for your
console so you don't have to have a PC
to enter this giveaway in the text horse
candidate group you will definitely find
other people with similar interests as
you and it's a great place to ask for
advice or drop a video topic suggestion
the key to have fun in this app is to
really be active in other communities
and maybe even make your own the app
also allows you to add anonymous friends
which sounds weird at first but in
practice
makes the app a lot more interesting
remember all the posts are completely
anonymous and under a random screen name
so you can get personal and express your
opinion without any worries ever since I
started making this video Canada's
actually become one of my daily apps
that I use alongside Twitter Instagram
and of course the YouTube app so if you
guys joined the textos group you will
see me posting on there occasionally
obviously you can tell which posts are
mine because of the stuff that I put on
there but I pretty much does it for this
video as always I'll drop a link to the
app down below it's completely free make
sure you guys download and try it out I
think you guys will love it especially
if you like something like Twitter or
imgur and stuff like that also leave
links to the giveaway information in
case you guys want to check that out as
well I'll announce the winners on my
twitter account sometime in late
September more information on my twitter
account that's basically it you guys so
much for watching and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
