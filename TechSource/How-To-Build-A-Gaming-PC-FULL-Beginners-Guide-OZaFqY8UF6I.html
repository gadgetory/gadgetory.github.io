welcome to the build guide everyone has
been waiting for if you've never built a
PC in your life because you don't know
how or maybe you're just scared you
might damaged something well I'm here to
tell you that it's gonna be fine because
this is a step by step very detailed
build guide made just for beginners I'm
also gonna show you guys how to install
windows how to download and install the
drivers and I'm even gonna show you how
to overclock the GPU so that way you can
get more frames out of it if you guys
using different parts than what I have
in my build then that is completely fine
you can actually use this build guide to
help you build your own PC as well the
PC we are building today is the popular
Blue Lotus which is a sub seven hundred
dollar PC that will destroy any game you
throw at it over 60fps whether you're
playing GTA 5 destiny 2 or even pub G if
you guys want to check out the
benchmarks I did for this PC I'll leave
a link below along with all the parts I
used there's a few things I recommend
before building a PC now obviously you
will need all seven parts but aside from
that I recommend a screwdriver the kid
I'm using here is from iFixit and it
offers all the necessary tools for a
complete PC build I'll drop a link below
if you guys want to check it out
I also recommend one or two shot glasses
or any small tray that will serve as a
place to keep your screws safe because
they tend to roll around on the table
and get lost another thing you will need
is a blank USB with at least eight gigs
of space and finally if you're not going
to be using the ethernet cable to
connect to the internet a Wi-Fi adapter
is a cheap alternative of connecting to
the internet wirelessly this is the one
I'm using for the video and I strongly
recommend it cost twenty-five dollars
but offers up to 1200 megabits per
second with support for 2.4 and 5.8
diggers bands if you're building on
carpet I do recommend building on a
wooden desk however metal surfaces are
fine as well as long as it's properly
grounded you don't need to buy an
anti-static mat or wristband however if
you want to be extra cautious you can
pick one up for only $6 on Amazon and
once again I'll drop a link to it below
I've been building pcs well over five
years now and I've never used one of
those anti-static
things but it's better to be safe than
sorry don't shuffle your feet on carpets
don't pet your cats as long as you touch
a metal surface that's grounded before
you handle your components then you'll
be completely fine also another tip when
handling the parts if there is a plastic
section or a plastic piece on it make
sure you're grabbing it from that and
also make sure you guys aren't touching
any of the circuits side with your hands
that's also one way of damaging the
components step one you will need a
motherboard CPU and RAM sticks so put
the other boxes aside and begin opening
up the motherboard box once you take it
out of the anti-static bag place it on
the top of the motherboard box but
actually before you do that make sure to
take out the following from inside you
will need the i/o shield and the SATA
cables one for each storage device we
are connecting if you have only one
drive then one is all you need next take
out the CPU and it's cooler from the box
and be very careful not to touch the
bottom part of the cooler because it
does come pre applied with a thermal
paste if you're gonna set it down on the
table set it upside down so that the
thermal paste is facing upwards make
sure you are handling the CPU from its
edges do not touch the bottom or the
surface of the processor if you look
closely at your CPU you will find a
triangle on one of the corners you're
gonna have to align that triangle with a
CPU socket cover go back to the
motherboard and push down on the lever
and pull it out from its side and lift
it up until the cover flips open gently
lower the CPU down into the socket while
grabbing it from both sides again do not
touch the surface of it and make sure
that the two triangles are aligned and
gently let it go do not apply any force
on the CPU it should fall right in place
you can tell if it's completely seated
by checking out the two notches near the
edges generally know where to cover down
and lock the CPU in place the black
piece usually pops right off if you
tighten the lever but if it doesn't make
sure to pull it out before you continue
now it's time to install the cooler if
you're using a different cooler just
make sure to follow the instructions on
the manual it's very easy to install
however if you're using the stock cooler
like me in the video then all you have
to do is align the four pins from the
heatsink to the four holes on the mother
but before you install it you have to
make sure the cable is long enough to
reach the fan header on the motherboard
in my case it was like a few centimeters
too short if I were to install it right
side up so unfortunately I had to rotate
the cooler about 45 degrees to get that
extra cable slack gently lower the
cooler on top of the CPU while making
sure all the four pins aligned with the
four holes on the motherboard and then
you can go ahead and let go of the
cooler and press down on the legs one at
a time
make sure you are locking the pins
diagonally tuck on the cooler a little
bit to make sure it's fully secured once
all the four pins are locked in the
board it's time to hook up the cooler
fan so grab the four pin cable from the
heatsink and connect it to the CPU fan
header on the motherboard which should
be right next to the RAM sticks above
the cooler now it's time to install the
RAM sticks if you guys look on the
motherboard you will see a label showing
you what the RAM slots to occupy first
if there are two sticks you have to
install them on a two and the b2 before
you occupy the others if you're
installing only one then you have to put
it in slot a to only grab the RAM stick
one at a time and make sure the gap on
the bottom of the RAM stick aligns with
the notch on the RAM slot as you guys
can see in the video it's facing the
incorrect way so I had to flip it the
opposite way gently lower the RAM stick
down evenly and push down from the
center until it snaps in place feel free
to use both of your hands to do this if
you pay attention both of the clips on
the sides should lock in place if done
right take off both side panels from the
PC by removing all four of the thumb
screws afterwards I put the screws in
one of the shot glasses so that they
don't get lost every case comes at
either a box or a bag of screws needed
to install the hardware so take the bag
or box out of the case and set it aside
for now next it's time to install the
i/o shield so tear that out of the
plastic and make sure you're holding it
so that the six circles are on the
bottom and slide it in the back of the
case from the inside if you can get the
i/o shield installed then you can pretty
much build a PC this is literally the
hardest part of building any rig make
sure you're applying pressure on all
four corners evenly until it snaps in
place whatever you do do not apply
pressure in the center otherwise it will
Bend and most likely
use the corners instead next up we need
to install these standoffs but this case
actually comes with six of them already
pre-installed however we do need to
install the other three on the right
side since we are using an ATX
motherboard you can find the standoff
screws inside the bag that you removed
from the case earlier the best way to
figure out which standoffs screws you
will need to install is by just placing
the motherboard in the case and figuring
out where the holes align as you guys
can see the top three are missing
standoffs screws so I went ahead and
install them right after you're gonna
need this type of screw to secure the
motherboard in mine uses 8 however every
motherboard is different depending on
the form factor just look at how many
holes your motherboard has and that's
how many screws you will need start by
screwing them in one by one feel free to
use a crisscross pattern until the
motherboard is fully tightened down
whatever you do make sure you guys do
not over tighten the motherboard we
might as well connect the rear fan to
the motherboard right now and get it out
of the way so grab the 3 pin cable
coming from the rear fan and connect it
to the system fan header on the
motherboard which should be right next
to the side of the RAM sticks let's hook
up the power supply now so with the fan
facing down slide the power supply
towards the back of the case and make
sure the four screw holes align with the
cutouts on the case before you start
screwing them in you will need four of
these screws which you can find either
in a bag that came with the case or in
the tiny bag that comes with the power
supply now it's time to hook up the
storage if you're using either an SSD or
a hard drive you can use one of these
three hard drive bays you will need to
match the screw holes on the hard drive
with the two knobs on the tray with the
back end of the hard drive facing
towards the end lower one side of the
drive in and slide the other side in by
stretching the tray a little bit you can
also put an SSD in here as well but you
will need four tiny screws to install
them you can find those screws in the
same bag additionally you can install
your SSD up here near the optical drive
area or you can hook it up in the back
of the case on its side just make sure
to tighten all four screws to hold it in
place now it's time to hook up your
storage device so whether you're using a
hard drive or an SSD
you will need a SATA cable that we
pulled out for them
bored earlier we're also gonna need one
data cable that you can find coming out
of the power supply looking at the back
of the harddrive you will need to plug
the SATA cable and the smaller slot and
I do recommend using the l-shaped cable
instead of the straight one for easier
cable management and the other end
connects to the motherboard but pay
attention to this part because it's
important if you're installing an m2 SSD
do not use SATA one it's actually
labeled right on the motherboard instead
you can use SATA 2 or any of the other
SATA ports right below that like I've
done in this video the data cable
connects right next to the SATA cable if
it doesn't fit in the first time turn it
upside down and try it again
both of these cables only fit one way so
this is what your PC should look like so
far all the main components are
connected and the final piece we need to
hook up is the graphics card don't worry
about cable management just yet we can
work on that once everything is
completed by the way I hope you guys are
enjoying the build guide so far believe
it or not does taking a very long time
to put this all together and dropping a
simple like would be very appreciated
thank you start by removing the screw in
the back to access two PCI slots so
you'll need to remove the second and
third PCI covers and the best way to do
this is by folding it a few times until
it snaps off you will need to align this
part of the PCB on your GPU with the top
PCI slot on the motherboard and it's
always recommended to install your GPU
on the top slot for most performance
generally bring the GPU closer until you
can feel it slide in place and once you
feel it's sinking in apply some pressure
until you hear it snap in place while
holding the GPU at the same time screw
in the PCI bracket in the back of the
case that way it prevents the GPU from
sagging if you accidentally remove the
top PCI bracket like me you can take
this time to put it back on close the
cover and screw it shut once you are
done now it's time to connect all the
cables and we can start off with the GPU
cable labeled PCIe
and it looks something like this grab
the six pin part and connect it to the
GPU socket near the edge of the card and
make sure you guys hear it snap in place
next we are ready to give some power to
the motherboard so we have the 24 pin
cable that looks like this and connect
it to the 24 pin socket on the
motherboard make sure it sits flush and
that there
no gap between it always remember if it
doesn't fit it doesn't belong there next
up is the cable with the words CPU label
on it combine both of them together and
slide it in the socket right above the
CPU cooler to the left the next cable
has a blue tip and this is to power the
front USB 3.0 ports on the case if you
don't have any USB 3 ports in the front
then you don't have this cable so this
one connects right under the 24 pin we
just connected just make sure that the
notch is facing the correct direction
before inserting it in because if it's
incorrect you can damage the pins also
make sure you are inserting it at a
straight angle if it's slightly bent
you can also damage the pins that way
the other cable is used to power the
front out of your port so that you can
connect your headset or microphone and
it's labeled HD audio this one connects
to the far left side of the motherboard
on the bottom and the pins on the
motherboard are labeled J audio one in
case you are having problems finding it
with the words on the cable facing up
insert the connector gently you might
need to apply some pressure for it to go
all the way in the USB connector is to
power the other two USB ports and this
one can go in either of the USB headers
on the motherboard labeled J USB 2 or J
USB 1 you can find both of them on the
bottom side of the motherboard towards
the middle now it's time to hook up the
two fans in the front of the case grab
both of the molex connectors coming out
of each fan and you're gonna connect it
to the molex connector coming out of the
PSU we're basically gonna chain all
three them together so connect one to
the PSU and you can connect the other
one right on top of it just like this
and finally the last set of cables we
need to connect is to power the front
panel of the case however you need to
pay attention to this one because it's a
little different from the others the
first one we are connecting is labeled
reset SW which is short for a switch
with the words facing down you need to
connect this to pin number three and pin
number four on the bottom row just like
this next up is the power switch with
the words facing up we're gonna plug
this right on top of the reset switch to
be honest the direction doesn't really
matter on these two but I did it this
way to make it easy for you guys to
follow the next cable is the HDD LED and
this one actually matters
which way you plug it in make sure the
words are facing down before plugging it
in right next to the reset switch on the
second row just like this the final two
are the power led plus and minus pins
the plus goes in first followed by the
minus one it's actually easier to go
backwards so I plugged in the minus one
on the second pin and then I plugged in
the plus cable if you did it correctly
this is how it should look like from the
bottom of the motherboard
we got the H TV led first and then the
reset switch and from the opposite side
this is what it should look like coming
from the right to left you should see
the power LED plus power LED minus
followed by the power switch notice that
there is a pin missing as well as there
being an extra pin right next to that
and that's completely normal
you're officially done plugging
everything and take this time to work on
the cable management now that you know
where everything connects to here's a
quick tip with the CPU cable I was
actually barely able to run the CPU
cable from the back of the motherboard
into the socket and all I had to do was
pull the motherboard towards me just a
bit in order to give it enough space to
squeeze it through instead of running
the entire cable across the motherboard
obviously you will need to remove that
screw on the motherboard in order to
pull it forward
for the front panel cables I was able to
route them through the front of the case
through the side of the fans and then
out from the back of the case I made
sure to use the extra space underneath
the hard disk trays to hide some of that
excess cables and using velcro straps
and zip ties really keeps everything
nice and tidy if you followed all the
steps then you are pretty much done
congratulations on building your very
first PC but we are only halfway done
now it's time to install the operating
system download the drivers and
overclock your GPU here are the current
time steps if you guys just want to skip
to that portion of the video first step
is to find a computer either a desktop
PC or a laptop with a working USB port
because you will need to plug in your 8
gigabyte USB Drive and visit the
Microsoft website to download the
windows files we are installing Windows
10 on to this PC but I'll leave a link
to windows 8.1 pro if that's what you
guys prefer instead click on the
download tools Now option and open it up
once it
downloading follow the on-screen
instructions until you get to this page
where you have to select the create
installation media afterwards you can
hit next keep everything default and
make sure you guys are selecting the USB
Drive that you want the files installed
on keep in mind everything will be
deleted on that USB stick so save the
files that you want to keep click on
next and let it download and do its
thing once everything is done it will
tell you that your USB Drive it is ready
to go so click on done take the USB
Drive and plug it into your PC that you
just built and hit the power button if
it doesn't turn on make sure the switch
on the back is flipped to the straight
line indicator once your PC boots you
will get a first-time boot message
stating that you have to hit a certain
key to load default settings and the
BIOS and continue or something similar
it's usually the f5 key but whatever it
is make sure you're paying attention to
what it says on the screen because we're
gonna be skipping the BIOS setup for now
your computer will now try and detect an
operating system now obviously there is
none so we'll boot straight from a USB
Drive by default and it will take you to
the Windows setup screen anyways once
you get to the Windows setup screen just
follow the on-screen instructions until
it ask you to enter in the CD key you
can either pay full price for it and get
it online or you can get a cheaper on
kinguin once you get your key enter it
in here and click Next select the
correct version of Windows that you
purchased for the CD key and then you
can click Next again and over here you
will need to select custom over here we
get to pick where we want the operating
system installed on if you have only one
drive then the selection is obvious
however if you have several then you
have to select which one to install the
operating system
I recommend installing the OS on an SSD
or an MDOT to drive whichever one you
have if you don't have either then it
doesn't really matter
a quick note if the drive has files on
it and you don't mind wiping it clean
then you will need to format it before
you click Next otherwise it won't let
you install the files keep in mind that
you will lose all the data in your hard
drive once you hit next sit back and
relax while windows installs the files
onto your drive this process can take up
to 30 minutes depending on the drive
speed once you are done it will take you
to the setup screen so just make sure to
follow the on-screen instructions until
it takes you to the Wi-Fi
set up now this is where the Wi-Fi card
comes in handy because without it you
can't access the internet until you
download the drivers finish setting
everything up until Windows takes you to
the desktop now if you guys are having
problems with your PC whether it's not
turning on or you're getting a black
screen on boot whatever it is I've
listed some troubleshooting tips down
below if you guys want to check that out
if you have access to the Internet then
we need to download the drivers straight
on to this PC however if you don't have
access then you will need to use another
computer to download the drivers onto a
USB and then bring those files back to
the PC you just built so visit the msi
service page for the board and download
the following drivers once all of them
are downloaded open each file and make
sure you guys extract the contents out
of the folder before installing them
otherwise you might run into some errors
next it's time to install the graphics
driver visit the g-force website and
download the GeForce experience by the
way guys I'll drop a link to all this
down below so all you have to do is
click on the link and just download all
the files once all the drivers are
up-to-date and installed
do a fresh restart of the PC but
immediately hit the delete key so that
we can get into the BIOS
we can't overclock the CPU since it has
a locked processor but we can set the
XMP profile for the RAM and that way we
can squeeze out more performance out of
this build once you are in the BIOS set
the f7 key to switch to advanced mode
and from here select the overclock
settings then we can scroll down an
enable extreme memory profile and for
the d-brane frequency we're going to set
it to 3,600 megahertz
finally we have to scroll down and set
the DRAM voltage to 1.35 once you are
done with all of that hit f10 which will
save the changes and it will take you
back to the desktop alright guys now
it's time to overclock your GPU and for
that we need both MSI Afterburner and
the heav'n benchmark tool once again
I'll leave a link below to download them
they are both completely free install
and open up both programs but first
let's open up the heav'n benchmark tool
and make sure that the fullscreen option
is not checked and put the resolution to
1080p and hit run it will start running
in the background at this time open up
msi afterburner so that it's overlapping
behave in benchmark just like how it is
in the video we're gonna be dragging the
power limit and temp limit bar all the
way up
to the right side so it's maxed out and
from here we're gonna be gradually
increasing the core clock speed until
the GPU crashes I normally do increments
of 25 megahertz so I double click on the
plus zero icon right above the bar and
enter in my own value I start off with
25 megahertz I wait about five seconds
and if it doesn't crash I bump it up
another 25 megahertz I keep doing this
until I reach a point where the GPU
can't handle it anymore and the program
begins to crash as you guys can see I
got it all the way up to 250 megahertz
before the heav'n benchmark started
crashing that means the core clock is
set to high and the GPU can't handle it
so we're gonna have to go back and lower
the clock speed so I set it back to 225
instead of 250 and we ran the benchmark
now that we know it can handle 225 we
need to leave the benchmark running for
a full cycle just to make sure it's
stable
once the benchmark completes and it
doesn't crash we are ready to move on to
the memory clock again it's the same
concept over here however I do
increments of 100 instead of 25 since
memory is a lot easier to overclock so
naturally I start with 200 I wait five
seconds bump it up another 100 and so on
and so forth
until we get a crash so I got a two 500
megahertz before the benchmarks started
freezing so obviously I pushed it way
too much I'm gonna put it back to 400
megahertz and restart the benchmark now
instead of increasing about 100 I'm
gonna try 50 instead and see how far I
can go as you can see it's still crashed
even at 450 so the sweet spot is
obviously somewhere between 450 and 411
425 and I let it ran for a full cycle
and voila a stable clock speed over 2000
megahertz on the boost clock and 80 856
on the memory now if your PC freezes or
crashes during gaming then that means
you have to lower the clock speed even
more the heaven benchmark isn't that
demanding on the GPU so when you play
games like pop G which are more
demanding it might push your GPU even
further and that is when you'll start
seeing crashes so if that does happen go
back and lower the clock speed and if
that doesn't work then you have to lower
the memory clock speed as well you just
have to play around both of them until
you find a sweet spot but yeah guys if
anyone traps up this bit
Gide it took me almost a week to make
this video it was a very long process so
dropping a like or even a dislike would
be appreciated and let me know in the
comments section if you guys are
planning to build this exact same PC or
if it was helpful
anyways thank you so much again for
watching I will see you guys in the next
