sitting over the past 10 minutes trying
to figure out a way to start this video
because these are getting very redundant
and I'm running out of things to say
pretty much said everything that I can
the past like five hundred thousand
subscriber milestones and these are
happening so frequently that I have
nothing new to say everything i say is
basically has been said before i let me
make any sense anymore but anyways thank
you guys so much for your support seven
freakin hundred thousand subscribers i'm
only 300,000 subscribers away from
hitting that million which i'm looking
forward to so much i can't wait to get
that golden plaque and hang it up there
with a silver play button is right now
but the growth of the channel is insane
honestly just been ridiculous this past
few months this past six months i should
say it's not really slowing down and i
am very thankful i'm very grateful to
have amazing subscribers like you guys
if you recently joined text sores the
past few weeks or even the past month i
want to thank you for joining i hope you
enjoy my content and my main goal is not
to disappoint so thank you guys for
joining and also huge thanks to everyone
who's been subscribed since day one
since i had a thousand subscribers or
even like the past few years you guys
are MVPs thank you so much so with that
said you guys know the drill every time
I hit a hundred thousand subscribers
more I host a giveaway a special
giveaway actually and um honestly I
haven't really had time to sit down and
think about what I should be giving away
so I'm just really I'm just going with
the flow right now so I'll probably just
do a giveaway on the ice cube pc that
I've built for last month this is a
six-hundred-dollar gaming PC that's able
to run a lot of games over 60 FPS you
guys can check out the benchmark video
if you want to know what I'm talking
about but I'll give away two of those 22
lucky subscribers one for my YouTube
audience and 14
my vessel audience and if you guys are a
subscriber on vessel that means you have
two chances of winning obviously you can
participate in a vessel platform and
YouTube so that's two chances of waiting
I'll drop links to my vessel account or
vessel video down below you guys want to
participate so this is an international
giveaway so no matter where you are on
this planet I will ship the pc to you
luckily it's a very tiny pc case so i
won't be paying much for shipping which
is why i'm able to do this
internationally so the requirements are
very simple all you have to do is drop a
comment down below in one sentence
telling me how you found texas how did
you come across my texas channel on
youtube I just let me know in the
comment section down below it's kind of
like a survey just so I can read the
comments and determine what video
brought you to text sores so the choir
minds are the same for YouTube and
vessel like I said if you're a vessel
subscriber you guys have two chances of
winning and also follow me on Twitter
that is the second requirement because
that is where I'll be announcing the
winner was today today is the eighth so
I will be announcing the winner on the
twentieth of June so this month on my
Twitter accounts so make sure to check
on my Twitter account on the 20th or
follow me whichever it isn't really
matter and that is when the winners will
be announced yeah I'll give the winner
about 24 hours to respond if not i'll
pick another winner and that's basically
it i'm gonna have the video thank you
guys so much for watching thank you so
much for your support i am i am like a
loss for words thank you so much for
your support I'm like repeating myself
as you can tell anyways thank you thank
you so much i love you guys as always
