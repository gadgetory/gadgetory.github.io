always everyone's gear for the setups
will be linked down below in the
description section along with anything
I recommend in this episode so here are
your five chosen contestants we have
Ollie three rich or fredwich Xavier Roca
and laser hawk congratulations for
making it to setup wars episode 37 so
starting up the show is all he's set up
with what tough is that so it appears we
have an emperor 1510 workstation holding
up three viewsonic 22 inch monitors we
also have a logitech MK 300 ryos
keyboard and an asus rog gaming mouse
below to the left of the keyboard we
have a few buttons which appear to
control the LEDs and the seat I'm
honestly speechless this is insane I
mean this thing has LEDs up top a cup
holder footrest and even freaking Bose
speakers on both sides I actually looked
up the price on this thing and it cost
around 5 grand let me remind you that's
only the base model you can customize
your very own workstation so I decided
to have some fun and customize my very
own which came up to a little over 13
grand talk about a dream setup Jesus
Christ
but anyways going back to reality ollie
definitely has an insane bedroom right
next to his godlike device we have the
PCs powering this entire setup an i7
3770 paired with a Radeon 7090 I
seriously want to give this setup a seal
of approval but the cables man so close
so close
if the cable added rent was a little
better I would have easily given the
seal I mean I haven't seen anything
quite like this and it's not easy to
replicate I mean who has 5 grand laying
around for a setup nonetheless this is
definitely one of the coolest setups
I've seen in my life and I thank you
very much ollie for entering setup wars
so apparently this next name is called
Fredrik and I butcher the crap out of it
up you guys know me like I'm bad at
pronouncing names so just just make fun
of me and move on
Fredrik is next up with a pretty sweet
room setup we have a set of ikea linman
desks the left one which is focused
mainly for school
Brook it seems like with some book
stands and a desk ad pretty simple and
straightforward moving on to the right
side is the actual PC setup we have two
LG 25 inch monitors and a logitech
wireless keyboard and mouse combo also
let us give a pair of bose companion 20
speakers and an Xbox one right in
between the displays excellent work with
cable management the Signum rack really
does a great job hiding the cables and
the LED strip stops off the set up
nothing I would really recommend it
seems like you got everything under
control
Thank You Frederick for entering setup
boards and I'm sorry for butchering your
name ID number three we have Xavier with
a single 27-inch iMac 5k display we also
have an apple wireless keyboard and
trackpad along with a Logitech
performance mouse I also like the
headphone dangers you have attached on
the wall even though they aren't aligned
perfectly really digging that wall shelf
as well that you have all the freaking
way up there with some LEDs shining on
the products and lastly this cool little
modification on the back of the iMac it
seems like Xavier installed a fan on the
wall to help keep the iMac nice and cool
plus one on that modification very
clever cables aren't visible so I can't
talk smack but what I can recommend are
some things to clean up your desk a bit
iMac owners are blessed by the many
accessories that companies keep making
for them for instance I see that they're
a bunch of miscellaneous things on your
desk that will look a lot better hidden
so there's a few options you can go with
Xavier but I would recommend any of
these to clean up your desk a bit first
up we have a monitor riser that has room
for your wireless keyboard that also
comes with four USB ports for charging
and syncing your devices you solve the
popular high rise to lift up your iMac a
bit which also comes with a hidden
storage that you can use to keep some of
your stuff in and lastly a simple
storage shelf that you can add to the
front or back of the iMac either way
I'll leave a link to all three down
below so you can check it out oh yeah
for the most part that's a very clean
productivity setup Thank You Xavier for
entering next up we have laser hawk with
a single 34 inch LG ultrawide monitor
mounted against the wall right next to
the headphone hanger that's also holding
up the SteelSeries Siberia v3 gaming
headset on the desk you have a gigantic
ass mouse pad and underneath that we
have the Logitech k810 keyboard and a
corsair m65 RGB mouse also no desk you
have the Xbox one play and charge kit
roller and the Samsung Galaxy Tab s
right below that really great work with
cable management everything is hooked up
against the roof of the desk and zip
tied to one of the legs so the PC that's
powering this set up is a very sexy
black and red build running on a 4770k
paired with two EVGA GTX 780 T is
classified editions along with 32
gigabytes of engines program the Caleb
management game is also strong on both
the PC and the actual setup so plus one
they're the only two things I really
messed with my OCD are the extremely
large mouse pad and the pair of
earphones just lying around you can
actually use cable drops and hook them
up to the right side of your desk that
way it's not only closer to you but will
remain hidden from sight at least that's
what I would do but then again who
really cares what I have to say
nonetheless really cool setup thank you
for entering last setup of the day
belongs to Roca with a very clean black
and white theme you have a 27-inch benq
monitor on the left and a 27-inch Dell
monitor on the right with a corsair k70
RGB keyboard and m65 RGB mouse on top of
the cursor extended mouse pad the desk
of course is none other than the IKEA
lindeman desk and to the right side of
that is the alux drawer which is holding
up his hackintosh build cable management
can definitely be improved with some
velcro straps and wraps but other than
that and the really cool acoustic bombs
against the wall this is a very clean
black-and-white setup thank you woke up
for entering I still have the cable
management video coming up you guys I
haven't forgotten about that it's gonna
be happening sometime in February so
stick around for that so that's it for
