up words episode 166 I might as well
call this the Ultimate Edition because
we have some pretty sick setups in this
episode so yeah if you guys want to
participate make sure to watch the video
link down below but with that said let
the set up or is begin make your devices
stand out by skinning them skin it
offers a wide variety of awesome skins
to protect and cover up your boring tech
I'm actually using the Deadpool skin for
my ps4 pro and it looks really dope it's
super easy to apply and the quality of
the skins are great skin and also offers
various case types for iPhones Samsung
phones and more but the coolest thing in
my opinion is that you can create your
own custom design by uploading a photo
it could be for skins cases and even
Apple watch bands so check them out by
clicking on the link below and just my
subscribers you guys get 25% off your
order kicking off the episode is Andre
from Montreal and his productivity set
up for software development we have an
ultra wide monitor from Dell let's mount
it on the IKEA Sol gen countertop with
two Alex drawers as support the
countertop actually looks pretty dope
with that texture it's the first time
I'm seeing this on the show Andre did
keep the surface fairly minimalistic
he's using the Dravo caliber wireless
keyboard with the MX master 2's Mouse
this setup is actually being powered by
his 2017 MacBook Pro which is held up by
the reign design stand
although the USBC hub sticking out of
the side kind of looks out of place and
it's kind of dumb that they made a cable
so short like that some of the
miscellaneous things he has on his desk
are has planned his lamp and a pair of
Logitech MX sound speakers even the
cables are managed neatly the wires are
routed behind the monitor mount and into
the Signum rack underneath his desk a
very simple yet productive setup Thank
You Andre for entering next up is
Benjamin from Las Vegas and his insane
gaming room we got lots of shelves
filled with where collectibles and tons
of Lego action figures and on the other
side we got a beautiful multipurpose
triple monitor setup
uses this for gaming photo editing and
watching content so we got three Samsung
4k monitors mounted against the wall
with the cables being routed through the
wall and you guys might be wondering
where the hell is the pc i'll show you
guys soon but trying to figure out until
then
so the desk is really nice he's using
the ikea barca boda countertop which i
think looks really cool with that arrow
style texture
he's also installed a few capital eggs
to add some space between the tabletop
and the Alex yours and looks like he
used that space to store a few things
then also kept the surface of his desk
fairly clean and symmetrical we got the
Logitech 5.0 speakers which are spread
out perfectly and his Man O'War headset
which offsets that giant Jim Raynor from
Starcraft collectible on the other side
in the center we got the razor Huntsman
elite keyboard the orb-weaver chroma key
pad and the Mamba mouse on top of the
Firefly mousepad beautiful work routing
all those cables through the desk and
behind the Alex door and finally in case
you guys haven't guessed already the PC
powering it all is actually mounted on
the wall right beside his setup it's a
custom water-cooled build rocking the
Rison 7 1700 X we got 32 gigs of ram and
the Ora's GTX 10 atti
extreme it looks like he was going for a
black and green build but the lighting
from the fans kind of throw off the
color consistency a little bit not only
does this setup have lots of personality
but it also has purpose I really like
the symmetry and the cable management
with the wall mounted PC I think this
setup looks really clean lots of thought
and time went into all this and for all
those reasons I don't see why he doesn't
deserve a seal of approval so congrats
Benjamin on winning the 16th seal of
approval and it's been a while since
I've award of one of those I think the
last person that got one was last year
or something but anyways the seal of
approval is a custom made plaque given
to someone with a setup that meets all
my criteria so Ben if you're watching
this video and you want to claim your
beautiful custom-made plaque toss me an
email at setup for is at gmail.com
congratulations well deserved
number three we have a very unique setup
by Janice from Germany who was only 17
years old so check this out this is a
custom made desk that he 3d modeled and
built himself
inside it we have a custom water-cooled
PC with a belated 7700 K that's
overclock 2 to 5 gigahertz
we got a GTX 1080 founders Edition and a
16 terabyte mass system from Western
Digital now the cool part isn't even the
desk itself but how he modded some parts
of the desk there's a huge mod list so
I'll just go over some of the cool ones
that I found for starters he installed a
fan controller in the middle of the desk
which he can use to control the speed of
the fans including his power supply fan
he also installed a bunch of stuff on
the slope of the desk including a
docking station a GoPro charger we got a
fingerprint sensor as well and near the
bottom he installed a built-in USB hub
and some buttons on the other side which
I'm assuming is for powering on the
system or resetting it he even
custom-made 2 separate displays that he
mounted on the wall so the left side is
actually display of his previous rad
gaming mice which I think it's 5 7 &amp;amp; 8
and then on the other side is the
leftover parts of his GPU after water
cooling it you know it's the little
things like these that set this apart
from the rest of the moderate PC desks I
have seen on the show this whole setup
is built for gaming and video editing
which I feel is a bit overkill for just
a single monitor I would have thrown in
at least one more in there maybe even go
ultra right at this point the keyboard
and mouse are both from MSI and it looks
like the wires are routed through the
desk and hidden behind it very clean
cable work I gotta say though if you're
not trolling me and you really are 17
years old and you designed and built
this whole setup just by yourself then
my friend you are going places just keep
it up follow your passion and most
importantly stay motivated and you will
be successful I mean when I was 17 years
old I was fapping daily and playing
Warcraft 3 I mean this guy has a bright
future ahead of him
Thank You Janice for entering my man
John coming in hard at number 4 with his
ridiculous boner-inducing gaming room
I'm sure we have all seen a set up
everywhere online so it was a matter of
time before he finally got featured on
setup Wars so thank you John for
submitting your photos I don't even know
where to begin but we can all agree that
the nettle leaf panels are the first
thing we noticed this setup has 62 nano
leaf panels and 18 canvas panels off to
the left side Jesus I personally think
this room doesn't even
need an actual light source like he can
light up the entire room with just the
paddles and three of his life ex trips
behind the desk okay so he's got three
27-inch monitor is mounted against the
wall and we have a 55 inch TV up top as
an overhead below that we got the
corsair k70 mk2 special edition keyboard
which is actually the one I'm using for
my own setup and we got this scimitar
Pro gaming mouse with Nicola is this
extended mouse pad it's tricky when you
have a large RGB mouse pad because
you're not able to route the cable
together with the keyboard wire so
instead you have two different cables
going across the desk which it doesn't
look as clean I feel like another
solution to this other than Jillian two
holes in the desk is by tucking the
mouse pad cable underneath the mouse pad
and routing it towards the keyboard and
then routing them across the desk using
velcro or zip tie for example to keep
them grouped up the cable is pretty thin
so it won't be that noticeable
underneath a black mouse pad the rest of
the cables are routed neatly underneath
the desk using raceways no complaints
here it does have a headset that's the
courser wireless Lloyd Pro which is
resting on the Corsair St 100 stem and
you can kind of see as ps4 pro tucked
away behind the monitors the PC powering
it all has a 77 2k that's overclocked to
4.8 gigahertz
we got 32 gigs of RAM and the Star Wars
Jedi Order Titan XP I gotta say I love
that he sleeved the AIO in two different
colors that's actually pretty clever I
also noticed that there wasn't a
consistent color scheme going on which
actually works well with this setup
because John is able to change it up
whenever he gets too bored he can change
up the wallpapers and the color scheme
to match it whenever he wants you know
the setup might seem a bit too cramped
for some people because he does have a
lot of collectibles and they are pretty
big too so it does take up a lot of
space I mean he's got two full shelves
of them and more on the bottom left side
the setups purpose is primarily for
gaming but he does watch movies and
sometimes stream as well but regardless
I think we can all agree that it's a
badass gaming room with lots of
personality and customization excellent
work and thank you John for entering
wrapping up the episode as Wesley and
his super clean stormtrooper themed
setup now I know it's not a big deal for
a lot of people but the desk not being
centered with the monitors and the TV is
kind of driving me insane
to be honest my guess is that he mounted
both monitors and the TV first since its
kind of centered with the wall and then
he realized that the desk couldn't be
centered because there wouldn't be
enough space for the drawer to hold his
PC and that's another thing he put the
PC on the left side which kind of
defeats the purpose of having a side
panel and I was not able to look inside
his PC I would probably remove that
caution sticker off of it as well when
you get a chance to but I mean other way
you can't really see it from this angle
so he's got to 24 inch curved monitors
stacked under a 4k TV from LG and under
that we got pretty much everything else
we got the Corsair k70 RGB rapid-fire
keyboard and the m65 Pro Mouse it looks
like he doesn't use any headphones just
the episode 2.1 active sound bar system
so that kia make a desk comes with a
dedicated rack for cable management and
two drawers for storage which makes it a
great desk for setups but I feel like
it's not being utilized well here a few
minor tweaks like repositioning a few
things would improve this setup greatly
this is why I strongly recommend
measuring things before buying furniture
and just planning your setup before you
start putting things together to make
sure it comes out the way you want it
but anyways that's it for this episode
as always make sure you guys drop your
comments below and felt on who has the
best setup in this episode it's gonna be
a tough decision all that's the winner
is on my Instagram page if you guys want
to follow me there drop a like if you
guys enjoyed the show as always I love
your faces and I will see you in the
next one which is probably Friday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
