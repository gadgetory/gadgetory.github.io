Texas and in this video we are going to
be doing a detailed speed comparison
between the 2015 model XP r and the 1+2
but those of you who are new to my speed
test videos that basically compare the
speeds from both of the phones when it
comes to booting up opening up apps
browsing the web and multitasking also
do a few benchmarks as well all in the
effort to determine which one of these
two phones is the fastest if they load
up the app or content within a second
from each other I will rule that as a
tie and no device will get a point so
with that said let's begin so before I
jump into the speed test let's compare
some of the hardware differences between
these phones the Moto X is rocking a
quad-core Snapdragon 808 processor as
well as 3 gigabytes of RAM and 1 plus 2
has a quad-core snapdragon 810 processor
with 4gb bytes of ram the 1+2 does
however have a 1080p screen compared to
the 1440p screen on the Moto X so might
produce better benchmark scores being it
has less pixels to push both of the
phones are running their most up-to-date
software and old apps have been cleared
from the background we made sure that
both of them are also connected to Wi-Fi
and that the brightness is set to max on
both of the phones so what all that
being said let's start the speed test
with a fresh reboot I hope you guys
enjoy the show
you
alright so as you guys saw from the
video these two phones have very similar
performance the 1+2 did take a lead
however and the benchmarks but when it
comes down to real-world usage don't
expect much difference between these
devices as always if you guys enjoy the
video then feel free to hit that like
button and if there's a specific
comparison you want to see next then
drop and comment down below letting me
know which two phones you want me to use
thanks again for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
