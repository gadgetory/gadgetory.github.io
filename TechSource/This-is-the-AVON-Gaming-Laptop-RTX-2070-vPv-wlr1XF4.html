and in this video we'll be taking a look
at the Avon which is digital storms new
lineup of r-tx gaming laptops this model
here has a ninth Gen six core processor
32 gigs of ram and the r-tx
2017 on max-q so you're getting a
desktop grade 2070 in here and Before we
jump into the rest of the review I do
want to give you huge things to Noor VPN
for sponsoring this video guys it's 2019
it's time to take your internet more
seriously with a virtual private network
your data gets encrypted your location
stays private which means you get to
surf the web anonymously
this means all of your information is
protected while you are online funny
enough story I've actually had my credit
card information stolen while I was in
Vegas using hotel Wi-Fi and it took
about $2,000 from my credit card with
unauthorized transactions so now every
time I travel I don't go online without
using a VPN just simply turn it on and
tunnel into any of the 61 plus countries
available on their superfast servers
it's available for iOS and Android as
well so you can secure your mobile
browsing experience and now you guys can
get 75% off a three-year plan by using
the code listed on the screen so make
sure you guys visit
Nour VPN comm slash tech source and get
protected today okay so the laptop is
built really well the frame is made out
of metal polycarbonate hybrid material
with a brushed surface and we also got a
digital storm logo that's illuminated
it's a pretty good-looking laptop very
minimal flex on a display and the
keyboard deck which is great now even
though this has a 17 inch screen the
overall footprint is similar to a
15-inch laptop and this was made
possible mostly from the super thin
bezels and the keyboard spacing speaking
of the keyboard he do get a full sized
keyboard with a 10 key and they are not
only RGB lit but they are mechanical as
well they are using a proprietary design
from a manufacturer however they are
very similar to Cherry MX browns
here's a quick typing sample
now even though the keys are crammed
together I didn't experience any issues
typing all the keys were easily within
reach and personally I prefer this type
of key layout if it means they're gonna
squeeze in a 10 key one thing that can
get really annoying really quickly is
cleaning the keyboard there's barely any
space between the keys so getting in
between them to clean the dust and dirt
might be a challenge and the lighting
for the keyboard and the light bar on
the side can be controlled via their
gaming center and you can also control
fan settings and monitor system as well
which we'll get into later I gotta say I
don't like the placement of the trackpad
because sometimes my left hand will
activate the mouse while I'm typing and
it kind of gets annoying luckily there's
a button on the keyboard that lets me
the say below even though it's very
inconvenient and I shouldn't have to in
the first place but other than that the
trackpad works as it should it is using
Windows precision drivers and it
recognizes all of my gestures without
any issues the 17 inch display is really
nice it has an IPS panel with really
great viewing angles and it gets really
bright at 400 nits with no backlight
bleed whatsoever it's not the best for
color sensitive work but for gaming it's
amazing you get 144 is panel with a
three millisecond response time the art
x27 he just makes more sense with a
higher refresh rate display the games
look so much better and are more
enjoyable to play on compared to a
display with only 60 Hertz speaking of
gameplay with the Avon you can game
comfortably over a hundred FPS on less
intensive titles like overwatch csgo and
even apex Legends
however for more demanding titles like
battlefield 5 and black ops 4 you will
be getting in the high 60s and 70s on
high settings it's still kind of
disappointing to see that even with an
RT X 2070 you're not gonna be taking
advantage of the 144 Hertz panel on the
more demanding titles now battery life
is pretty bad which is to be expected I
was getting a little under two hours of
use on the balance power plan then again
with a ninth Gen 6 core processor and an
RT X 2070 you really shouldn't leave
your charger at home also guys is it me
or is it really pointless measuring
battery life on a gaming
top I don't know a single soul on this
planet who games on there gaming laptop
without having their charger plugged in
I just kind of find a pointless one of
the things I love about the Avon is the
amount of connectivity so you have your
audio ports Ethernet jack and a single
USB 3 on the left side and then we got
two additional USB threes and a micro SD
card reader on the opposite side and
then in the back is where you'll find
two mini display ports an HDMI and a
single USB type-c which is done about
three compatible can I just say one
thing I love it when laptop
manufacturers put the charging port in
the back of the laptop it doesn't get in
the way of the ports and it just looks
way cleaner in my opinion now the
speakers I don't even know where to
begin with the speakers these are
probably one of the worst if not the
worst sounding speakers I've heard on
any laptop I've just gaming laptops but
just laptops period they are so quiet
that you can barely hear anything on max
volume so if you're outside or in a loud
environment
good luck hearing anything from these
especially when the fans kick on I mean
it is just I want to show you guys an
actual example because you need to hear
this so I'm gonna put out one of my
videos okay the laptop is max volume and
also the volume on the YouTube player so
check this out guys of money in kidding
compared that sound to my sound I mean
it's it is really really low you can't
even hear anything I should only
recommend using earphones headphones or
even a headset with the iPod so it's
really easy to get access to the
components inside the Avon just remove
all eight screws and pop off the back
cover there's a 62 watt our battery down
here and you can get access to both MDOT
to SSDs and RAM if you wish to upgrade
my nvme based m2 SSD is currently
getting around 1,400 megabytes per
second read and 1600 megabytes per
second write which is blazing fast one
of the things that his laptop does great
is the cooling design we got to decently
sized fans split between multiple heat
pipes and four exhaust vents we got two
on the sides and two more in the back
and because of the great cooling design
the laptop does not thermal throttle the
fans do get pretty loud but they do a
good job keeping the components cool
enough to a point where there is no
thermal throttling during heavy
workloads or gaming I also love the fact
that you can control the fan speeds
through the gaming Center so if you need
to lower the fan speed because you're in
a library or somewhere quiet and you can
do so there's even a dedicated button
above the keyboard then let you switch
between office mode and game mode so to
sum it all up the Avon gaming laptop has
really crappy speakers I mean the worst
speakers I've ever heard and poor
battery life which is to be expected but
honestly everything else it kicks ass
great thermals and gaming performance
amazing build quality
I love the mechanical keyboard and the
awesome 144th screen which gets really
bright and that does it for my review I
hope you guys enjoyed it I'll drop a
link to the Avon gaming laptop if you
guys want to check it out and also
consider leaving like if you want to see
more gaming laptop reviews like this and
leave a comment below on what laptop I
should review for my next video I don't
know why I'm doing this thank you guys
so much for watching as always guys I
love your faces and I will see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
