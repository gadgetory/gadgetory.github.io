was on Amazon shopping for something to
make my ps4 slim more portable and oddly
enough I came across the G story which
is an 11.6 inch full 1080p portable
monitor that had no reviews and of
course I had to pick it up and test it
out and see if it's actually worth the
$200 price tag and I figured hey why not
make a video on it and I feel like I
have to say this and every single in my
videos this is not sponsored I bought
this with my own money here's a
screenshot of me actually purchasing it
on Amazon but anyways with that said
let's dive into the review okay so this
thing sits on top of the system and
supports Full HD resolution guys that's
1920 by 1080 P so you can enjoy all your
games and media and high quality this
thing is going for $200 on Amazon right
now so we're gonna find out if it's
actually worth it the setup is very easy
you basically place the device on top of
the console and install the included
clamps surprisingly it clamps on pretty
well alright so then we have to plug in
the power cord as well as the supplied
HDMI cable back here will also find the
two headphone jacks the two HDMI ports
as well as the USB port for charging the
devices once it's installed it's
actually secure enough to move around
the house but I wouldn't travel around
with it installed on the construction of
the actual unit is poor I would say and
it's made of plastic and feels a bit
hollow it would probably break if
dropped so I'll definitely be careful
with it we also get a controller inside
the box with standard functionality
nothing too
crazy here it's a hefty price to pay for
a monitor that isn't as portable as it
looks now because of its external power
supply there aren't many uses unless you
have access to a power outlet for
example you can't go out camping with
this or use it in an airplane I mean not
that you would but basically you can't
use it without a power source which kind
of defeats the portability factor of it
it's portable in the sense that you can
grab the whole thing and take it to your
friend's house or your grandmother's
house plug it in the wall and start
playing it's portable in that sense
however there was an alternative way to
power this and that's by using an
external power source something like
this massive 120 thousand milliamp hour
battery bank from anchor which I did a
video on I think over a year ago not
only can you power the monitor on there
but you can also power the ps4 slim as
well if you guys recall my original
review of the power house I found that
it couldn't power the classic ps4 but
since the slim is more efficient it has
no problem supplying steady power what
everything connected we're getting about
4 hours of use from the power house and
once again I'll drop a link to the
original Power House review if you guys
are interested in checking that out so I
was kind of worried that they would
cheap out on a displace quality
fortunately they didn't the colors are
rich there's good viewing angles and
since it's a 1080p panel at 11 inches it
has a ppi of 200 and surprisingly it
gets bright enough to use outdoors out
of the box does it come out a little too
saturated for me but that was an easy
fix through their menus so we also get
audio control in here as well but
unfortunately the audio is very poor the
upwards firing speakers on the back are
very tinny especially at higher volumes
you're better off using the headphone
jacks on the back or on the ps4
controllers but definitely make sure
using some sort of headset because the
audio is pretty bad here's an actual
sample
so my final conclusion for those of you
are looking for a portable gaming
monitor for the ps4 slim this is a
pretty good deal I know $200 is a bit
steep but for that price tag this is
actually one of the best options if not
the best option out there right now
because they came across a bunch of
other ones before I pull the trigger on
this one but anyway there's a pretty
niche market out there for portable
gaming monitors for the ps4 slim
especially this is a lot of people have
the ps4 Pro but if you guys are looking
for a portable gaming monitor like I
said before this is the best option out
there for $200 thank you guys so much
for watching I'll drop a link to the G
story down below in case you guys want
to check it out but yeah maybe I'll do
one for the ps4 Pro if you guys are
interested let me know in the comments
section if you want to see that done on
the channel thank you so much again for
watching I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
