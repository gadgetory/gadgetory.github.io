what's up guys thanks and welcome to
setup wars episode 134 where you submit
your desk setup to get featured on the
show and if you guys want to participate
make sure to watch the video linked
below
with that said let the set upwards begin
kick me off the episode is Danielle and
his gaming and editing setup judging by
the vegas pro icon on his desktop he's
walking a 27-inch Samsung monitor that
is sitting on top of the popular Satechi
monitor stand and below that we got the
Logitech G 610 keyboard coupled with the
cursor scimitar Mouse is it a scimitar
or scimitar I still don't know how to
pronounce that mouse but anyways I do
like the way he managed those cables I
also like those racks that are holding
up his Mackie CR four speakers because
you can even use them as storage space
which is pretty cool on the left side we
can find his AKG K 7 xx headphones
resting on the desk lamp and right below
his monitor is the portable Samson go
mic cable management underneath the desk
looks very clean and the Signum is
holding up majority of the cables and
the rest of the wires are being held up
using cable clips nicely done the pc
powering the setup is rocking the 5820k
16 gigs of ram and an asus r9 390x not a
bad gaming and productivity setup Thank
You Daniel for starting off the show
next up we got Eric from Taiwan and this
is the setup he uses for gaming and
editing it features a 34 inch ultra
light from LG the corsair k70 luxe RGB
keyboard and the logitech g502 mouse the
setup also has a monitor riser however
it's not really holding up anything
because I think the monitor itself is
mounted against the wall so here's an
interesting layout for his mouse and
bungee most people would put the bungee
on the edge of the desk but then that
would mean that the mouse wire has to go
across the desk which doesn't really
look as clean well Eric came up with a
pretty cool solution for this so he
moved his mouse bungee above his
keyboard where he drilled a hole to
route both of his wires through that's
actually pretty smart I mean it's not
the cleanest look but I much prefer this
solution over the ladder he doesn't have
any headphones but he does have a pair
of Altec Lansing speakers as his main
audio source I do have to give Eric some
props on the cable management not only
did he do a good job organizing the
wires under the desk but he even added
channel raceways against the wall to
route the cables above the desk he even
took it a step further and skinned them
in black carbon
it's an interesting choice it's obvious
that Eric is a fan of anime and his
setup reflects that from the wallpaper
on the monitor and phone to these
stickers and even his PC which is modded
with some skins I also like that PSU
shraddh mod he did near the bottom with
those LED lights that looks pretty cool
and very clean and straightforward setup
thank you Eric for entering at number 3
we got Justin and his gaming setup
featuring a 29 inch ultra wide from LG
I love the white on black contrasts the
desk setup actually looks very modern
it's a simple IKEA desk but he actually
skinned the top with white carbon fiber
to give it that extra contrast he even
skinned his PC case to go along with the
color scheme on the desk he's got the
Logitech G 610 keyboard and the logitech
g502 Mouse along with a few other things
like the g930 gaming headset the phone
stand and a Harman Kardon speaker pretty
good work with the cable management
underneath the desk looks like
everything is hooked up behind the
backboard so no complaints here however
the wires above your setup can be
improved either drilling a hole in the
desk to route them through there or
simply tying them together with clean up
the surface a bit Justin also has a
laptop for when he needs to go mobile
and I'm assuming that he stores that on
the top drawer underneath his desk for
when he's not using it because leaving
it on the desk like that simply takes up
too much space
the main PC powering this setup is on
the opposite side on the ground and it
features the 7700 K and a su Strix 1070
it's a shame that it's on the floor
because it's actually a decent looking
PC a very balanced gaming setup with
awesome color contrast Thank You Justin
for entering nathie who is a warden from
South Africa is our fourth contestant
and this is his setup for gaming and
editing he built it on a custom-made
desk and it features three wall-mounted
Dell monitors the Mad Catz strike 7
keyboard and the rat 7 Mouse he kept a
setup very clean he kept the audio
interface right in front of him and he
mounted as KRK Rokit 6 speakers on the
walls and his headset on a stand to his
right very clean job overall speaking of
clean I have no complaints when it comes
to the cable management
he's pretty much hooked up everything
underneath the desk and he even used
cable raceways everywhere to hide the
cables excellent work
the PC on the other hand is more like a
supercomputer at least that's what it
looks like from the outside on the
inside its got the 4790k and to Asus
tricks 1070 s in sli with 32 gigs of ram
however he did add two extra radiators
one on the top and one on the bottom I
honestly thought it was a water-cooled
PC at first because why would you add
two extra radiators in an air-cooled
build like that it just makes no sense
so on the other side of his room he
actually has a wall-mounted Xbox one
setup that's hooked up to a TV what can
I say a pretty badass gaming setup Thank
You Nathalie for entering wrapping up
the episode we got Ryan making a return
from episode 124 if you guys remember he
shared a room with his girlfriend which
had a set up right beside his but since
then she actually moved her setup into
another room giving Ryan some extra
space to redo his setup looks like he
got a new desk as well and he mentioned
in the notes that he got inspiration
from my Wolverine setup that I created
on that channel there's definitely a lot
going on here but I feel like Ryan did
an excellent job organizing things while
keeping stuff symmetrical and balanced
at the same time the monitor he is using
is still the same 28 inch 4k display
from Samsung however this time he
mounted it against the wall right above
that he still got the 48 inch vizio tv
with chromecast built in and he's even
hooked up his Wii U and ps4 slim to the
TV for console gaming for when he is not
streaming videos the keyboard mouse and
mouse pad are all from courser and I
like that he drilled a hole underneath
the desk for the wire management so this
is a music production setup as well
which is why he has two KRK Rokit
powered 5 speakers he also has the ath
m50x headphones and the m XL 770
microphone I really like the neutral
white on black color scheme and I feel
like it looks so much better than before
because there was way too much black on
his previous setup and that wasn't
really a fan of that I definitely liked
seeing brighter colors in a setup to
give it that extra pop the PC powering
the setup is still using the same parts
we got these 6600 K and the EVGA gtx
1070 that's sitting inside the fantex
through pro case I like that you added a
kylo Ren figurine on the desk and the
Xbox one elite controller to balance it
on the other side definitely some major
improvements from last time thank you
again Ryan for entering that pretty much
wraps up this episode and as always make
sure you guys leave your comments below
and vote on who you think has the best
desk setup and I'll ask the winners on
my social media platforms on the weekend
if you guys enjoy the show dropping a
like would be awesome if you guys don't
please I encourage you to leave a
dislike thank you so much for watching I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
