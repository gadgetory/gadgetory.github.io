series you guys have been asking me to
do a cool tech on the right dollar and
after many months of procrastinating I
finally gave in let's just get this over
with starting off the list is this
retractable smartphone bracket that can
hold up any device up to three inches in
width it's big enough to even hold the
Galaxy Note series
it features rubber mounts on the top and
bottom which will prevent the phone from
being scratched and honestly for only 72
cents this is a really great way to
shoot videos if you are in a very small
budget just hook it up to a tripod of
your choice and you are good to go by
the way these skins shown in the video
are from the brand and they actually
released iPad air 2 skins as well you
have the most precise fit in the world
and offer a bunch of other high quality
skin materials so if you guys want to
pimp out your smartphone iPad or even
consoles make sure to check them out by
clicking on the link below next up on
this list is the silicone case for the
iPhone 6s plus or on our dollar you get
a protective case that will do its job
just like most other simple clear
silicone based cases the cutouts are
precise for the most part except for the
speakers but the buttons are really easy
to press and honestly for the price I'm
not complaining at all next up is a
portable speaker that you can connect
via 3.5 millimeter jack and that's
basically it here's a quick demo of how
it sounds at 50% and 100%
who knew you can buy a pair of earphones
for just under $8 these look a lot like
the B's earphones and have a really snug
fit but the sound quality isn't really
the best there is also be more trouble
and no bass at all the sound is also
really muffled which you can especially
tell when listening to vocals but I
would pay $1 for these earphones any day
of the week some of the things I found
is a lightning cable which is set to be
certified and a lightning adapter which
you can connect to a micro USB cable and
convert it into a lightning cable this
next item is a power bank at least I
thought it was until I received an empty
shell apparently you need to put in a
battery of some sort in order to power
this thing on and then you can hook it
up to your devices and charge it kind of
pointless if you ask me last but not
least we have a travel Mouse which is
great for travel super tiny and
lightweight makes this an excellent
addition for anyone who hates using the
trackpad on laptops or in some cases
tablets the mouse is really responsive
and I experienced no lag from the time I
spent with it I'm actually surprised
that this thing is going for only $1
2015 is over and 2016 is already here

resolution and what a better time that
