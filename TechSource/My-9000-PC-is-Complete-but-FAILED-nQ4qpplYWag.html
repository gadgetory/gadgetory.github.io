an app that provides you with a huge
library of books audio books magazines
and other reading materials I get asked
so many times in the comment section
about troubleshooting their pcs because
it stopped working for some reason and
because of that I recommend my viewers
to check out upgrading and fixing
computers for dummies it's easy to
understand and very informative when it
comes to upgrading your rig or
diagnosing it script has a ton of books
and audio books like these with over 100
million active users so you're gonna
find something you enjoy and the best
part about all of this is that it cost a
lot less than audible so make sure you
guys check out the book I recommend it
by clicking on the link below I know
it's gonna help a lot of you guys out
there and it's also going to help
support the channel
ladies and gentlemen I'm sad to say that
this is the finale of big red I may
think it's a few days to finish the bill
but for you guys it's only gonna be one
episode because I know you guys are
tired of seeing episode after episode
you just want to see the finale so that
is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna condense
everything into one final episode for
you guys and I'm gonna be doing
benchmarks because apparently a lot of
you guys want to see that as well and
I've been reading the comments section
on the past few videos and that's what
you guys want I also asked you guys to
vote on the RGB or non RGB SLI bridge
and 90% of you voted for the RGB and
actually today I got in the new SLI
bridge so this is the brand new one
that's actually cut to the perfect size
and this is the RGB one it's interesting
that there's a lot of space near the
bottom I'm guessing they did that
because all the circuit board is here
for the RGB lighting so it's not quite
as centered as the non RGB but I guess
I'm gonna have to go with this one oh
and also look what else came in guys so
fan grills for the fans these are custom
made by hasan himself for the text
source build so I think these looks sick
and I think I'm only gonna use five of
them so the three fans and the bottom
and then the one rear fan
so actually four fans not five another
thing that came in today was the smaller
reservoir from ek huge thanks to ek by
the way they're so quick and clutch when
it comes to ordering new parts attila if
you're watching thank you so much for
the fast responses on the email they
sent this over and literally got it
within the next three business days I
replace the top cap with the white one
obviously to go with the build but the
bottom one still remains black and it
looks kind of stupid to be honest so I
did order some white skins that are
coming in and I'm gonna have to skin the
bottom portion here so it matches the
top cap so that's what's happening but
yeah we're gonna basically install this
we're gonna plan the loop do the band's
fill in the coolants and then pretty
much wrap up the video so I got my PT G
tubes over here on standby I'm pretty
sure I'm gonna go through a lot of them
because there's gonna be a lot I repeat
a lot of mistakes because the
is so small it's gonna be very difficult
to get those precise benjin speaking of
mistakes a lot of you guys have been
saying ed why don't you just switch the
case and go in a bigger case yeah I can
do that that's an easier fix actually
that's the easy way out I can get the
r8e version of this case which is a
bigger version that thinks the full ATX
case instead of the micro ATX but
that'll be taking the easy way out and I
don't want to do that I want to
challenge guys building pcs for so long
here on the channel it's not a challenge
to me anymore it's not fun so building
something like this in a tiny case it
finally gives me the challenge I'm
looking for and it's very exciting to me
so yeah I'm not gonna take the easy way
out and besides I've come so far why
would I just switch cases it makes no
sense but I appreciate you guys looking
at for me all right so in order to mount
this to the bracket we're gonna have to
drill some holes on the red mounting
bracket I do have the mounting pieces
here which are white perfect for me I'm
gonna basically put one down here and
then put one on the top
is just broke
it's fine though I can I can fix this
that's it can't fix that that's not an
issue but anyway so I was trying to say
is actually I just realized all I really
need is one clamp since the reservoir is
really small they sent them to
originally because it came with this one
this reservoir is a little longer so I
swapped it with a smaller one so I think
one should do the trick don't want to
overkill here yeah this goes on the
reservoir and then it basically mounts
against the bracket right in the back
here so I'm gonna mark some holes over
here where the screw is gonna go drill
some holes and then mount this baby so
let's get that drill out of here
all right so where's the born pump
successfully mounted it's a little too
close to the power supplied to know what
I've liked but it's fine I already
figured out a different way of modding
the PSU cover which is gonna work out in
the end so I'm fine let's go ahead and
plan the loop I think I'm gonna do
actually it's a very simple one
we'll do a GPU block two CPU out from
the CPU to the top radiator from the top
radiator to the pump from the pump down
to the bottom radiator and from the
bottom redditor back up into the GPU
that seems like the obvious choice right
now for this build so yeah I think the
next step is the bends ladies and
gentlemen it is time for the hardest
part of the build let me get the heat
gun out these are the tools I'm going to
be using of course you got my heat gun
got the inner silicone and needed to do
the bends got the tube cutter and
whatever this is to smooth the insides
of the tubing and I just realized I
forgot to put this inside the reservoir
let's see if I can do it actually it
look like you know what screw it it's
not important right now I'll do this at
the end yeah mr. spark
ladies and gentlemen alas the build is
finally complete it took me two days for
the entire bands it was definitely a
long process a very tedious process as
you guys can see in front of me this is
the ptg graveyard I went through a bunch
of tubes this one over here the silicone
snapped while I was pulling it out so to
start a band II when this was actually a
perfect band for me but yeah this is
officially guys my second hard line
build so obviously I'm still learning
I'm not have not mastered this I'm
nowhere near close to mastering it it's
definitely difficult getting the bends
at the perfect angle and at the perfect
spot but anyways so far I'm really happy
with the way it turned out it's looking
amazing before I put in the fan grilles
and SLI bridge and do the cable
management guys I want to do a complete
flush of the system we're gonna be using
the mayhem blitz a cleaning system I'm
gonna leave the system running for about
12 hours so that way all the radiators
and all the loops are nice and clean
before I pour in the fresh coolant once
I pour in the coolant I'm gonna stop
talking and show you guys some cinematic
b-roll and of course at the very end
benchmarks just like you guys request it
in the comment section there was one
thing I did want to mention about the PC
will quick and that is the PSU cover
that I was originally planning on
modding for of course the power supply
unfortunately I won't be able to do that
because my original plan was to cut a
Kulik piece and run it down this entire
side of the case but you guys can see
here there's a tube running through so
that is gonna interfere with the cover
so the alternative is to essentially mod
the power supply itself I'm just gonna
leave this side alone because it's gonna
be great for airflow and I think it's
gonna look really nice in the build
overall so I'm gonna cut an acrylic
piece and just cover up this side of the
power supply and I'm going to take off
the fan grills and paint that red or
white I haven't decided yet
I think i'ma doing red actually so yeah
that's gonna be after the flush oh
there's also one more thing that I did
in the back here which is gonna make
draining the fluid a lot easier as I
attached a valve over here and basically
when I'm ready to flush the system we'll
have to do is hook up the softube right
over here
like that and then and after tightening
it I'll have to do is turn the lever and
have the coolant flush straight out of
the back all right some I think they
sell them and flush it and I'll see you
guys very soon
so this part of the video is usually
when I talk about the benchmarks and go
over temps overclocking and all that but
as you guys can see it's off so yeah
there's no easy way of saying this I'm
just gonna jump straight into it my
computer is dead
it's 100% dead now I don't know how many
components got damaged in the process
but I know so far the power supply is
dead and so is the motherboard after
hooking up everything I hit the power
button
nothing happened there's not even any
LEDs that are lighting up on the
motherboard usually the debug code area
is usually lit on motherboards but for
this one nothing not a single light
source coming from the motherboard so
I'm like okay maybe something's going on
with the power supply so I bought in an
extra power supply from EBG I hooked
that up
still nothing so I'm like wait a minute
maybe the motherboard got damaged
somehow it's funny because all these
components were working before I tested
everything in episode 1 and episode 2 I
told you guys that all the components
was working fine only one of the cables
was the issue why I wasn't working and I
swapped that and everything was fine so
then I went back and I'm like ok let me
test the power supply by itself and see
if it's working or not so I bought over
my power supply tester unit so I hooked
this up to the power supply and I shoot
you guys not when I turned it on I heard
this loud popping noise like something
blew up I don't know what it was
I freaked the hell out I should I
switched off the power supply I'm like
what the hell was that noise so yeah I
needless to say the power supply is
officially defective because they won't
even turn out and even with the power
supply tester I don't know what the hell
happened during this entire process I
didn't do anything special to it I just
took off the cover and I painted the
cover I didn't touch anything inside the
power supply so yeah that's gone my only
fear is I hope it didn't fry the
components inside I hope it didn't fire
the processor $2,000 processor let me
remind you guys which is deleted and I
hope the GPUs didn't get damaged and
also the RAM sticks so the hardest part
about all this the most disappointing
part of
this is that after swap I have to take
everything out again to swap out and put
in the new motherboard I ordered a new
motherboard it's coming in I am at a
loss of words guys I don't know what to
say to be honest I was expecting this to
work nothing ever goes according to plan
with my builds apparently so when once
the new power supply and motherboard
come in I'm gonna have to completely
redo everything honestly I feel really
bad for you guys cuz I know you've been
waiting so long to see the actual
benchmark service and see what it can do
and actually turn on and light up I
can't even give you guys that so for
that I apologize I don't know if I'm
gonna be making a follow-up video I
think I'm just gonna do this offline and
figure out what's going on unless you
guys want to see that that's up to you
let me know in the comments section yeah
I don't I don't know I don't know what
else to say I love the way you turned
out I mean it's such a beautiful PC to
be honest it's just a shame it's really
a shame I think though I think the worst
thing that could happen beyond the power
supply and motherboard dying is if the
CPU is fried and the graphics cards are
fried if those are fried I think I'm
done I think I'm done with this and I'm
moving on to the next one alright
anyways I'm sorry guys I know you're
expecting something different one like
equals one prayer one this like means I
should move on start on other other
projects anyways all of you guys thank
you so much for sticking around this
entire process well it's been what five
episodes for this entire series I'm
gonna I'm done I'm done thank you guys
for watching I'll see you in the next
