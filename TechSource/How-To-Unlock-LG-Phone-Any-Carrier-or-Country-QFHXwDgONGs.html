today I'm going to show you how to
unlock your LG smartphone so you can use
it on any carrier or country you like
for this demonstration I'm going to use
my LG g3 but this video will work on any
LG smartphone that you have so first off
we need to get the unlock code for the
phone before we proceed with the
unlocking procedure I personally use the
locking company for all my devices
simply because they are the lowest
prices in the market with the fastest
delivery speeds so head on over to the
unlocking company.com once you're there
you're gonna be selecting your phone
manufacturer and the phone model from
the drop down list once you do that
select get unlocking code and that will
take you to the next step which is to
select what country you purchase the
phone from as well as the carrier of the
phone in my case I purchased it from the
United States and a carrier is t-mobile
you will need the phone's IMEI number to
continue and I'm gonna show you how to
look it up on your phone once you open
up your dial pad and enter in star pound
zero six pound the number will
immediately show up and you will need to
enter that on the website to continue
make sure you select the correct
currency for your country before moving
on once you checkout with PayPal they
will email you the code the price and
time vary depending on the phone but
they do guarantee that you are getting
the fastest delivery times with the
lowest price available once you receive
your code via email it's time to unlock
your phone so before we continue make
sure that the phone is powered off go
ahead and remove the backplate of the
phone and the battery as well so you can
gain access to the SIM tray this is
where you insert the SIM card that you
wish to use with the phone if your SIM
card is a different size then you have
to adjust it in order for it to fit I
provided you with a link in the
description section to show you how
that's done after you insert the SIM
card in the tray go ahead and put back
the battery and the back case and power
on your phone now once it powers up and
you leave the lock screen a prompt will
appear asking you to enter an unlock
code in that case you enter in the code
that you got via email and you are done
however if you don't get a prompt like
me then you are going to have to unlock
it manually you are going to have to
open up your dial pad once more and
enter in two
nine four five pound star and your model
number and it will take you to a secret
menu once you are here you have to
select Network unlock and it is here
that you have to enter in the lock code
that you received in the email to find
your model number you have to go into
settings about phone hardware
information and that is where you will
find the model number so the code you
would input would be two nine four five
pound star and then your three digit
model number in my case it was 851 so
once you enter in your unlock code your
phone will accept it and it will be
unlocked immediately as you can see here
it is a t-mobile phone that is now
working on a TNT so that is how you
unlock your LG g3 smartphone if this
video helped you guys out feel free to
leave a like and if you have any
questions at all or any concerns then
leave a comment down below and I will
respond as soon as possible this is that
from tech source and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
