and welcome to setup wars episode 48
will you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel if you want to
submit your desk set up make sure watch
the video linked below which by the way
will go live in about two weeks
so the submissions will be open once
again
but all that said I'm done let the setup
boards begin never pay full price for
games ever again guys g2a offers the
cheapest cd-keys you can find anywhere
check them out by clicking on the link
below as always everyone's gear for
their setups along with anything I
recommend in this episode will be linked
below but here are your five contestants
for this week we have a key Joey
Stu Tobias and William congratulations
for making it on the show starting off
the show is our keys black and red setup
we have a 27 inch tail monitor with a
pretty badass wallpaper on top of the
monoprice monitor riser and below that
we have a few ps4 controllers neatly
tucked away for peripherals we have the
courser strafe keyboard and the me onyx
neo 7000 mouse on top of a sweet-looking
League of Legends mousepad seriously
that mousepad is on fire I want to take
this time and thank Aki for the amazing
quality pictures you know submissions
like these whether it's a laptop on a
stool will still get featured regardless
because of the quality the higher the
quality of the pics the greater the
chances of being featured so thank you
all for taking your time and sending me
these pictures so also on the desk you
have a pair of cloud tools resting on
the Thermaltake headphone hanger and the
ever-so-popular Harman Kardon sound
sticks three cable management can
definitely be improved and no amount of
wooden pieces will hide the fact that
there are cables hanging around in the
back I strongly recommend watching my
cable management video for tips and
tricks on how you can improve your
wiring job I really love how you kept
the color theme consistent throughout
this setup there's not a lot of black
and red it's not overpowering at all and
I think it's nicely balanced the glass
monitor riser and the sedum speakers
really add some spice to the over
all set up even though you have your
phone and LED remote neatly organized on
the riser I would much prefer them
either hidden away in a drawer or maybe
a dope black stand for the phone I'm
sure you won't be able to see any
notifications with the phone facing down
like that last thing I want to mention
is the desk I'm honestly digging that
carbon fiber it looks pretty sweet but
overall a really sick setup Thank You
Aki for entering Joey is next up with a
very clean wireless setup we have two 23
inch AOC frameless monitors hooked up to
the mounted arms and below that we have
the Microsoft sculpt Comfort keyboard
and the Logitech g600 mouse on top of
the pet ram extended mousepad also on
the desk gave a pair of Logitech z2 13
speakers and a blue snowball mic hiding
in the back now I've seen some weird bit
before on desks and PCs but shoes you
guys are continuing to impress me cable
management is excellent we got the
Signum doing majority of the work and we
also have some cable tubes concealing
the wires below not to mention the
mounted power strip and the quirky cord
is holding the charging cables up top I
can definitely see you spend some time
on the overall cable management job well
done
Joey Oh at a point for the remote
placement for the LED strips the PC is
powering the setup has a 4790k paired
with an EVGA GTX 960 FTW edition and
slightly spectacular h4 40 case great
job again keeping the beam consistent
even inside your PC the only thing I
don't understand is a decision going
with - Alex drawers with a linman
tabletop I mean how much do you have to
store overall a very clean and organized
set up Thank You Joey for entering
moving towards the dark side we have Stu
and the magical land of acoustic phones
you know that layout actually looks a
little familiar on the desk we have two
24 inch asus monitors and a wireless
largest a keyboard and mouse combo
sandwiching the monitors are a pair of
audio engine a 5 plus speakers with the
audio engine stands and the d1 deck
right below cable management is really
clean and not a single wire in sight and
I also like the fact that you installed
a drawer underneath that
desk unless you didn't and it came with
one already the pc does powering the
setup has a fifty nine thirty k paired
with an r9 290x and a pair of m70x is
just lying on the desk we do have a
little setup on the other side of the
room which is mainly for work and I like
how it also has its own acoustic foam
wall as well really impressive setup
overall nothing really to recommend
other than a headphone hanger for those
cans to prevent it from getting
scratched or damaging the desk but thank
you Stu for entering Tobias's next up
with a very clean minimalistic setup and
I think that this is the second star
wars-themed setup in this episode first
off I just have to say I love the desk
the white table top with the black
drawers goes so damn good together the
color contrast is on point so we have a
27-inch Dell 1440p monitor Corsair
strafe RGB keyboard and m65 RGB mouse on
top of the extended mouse pad from
glorious we also have a pair of Presonus
ePHI speakers on custom-made stands I
personally would have gone with a white
shelf instead to keep the black on white
contrast more consistent but black still
looks awesome I love the fact that you
utilize the spaces on the desk by
putting your audio interface in one side
and a laptop on the other also great
work with the cable management it looks
like the wires are being routed behind
the second drawer but what's up with the
white board to be honest I was going to
feature this in my flawless edition but
that white board was the deal-breaker
since I can't really see anything behind
it nonetheless a very gorgeous set up
Tobias thank you for entering finishing
up the episode is Williams dual display
setup with the same desk configuration
as the last we have to Ikea Alex your
units holding up the wide linen tabletop
for the monitors William is rocking two
different ones a 27-inch asus rog swift
and a 28 inch 4k monitor from asus as
well but if that doesn't mess with your
OCD that maybe the stickers on his pc or
the bottom drawer being left open will
one William wall so the monitors are
resting on the Alex add-on unit and
below that we have the corsair k70 RGB
keyboard with brown switches and a Mad
Catz rat 7 MMO Mouse on top of the
course extended mousepad we do have two
different headsets the Sennheiser game 0
for gaming and the Sennheiser HD 598
on the mov headphone hanger those area
906 speakers are huge but at least they
are in black and white to match the
color scheme
I feel like William did a fantastic job
with the contrast we have a black on
white on black on white no two colors
are next to each other except a mousepad
which is on the black surface I feel
like a white extended mousepad would
have looked way better and would have
made the gaming gear stand out a bit
more sometimes you need to make the
sacrifice of not putting your PC on your
desk to free up some space for other
things so I will give you props for
putting your PC off to the side and
still making it visible after all who
would hide such a beauty we have a 4790k
paired with two gtx 980ti is classified
edition excellent work with the cable
management and that paint job on that
EVGA sli bridge though cable management
under the desk however could be better a
cable box to hide a parish tip and maybe
a few cable clips throughout those wires
in the back of the desk or even a cable
sleeve can work if you can somehow group
up all the wires together feel free to
check out my cable management video for
more tips and tricks but overall a very
clean and dope setup indeed I have
nothing else bad to say thank you
William for entering but that will do
for this episode of setup wars as always

comments down below and vote on who you
