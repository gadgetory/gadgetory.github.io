another giveaway today we are doing the
Xbox 360 from Microsoft so let's get
started so this is the new 360 model
just released by Microsoft this is the
250 gig shown here and it starts around
three hundred dollars whereas the four
gigabyte model starts at two hundred
dollars so it's about a hundred dollars
cheaper for those of you that I want to
start up with something smaller so let's
continue with unboxing and take a look
inside the only major difference between
this and the older model is the design
they kept the same software and
controller of course just want one a new
cleaner look so the first thing I pull
out is the power supply and I don't own
an Xbox so I was shocked to see how big
this was compared to the ps3 next up is
the composite AV cable but this is
unnecessary because everyone uses an
HDMI cable for better quality here we
have a power cable which connects to the
power supply and in return power as your
Xbox 360 and all 360 versions company
headset like the original model it's
lightweight its compact but I'm sure a
lot of people use other headsets for
better sound quality and it's always
nice to have a spare so this looks like
the controller it's the same model
nothing new here I honestly don't like
the Xbox controller for one main reason
it needs batteries which is really
inconvenient I mean why couldn't they
just stick with charging it at least
they were kind enough to include two
double-a batteries to get it started all
right on to the main event here is the
360 itself so they changed a few things
on this newer model for one they made it
look a lot similar to the Xbox one which
is going to be released later this year
they exchanged the power cord from two
prongs to one making it much easier to
connect they removed one USB port from
the back and added one small button in
the front to connect new controllers
with with that being said let's take a
look at the backside of the 360 II you
have all your necessary ports you're
like HDMI to connect 10 USB ports and
it's all easily accessible so as I
mentioned before the software and
hardware are the same it's even slightly
smaller than the last generation Xbox
360 slim with no major changes in the
price being three hundred dollars
honestly I want to consider it being a
smart investment to buy one especially
since the Xbox one is right down the
road so that concludes the unboxing
