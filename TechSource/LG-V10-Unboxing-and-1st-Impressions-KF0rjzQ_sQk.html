tech source and in this video we're
gonna be unboxing and taking a look at
the LG v10 this thing seems to be
packing some serious technology inside
and looks like a worthy successor to the
LG g4 so without wasting any more time
let's get into the unboxing
when holding the LG v10 you can
immediately tell that this is a much
more well-put-together phone when
compared to the g4 the stainless steel
side rails and reinforced frame makes
this device just feel solid even though
the frame is metal the back cover
however is not it's made out of a soft
scratch resistant plastic it's
definitely not the best looking weird
for a smartphone but being able to
expand your memory and swap batteries is
something that I gladly pick over a more
premium material in typical LG designs
we of course get the volume and lock
buttons located on the back but what's
new here is that the actual lock button
also doubles as a fingerprint reader a
good one at that it's speed is about as
quick as the Galaxy Note 5 and for my
first impressions it seems mostly
reliable what's the screen is on we are
greeted with the typical LG UI basically
everything's very big and very colorful
we're not going to go in-depth here on
the software because it's essentially
running the same software that the g4
has been if you guys want more detailed
look at UI I'm sure there are tons of
videos out there instead of gonna be
taking a look at what LG did differently
with this phone the first and major
thing being the second screen this is
basically an extension to the IPS quad
HD panel and its purpose is to give you
shortcuts to apps as well as media
controls when your main screen is on the
second screen turns into an app launcher
and a place for your favorite contacts
and other key features you want to
access quickly your notifications will
also pop up there instead of on your
screen which is nice when you're
watching videos or playing games when
the screen is off quick settings for the
Wi-Fi the flashlight and more are
located all on the second screen another
change LG has made when comparing the
phone to the g4 is in the camera it's
the same 16 megapixel shooter that was
on the g4 but this time the cameras
manual mode works also for videos you
have control over the ISO the white
balance focus shutter speed frame rate
and even the audio on the v10 the phone
also has four mics so you can even
choose which direction you get the sound
from in your videos another change in
the camera department is the two five
megapixel front cameras on the V
LT says the two shooters enabled a v10
to capture wide-angle photos with fields
of view between 80 and 120 degrees
without the picture being plagued by the
fisheye effect and just when you thought
we were done LG comes around and throws
in another new feature this one being a
digital to analog converter chip inside
as well as a headphone amplifier I'm
really into the audio when I can't wait
to thoroughly try this new hardware out
but for my first impressions it sounds
really good we've only had a quick look
at the v10 so we'll need to do a lot
more testing to see how it performs in
real life however since it packs more or
less the same specs as the g4 we expect
excellent performance especially when it
has an extra 1 gigabyte of RAM so
anyways that's it for the video if you
guys enjoyed it feel free to hit that
like button to show your support and if
you guys want to see any specific

much for watching this is that from tech
