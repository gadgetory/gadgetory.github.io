decent laptop for 150 bucks well that's
exactly what you will get if you pick up
the new Chromebook from Hisense so this
is the Hisense Chromebook and it packs a
quad-core processor with 2 gigabytes of
RAM and 16 gigabytes of hard drive space
which when compared to a flagship
smartphone kind of seems disappointing
the Chromebook is mostly made out of
plastic with a woven texture finish on
its cover
however the trackpad and arm rest is
made out of aluminum is very thin and
lightweight as well weighing about 2.3
pounds I didn't notice that the laptop
is a fingerprint magnet and just by
simply touching it you can see smudges
on it on the back of the laptop is where
the speakers are located which sound
decent and there are also four rubber
pads to keep it from sliding while
typing the Hisense Chromebook has an
eleven point six inch LED display with a
resolution of 1366 by 768 although you
can increase the resolution to 1536 by
864
however the scaling makes the font
distorted and blurry which is why they
recommend you to stick with the default
also on the top is the 720p front-facing
camera and microphone which is sadly
more than the new MacBooks on the left
side you will find the charging port a
USB 2.0 and HDMI and on the other side
is the headphone / microphone port
another USB 2.0 and a micro SD card
reader
Hisense also promises up to eight and a
half hours of battery life which is
really good now because this is a
Chromebook it is heavily dependent on
internet connection Chromebooks are
basically used for browsing the internet
typing up Word documents and even light
gaming the Hisense is running the latest
software of Chrome OS and we are
beginning to see more and more apps
being able to run offline which is a
good thing watching videos in 1080p is
smooth there is no lag or stutter
whatsoever but you have to make sure you
are looking directly at the center of
the screen because the viewing angles
are pretty bad the more you turn or tilt
the display the more visual distortion
there is now if you try watching 4k
video that's where you run into problems
there just isn't enough processing power
for 4k
screaming which is why the laptop
stutters and lags a lot for basic games
that are available through the web store
the Chromebook handles are pretty well
with no lag the more graphic intensive
it is the more you start to see stutter
and lag the Hisense also features a full
keyboard - the ten key and the keys are
very responsive however it does feel
kind of spongy at times when you're
typing for 150 bucks this Chromebook is
a pretty damn good deal if all you need
is a laptop for typing up Word documents
and accessing the Internet then this is
honestly the best option for you
especially if you're on a budget I will
leave a link to this and one other
affordable Chromebook in the description
section if you guys want to check it out
but anyways that is it for the video if
you guys enjoyed it please hit that like
button if you didn't feel free to
dislike and let me know by leaving a
comment if this is something you would
drop 150 bucks on anyways this is that
from tech source I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
