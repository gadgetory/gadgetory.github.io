the review of the bose soundlink to
bluetooth speaker this is a portable
powerful bluetooth speaker from bose
that retails for 299 US dollars the
Soundlink to has a clean and elegant
design and is also equipped with the
magnetic bifold nylon cover that
protects the speakers from damage and
also automatically turns the speakers
off when it is closed the cover also
gives the speakers more stability the
bose soundlink towards a compact design
that is ergonomic and is easy to hold in
one hand it's nylon material gives a
speaker a nice feel it makes a speaker
grippy and let's likely fall in your
hands the speaker compact design allows
for easy travel as you can place it in
bags large purses and more the speaker
has a total six buttons on top of the
device starting with power button on the
left now it's very important if your
device is not support Bluetooth the
bluetooth toggle itself a mute button
and volume up and down buttons on the
back of the device there are three ports
sorry from left facing auxiliary port
which is another way to get sound to the
speakers if bluetooth is not available
on the connected device a service pro
used for the software updates to the
actual system and the last port is where
the power cord is attached to charge the
Soundlink system the battery got me
through six hours audio playback when
modern valves are used when I cranked it
up all the way I can only get three
hours from it which is pretty bad seeing
that similar devices like the big jambox
gets around 12 hours audio playback
before needs to be recharged which takes
about three hours it is very easy to
pair the speaker with the Bluetooth
enabled device power up the speaker and
talk of the bluetooth on then pull out
your device and navigate to bluetooth
settings once your day you will find the
bose system in the list available
devices then just type on it and you're
connected the speaker outputs very loud
and balanced audio has deep bass and
good mids while still giving the lowes
their proper respect and highs on this
device are amazing here's a sample audio
clip
overall I give this advice a saw seven
out of 10 because it is a little low
price and the battery isn't that great
but thank you guys for watching and be
