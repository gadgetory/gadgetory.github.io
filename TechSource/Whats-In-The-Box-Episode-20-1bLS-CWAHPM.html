urine to help you mark your territory
good luck
Luciano what's up guys it's that from
Texas and welcome to another episode of
blood in the box now I know it's been a
while since I've done one of these and I
apologize
I've been in Vegas the past week for CES
2017 so I've been really busy with that
stuff I do want to give you some updates
on the PC bills that I've planned I do
have a PC plan for January actually I'm
working on it right now and the
water-cooled build Electrolux is still
in progress the reason why it's taking
so long to get that done is because I'm
waiting for some parts to arrive the
company who made the cables sending the
wrong cable so long story short I'm
waiting for some parts so it's gonna be
another week before you guys expect a
part five I believe but with all that
said and done guys let's not waste any
more time and dive right in I receive a
few holiday packages from Christmas that
I haven't opened yet most of these are
fan mail as well so let's go and dive
right in actually I haven't opened up
this one first this was a big red box
from Elemental knives as you can see
here I could only guess what's inside
seriously let's just do it all so I hope
you guys had an awesome Christmas if you
celebrate and a fantastic new year lots
of popcorn as always looks like there's
a box in here ooh
several boxes actually three boxes of
knives wait four boxes of knives what
five what is this five boxes of knives
like I said earlier guys I got this
during Christmas time so I haven't had a
chance to open these up so this looks
like a pretty cool sign I had actually
put this on now all right feeling a bit
festive even though it's a bit late but
hey so Elemental knives hooked me up
I've never even heard of this brand but
apparently they sent me five boxes and
these are pretty big let's start off
with the small ones actually there's a
private community indentation looks like
microfiber and whoa black and gold knife
this looks pretty sick
how do you open this thing whoo very
nice also I've added a second camera you
guys can see it but I'm going to be
swapping to my other camera for a
different angle most likely a close-up
shot of the product so if you guys like
that you guys like that extra camera let
me know by leaving a like and I'll make
sure to keep that for all of these
videos in the future so that's one let's
open up the other oh this one is black
and blue looks like it's the same design
actually just a different color and a
different artwork on there so it is -
I'm guessing this is the same design as
well oh whoa I was wrong this is I don't
even know what this is what is this so
this opens up pretty interestingly so
you pop this open like that oh wow that
is sweet and I guess you can close it by
yep closer - no like that and you have
yourself a weird shaped knife I don't
even know what you call this a knife I'm
sure there's a specific name for it but
these are really sick I have to put up
the big ones I'm really curious about
the what's
sides-- oh my god I knew it
freaking combat knives Jesus Christ I'm
legit i legit have a collection out this
is official I officially I officially
have a collection this is sick and the
last one well this one's a straight-up
Army knife military knife that is sick I
love the little artwork on here that's
pretty awesome
you have sick looking knives thank you
so much ek for sending this in it I'll
drop a link to the website if you guys
want to check them out they're some
pretty sweet selection of knives all
right so now that I got that out of the
way let's continue on actually let's
finish off this side and I will move our
way on to the right this one is from
unlimited knives
oh so this one's an old gold actually
looks like a tack forest version but
it's from mtech ballistic interesting

using before but it's all in gold hello

shopping around for a new toothbrush so
I'm gonna give this one a shot let's
open this up actually
