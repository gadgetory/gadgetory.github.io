today I'm going to show you how to
unlock your samsung galaxy s4 so you can
use it on any carrier or country you
like for this demonstration I am going
to use my t-mobile s4 and unlock it so I
can use it on my AT&amp;amp;T network so first
off we need to get the unlock code for
the phone before we proceed with the
unlocking procedure I personally use the
unlocking company comm for all my
devices simply because they have the
lowest prices in the market with the
fastest delivery speeds so head on over
to the unlocking company.com and once
you're there going to be selecting your
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop-down list and once you do
that select get a locking code which
takes you to your next step which is to
select what country you purchase the
phone from as well as the carrier of the
phone and please remember that this is
the carrier that the phone is originally
purchased from you will need the phone's
IMEI number to continue and I'm going to
show you how to look it up on your phone
so open up your dial pad and enter in
star pound zero six pound and the code
will immediately show up and you will
need to enter that on the website to
continue make sure you select the
correct currency for your country before
moving on
once you select get a locking code and
purchase it securely with PayPal they
will email you the code the price and
time vary depending on the phone but
they do guarantee that you are getting
the lowest price and the fastest
delivery times once you receive your
code via email it's time to unlock your
device so before we continue make sure
that your phone is powered off next go
ahead and remove the backplate of your
phone and then remove the battery so you
can gain access to the SIM tray then go
ahead and insert your SIM card that's
from another carrier into the slot if
your SIM card is a different size then
you have to adjust it in order for it to
fit I provided you guys with a link in
the description to show you how that's
done once you insert the SIM card into
the slot put back the battery and the
back case and power on your smartphone
once it boots up go ahead and leave the
lock screen and once you do we will ask
you to enter in the lock code and this
is where you enter the code that was
sent to you via email once you input the
entire code
hit unlock your phone becomes unlocked
and you can begin using it immediately
so that's how you unlock your Samsung
Galaxy s4 if this video helped you guys
