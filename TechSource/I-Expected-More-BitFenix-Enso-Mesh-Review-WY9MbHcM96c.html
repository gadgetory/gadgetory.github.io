gaming PC is incredibly fast with
Intel's ninth gen8 core processor up to
an RT X 20 atti graphics card and 32
gigabytes of vengeance lpx ram all
packed inside a compact bead blasted
aluminum shell with excellent cooling
both CPU and GPU are cooled using a
patented assisted convection liquid
cooling system achieving higher clock
speeds lower temperatures and minimal
noise with coursers advanced IQ software
you can configure the system's fan
monitor system performance and
personalize your lighting to learn more
click the link below so this is the new
BitFenix
and so mesh it's a mid tower case that
goes for $90 and sports a tempered glass
side panel a PSU shroud and two included
120 millimeter fans the rear fan is RGB
whereas the front fan is not you know
building in this case I quickly realized
that it's far from perfect there were
some questionable design choices that
makes the $90 price tag on here seem
very steep so let's take a closer look
so the case is designed to fit up to an
ATX motherboard but I was able to
squeeze in the Ora's Z 270 X which is an
e ATX motherboard without any problems
the case has 2 USB 3 ports up top
alongside a power and reset button and a
dedicated button to control the
addressable RGB lighting with the
integrated controller in the back you're
able to daisy chain their RGB fans and
the RGB strips together so it's a lot
easier to change the colors at once
alternatively they are compatible with a
su sorrow sync so you can actually hook
up the cables directly to the 5 volt RGB
header on your motherboard if it's
available
speaking of RGB the front panel has
these accents on all four corners that
are connected with the controller as
well making it very easy to sync all the
lighting together I personally think it
looks really cool combined with the mesh
filter which lets you see through them
so if you have any RGB fans installed in
the front of a radiator like I did in
this build then you'll be able to see
them from the top you can control the
lighting you can either set a solid
color for all the connected devices or
select from a few rainbow effects
what's disappointing about this is for
some reason they didn't include a white
option if you guys are gonna be using
any CPU or GPU that runs hots for
example the new ninth gen copy Lake
processors and I do recommend going with
the mesh version for a better airflow
otherwise they do sell a non mesh
version for around the same price
cleaning the filters are really easy the
PSU filter is located on the side of the
case but you would need to remove the
side panel first to access it the front
mesh panel is magnetic but it's kind of
annoying to remove since the tab is
located too close to the bottom so
you're gonna have to tilt the PC a
little bit to grab a hold of it removing
the filter allows you to install up to
83 60 millimeter radiator more easily
since you can screw them in from the
front however you can remove the entire
front panel if you need extra space
additionally you can add fans behind the
radiator for a push and pull
configuration as long as there's enough
clearance between the rad and your GPU
the case does support a good amount of
storage you can mount one SSD on the
tray over on the right side if you're
only using a single SSD like I am but if
you're using more you can actually mount
two additional ones on the left side but
if you still need more space for us as
these then you can use the hard drive
trays so in total this case supports up
to 5 SSDs or three SSDs and two hard
drives ok old management it's not
terrible we do get 23 millimeters of
space behind the motherboard tray and
some extra space near the bottom next to
the power supply please note if you guys
are using a longer power supply then you
will have a lot less room to work with
down here unfortunately the hard drive
cage is not removable as they are bolted
directly on the PSU shroud which also
acts as a support there is one thing I
don't like about the cable management
aspect of the case and that is the
amount of grommets it has there's only
two on the motherboard tray and I would
love to see one more near the top
instead there's just this empty space on
the top right another really annoying
thing I noticed while building in here
is that there was no cutout near the top
of the motherboard tray which is
shocking I tried to route the cables for
the courser AIO and the fans only to
find out there wasn't any so I was kind
of forced to route the cables towards
the right side which does not look clean
at all but it doesn't even stop there
guys no siree
you know how almost every single
case has plenty of space on the top left
corner to route the cables for your EPC
power connector well this case doesn't
the hole is only big enough to route
thin wires so what does this mean well
this means that throughout the cables
towards the right side once again
luckily I was able to hide the cable
behind the fans also a side note make
sure that hook up all your cables in the
motherboard before installing the fans
on the top because you're not gonna have
any space to route the cables behind
them it's a pretty tight fit you know
small things like that where I'm
thinking constantly what is the design
team thinking when they approve the
final product
you know while I'm nitpicking I do want
to say that I'm not a fan of the thumb
screws on the tempered glass panels it's
kind of annoying having to remove four
screws while holding up the side panel
which is prone to fingerprints I much
prefer the hinge design like other cases
have for example the Evolve
X from fantex one thing I do like about
the glass panel though is that it's not
tinted too dark so you can easily see
through it in terms of cooling I was
getting really great temps using the
7700 K and the RS GTX 1080
while gaming the GPU stayed under 70
degrees and the CPU stayed under 60
degrees constantly which is great
considering a 7700 K runs hotter on
average between 70 to 80 degrees
sometimes even in the 90s the two fans
in the front the radiator acting as
intake sucking in cold air through the
front mesh panel helped out a lot you
know I feel like they focused more on
the RGB features of the case rather than
the actual functionality for $90 I
definitely expected more of a refined
product I mean yeah the RGB features are
really cool and I think it's a great
looking case with great airflow but I
think $90 is a bit steep for a case with
so many flawed design choices regardless
if you guys want to check it out I'll
drop a link to the case as well as the
power supply and the RGB fans that I
used inside this build if you guys
enjoyed the video consider leaving a
like if you want to see more like it and
if you didn't you know what to do
there's a specific case you guys I'm
gonna pick up and do a review and they
build inside let me know in the comments
section down below I love your nose
holes I will see you in the next video
