to show you the process of unlocking
your ZTE concord to smartphone so you
can use it with any carrier or country
for this demonstration I will be using
my lock t-mobile Concord to and unlock
it so I can use it on my 18th network
but you can use this video as a guide
for any carrier so first off we'll need
to get the unlock code to start the
unlocking process one of the best and
most trusting websites that i use to get
my lock codes is the unlocking company
com because the prices are unbeatable
and their customer service is the best
in the market so head on over to the
unlocking company com and select your
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop-down list and on the next
page go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is t-mobile before
we continue we do need the imei number
of the phone and the way you look that
up on your phone is to open up the dial
pad and enter in star pound 06 pound
once the phone displays the imei number
you have to go back on the website and
enter that in once everything is filled
out select get unlocking code and that
will take you to the final screen where
you have to check out after checking out
they will email you the unlock code the
price and delivery time of your code
varies by phone but don't worry because
the prices are always the cheapest in
the market than any other unlocking
website so before we continue make sure
that the phone is powered off next go
ahead and remove the back plate and the
battery so you can gain access to the
sim tray then go ahead and insert the
SIM card that you want to use with the
phone I want to use the Concord to on my
AT&amp;amp;T network so I'm putting in my AT&amp;amp;T
sim card if the sim card is a different
size and you have to adjust the size in
order for it to fit I've actually left
the link in the description section to
show you how that's done so after you
introduced sim card in the tray go ahead
and slide the battery back inside and
install the back cover on the phone and
power on the device once the phone boots
up go ahead and leave the lock screen
and immediately after you will get it
prompt asking you for the unlock code
this is where you put the unlock code
that was sent to you by the unlocking
company so after inputting the code you
will get a message stating that
work on lock was successful and it will
take you straight to the home screen
which means that your phone is now
permanently unlocked so that's how you
unlock your ZTE Concord to smartphone if
this video helped you guys out feel free
to leave a like and if you run into any
problems or have any questions at all
feel free to leave them in the comments
section down below and I will answer
them as soon as possible this is that
from Texas and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
