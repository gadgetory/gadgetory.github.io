about 20 grand believe it or not what's
up guys long time no see I know haven't
done a vlog in a while it's just been
very difficult balancing life and making
videos and sending up the home this past
month and a half even two months I've
been chaotic for me so thank you guys
for your patience I know you've been
asking for more vlogs and I'm trying to
do as much as I can how do you know what
I'm saying okay anyways look I'm not
gonna be doing it what's in the box for
this episode because I figured I just
unbox it and vlog because I have way too
many things going on wait to me boxes
keep cutting it wait 20 boxes coming in
as you can see they're starting to pile
up over here and I got a few more boxes
back there and yes I didn't move the TV
to my bedroom because we're gonna be
popping in these 65 inch 65 you h77 and
like I said guys the ultimate gaming
setup is gonna be we worked a lot of you
guys weren't happy with the first one
because of the ps4 slim and stuff like
that but anyways hey we are I am
building it so that is episode 1 as you
can see I've already made some upgrades
ps4 pro is coming better TV I'm getting
a sound bar it's gonna be lit guys it's
gonna be late I promise
also here's the future plan as well this
whole room here is gonna be gone so as
you can see my filming desk over here is
a complete mess we got a test bed over
here we got some acoustic panels there
is literally no room to move around my
desk has gonna be gone because I got my
desk actually today it's downstairs let
me show you I'm not gonna go all the way
downstairs but there's the two boxes
right there that's the tabletop I think
it's about 84 inches and with my voice
is dying oh my god so that is the
tabletop as you can see it's about 84
inches in width which is ridiculously
long and those are like the legs and
adjustable control panel and stuff like
that because it is an adjustable desk
but anyways in this video I'm gonna be
unboxing these and those three boxes in
the back and if there's time I want to
take this entire desk apart everything
is going to be gone and I'm gonna move
that into these this next room which is
where my mom is
currently sleeping as you can see their
house is finally completed they'll be
leaving me
finally this Saturday so I can finally
redo this entire rooms that over there
is gonna be the charging station I'm
gonna move that desk actually over here
against this wall and whatever has a
rechargeable battery will sit on that
desk with some 3m tape underneath that
way it's not moving and stuff there's
some stuff on the ground as well I'm
only working on the cable and ruin
everything is just okay I also be
building myself a brand new PC this is
the one I've been using for I think over
a year now since I buy power sent this
to me it's a solid computer honestly I
no complaints I did the few upgrades
actually I updated the CPU to a 69
hundred K it's got 32 gigs of RAM now
instead of 16 and I swapped out the
980ti to the Titan X P so everything's
fine for now it's getting the job done
editing and stuff like that on my PC so
that's cool but this entire section is
gonna be gone I don't know if I'm gonna
put the PC on my desk or I'm gonna keep
the allegewi in it we'll see guys a lot
of things need to be done I just love to
hang this pretty dope artwork that I got
I don't know where exactly but maybe
I'll put it on top of my setup I don't
know we'll see so yeah guys it's gonna
be interesting unboxing experience and
angle I've never done it this way but
hey time is of essence this one was
already opened because I was excited
when he came in so I'm just gonna get
this out of the box so guys this here is
my new red camera I sent back the Red
Raven and I picked up the scarlet W
because of Jon from TLD he told me it's
worth it to spend a few more thousand
and get this that weighs future-proofed
for a very long time so I listened to
him because he's a good buddy of mine at
least I think is a good buddy of mine
and I got the red scarlet W so here it
is that's that cool alright moving on
this year looks like it is the charger
for the scarlet W let's open this up so
yeah this is just the AC adapter if I
want to plug it straight to a wall and
not worry about battery packs but I'm
not gonna really use this as much this
next box is where all the accessories
are let's open up let's open up this one
first actually
I like how all the boxes are just black
there's like nothing else on it other
than the red logo oh wait no I lied
actually told you what it is okay so
this is the V mount to mount the battery
on the back of the camera oh this is way
bigger than the one that came with the
Red Raven nice okay so this is the LCD
monitor or LED monitor anomaly share
this but just keep that on for now
actually very nice okay let's put this
inside two more boxes of debt this is
the side handle nothing fancy I lied so
this is actually the mount for the
camera that way I can hook up my Canon
mounts on here this is the canon EF
mount
so it looks like I'm missing two items
my 960 gigabytes red mini mag which is
the memory card and two battery packs
for the red scarlet W so unfortunately I
can't use the camera just yet I don't
like plugging stuff in the wall
I'm gonna have to use the 6500 that I'm
using now to make my videos until he
sent it over I think it was a special
order from BH photo that is why so yeah
guys everything here is worth about 20
grand
believe it or not plus the battery pack
and the mini mag we're looking at a
total of 22 grand but everything here 20
G's believe it or not but just hope it's
worth it so let's go and put everything
together real quick and then we can move
on to the other boxes let's pop open the
sensor cover take a look at that guys 5k
sensor so pretty gotta make sure to
align the pins on the bottom and there
you got it
kind of like building Legos pretty fun
actually alright so onto the battery
mounting plate so I'm guessing the same
concept goes just make sure the pins
align just sits like this I think yeah
there we go
alright that is done let's put on the
handle where are we gonna put this
actually they just have a pin oh it does
so that goes on top of dad you baby
looking pretty sweet
well that was close our final piece is
the LCD monitor and then we can move on
from this once again same concept match
the pins just like that just gonna
tighten it to be on the safe side and
there you have a guy's tiny yet powerful
red scarlet double you might kill this
thing off that was a horrible job but
hey don't let the size fool you guys
this thing is freaking heavy and I don't
even have a lens on or a battery pack so
yeah it's gonna be very very hard to do
it one hand you definitely both hands to
hold this thing
alright so now with that out of the way
we are actually four boxes to open up
I'm not sure why I said three but yeah
this is jump right into it what was I
trying to say oh yeah the style of
unboxings is different I like it it's
chill there's no like scripting or
anything there's nothing to set up I
just sit here on the carpet and open up
boxes let me know what you guys prefer
this style unboxings or my what's in the
box style videos either way I enjoy
doing both either way I enjoy doing both
so let me know your comments down below
guys
so these are the fans I'm going to be
using in the build I'm calling it Jack
the Ripper I don't if I told you guys
but yeah the threat Ripper build calling
it Jack the Ripper I'm very creative
alright let's open up this one ooh
so this is I don't know if this is on
their NDA or not but this is logitech's
new mechanical gaming keyboard
apparently this is the g6 13 oh they
sent a mouse to the jew 603 so yeah
maybe you guys will see it in the video
it's kind of for those minimalistic
people who are looking for just a solid
keyboard and mouse you don't get
anything fancy or flashy with these but
yeah probably put it in a video or
something next box I always read your
comments you're like Edie
stop cutting boxes with the knife
towards you always go away from you and
I never listen one of these days I'm
gonna cut myself away bad and you guys
are gonna be like I told you so so
remember I said earlier in the video
that I'm gonna be building myself a PC
these other parts I'm gonna be using EVG
IX 299 micro ATX board I should probably
not shake it like that
we got the EVGA g3 1000 watt power
supply and I wonder if you guys can
guess what GPU I'm gonna be using let me
know in the comment section quick I'm
gonna be using not one but two a VGA GT
X 1080 t is this is the FTW three I
believe or is it oh it is I'm blind
I don't usually have it like in front of
their box I guess they changed it but
it's located right over here FTW three
as you guys can see so yeah there's only
one of the box because they can only
send me one unfortunately so I had to
buy the other one from BH photo it's on
its way it should be here actually
tomorrow I couldn't wait so I had to get
all these things in box today because I
want to start putting things together
but here it is you are the parts oh and
with the case let me show you guys the
case so yeah this is the case the cougar
conquer this thing is looking like a
transformer it's gonna look awesome
obviously it's gonna be a black and
orange theme in case you guys haven't
deduced that already here's another shot
of the case alright one more final box
guys I'm just gonna unbox it like this
ooh what is this I mean obviously it's a
laptop but curious what kind of laptop
this was because I have no idea that
this was being sent to me Wow
oh so I think this is the Acer predator
Helios I think I'm sorry pronounce it
which is $1,000 worth laptop it means
got a GTX 1060 in here and a 7700 HQ I
could be wrong and look no surprise
black and red color scheme of course
every laptop and their mother's come in
black and red but anyways you guys can
expect a video on this of course along
with the other two laptops holy crap I
have so much work to do I'm gonna die oh
and one final box I almost completely
forgot about this guys remember I told
you about the that I'm swapping the ps4
slim with the ps4 Pro well that's what
this is I also picked up an extra ps4
controller and I got the same stand but
for the ps4 Pro - the - the stand
because I don't really have them
actually I have zero games to be honest
all my games are stored online or on the
SSD so so I do not need that plus looks
a lot cleaner in my opinion the ps4 Pro
obviously I'm gonna pick up some skins
cuz black is a bit too bland for me you
guys already know deep bran is where I'm
gonna be getting them from but let's put
this over here I promise you guys
episode 2 of the ultimate gaming setup
is gonna be way better than the first
one the ps4 slim thing is still on here
actually me
okay wear this and put the other one but
anyways I don't wanna be what do I know
so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and wrap
up the vlog here I hope you guys enjoyed
it if you did feel free to leave a like
