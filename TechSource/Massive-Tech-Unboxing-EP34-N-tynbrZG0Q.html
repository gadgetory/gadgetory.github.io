ladies gentlemen with another unboxing
episode here on tech source and just to
recap for all the newbies that are
watching these series are basically
about unboxing stuff that I get from
companies who are sending things to get
featured on the channel or to get
reviewed or even some fan mail from
subscribers so yeah that's pretty much
the purpose of this episode and I know
some of you guys already know that most
of these boxes are for my upcoming
insane two-in-one gaming PC which I'm
gonna be calling yes and those Armenians
out there know what that means because
it's an armenian they're calling it yes
and it's actually gonna be specifically
this box some parts on the asus one and
the other alpha cool box so yeah but
with that said let's dive right in you
know why i love this series so much guys
i just sit in front of the camera and i
unbox things there's no technical specs
to talk about there's nothing to review
it just like relax a chill and i chat
with you guys it's a one-way chat
obviously but you know what i mean
anyways typically we like to start off
with the small boxes so this one is
coming from encased products it's going
on boxes and see what they are sending
us today
black-and-red I'm always loving it Oh
check that out guys the jack is back
this is basically a case oh it's a
battery case for the iPhone 10 I'm
guessing yeah it's for the iPhone 10
let's check this out actually remember I
was telling you I was looking for a
charging case for my iPhone 10
I think somebody heard me I've been
hooked on this game called mobile
legends guys I want to show you
screenshot of my battery life it is
draining the crap out of my battery
honestly I've been looking for something
portable that I can use and I think this
might be it
you got your charging cable of course
and that's pretty much it in the box
and then you got the charging case
itself so installation is actually
really simple you just pop off the top
cover you slide in the iPhone 10 which
actually goes in really smoothly snaps
in place and then you put back the cover
and you pretty much it if you want to
turn it on will have to do is hold down
the button for about 2 or 3 seconds and
it starts charging your phone as you can
see so guys this case has a 4600
milliamp hour battery juice inside here
which will give you 130 percent extra
battery life basically what that means
is it'll charge your iPhone 10 fully and
then give you an extra 30% so that is
actually insane and the cool thing about
this that separates it from other
battery cases is that not only does it
give you back the jack but it also gives
you the option to listen to music and
charge the phone at the same time
because the dilemma right now with
iPhone 10 is the charging port is the
same as the earphone port so with this
you basically plug in your earphones and
you can even enable charging a listen to
music at the same time while you're
charging your phone which is pretty cool
and then over here you get two front
grills which are basically redirecting
the iPhone 10 speakers since it is
covering the bottom portion very
well-thought-out so the only issue I ran
into while testing this is that one of
the earbuds don't work only one side
does so you're not getting stereo sound
plugged in whether it's charging or not
it's weird I don't know if it's a
defective product or not because on the
website is actually claiming that you
can listen to music in charge at the
same time and you even have control for
the volume and skipping tracks so and
I've been reading reviews as well
they're not complaining anything about
that so I just think we have a defective
units so I'm gonna get in contact with
them and see what's going on but if you
guys want to check it out anyways I'll
drop a link below
besides that issue I'm actually really
like in this case the buttons are really
easy to press it's not as heavy or bulky
as other charging cases and this is
actually the case I'm gonna be using for
my iPhone 10 anyways moving on to the
next box
these next two bags off in the same
place so might as well just open it at
the same time I think I know what these
are yes and indeed they are the cables
for the PC build coming from none other
then cable mod themselves I'll just open
up one of them and show you guys the
color combo I went with so yeah guys it
is gonna be a black and white build and
I went with the white aluminum cable
combs day I can never get tired of
looking at these so sexy now I do have
two sets of cables because obviously
there are gonna be two pieces in there
there's gonna be a workstation and
there's gonna be a gaming PC so both of
them need their own sets of cables is
also black and white but I'm not gonna
open it because it's the same thing and
this is the next big box
I think there's liquid in here maybe
coolant
check out I mean ask to be cool and what
else could it be almost a subscriber
sent me a nice surprise
there are liquids down there
there's gonna be the first time I got
that coyote urine one time when I was in
boxing you guys remember that one of the
worst episodes of what's in the box
Pete's pete Rickards coyote urine so
let's say we got some containers
hopefully if not coyote urine we have
four actually bottles of I'm assuming
cool in you can open up one of them so
this is the mayhem nano liquid coolant
advanced nano liquid coolant so I think
this is actually the white because the
coolant I'm gonna be using is gonna be
white inside the build all my guys on
the side of it I'm recovering that's
Mexican for the entire episode now I'm
recovering from the weekend so you guys
pace the light is what I'm going with
they sent me four which I hope is gonna
be enough because there's gonna be two
separate loops because I'm powering two
pcs so I think I think four should be
good the only thing I'm gonna get from
Am's is the cleaning kit which i think
is gonna be coming separately moving
right along you have this massive bucks
from Asus a package from Asus always
makes me smile so I cannot wait to see
what they sent me this time
this is a really big box for one mother
voidness they're supposed to send me a
mini ITX motherboard but they put it in
this box so I'm curious what else they
sent me because all I requested was a
motherboard all whole white I've seen
these
I've seen these somewhere oh my god
we've got some peripherals ladies and
gentlemen oh my lord
hey soos you guys got to stop spoiling
me seriously this is insane we got their
new keyboard well this is the mother but
I was talking about the are districts
this is actually gonna be part of the
gaming PC build let me put that aside so
they actually sent me their new mouse
pad their new mouse keyboard and their
badass fusion 500 gaming headset these
are of course are all RGB 2018 got RGB
everything I wonder if the mouse pad or
a TV check it out you know what though I
was actually in the process of replacing
my mouse pad is like super dirty and
I've been looking for a new one so I
might use this what's black and red -
it's okay it's a little little too much
black for me if the outline was black I
mean if the outline was red I think I
would have used this in my in my setup
but yeah I don't know why the backside
is red interesting nonetheless it's a
nice large mouse pad and of course you
got the keyboard headset and mouse which
I'm not gonna open up in this episode
and the motherboard that is going inside
yes if you're Armenian by the way and
you know what yes means translator for
everybody else cuz it's a funny name but
you guys don't understand why I called
it yes moving on all right two more
boxes guys and then I wrap up the
episode this is actually one of the two
boxes from Alpha cool and alpha cool is
actually the main sponsor for the
upcoming build they are a German based
water cooling company one of the
water cooling components you can buy
I've actually used them in my first
water-cooled build Electrolux if you
guys missed it
check it out it was an interesting build
so yeah all the water food parts are
gonna be from Africa I don't know why
they packaged it like this oh there we
go oh my lord yes okay yeah this is
gonna take a while to unbox everything
let me just let me just dump everything
on the table for you guys we got
reservoirs we got fittings we've got
freakin CPU blocks we've got a bunch of
things that are going in the bill
obviously I'm not gonna go there every
single one of them some of them even
have names actually see what this is
we've even got cups guys we've got
fittings most importantly we got alpha
cool cups look at this I think I have an
extra one for you Bob let me see they
don't I'm picking this one all this
one's mine oh look at that Bob looks
like they do love you there ha
Bob this one's yours there's a little
there's a little scuff mark here but
nonetheless you got a nice lucky enough
cup there you go there you go I won't
that this keeps your dreams cool that'll
be pretty cool huh it's like 5 degrees
cooler anyways yeah that's all then we
have some cooler than anything what is
the secretary CKC Cape Kelvin catcher I
have no idea what that is
looks like it's anti-corrosion fluid for
PC cooling system
so I'm guessing you've dumped this in
with the coolant I don't know I've never
I never heard of this I've seen this
before so do some research and check it
out but yeah very cool stuff from alpha
cool
yeah ladies and gentlemen I think this
is upside down this there we go holy
moly just look the size of this radiator
look how long this thing is holy crap
this is just one of the four 80s that
were gonna be fitting inside the corset
1000d case ladies and gentlemen i'm
gonna think everything out of the box
and i'll see you guys soon so yeah we
got pretty much the rest of the stuff
I'm gonna use inside the bill why don't
we hear we got all the radiators we got
some more CPU blocks I've got the GPU
blocks down here some more fittings
hardline tube I think this is PEP gee I
don't know if I want acrylic this time
no I want PT d and of course you gotta
have some soft tubing for the rear or
the draining loop and stuff there is one
other thing that alpha cool sent me and
it's down here it's too big to fit on
the desk with the rest of the parts and
this is gonna help me a lot this time
around when it comes to the bends and
actually putting together the PC I'm
gonna show you guys right now
you know it's legit when it comes inside
a freaking aluminum Pelican case ladies
and gentlemen this year is the Alpha
cool L scope for this is basically their
premium bending kit let me open this up
and show you guys what's inside whoa
ladies and gentlemen I think I just got
a hard-on they even sent you gloves look
at this what all types of rulers over
here all sorts of different angles over
here you got angles for days and of
course a bunch of other tools to help
you with the actual bends and there's
even a second layer to all this let me
pop this open oh this is freaking insane
this is so advanced I don't know what
this is but I'm sure I'll figure out
eventually oh wow this is for like those
180 degree bands guys or even 270 270
degree bends what it's safe to say I'm
not even ready for that one got the
inner silicone inserts and what the heck
is this what okay I get that this is
used to cut the tubing but I would
assume comes with some other tools I
mean is this really necessary well it's
nice to know I have a saw in here just
in case I need to use it
wrong side whoa okay that's not that's
not kind of myself today
