this episode I have to clean all this
crap up what you guys as mtech stories
and the time has finally come I've been
teasing about this day for months and
months and months I've been getting
emails I've been getting tweets I've
been getting comments the day is finally
here to finally expand text source now
before I continue if you're not
interested in working with text source
stop watching this video and move on to
one of my other videos because this is
not print a ting to you and it's not
going to be in interesting videos can be
very boring I'm just going to be me
sitting front of the camera talking
about stuff now if you're still sitting
here watching this video you probably
didn't care about what I just said a few
seconds ago your rebellion I like that
little seriousness though I am having
two full time individuals a reviewer
editor and also someone who could shoot
video we need to have these three skill
sets to apply for the position this
person needs to be able to relocate
wherever they live so if you live
outside the states or maybe in a
different state you guys are gonna have
to move to LA and so we're close to
where I live I'm gonna be moving to
Santa Clarita at the end of July which
is about 30 minutes north of LA and if
you guys are worried about the payment
the salary here is basically enough to
get your own place in LA and still live
comfortably I'm not going to tell you
what the celery is now because it
depends on experience and it depends on
a bunch of other factors but more info
on that as the hiring process continues
this is private information of course so
the tumor viewers I was talking about
the first one has to have excessive
knowledge and skill sets on the PC side
we're talking about graphics card
reviews motherboards CPUs benchmarks PC
builds keyboards gaming runners the list
goes on but you guys get the idea the
other person has to have expertise and
general text so we're talking
smartphones operating systems like
Android iOS we're also talking about
headphones speakers and basically
everything else and it doesn't have to
do with PC gaming if that makes any
sense both of them need to know how to
edit on Adobe Premiere or on Final Cut
Pro and also they need to know proper
scram
both of them are going to be reviewing
products so obviously you have to sound
like you know what you're talking about
basically guys I'm looking for sharks
I'm looking for self driven dedicated
loyal intellectual individuals I want to
join something big
also it's been one of your dreams to
always live in California then this
might be your dream job one thing that's
missing this year compared to last year
when the channel is doing so well is
consistency I upload every single day
but now that I'm not the channels kind
of this plateauing I mean still growing
believe it or not I'm not complaining at
all with the numbers it's just I expect
it to be at a certain number at the end
of the month and I'm not hitting that
number so in order to do that I got to
pump out more videos I gotta push out
more content and I believe that this is
truly the next step to make that
possible so with that said I'll drop a
link to the application down below but
honestly guys the most important thing
about this whole application is the
actual video that you're going to have
to create to send to me so basically I
need you guys to review a product and
send me the video file now I'm not
expecting high quality production videos
in fact something guys might not even
own a camera but this is where the
people who really want the job will
outshine the people that don't want it
as much
I feel like obtaining a camera is fairly
easy I'm sure you know one of your
friends or family that owns a camera or
you can go to your local camera store
maybe borrow it from them or purchase it
shoot the video and then you can return
it back I mean there's plenty of ways to
do that as far as the voice-over section
if you guys aren't comfortable voicing
over the video you can send me the
script
I'll voice over and I'll just send you
the audio file and you guys can put that
in your video so if you have a PC side
grab maybe I don't know like a graphics
card and do a video on that with
benchmarks and stuff like that and if
you're on the other side general tech
grab maybe a smartphone or a pair of
headphones and do a video on that don't
grab a power bank or something simple to
do a video on just to do a video guys I
need to be impressed okay I'm gonna be
looking at the editing skills I'm going
to be looking at the way you present the
item I'm not looking at the quality per
se I'm just looking at how you guys
present the item I'm going to be judging
it off that it's like this is the best
place to reach a poor potential
candidates for several reasons one you
guys watch my content so we know what
type of videos I produced
familiar with the style of my videos and
to you probably into technology if
you're subscribed to tech source so
instead of reaching out to an agency to
hire people that might not even know
anything about YouTube or social media
or anything like that I think will be a
complete disaster and waste of time so
this I feel like is the first step in it
into finding someone or finding the two
people that are perfect for the growth
of tech stores so that about wraps up
this video I think yes so much for
watching and for those of you who aren't
even interested in watch the video thank
you so much for the viewership this
year's going to be very big for tech
source we're going to be expanding and
I'm so excited to welcome to lucky
individuals to join a tech source team
honestly big things are happening this
is the beginning I cannot contain at the
excitement I have all these series ideas
I have planned and all the content that
I want to shove in your faces as soon as
I have the team and the office space to
do it I want to bring you guys more
ultimate that set of videos hopefully
you can do that
once a month or once every two months or
something more frequently and just a
bunch of other PC bills and stuff like
that but and I'm done rambling check out
the links below if you're interested if
you have any questions hit me up on
Twitter at IDI underscore tech stores
I'll see you guys in an excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
