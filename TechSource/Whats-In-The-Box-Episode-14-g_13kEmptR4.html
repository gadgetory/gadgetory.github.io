it's dad from tech source and welcome to
another episode of what's in the box
none of you guys can tell but I'm
actually using a new lens it came in
today and I want to improve my quality
of my videos specifically these what's
in the box videos because it's one of my
most popular series on the channel so
hopefully you guys can tell the
difference if not I just wasted nine
hundred dollars for no reason and the
next thing I want to improve is the
audio which I'm currently not happy with
this is definitely a new scenario or a
new style of video for me so I'm trying
to get used to it obviously
so hopefully this book box can change
that because it's from CAD or CID and
there's some pretty cool audio gear in
there so yeah if you guys can tell
difference in the image or video let me
know in the comments section thank you
so much let's begin I keep forgetting to
black out my address on these boxes one
of these days it's gonna get leaked and
I'm gonna get like be dust is it D dust
or doxxed I don't even know so we got
one fan mail in this episode I do have a
few letters in the storage room I'm
trying to save up until I have enough to
make another episode but in this episode
I will unbox
one of the fan mail that I got I think
sometime last week as always I'm very
stoked to use this new unboxing knife
that I got I still can't get over this
thing is badass a whole dude the fact
that you spend extra to get this gift
wrap is honestly unbelievable thank you
so much there's two boxes in here I am
so excited I'm gonna hold off my
excitement maybe it's another deke
trucks bottle it was at this moment that
he knew hi enjoy your gift from Joshua
Evans do Joshua thank you so much for
sending these in let's check these out I
don't want to ruin this how can I open
this up so in box number one we have
looks like a game of Thrones shirt no
way this is sick my most favorite TV
show and it's a red and black sure this
is freaking awesome Joshua thank you so
much you get my size right doesn't say
the size but it looks like this will
definitely fit me I'm definitely gonna
be walking these in my videos Joshua I
can't thank you enough dude thank you so
much let's open up the second one so in
the second box we have another game of
Thrones this time it's a banner dough
and it's House Targaryen which is the
house I represent let me check this
thing out it's like sick so this is a 30
by 50 inch banner holy crap this thing
is huge dang this thing is legit this is
seriously legit
I don't know I'm gonna hang this in this
room for sure maybe behind me I'm gonna
rock this behind me on every single one
of these episodes you never know
dude Joshua thank you so much do this is
honestly this is awesome
even following me for quite some time
there's no there's no other way you
would have known that I represent House
Targaryen so thank you so much for this
these are freaking awesome looks like we
got more loot gaming and loot we're so
let's go open these up and check out
what this month's theme is for those of
you that don't know loot we're and also
loot gaming are these monthly
subscription services that send you
these boxes all these bags every single
month with goodies so it's open these up
and check them out so this month's theme
is speed so let's see what this is about
short one is something to do with Mario
Kart and the Bowser shell I think this
is a shell that attacks the first player
in the race that could be wrong pretty
sexy looking what is it a skirt booty
shorts
and finally we have a pretty cool look
in transformers Autobots t-shirts so
yeah looks like there were three
t-shirts in this loot we're onto the
loot gaming box alright so we got a
bunch of stuff in here let's start off
with their shirt this is just a woody
this looks like a fallout 4 theme the
t-shirt this is something my fallout 4
fans would appreciate battlezone shot
glasses these are pretty dope you also
have a Dead Rising looks like a Swiss
Army knife this thing is pretty dope it
has a bunch of tools on here there's
also a flashlight where you can screw in
and then they'll activate
that's pretty cool kind of like a handy
little - we can put in your pocket it's
got a Phillips screwdriver flat head
even a little knife over here Gears of
War 4 so looks like a model of I'm
guessing the main players or main
character's gun
I haven't played Gears of War so don't
drill me guys but it's got a little
stand here I guess you can hook this up
on your desk or something pretty nice
prop for your desk set up I would say
Dark Souls legends of the flame looks
like there's a pretty cool little comic
book in here they usually include comic
books once in a while so I'm sure this
is something you Dark Souls fans would
appreciate reading you have a tiny
battlegrounds pin and finally it looks
like we have a poster of once again
battlegrounds so yeah there you guys
have it this month's loot crate and loot
where if you guys want to check them out
it's a monthly subscription they send
you some pretty cool stuff every single
month if you guys sign up using the link
below you do get a discount let's
continue so this is hyper axis new
gaming keyboard these are cherry MX
mechanical gaming key
and I don't know the price but you guys
will see it in a video coming up soon oh
this is sweet it comes with a detachable
USB cable guys which is awesome for
cable management and it looks like there
is a USB 3 pass-through in the front
as well so very very nice it also comes
with some removable key caps so very
sweet looking keyboard is actually
pretty heavy the construction seems
pretty solid it doesn't look like it's
RGB so instead you guys will get red LED
so if that's not your thing then yeah
this keyboard won't work out for you
this is a really nice black and red
reddit reddit threaded cable USB cable
so to match the theme obviously so yeah
this is pretty cool all right so we got
some bumpers lots and lots of bumpers
and screen shields for the iPhone and
seven and seven plus so I did a video on
this actually if like months back but
now I'm going to be doing one for the
iPhone 7 as well it should be part of
the cool tech video of November so stick
around guys this thing seriously
protects your phone from insane amount
of damage I ran over my iPhone 6s plus
at a time with this bumper on and the
phone stayed intact I also dropped it
for like 20 feet and it didn't like get
destroyed or anything so these bumpers
actually work
so this is something I ordered last week
for my top five GPUs under $200 this is
the Radeon r9 380 which is currently
going for I think 180 bucks or 170
depending on if you get a deal on it or
not so this will be in the roundup of
the top five GPUs coming up very soon
guys
stick around I know a lot of you guys
are excited all right two more boxes and
then we can open up the CAD box which
I'm very excited about so guys these are
all sent by this app called nice
shopping I've done a few videos on the
channel before and you guys will see a
lot more done in the next few months so
this is pretty much it's an app where
you can try products for free so all the
products in here you see here are
requested by me and if I featured in the
video you guys have the opportunity to
try them out for yourselves for free and
if you enjoy it you can pay for the
product and keep it or if not you can
send it back with free shipping label
and you have to worry about anything one
of things I really like about the app is
the variety of the tech products that it
does have which is perfect for my cool
tech series because I can go on there
pick out the products I want to request
send it to me so give a YouTube channel
especially this is perfect for you guys
out there so yeah guys I'm not gonna
really show you any of these it's
surprise for my upcoming cool tech
videos maybe I'll give you a sneak peek
on this one's pretty cool it's a self
stirring mug so I guess you press the
button and the cup stirs your drink so
that's free though last but not least we
have the CAD audio box I am very excited
to see what's in here is a massive box
we have quite a few things in here guys
well they send me so much so we got two
USB you 37 recording microphones it
looks like I don't know why they sent me
two maybe I'm supposed to do a giveaway
so we have quite a few more microphones
over here condenser microphones dynamic
and looks like we have a budget
microphone this one's going in the top
five budget mics on there 50 I know why
I got this but I have no idea well I got
these other ones for it
these sessions headphones I think this
is for monitoring audio are these the
same ones so they kind of look alike but
this one is the CR version I have no
idea what that means but I can't wait to
test these out maybe they'll replace my
audio technica m50x s who knows and last
but not least we have this this is what
I'm gonna be using starting next episode
of what's in the box this is a lavalier
wireless audio setup that I'm very
excited to try it out because instead of
having a microphone right there in front
of the camera which is kind of far from
me I want to basically hook it up to my
shirt where the audio will be a lot
clearer for you guys so yeah very stoked
to give it to ya give this a shot but
but that pretty much wraps up this video
thank you so much for watching as always
if you guys enjoy these videos be sure
to leave a like and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
