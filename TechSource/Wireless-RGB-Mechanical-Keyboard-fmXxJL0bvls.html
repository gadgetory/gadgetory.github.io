welcome to another keyboard review video
you guys seem to really enjoy the first
one so that's really good I'll continue
to do these on the channel at least once
every two weeks maybe once a month if I
have time but with that said you guys
will be checking out the drebbel caliber
mechanical Bluetooth keyboard so let's
start off with the hardware it's built
solid with very little flex to the body
its foot spin is actually small compared
to something like my cursor keyboard one
thing I don't like about it already is
that it doesn't have a wrist rest so I
was forced to pick one up you guys
probably already know this but I do like
keyboards that come with a detachable
wrist rest but I will leave a link in
the description section to the wrist
rest I'm using if you want to check it
out the keys have a soft rubber coating
on them which feels really nice I
definitely prefer this to the generic
plastic feel that you find on most
keyboards at this price range on the
bottom we have six anti-slip rubber
strips now they are rubberized so it
suffice to say that you won't be pushing
this thing around
while using it the keys themselves are
labeled as brown switches and they're
great they're definitely less tactile
than Sherry's variant of the brown
switch but not by that much they're not
annoyingly loud so these were great in
environments where there are other
people like in a small office or even
streaming since the mic won't pick up
much noise however they do offer red
blue and even black switch versions as
well the keyboard is full RGB and since
there isn't a desktop application all
the effects are controlled through the
function key which is a bit annoying
there are seven modes you can cycle
through as well as being able to control
the speed of the effects I found that
the lighting is pretty dim especially
when using it in well-lit rooms however
in low-light scenarios it's actually
fine the lights will automatically turn
off after thirty seconds of an activity
to conserve battery or you can turn them
off completely yourself on a full charge
the keyboard lasted me around 28 hours
with the RGB effects on I wish it lasted
a bit longer but seeing as I can connect
it to my PC and use it while charging at
the same time makes it bearable and of
course being micro USB you can even use
a battery pack to keep it charged up
sadly there's no way to check the
remaining battery percentage on the
keyboard which is definitely something
to keep in mind let's switch gears and
talk about what stands out
about this mechanical keyboard it's
Bluetooth capability if you're going for
a clean aesthetic looks than a wireless
solution is really the best route
especially if you don't want to drill
any holes in your desk for the cable
management pairing the keyboard was
straightforward just hold the function
plus Q W or a keys to store into one of
the three profiles the caliber also
supports multiple devices like Android
iOS and even Linux so having three
profiles is really convenient I did have
concerns about Lane T being a wireless
gaming keyboard it would be kind of
useless if there was any input lag from
the PC fortunately I didn't detect any
lag throughout my week of using the
caliber so I do recommend this for
gaming as well for fifty seven dollars
you get a pretty solid compact full RGB
Bluetooth mechanical keyboard its
battery life isn't going to get you a
week of long use but it's easy to
recharge with its micro USB port and it
works directly plugged into your PC as
well
you get no ten key a wrist rest nor do
you have the ability to program the RGB
lights easily via software so if you're
someone with very little patience then
this keyboard definitely isn't for you
also this keyboard doesn't have any
dedicated media control so that can be a
deal-breaker for some as well there is
one way around this however and that's
by downloading a software that lets you
remap some keys for shortcuts but that's
just more work if you ask me the brown
switches feel great and I've enjoyed my
time gaming on this keyboard without
experiencing any lag or stutter however
I do wish they would have made a
full-size model with a number pad since
that is a deal-breaker for me but other
people don't seem to mind so with all
that said I will give this keyboard a
solid 7 out of 10 if you guys are
interested in checking it out I'll drop
a link to it down below then guys so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
