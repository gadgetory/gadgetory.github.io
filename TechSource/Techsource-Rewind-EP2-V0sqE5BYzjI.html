well as these setup wars winners but
with that said here are the table of
contents let us begin
so few things are happening with the
channel first and foremost a huge
massive upgrade in quality I recently
picked up a few things from BH photo I
just got thinking the last episode I
talked about me getting the Ursa mini
4.6 k camera today I got the sheen or
zine however you say lens which is a
wide-angle Sinaloan that's going to look
amazing for those cinematic shots and
I'm most going to be picking up some
better audio gear and lighting gear so
basically a lot a lot of stuff I'm
picking up to bring you guys just better
looking videos I want to increase the
quality and the production quality of
this channel and I feel like that's the
next step and huge things to BH photo
for hooking me up with this amazing deal
on all of my gear from the camera to the
lens to the battery packs as the I mean
everything you guys are awesome I'll
drop a link to all the gear I'm picking
up from BH photo in case you guys want
to check it out I'm very excited and I
know you guys are going to be
I just about have everything to put
together the perfect desk setup episode
four which by the way it's going to be
insane it's going to be black and yellow
setup
Wolverine themed and it's going to
feature electro box I am just so static
static I am so ecstatic for this and
honestly it's going to be one of the
best it's not the best video the only
thing is I'm waiting for the rest of my
camera gear because I want to shoot this
video in the best possible quality and
bring that to you guys I figured it's
gonna be worth the wait
so just give me a few more weeks maybe a
month but aside from that I did a few
other awesome builds coming up on the
channel next few months one of them is
going to be a rising five budget extreme
budget build and that's going to have a
build guide because I actually haven't
done one of those in such a long time
and I know a lot of you guys love the
field guides so excited satellite so the
top 5 tech of April according to your
votes in the nice app in no particular
order are as follows the gigabyte b250
motherboard which is one of the go-to
boards for budget builders out there
looking to build a PC running on either
the sky lake or kb lake platform it's
got four dimm slots and that to support
as well as 4 USB 3.1 fours next up is
the Logitech G 9 10 RGB mechanical
keyboard which is actually fifty three
dollars off right now in Amazon and then
we got the very popular one terabyte
drive from WD which you guys are
probably sick of seeing at this point
since it's pretty much in all of my
builds the 7600 K also made a list
making it a sweet spot for gaming around
$240 and finally the most popular cooler
on the planet the 212 Evo even until
today there hasn't been another cooler
to take its crown usually it goes for
around $35 but it's actually on Amazon
for only 25 so you get to save a measly
$10 and just like always every single
month the top 5 tech of the month will
be given away one to you and one to a
lucky friend more information on that
