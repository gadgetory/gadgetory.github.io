I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out starting off
the episode we have mats here and a
pretty clean black and white set up so
he's rocking a 28 inch asus monitor a
razer blackwidow and a logitech g502
mouse for audio he has a giant stone e
sound bar right in front of its face and
a pair of super luxe HD 668 B headphones
resting on an empty alcohol bottle I
think you might want to fill that up
though not much else on the surface
other than a wireless Qi charger from
anchor and SPC which is equipped with a
45 90 and an MSI GTX 960 cable Angela
isn't that sad it looks like he used
some zip ties to keep the wires under
the desk and a single power strip on the
ground which is powering the PC my only
question is how are you powering the
monitor and sound bar my guess would be
for me another power source behind a
drawer or something but overall he's
very straightforward black and white set
up Thank You Mattia for starting off
this episode speaking of black and
whites here is a white and black set up
from max a single 27-inch ILC monitor a
diode v60 wireless gaming keyboard and
mouse combo although I don't know if I
would call a wireless keyboard a gaming
keyboard but that looks pretty dope I
definitely appreciate the consistency of
the color scheme for audio here using a
pair of Logitech Z 200 speakers that he
mounted against the wall and in total
beach ear force x31 wireless gaming
headset even his xbox one controller is
skinned in white and black from debrand
job well done the PC what has been the
cherry on top had he gone with white or
black RAM sticks I'm guessing he went
with blue to match the motherboard
accent I don't know regardless it's a
good-looking PC I finally had some AMD
parts an FX 8350 and an r9 380 now here
is an interesting modification to cable
management he created his very own cable
box that he hooked up under the table
which is holding up majority of the
cables and his power strip the rest of
the cables are tied together with some
velcro and routed down one of the legs
amazing work I have no complaints this
is a very clean setup Thank You max for
entering here's an interesting triple
monitor setup
entirely sure how effective this can
possibly be
I feel like Robert always dreamed about
having a triple monitor setup and
despite not having this space for it he
decided to go with one anyways so the
desk he is using is called gel stead and
it's only 47 inches in width but I feel
like if you put the PC under the desk he
can actually squeeze that 24 inch
monitor up top on the desk especially
since you have another desk right next
to that also on a table he has the cue
pad MK 85 cherry keyboard and
SteelSeries rival Mouse on top of the
asus rog stealth mousepad someone behind
the monitors are a pair of Logitech G
623 speakers and is also using a
logitech g930 headset these cable
management seems to be under control
I believe the IKEA Signum is holding up
everything along with a few zip ties
that are keeping everything tied
together and finally the PC that somehow
pushing all these pixels has a 40 40 60
and a 79 70 so yeah this is obviously a
cluttered setup and I would recommend
you to get rid of one of the monitors or
placing the PC on the desk to make room
for the third monitor because this
honestly just doesn't look practical at
all but anyways thank you Albert's born
into ink use a triple display setup that
actually works well technically the
third display is a 40 inch TV but at
least it has purpose even though it's
not exactly centered about the monitors
due to the diagonal wall but there are
two monitors are they popular 34-inch
ultra light from LG which look to be
mounted against the wall the keyboard of
choice is the Logitech G 19 paired with
the Roccat Kone mouse which are resting
on a kitchen working top for audio he is
using the wall cat cave gaming headset
and that's resting on a headphone hanger
from aliexpress I don't know what's up
with the vodka bottles but this is like
the third setup that I've seen with some
hell there's even a smaller bottles
right next to that one maybe it's for
added personality but I'm not really
sure I do gotta give props for cable
management so I'll use some wall
raceways to hide the cables near the
bottom for a very clean look the rest of
the cables are resting on the rack I
think it's been a while since I've seen
a bit Phoenix Colossus case until now
but inside here is the i7 920 and a GTX
780 Ti
a pretty clean and organized setup with
no complaints thank you Sarah for
entering finishing up the episode strong
we have Zack and his impressive quad
display setup that's on a custom-made
desk from Ikea so is rocking a 27-inch
paint
you monitor that's in between two
23-inch h2s monitors and right above
that is a 55 inch vizio 4k Smart TV
there may be a few extra stuff on the
desk but everything is nicely organized
he has a pair of KRK Rokit speakers for
audio that hooked up to a Mackie Pro FX
mixer and an audio technica at2020 the
Focusrite audio interface definitely
loving that audio setup he also has a
few headphones hanging from the wall the
popular m50x is and the astro a40 s for
gaming I'm assuming speaking of gaming
Zack has quite a peripheral setup a
Razer DeathAdder chroma razor or
believer chroma and a ducky shine v RGB
keyboard in the middle keeping the
overall black-bean consistent he also
wrapped his ps4 in carbon fiber skins
from beer and of course I mean where
else in the cable management is of
course flawless I love how he grouped up
everything in those square compartments
under the desk
this means that he had to drill holes in
the pieces of wood to route the cables
through as you can see excellent work
of course the gaming setup isn't
complete without carbs this dude has a
mini-fridge next to his desk with a
bunch of sodas I mean could you ask for
anything else this entire room looks
like a man cave to be honest I'm not
really sure what's up with the giant
black curtains but this is one hell of a
gaming setup Thank You Zack for entering
