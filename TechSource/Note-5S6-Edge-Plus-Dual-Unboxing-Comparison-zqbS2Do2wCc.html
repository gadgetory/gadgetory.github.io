unboxing video of the galaxy note 5 and
the galaxy s6 edge+
I can safely say that lots of Samsung
fans including myself waited years for
them to finally ditch the cheap plastic
materials and go with a more premium
design they started with the galaxy s6
and now moved on to the note and edge
series as well so these models are both
from AT&amp;amp;T as you can probably already
tell by the hideous orange boxes that
they keep using but anyways opening of
the boxes we are greeted by both of the
phones laying face-up I mean it's no
secret that these were already unboxed
earlier but everything else is still
untouched so underneath the phones we
can find some QuickStart guides and SIM
cards and underneath the flap are some
more paperwork some warranty guides and
other useless information that no one
really cares about moving on to the
accessories we have two power books that
feature fast charging that will juice up
the phone's faster than usual there we
have a sim ejector tool some light micro
USB cables and finally some white
earphones these are actually really
comfortable to wear and have a snug fit
so it's great for working out or jogging
these also come with a built-in mic and
volume control so you can accept calls
both of the phones feel amazing in the
hand and you can definitely tell these
are premium devices this is what Samsung
should have done since the beginning
there's definitely some weight on both
of the devices they both have the same
5.7 inch Super AMOLED display with the
resolution of 2560 by 1440 P and Exynos
eight core processor and four gigabytes
of RAM the only difference between these
phones are some of the features and the
edges the note 5 has a flat screen and a
slight curve on the back whereas its
opposite on the s6 edge+
there's a slight curve on the screen and
the back is flat on the right side of
the phone if you're looking directly at
it you can find the power button and I
notice that it's much lower on the s6
edge+ on the opposite side is where the
protruding volume buttons are located
and at the top you will find the SIM
tray and noise cancelling mic
sadly they both don't feature a micro SD
card slot so you can't expand the memory
and they both don't come with an
infrared blaster on the bottom you will
find the headphone jack micro u.s.
B port and speakers and also notice that
the mic is on a different side for both
phones everything else is the same you
get the same 60 megapixel camera with
1.9 aperture that can shoot up to 4k
resolution and the same 3000 milliamp
hour non-removable battery which was
lowered from last year's 30 to 20
milliamp hour battery
unfortunately Samsung did away with the
removable black as you can probably tell
which means that you can't replace the
battery but they did add a super-fast
wireless charging feature that's faster
than standard wireless charging the note
5 feels really natural in my hand
because of the slight curves in the back
it's not as slippery as people claimed
you guys need to calm down the iPhone 6
is far more slippery both phones also
have a glass back so it's a major
fingerprint magnet not to mention that
it can easily be scratched so I would
strongly recommend getting a case for it
or better yet if you guys don't want to
cover up the beautiful design you can
pick up an awesome skin for your
smartphone like I have from P brand but
I'm going to drop a link down below for
those of you that are interested aside
from the design the phone itself is
super snappy I was never and will never
be a fan of TouchWiz but Samsung has
definitely come a long way and improved
the interface greatly they actually
claim that it's 40% lighter than last
year which I don't disagree with so I've
been using the phone for about a week
now and I've not yet experienced any lag
and everything is super quick to open
and the multitasking is wicked fast as
well I obviously prefer stock Android or
even the experienced skin but if you
guys love the note lineup then this is
something that shouldn't even bother you
the phone is extremely big as well even
with my large hands I find it difficult
to use with one hand especially when I
need to reach the top of the screen if
you have especially tiny hands and this
phone will be way too big for you and it
will feel like using a small tablet the
S Pen has also made some improvements
and now releases with a click and the
noise offers a satisfaction that I can't
quite explain
the s-pen itself feels a bit heavier
than last year's and with it comes some
pretty cool features if the phone is off
and you pull out the S Pen it will
enable you to write on the screen
without swiping to the homescreen it's
great for times that you need to quickly
write stuff down like an idea that
popped up or even the location of where
you parked
pulling out the S Pen also give you
other options like writing on the screen
that you captured or even bringing up in
notepad you can also add two additional
shortcuts but if you guys want a video
covering a bunch of note 5 features then
let me know by hitting that like button
the s6 edge+ is practically the same
exact phone but without the s-pen and
instead has a curved display
unlike the note 5 the edge plus is not
as comfortable to hold in the hand
simply because it has a flat back
swiping to the left from the top will
open up the edge screen and from here
you have shortcuts to contacts and
swiping one more time
will open up the app edge which will
give you shortcuts to the apps you can
obviously pick and choose which apps to
display here but you only get room for
five aside from that there's a few other
features that utilizes the edge like an
information stream or even a knife clock
and a few others that we have seen from
the regular s6 edge but anyways that's
basically it for the unboxing and quick
comparison between the two both of these
devices are exceptional phones and I'm
really happy with the quality I
personally like the note 5 better
because of the S Pen features and it's
more comfortable in the hand but let me
know which phone you guys would go with
if you had to choose between the s6 the
note 5 and the s6 edge+
there will be tons of coverage on the
note 5 coming soon so make sure you guys
are subscribed to the channel anyways
this is that from tech source and I'll
see you in the next video
