source and the galaxy s7 is finally here
but before I give you guys my review of
the phone I have to use it for a full
month but in the meantime these are the
apps that I have on my galaxy s7 so a
lot of you guys know that I hate
TouchWiz with a passion it's my least
favorite Android skin so immediately I
installed the Android 6.0 theme from the
theme store
I mean TouchWiz is still present but at
least this gives you more of a stock
Android look with the icon pack the
wallpaper and even some tweaks to the
actual UI appearance another
modification I did was install this
widget called dashclock that really
blends nicely with the overall theme you
get your clock date weather and
notifications in a single glance which
you can access by simply tapping on it
you can also customize the appearance to
your own liking and display the
notifications you want to see even if
they are from another app it doesn't
have to be a stock app just like last
year's model the s7 is a huge
fingerprint magnet and it's extremely
slippery to combat this I picked up some
awesome skins from D brand that I'll
jump links below if anyone is interested
in checking some out for themselves
so onto the apps the first step I use is
go keyboard which lets me ditch the ugly
stock keyboard and go with the much
cooler one I constantly change my
keyboards every week when I get bored of
them but what I'm actually using now is
this black and white theme which isn't
super flashy or anything I just think it
looks pretty cool and blends in well
with the phone they do have a bunch of
other keyboard so there's definitely
something in here that will please
everyone this next type is something I
recently installed and have been using
it every night so check this out guys
studies show that the ultraviolet and
blue light can damage our eyes
specifically the cornea monitors and
especially smartphones have blue light
and not only can they damage your eyes
but it makes it harder to go to sleep
after looking at your phone or tablet
that's where this app becomes so useful
basically it filters the flux of blue
light emitted by your phone or tablet
and protect your eyes with a soft and
pleasant red filter it's also proven to
help you go to sleep much faster but
there's a ton of information on
this and I'll drop a link to the article
below if you guys want to read more on
how blue light damages your eyes gee
tasks is something I use often as well
since I don't like the stock calendar
app on the s7 in my opinion there's too
much cluster with this app I can easily
view all of my tasks or reminders on the
same page and creating a new one just
takes seconds and finally the game I'm
super addicted to is supercells newest
game clash royale where you basically
send units to destroy the opponent's
towers you build your deck of cards from
defeating opponents and opening chests
and you summon them using elixir to the
battlefield
each tower you destroy gets you one
crown and the feeling the King's tower
automatically wins you the game I was so
addicted that I actually bought $300
worth of gems and then I lost it all
because the game decided it would be a
great idea to log into an account to
save my progress well it turns out a
completely restored everything and I
lost all of the gems I bought customer
service as always wasn't helpful and it
felt like talking to a robot you know
it's times like these I wish I can talk
to someone directly and get the
situation resolved right then and there
sending emails and messages always takes
forever and it's extremely frustrating
but you know what there are services out
there like that that can provide direct
customer service and one of them is
called Citrix concierge as a developer
you can implement concierge into your
app directly connect with your users
they have features like Live Chat screen
sharing and they can even draw on the
screen to help you with whatever it is
you need
I honestly wish that all apps had this
feature so if you're an app developer
out there I strongly recommend you check
this out and maybe even implement this
feature into the app that you're
designing I know that your users and
customers will thank you but I'll go to
drop a link down below if anyone's
interested in signing up for free I
think they do have a free trial so let's
give it a shot but I will do it for the
video thank you guys so much for
watching as always if you enjoyed it
make sure to leave a like and I'll see
you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
