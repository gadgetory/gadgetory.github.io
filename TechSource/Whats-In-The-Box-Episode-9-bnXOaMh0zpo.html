episode of what's the goddamn box let's
not waste any more time and dive right

forgetting to talk about my peel box and
I do have one open actually since like
six months ago I'll drop my p.o box info
down below in case you guys when I send
me some mail if I do get any mail from
you guys I'll be unboxing them in these
videos
what is I don't even know what the hell
this is
looks like Packaging envelope for some
reason I don't even know why they sent
this to me but I'll take it Thank You
USPS all right moving on to the other
envelope aha
these are from the brand if you guys
remember last episode they sent me the
wrong skins well they went in to correct
a bad mistake so thank you dear ands you
guys are awesome gonna be featuring this
in a very very special episode let's
change things up a bit now gonna move on
to the right side more stuff from USPS
caution heavy thirty-five pounds and
over well then I think this is gonna be
a very boring episode apologies in
advance
alright give us some good stuff please
new egg there we go now we're talking
alright so we got a wireless void gaming
headset from you egg I actually ordered
this myself it's gonna be in a very
special video coming up very soon I
can't tell you what it is honestly I
can't tell you what it is because it
will ruin the surprise
alright we got two small packages from
the same place from mark toys this looks
like a gaming mouse black and red gaming
mouse don't know who sends that okay so
on this one we have another gaming mouse
looks like it's the same thing or maybe
not and a gaming mouse this looks like a
pretty sweet gaming mouse actually check
that out alright it's going to finish
off the left side from new egg once
again
oh you've got a motherboard I did not
order this Oh looks like there's a note
dear ad I sent this z170 FTW to you
because I heard the one you got was
defective and you couldn't send it back
I hope you can use this one an upcoming
build since you love the VGA parts so
much thank you so much for that thank
you so much for the amazing tech content
that you upload consistently I literally
come home from school every day excited
to watch your videos keep Apple I'll
keep up the amazing work and congrats on
800k all the best Manny what you
seriously sent me a motherboard dude how
they say first and foremost thank you so
much for sending this and it's the
thought that counts Manny but
unfortunately I cannot accept this gift
obviously you're going to school so I'm
pretty sure you need the money so I'm
going to send this back and hopefully
you can use the money towards to your
tuition or maybe buy books or maybe just
go to the strip club or something
but thank you so much for setting this
in and this is for everyone else you
guys please don't send me any PC parts I
am drowning in PC parts but honestly
this means a lot thank you so much for
watching my videos I cannot accept this
gift I'm gonna be sending this back to
you but thank you so much Manny again
this means a lot and yes I'm a huge fan
of EVGA so you must be watching for a
while
Thank You Manny
that's what I'm talking about this is
the z170 and the gaming 5 motherboard
this is actually the last piece I need
for my mini ITX build coming in
September so I was actually waiting for
this bad boy
for over a week now check this out a
very tiny and cute yet powerful
motherboard I cannot wait to test this
baby out this is actually the first
gigabyte motherboard I'm actually using
and when my builds so I'm very excited
for that thank you goodbye
for sending this over to more boxes yes
yes the audio technica ath m50x is wide
edition and I'm pretty sure you guys are
figured out at this point what those V
brand skins were for so yeah again this
is going into that special video I
cannot tell you what it is but I promise
you it's gonna be one of the best videos
on the channel last but not least this
is actually a very short episode so this
looks like a laptop cooling stand looks
like this is coming from all the same
company that sent the mouse pads and the
mouse so again not really sure why they
sent this so I'm gonna have to dig
through some emails and figure it out
but yeah but yeah it's pretty much it
for the video I hope you guys enjoyed it
it was a very short one but nonetheless
if you enjoy these videos as always make
sure to leave a like so I can continue
to do these maybe once a week or once
every other week but any whose thank you
again as always for watching you guys I
love you and I will see you in the next
