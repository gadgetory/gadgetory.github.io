Squarespace the one tool needed to

ten percent off so CES 2014 is over and
there were a lot of products that we did
not get a chance to see mainly because
it was our first time there there were a
lot of cool stuff at the event so I'm
just gonna go over the three products
that I thought were the most interesting
first up is the announcement of
PlayStation now from Sony with
PlayStation now you'll be able to stream
popular hits and classic games from the
ps3 library they'll be first available
on the ps4 and ps3 systems followed by
the PS Vita in addition to the
PlayStation platforms most 2014 US
models of Sony's bravia TV lineup will
support PlayStation now as well
eventually the service will expand
beyond PlayStation platforms and Sony
devices allowing you to scream
PlayStation games across a broad range
of interconnected devices always play
the most updated version of your game
with games hosted in the cloud you can
take your game with you anywhere you go
just simply log in with your sony
entertainment that would account on a
compatible device in your games &amp;amp; save
progress will be easily available
PlayStation I will begin a better
program in the US at the end of January
what an expected full rollout in the US
this summer another interesting thing
that got announced was the pebble steel
this year is a SmartWatch it's basically
a device that connects to your
smartphone and displays key information
like caller ID emails and other
notifications and it could also want a
ride variety of pebble apps it's
compatible with both iOS and Android
with the battery lasting up to a week
the plastic shell and banned from the
original pebble have been replaced with
CNC machine Chessie's and gorilla glass
protector display whether you choose a
brush stainless steel or black matte
finish the pebble steel will be paired
with matching metal band and black
leather straps functionality between
pebble steel and the original pebble is
identical the only the vonage that the
pebble steel has is a boost of internal
storage which allows you to install
roughly double the number of
applications pebble still carries a
price tag of 249 making it a hundred
dollars more than the original and fifty
dollars less than the Samsung Galaxy
gear the first batch of pebble steel
smartwatches will ship
January 28 lastly razor and build
something cool at CES as well they
called it project christine what you're
looking at is a pc with a completely
different concept instead of the
traditional tower set up with all your
components installed inside this was
created to make it much easier for
people to take advantage of pc
customizability so here's how it works
you choose any module on the fly whether
it's the cpu memory graphics card or
power supply and you simply plug it in
the pci express architecture of the
project christine automatically syncs
the components together each sealed
module is entirely self-contained and
features active liquid cooling and noise
cancellation this unit here is actually
dummy they have the real thing at their
offices back in California razor and
build it at CES to see how people would
react to it before they go ahead and
start with the production the challenge
is being able to convince companies like
Intel and AMD to support the idea and
have them make custom parts for the PC
they want to have the proof that people
are interested so they can show those
companies that there will be demand
anyways that wraps up the top three
items that we thought were the most
interesting at CES this year if you guys
