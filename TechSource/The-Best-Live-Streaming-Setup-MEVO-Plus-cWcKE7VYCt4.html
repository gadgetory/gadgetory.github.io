guys saw a glimpse of in the intro using
this the Mevo plus which is a camera
that offers live editing while streaming
the nivo plus can record up to 4k on the
internal SD card or stream up to 1080p
and you can do this anywhere over Wi-Fi
or LTE so let's take a quick look around
the Mieville plus and the front is the
150 degree all glass lens that's
covering the sony 4k 12 megapixel sensor
and right below that is the microphone
which actually sounds really good taking
a look at the back you will find a
microUSB charging port and the SD card
slot the amiibo plus by itself will give
you around an hour of screaming time on
a full battery however I strongly
recommend picking up the meebo boost if
you're considering buying this because
it will add an additional 10 hours of
screaming time there's actually several
accessories that you can purchase
separately that will complement the
amiibo plus like this hard shell
carrying case and a portable mic stand
with an adjustable mount to give you
that perfect angle but anyways back to
the amiibo boost this is essentially a
battery pack for the amiibo plus and
what makes this so cool is that it
doubles as a power bank that you can use
to charge your phone or device under the
flap you'll find an Ethernet port and
USB which can be used to hook up an
external audio device and the micro USB
charging port so what makes them Evo
plus so unique is actually in the app
itself not only do you have the ability
to edit the video but you can do it
while streaming live you can pinch the
screen to zoom in or out you can drag
focus point anywhere on the screen to
pan or simply tap on the focus points to
do a quick cut you can also check on all
the focus points by tapping on the six
squares on the bottom right of the app
up to eight focus points plus the
default wide view you can even have the
camera follow someone so that they don't
go out of frame which is pretty cool as
I mentioned before you can stream up to
1080p at 30fps unfortunately you
can't scream in 4k just yet but you can
record it directly into the SD card you
know I see the memo plus being useful
for a lot of people someone who likes to
broadcast themselves to their audience
large or small and someone who likes to
just stream live events for example a
podcast right you can set up the me Bo
plus on a tripod setup different focus
points on each of the hosts and quickly
pan and cut to each one of them those
are just one of the many scenarios that
you can use amiibo plus now if I were to
use this in my personal life I would
hands down use it to livestream PC
builds I think that it would be a really
cool way to interact with my viewers I
can answer you guys questions like we
can talk about life whatever it is while
I'm building a PC and I think that would
be really entertaining I can see this
being a game changer in the streaming
world because of what it offers the
ability to edit during the stream is
innovative and would be interesting to
see how people would use this in their
lives and that pretty much wraps up my
video and first look at the amiibo plus
I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did
tossing a like would be awesome I'll
drop a link to it down below if you want
to check it out and just for my
