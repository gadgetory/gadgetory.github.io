bringing back over price tag so we
better smack the crap out of that like
button because episode 4 might be in
2019 if you don't I'm just kidding guys
what's up aside from tax sores and
welcome to overpriced tech episode 3 if
you guys come across any overpriced tech
while shopping or looking at an article
please feel free to tweet at me or post
the link to the comment section down
below and you might see it in the next
episode alright so the first piece of
tech I came across while shopping on
Amazon was this beautiful CAD
workstation PC it's got the 12 cores 79
20 X 128 gigabytes of RAM a 12 terabyte
hard drive and the PNY Quadro p6000
which costs almost five thousand dollars
by itself so naturally I put together
the exact same parts list and it came
out to a little under eighty three
hundred dollars
this guy is charging an extra thirty six
hundred dollars for this overpriced
piece of scrap metal and you know what
infuriates me the most it's not even
about how overpriced this is this guy
put in the slowest RAM possible any CAD
workstation in what world would you
think that 2400 megahertz is enough for
a CAD workstation desktop why couldn't
you go with at least 32 hundred
megahertz I mean it wouldn't have cost
that much more you're not even using ECC
memory for the love of God and to top it
all off guys get this this PC has a 120
millimeter radiator that's cooling the
unlocked ex
processor oh my god CPU fan Corsair
water cooler damn that sounds so good I
mean your CPU will be fried after a week
of editing why would you go with an X
processor with a 120 millimeter fan at a
man's computers if you're watching this
video please please just subscribe to my
channel and watch a few my videos I
think it will help you out a ton I sold
my balls to buy this totally worth it
okay first of all who would spend over
10 grand buying a pair of balls that
alone is overpriced guys please just
promise me you'll never buy a prebuilt
PC off of Amazon
unless it's a reputable company like
NZXT iBUYPOWER or coarser there's a lot
of people who buy the parts and build it
on PCs overprice it and then they sell
it to you but you guys have no support
whatsoever once it gets to you no
warranty issue so if it breaks down
you're pretty much screwed so stay away
from pre-built pcs on Amazon next up is
the so bro a coffee table with a
built-in refrigerator Bluetooth speakers
LED lights and charging ports it's going
for fifteen hundred dollars but is it
actually worth it I'm not gonna lie at
first glance it actually looks like a
pretty cool concept having a coffee
table that can charge your phones and
keep things cool but $1,500 this is such
a good example of how lazy people have
gone I mean why can't you just walk 20
feet into the kitchen and grab your own
damn drinks also if I'm gonna be
spending $1,500 why not have wireless
charging built-in or at least give us
the option to upgrade I mean if you can
add touchscreen controls to the damp
surface I'm sure wireless charging would
have been an easy add even this guy in
the comment section agrees by the way
have you guys noticed that the actual
cable is missing from the table you have
to keep in mind that you're gonna have
this giant black cable running across
your living room and into a power outlet
assuming you're not gonna drill a hole
in your rug and run it underneath I mean
who the hell wants to do that here's an
alternative for you guys how about you
buy a good-looking piece of furniture
which is gonna cost you around one third
of the actual price and add in a
Bluetooth speaker some LED lights and a
power bank not only will you have a
giant cable running across your floor
but you also save a crap ton of money
well it might be expensive but at least
it's hideous why what a joke yeah but
does it play pong what oh you want pong
on a coffee table anyways if you're
still watching this video and your
eyeballs haven't left your skull then
check this one out guys introducing the
Aero dream one speaker doc from Jarrod
technologies it's made for the iPod
iPhone and iPad and it's only gonna cost
you a measly five hundred sixty thousand
dollars it's 11 foot tall and it's
covered in Chrome but don't worry guys
if chrome does not match the decor in
your mansion you can get it in white or
black I mean that's awesome that they
give you options to choose from
apparently it weighs more than eight
hundred seventy pounds and each one is
custom-made which takes up to 6 months
for delivery and get this guy's it even
comes with its matching colored ladder
so this is supposed to fill your entire
home with sound and honestly with that
price it better give me a bomb-ass
massage and an orgasm at the same time
you can buy two hurricanes or two
roadsters hell you even buy a nice home
in LA with that price can you please
just stop and take a second to realize
that this is a duck created only for
iPod iPhone and iPad every other tablet
and phone is pretty much left out I mean
Jesus Christ if it's gonna cost more
than half a million why not just build a
badass speaker system instead why on
earth would you need to walk towards the
dock climb the ladder
put your smartphone on there which you
can't even access once you climb back
down just to play music I mean just make
any sense oh okay that's why it's so
expensive how can I be so stupid
you get two free jean-michele jer
concert tickets oh my god now makes
sense three meters of that's
probably the most accurate description
I've seen and finally the most
overpriced tech on this list has to be
razors and I'm not talking about this
razor that will be in a different
episode I'm talking about these things
you have to pay upwards of 20 $30 on a
pack plus the price of the handle I
don't know why people pay so much for
these it just makes no sense I mean at
this point I'm sure people have heard of
Dollar Shave Club I've been using these
guys the past three years now way before
they even reached out to sponsor this
video I get a perfect shape every single
time and I'm just a huge fan of the
quality of their products thankfully
though I've been avoiding headaches
while saving money at the same time the
past three years I would always drive to
the store hustling trying to find
someone to unlock that damn section for
the razors and then I would pay
ridiculous prices just for like three or
four of them I am so over that luckily
Dollar Shave Club is now offering
starter kits and they said over there
shave and shower kit which includes an
executive razor with four cartridges and
some extras like shave butter body
cleanser and a few one wipe Charlies you
get all of these on the first month for
only $5 and
shipping I don't know what they put in
their butt wipes but these things smell
so good guys like I want to go use the
toilet right now just so I can use these
Oh Lord anyways just stop overpaying for
razors guys and sign up with the Dollar
Shave Club you won't regret it the shave
and shower kit is an awesome deal and
you can get the first month for only $5
with Free Shipping so make sure to visit
dollarshaveclub.com slash tech source or
click on the link below alright I think
that's enough overpriced junk for one
episode if you guys enjoy the series and
want me to continue and you excited
about episode 4 let me know by dropping
a like and if you didn't like the series
please leave it this like with your
criticism down below as always if you
guys come across any overpriced tech
whether you're on ship you're shopping
on Amazon or you're reading some
articles make sure to drop a link to
that in the comment section below so I
can check it out and maybe feature it in
the next episode then you guys so much
watching I love your faces and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
