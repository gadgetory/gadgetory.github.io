and I'm excited to bring you guys an
overview of math drops new pair of
headphones these Sennheiser HD 6 XX the
reason why I'm so excited to do this
video is because these headphones are
going to change the game in terms of
price to performance in the audiophile
industry so these are a variation of the
extremely popular Sennheiser HD 650 s
which is considered to be the Holy Grail
in terms of professional headphones in
fact there hasn't been any major
technical or aesthetic changes made to
the headphones since it was originally
released about 20 years ago guys and
this is the first time ever that any
major revisions are being made now the
classic HD 650 s range anywhere from
three to five hundred dollars but mass
drop is letting their version go for
only $200 guys which is unbelievable
price for the headphones of this caliber
so the master of variation will feature
no changes to the sound signature all
the changes are based on aesthetics or
utility the adjusted is a 10 feet cable
down to 6 feet so it's more manageable
they've also changed the quarter inch
jack to be an eighth inch so that way
the headphones can be plugged into a
phone or laptop however an adapter to
convert it into a quarter inch jack will
also be included for audiophile
enthusiasts who prefer to use a DAC or
amp in my case I plugged these straight
into my audio interface these are
extremely comfortable to wear the fact
that they're really light makes you
forget that you're wearing anything
after just a few minutes the headband
area has plenty of cushion for the top
of your head and the ear cups are made
out of velar which warmed up my ear
quite a bit I mean we are getting it to
winter over here and the weather is kind
of cold so it didn't bother me that much
but I would imagine wearing these in the
summer would be somewhat uncomfortable
but thankfully there are replacement
here cuffs on Amazon to combat this and
I'll drop a link to something down below
the build quality is also really good
then again I didn't expect anything less
from Sennheiser most of it is plastic
but you get aluminum sliders and it's
pretty flexible for the most part the
ear cups do pivot and rotate very
slightly but it's enough to get that
perfect fit over your ears one thing I
did notice was the clamping force they
don't stretch out too far and I feel
like they did this on purpose to get
that nice and snug
fit however after a few minutes I don't
really feel that constant pressure and
of course after a while they will loosen
up after you start breaking them in now
let's talk about the sound first off
these are open back reference style
headphones which means that you don't
get any noise isolation and there will
be plenty of noise leak after all these
are professional-grade headphones I mean
I wouldn't take them to hiking or to the
gym or even quiet spaces like libraries
unless you want everyone to hear what
you're listening to the sound quality on
these are amazing to say the least all
the notes are very clear and you hear
everything so it's playing clash royale
using these headphones just to hear what
it sounds like on a phone and let me
tell you guys I can hear some of the
music from the background that I haven't
even heard before the amount of detail
you can hear with these are insane
and that's one of the reasons why these
are so good for audio monitoring now if
you guys are looking for heavy bass
headphones then these are definitely not
it
but don't get me wrong the bass on these
are incredible I don't think they're too
overpowering in my opinion I would say
that they are perfectly balanced do
overall soundstage is really great on
these headphones and I would recommend
these for monitoring audio listening to
music and even gaming and watching
videos I would say that these are all
around solid headphones so guys
unfortunately I'm gonna be swapping my
Audio Technica m50 X's with these now
it's kind of suck because I'm gonna miss
the deep band skins and the overall
really cool looking headphones but in
the end I am going for what gives the
best quality and these are obviously it
so I'm gonna be editing my videos now
using these headphones the band if
you're watching this video please please
make skins for these so that is it for
the video I'll leave a link down below
in case you guys want to check these out
you won't find them anywhere else with
this incredible price this is only a
mass drop exclusive product so once
again I'll drop a link if you guys want
to check it out thank you guys so much
for watching I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
