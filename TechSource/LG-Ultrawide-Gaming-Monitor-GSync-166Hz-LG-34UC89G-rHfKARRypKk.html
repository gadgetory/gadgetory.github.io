spreading like wildfire with so many
options to choose from nowadays you can
really get a headache while shopping
there's basically an ultra wide monitor
for everyone there's one for budget
gaming there's one for high-end gaming
even for productivity but a bunch of
different sizes resolutions and a
plethora of features I'm actually
thinking about doing a buying guide for
ultra Lite monitors and that's something
you guys are interested in seeing let me
know in the comments section because I
do have some experience in ultra Lites
but in this video we'll be focusing on
the new LG 34 you see 89 G gaming
monitor which is the bigger brother of
the UC 79 G that I reviewed last year as
always I'll be showing the things I like
and don't like about this monitor so
make sure you guys stick around to the
end so this is targeted for serious
gamers out there with a higher budget
because it does fall short under $1,000
what do you get a return is a dirty four
inch curved IPS panel with a resolution
of 2560 by 1440 P honestly though for
this price point I expected quite HD a
resolution of 34 40 by 1440 P would have
been nice to add to sweeten the deal but
it does have 844 Hertz refresh rate and
gsync which is nice I do want to note
that I was even able to overclock it to
166 Hertz
using the Nvidia control panel and holy
cow guys this thing is extremely snappy
keep in mind that I'm coming from 60
Hertz so the difference is night and day
I even under clocked it back to 144
Hertz just to see if there is a
difference and even though it's very
miniscule I can definitely feel it and
if you're competitive gamer out there
every single refresh rate counts also do
keep in mind that this is the only 34
inch ultra wide curved monitor that can
achieve 866 Hertz with fresh waves so LG
already has the upper-hand in the market
so the design of the waterer is
identical to there you see 79 G by the
way the guys missed that video I'll drop
a link to it below you get an old
plastic build throughout the frame with
a detachable base which doesn't require
any tools to install that's always been
one of my favorite things about LG
monitors if you don't want to use the
base you can use the four included
screws in the
back and hook it up to either a wall
mount or a VESA compatible spend
obviously I'm a huge fan of the color
scheme his mostly black with red accents
near the base and in the back which is
kind of pointless if you ask me nobody
really gets to see the back of the
monitors so I feel like the awesome
design was kind of wasted LG does
provide a cable clip near the back for
cable management along with a smaller
clip that acts as the Mouse bungee I
personally didn't find a use for it
since I'm using a wireless mouse but
it's definitely a nice little bonus for
people that use a wired connection you
get the standard heights and tilt like
most monitors and a few degrees to pivot
the base isn't as sturdy as I would have
liked so if you're an aggressive type ER
and have a very thin or flimsy desk then
you might notice your screen wobble a
bit while you type however from my time
of use I had no problems with its
shaking so it honestly just depends on a
user and the type of desk they are using
it doesn't have built-in speakers so the
only thing down here is the joystick
which gives you access to the menu
pretty straightforward stuff so you can
enable g-sync
at crosshairs overclock your monitor and
this one's pretty cool you can even
enable quick charge so that you can
charge a compatible smartphone twice as
fast using these blue USB ports aside
from that you also get an HDMI display
in a usb up port so let's talk about a
display for a bit
it has a 2560 by 1080 P resolution so
it's not going to be very demanding on
your GPU I also notice that the curve
isn't aggressive at all in fact it
almost looks flat to be honest I didn't
feel any type of emergence itting in
front of it the curve is definitely more
noticeable on my 38 you see 99 the
viewing angles however are very nice
it's crisp
no matter the angle you're viewing from
and the colors remain consistent edge to
edge I also notice that as a mask
coating so the constantly sitting next
to a window then you're going to like
this monitor I'm a huge fan of the super
thin bezels they actually made them
thinner by a few millimeters compared to
the one I'm using right now I didn't
notice any light bleeding I mean there's
a tiny bit near the top left but it's
nothing major and you won't really
notice it unless you're really looking
hard LG has definitely come a long way
with their quality checks the monitor
also has srgb over 99% making it the
perfect ultra wide for both gaming and
productivity
speaking of gaming guys
this is incredible I honestly couldn't
get enough it's crazy how snappy
everything is there is no lag there is
no stutter and the response to
everything I press is lightning fast so
a fun fact guys I was actually supposed
to play battlegrounds for about a minute
just to capture enough b-roll for the
video but I actually ended up enjoying
it so much because of the super fast
refresh rate that I ended up playing the
full game now I don't know if this is
just me but playing on a higher refresh
rate runner is a lot more fun and
addicting but let me know if that's the
same for you guys as well by dropping
your feedback in the comment section
I mean I would have loved to see a
higher resolution given the price point
and I would have preferred a more
aggressive curve to really get that
immersive experience that I get on my
other ultralight but those are more
personal preferences really so here's
the part where I talk about the things
that I didn't like about the monitor and
honestly the list is really short
because there aren't a lot of things
that I didn't like so there only a few
negatives about this monitor the first
one being it doesn't have built-in
speakers which I'm sure a lot of people
don't even care about I also got a 5
millisecond response time instead of one
and finally the resolution like I talked
about before it's a bit of a pricey side
but you do get what you pay for
unfortunately g-sync is not cheap it's
LG only bumped a resolution 2 quad HD
then this ultrawide monitor would have
been the best in the market right now
unfortunately for me I think I'm going
to stick with my UC 99 because the
screen real-estate is amazing and I'm in
love with my giant ultra light as much
as I love gaming on the UC 89 the
resolution was a deal-breaker for me
after all I am a content creator first
and a gamer second but if you guys have
the money a decent GTX travers card and
you don't have an ultra wide monitor I
recommend taking one up to jump on the
ultra light training but if you guys
already have an ultra wide gaming
monitor but at least 800 Hertz refresh
rate I would honestly save your money
and wait six months to a year to see
what comes up next because I feel like
the next one up is going to be a higher
resolution we are literally at the peak
of all gaming ultra wide monitors if
they do come out with one with the same
specs and a higher resolution that's
definitely what I'm gonna be picking up
for myself as well but anyways I hope
you guys enjoyed the video I'll drop a
link tomorrow
down below in case you guys want to
check it out if you enjoy the video
filthy to leave a like and if you didn't
feel get a dislike as well thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
