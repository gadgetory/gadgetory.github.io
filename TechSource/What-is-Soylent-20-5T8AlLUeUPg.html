today we are doing a different type of
video something I've never done in a
channel before so essentially soil in
2.0 is an entire meal in one bottle you
can basically use this to replace any
meal one of the best things about this
is that it doesn't need to be
refrigerated so let's say you're going
to work or you're going to invent or
travel a lot instead of bringing your
food with you you can just pack this in
your bag and you are good to go
it also has a bunch of nutrients you
have your vitamin A calcium vitamin D K
b6 b12 and the list goes on and on but
the most important thing about this to
me personally is the fact that it's not
made out of animal products and
specifically dairy I don't know if you
guys know this but I actually went vegan
about two months ago so finding a meal
replacement is definitely difficult for
vegans so I'm actually glad Soylent
reached out and wanted to do a video
with me otherwise I would have never
heard of these guys in terms of
nutrition facts this entire bottle will
have 400 calories and from that you have
21 grams of fat there is some grams of
carbs and 20 grams of protein please
keep in mind that this isn't a weight
loss product or a dietary supplement
because of the high amount of calories
and total fat now if you had a bulk and
if you're working out then I think this
is a solid product to add to your diet
especially if you want a quick meal in
terms of actual taste it's a lot like
soy milk and it doesn't taste bad if I
would say soy milk tastes like a 10 this
would be a nine and it's actually it's a
little creamy but it goes down really
smooth and to be honest it's kind of
bland but I mean at the end it is a soy
based product and here's what it looks
like pour some in a bowl
definitely tastes a lot better when it's
cold and that's for sure so after gingy
an entire bottle of this I actually felt
full and satisfied as opposed to just
full and I know that makes zero sense
but I've tried other meal replacement
drinks and it just gave me the feeling
of being full like I know I was full I
couldn't drink or anything else but I
wasn't really satisfied that makes any
sense but drink this you also get a
sense of satisfaction at least to me it
does so yeah I thought that would be
interesting to point out as well but
that's basically that's all I wanted to
talk to you guys about today I just come
in a box of 12 just like this you can do
a monthly subscription and decide how
many boxes you guys want but if you're
interested you want to give us a shot
there is a link below you guys can check
out and for my subscribers you guys
actually get 50% off your first box so
anyways give it a shot if you guys want
then you guys so much for watching as
always and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
