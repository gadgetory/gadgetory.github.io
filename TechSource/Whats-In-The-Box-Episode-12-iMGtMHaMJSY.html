welcome to another episode of what's in
the box
I think run episode 12 I'm not really
sure but today's a very special episode
and that's because I have a very special
package which isn't on the desk yet it's
actually on the side because it's a
little too big for the desk so let's go
ahead and get rid of these boxes and
then we can go in and unbox the grand
finale alright so this first box is from
Kingston and these guys ship really
really quickly it's only been a few days
and they're already sent their package
so this is going in the upcoming build
actually the build I'm working on on
Monday which is in a few days we have a
kingston 480 gigabyte predator this is
an m2 SSD which is going in the build
and not one or two but three SSDs also I
think 480 gig up for 80 gig HyperX
savage SSDs that are going in raid 0 in
the build as well very very excited as
you can tell it's gonna be a black and
red build of course got to represent my
colors even though I'm wearing blue but
whatever moving on to this next one
we have one two-way SLI bridge from EVGA
if I can get this thing out of here and
a thousand watt power supply from EVGA
as well which tells me this box is also
from EVGA because it came from the same
warehouse you have a black box that has
nothing on there okay okay
and another blank box that is weird it
says nothing on here just says EVGA oh
this is the graphics card why is it
packaged like this what's in here this
is an interesting packaging I guess it's
for I guess this is how review samples
are sent not only sure so guys this is
the z170 classified motherboard and this
is a very special but I keep saying that
it's a very special project all projects
are special to me in a way but this is
going to be I'm not gonna tell you I
can't tell you it can't I can't ruin the
surprise I'm sorry but yeah this is a
very very good-looking motherboard and I
cannot wait to do to do a build in this
so what graph is car did they send me I
wonder what do you guys think is inside
this box let me know your predictions
down below you probably are wrong but
let's open this up and find out
I've never seen this packaging before
this is seriously the first time whoa
whoa if you guys guessed the 1080
superclocked then you received some
internet points what you guys just love
the smell of fresh GPU so this is going
inside the motherboard of course I'm
sure you guys have already noticed and
the sli bridge actually one sec so here
is the second one that was sent with the
iBUYPOWER pc I took it up and I popped
in the MSI graphics card instead but
these two babies are going in the
motherboard actually it's going to test
it out right now and see if the SLI
bridge will fit because sometimes the
slot differences or the gap between the
slots does not work out so let's try it
out whoa this is way too long that's
what she said yeah too long so here are
the two cards and here is the SLI bridge
as you can tell it's too long here the
first connector is over here and the
second one is all the way down here so
yeah I'm gonna have to find a way to get
a shorter one because this is on to plan
B so guys this is the final piece I need
to begin my build
remember I was telling you I was waiting
for some cables last episode well they
are here
black and red custom sleeved full cables
these are not extensions from any source
mods these guys do such an amazing job
at these cables that is why I keep
coming back to these guys because no
other cable company matches the level of
quality that these guys are that these
guys have so yeah a bunch of black and
white cables I cannot wait to start this
bill that it's going to be one of the
best on the channel two more boxes to go
before we jump into the main or grand
finale
so these are parts I ordered for my 500
dollar budget bill for October and this
is the one that's gonna have a build
guide as well guys so yeah a lot of you
have been asking me to do another
version of Ice Cube and this is it this
is going to be called black cube or a
dark dark hue back sure that's what it's
gonna be called so can't wait to do a
build on this and show you guys the
build process so you can build one for
yourselves if you want to
it looks like the GPUs have arrived so
I'm sure I talked about this on the last
episode as well this is going in the
candid PC giveaway winners most of the
parts arrived last episode and I think
these are the final pieces actually I'm
still waiting on the cases and then I
can ship out these parts so these are
the GPUs that are going in there are x4
70 from MSI once again congratulations
you lucky bastards and now for the
moments that we have been waiting for
actually that I've been waiting for
let's get straight into it so I wonder
if anybody actually guessed what's
inside this box I bet you my channel
that none of you guys got it correct so
let's go and open this up
oh my god it's right side up ladies and
gentlemen the brand-new NZXT s340 elite
case that I've been waiting for for a
long time I really want to do a build on
this guys but unfortunately I am booked
for all of October but expect a very
very sexy build sometime in November so
this is pretty much like their previous
s340 case but this time they have a full
tempered glass side panel as you can see
there is nothing covering the side which
is awesome and then there's also a hook
in the front that you can attach it is
optional and it's basically a place
where you can hook up your VR headset
now obviously there are some other cool
features that come with the case expect
my video on it sometime next month one
of the features is an option to expand
USB 2.0 ports I think you guys get three
internal and two external as well and
you do get two different color options
you have the old black that you see here
and then a black and white and also a
black and red but I'll drop a link to
the case down below if you guys want to
check it out honestly I've been waiting
for NZXT to do something like this ever
since I saw the iBUYPOWER
element case so props to you NZXT for
listening to your customers as always
that will do it for this video thank you
guys so much for watching I honestly
appreciate the likes you guys have been
dropping on these videos it shows
tremendous support and I love every
single one of you guys so thank you so
much again for watching if you enjoy the
video make sure to leave a like and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
