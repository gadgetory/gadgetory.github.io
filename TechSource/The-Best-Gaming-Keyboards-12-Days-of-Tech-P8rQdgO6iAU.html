welcome to day two of 12 days of tech
where each day I feature a category of
tech all the way till Christmas this
episode we'll be focusing on keyboards
ranging from budget to high-end as
always if you guys missed the first
episode which we covered monitors I'll
have it linked down below let's begin
kicking out the show we have some
extremely budget gaming keyboards with
membrane switches so first up is the
popular red dragon Karura that features
seven different back lift colors for
brightness levels and a full 10 keypad I
like that it comes with a wrist pad and
the keys itself are very flat so the
travel distance is kept short for quick
reactions and gaming for only $23 you
can't go wrong if you're on a tight
budget the DB power a8 is a dollar more
however this will give you more
mechanical feeling even though the
switches are membrane you get 19
non-conflict Keys removable key caps and
a tactile feedback the downside is that
you only get three color options that
include purple red and blue but they do
come with an optional breathing mode as
well but if you're set up as imagine a
vouz colors then this is probably a
deal-breaker venturing into mechanical
keyboards the velocity v vm zero one
comes with brown switches and a full
keypad for only 40 bucks
the downside however is that you only
get a turquoise backlit option with five
different modes that include breathing
fading and a few others
now the eagletech is a bit better
because you get to choose which color
you want to go with the black with blue
lighting or silver and white with blue
lighting as well which is actually my
personal favorite they do offer a
rainbow version as well but it's eight
dollars more and I'm honestly not a big
fan of those multi color keyboards
anyways but that option is there if
anyone is interested so HyperX has made
a few keyboards in the past but nothing
really yet stood out to gamers not until
they recently released the HyperX alloy
which is currently going for a solid
hundred dollars you get a very compact
form factor with cherry blues and red
backlighting you don't get any extra
bells and whistles like media controls
wrist pad or even full RGB lighting but
if you're only looking for a solid
gaming keyboard for $100 that gets the
job done then this is it sticking with
high-end gaming keyboards the Logitech
RGB GH 10 is next up for being a very
solid keyboard around $100
it's actually currently on sale for $50
off so the g8 ten is well known for
having a minimalistic design while being
packed with awesome features so this
keyboard features logitech's romaji
switches which aren't as squishy as
cherries various switches but the main
selling point for this keyboard is the
technology it's set to have up to 25
percent faster key actuation than
standard mechanical switches combine
that with full customizable RGB
backlighting and you have a very solid
gaming keyboard no doubt Corsair has
made a name for themselves in the
keyboard Department as you have some of
the best keyboards out there my personal
favorite is the Corsair strafe RGB which
is curling the keyboard of choice that
I'm using right now the build quality
and design are one of the reasons that
separate these keyboards from the
competition it features a USB
pass-through full 100% anti-ghosting
keys and it even comes with a
comfortable detachable wrist rest if
either choose between this keyboard and
the Logitech G 810 it would definitely
be the slave RGB for those MMO or RPG
players out there that want macro keys
and the worldcat ryos is a very solid
choice the brown switches cost $110 so
if you want reds or even blues you're
gonna have to pay a bit extra you get
full media controls up top five macro
keys on the left side and a wide wrist
pad it also features two USB 2.0 ports
and both an audio in and out jack as
well this keyboard is packed with
features the only downside is that you
only get blue backlighting however they
do have an RGB version which costs $40
more and finally the last keyboard on
the list and the most expensive is the
SteelSeries apex M 800 for my ballers
out there this keyboard claims to be the
fastest mechanical keyboard on the
market and features competition grade
mechanical q s switches which lasts up
to 60 million clicks you also get six
dedicated macro keys media controls full
RGB lighting and two USB pass throughs
the only downside is that it doesn't
have a wrist pad and also the build
quality is a bit plasticky you would
think a keyboard $150 would be built a
little better maybe with some aluminum
but hey so that is it for day 2 as
always if there's a category you guys
want to see next let me know in the
comments section down below episode 3
will be on gaming mice again from budget
to high-end but if there's a different
category you
want to see let me know down below and
also if you guys enjoy this series let
me know by leaving a like it helps a ton
I love your faces and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
