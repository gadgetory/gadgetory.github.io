clear up from the last episode of setup
words first of all do you guys really
think that I don't know the difference
between pokémon and DBZ I was surprised
that how many people actually thought I
was serious when well play the clip
you'll see what I'm talking about let's
relax a little bit and check out his
gaming room it's obvious just by
glancing around he's a big fan of
Pokemon now there was a car model on a
setup and I called it a charger instead
of a Camaro I was dumb there because I
should have realized they're friends so
I'll take the heat for that but for the
pokémon and DBZ come on guys seriously
anyways I just wanted to clear that up
but anyways welcome to set up for is
episode 153 where you submit your desk
setup to get featured on the show if you

said that the Pokemon wars begin

link below if you're interested kicking
off the episode is email who was on the
show over a year ago from episode 104
which he actually ended up winning an
ultra-wide monitor from the LG
ultralight competition so congrats or
once again dude his setup actually
changed a lot since episode 104 and it
looks like he added a secondary setup on
the other wall but we'll get to that in
a bit so his main setup is still rocking
the custom-made desk with a backboard
and I just love how he kept everything
mounted against it and it looks so much
cleaner against the backboard than on
the actual surface of the desk I'm also
happy to see that he kept the ultra wide
from the competition instead of selling
it like some other people out there he's
also still using the K 55 keyboard in
the M 65 mouse which he drilled a hole
for some of the other stuff he has on
the desk or his surface pro 3 tablet we
got his phone and on the left side is a
tray holding his watches and some other
miscellaneous things like the remote for
the RGB strips the biggest addition to
the set up are those polk audio subs
which have been painted red and mounted
against the backboard
speaking of audio it looks like he's
added a pair of headphones to his
collection so now he has a total of
three hanging from the backboard and the
last thing hanging from the backboard is
the Beast PC which he upgraded since
last time he upgraded from an FX 8350 to
a risin 1700 X and even upgraded the GPU
from an aurochs 470 to a gtx 1080 he
also went from air cooled to a liquid
cooled system and the red carbon fiber
skins on the GPU and power supply are
also a nice touch but overall a very
solid upgrade from before so this entire
setup is actually used for productivity
mainly since he doesn't like gaming on
the ultra wide while the other setup is
for gaming that's rocking a 25 inch
Alienware monitor the coarser K 65
board and the logitech g930 much mounted
against the wall using a bracket and the
other side is being supported by a cubby
the audio setup is also pretty simple
he's using the corsair void gaming
headset and a blue yeti microphone now
the cool thing about this setup is that
it doesn't have a PC the monitor is
actually hooked up to the PC from the
main setup and the cable management is
excellent he used a wall Raceway to
route the cables towards the main setup
excellent job now since he has a giant
back board he can easily hide the cables
under there and I also like that he has
a set of cables ready for charging next
to the tablet last but not least we have
his console gaming setup on the other
side of his room and he pretty much uses
this to play on his xbox one X or the
ps4 slim which are both painted and red
to match the aesthetics of his other two
setups but he also uses it to screen
games and watch content he did build a
PC just for this setup as well and it's
packing the i-5 35 50 K and an EVGA GTX
1060 the PC is hooked up to his 50 inch
4k TV from Samsung and his other monitor
next to his bed
which i think is a clever modification
you can just chill in his bed while
watching videos it's very convenient the
awesome backboard and the fact that he's
using the same PC for two setups and
even small things like adding charging
ports inside his desk is what makes this
setup unique and stand out from the rest
email you have taken and already awesome
setup and you made it better with some
awesome upgrades excellent work and
thank you for entering Frankie all the
way from France is up next with a bowl
the triple monitor setup and he's got
quite the list of occupations he's a
geek father husband Archer gamer RC
biker and of course a tired man the
setups purpose is gaming home working
which he is a data center System
Architect and watching his new favorite
YouTube channel I'm guessing that's me
he's walking three 24-inch samsung
monitors that are hooked up against the
wall and at first glance I thought he
ran the cables through the wall but he
actually bundled up together
and hooked them to a parish tip behind
the monitor now he did run the power
strip cable through the wall and out
underneath the drawer where his PC is it
also looks like he routed the
Espie hub and the cables for both the
keyboard and mouse through the wall and
into the PC on the other side very clean
cable management speaking of the
keyboards and mouse he's using EGA 1000e
on keyboard and the G 300s Gaming Mouse
both from Logitech other than that he's
got two Gallardo models sitting on the
desk overall he kept the surface
organized and very minimal I do like
that he kept things symmetrical the wall
shelves are spaced out perfectly along
with the bookshelf speakers and the
skull in the middle holding the G 433
headset finally the PC powering the
setup is equipped with a rise in 1600 X
we got eight gigs of RAM and the
Sapphire r9 280 the setup kind of has a
dark side vibe to it but I liked that he
wasn't afraid to give it some contrast
by throwing in some white shelves and
the drawers overall it's a very clean
and straightforward triple monitor setup
Thank You Franky for entering speaking
of cleaning setups check out this
Assassin's Creed inspired set up by
johannes from norway now this setup is
mainly used for gaming however he does
use it for programming and school work
as well Oh fun fact by the way Johanna's
also won an ultra wide monitor from one
of my competitions and he still uses it
till today that's actually two people
who want ultra wide monitors from
previous competitions that are in the
same episode and I promised you guys
that this was not planned it just
happened so this is the 34 inch
um 69 G which has a 75 Hertz of fresh
rate 1 millisecond response time and an
AMD freesync it's always nice to see
that they kept the price and they're
still using it even till today now he
does have a side monitor from Ben Q
which is sitting on a custom riser and
speaking of custom work the riser is for
his desk are also custom made there are
3d printed cubes with the Assassin's
Creed logo on them the same logo can be
found on the front of his PC you guys
probably recall seeing something similar
from the Wolverine setup I did a few
years back and also season one of setup
makeover for peripherals he's using a
Logitech g7 10 plus keyboard and the MX
master 2 wireless mouse that custom
paint job on the keyboard with the
mixture of white and red key caps are
very nice and I just noticed that the
cutout he made on his mouse
for the Assassin's Creed logo that's
very clever Ferrario is rocking creative
inspire a 60 speakers and he logitech
g930 3 headset I definitely think that
Jonas did an excellent job on balancing
the colors over here
there isn't one collar that's dominant
and he spread it evenly across to set up
with great contrast another thing he did
great on is the cable management he's
using a signal rack but unlike most
people just tossing the wires on there
he actually kept it organized he also
used some cable clips to keep the wires
from hanging down and out of the USB hub
in the front for easy access the PC
powering all this has a 60 600 K an
interesting 24 gigs of ram and the msi
gtx 1070 although I don't agree with the
power supply orientation I do like the
backplate that he made and painted
himself for the GPU this is a really
nice assassin's creed inspired set up
and I think Joanna's did an excellent
job with the custom work and the color
scheme thank you for entering coming in
at number 4 is Julius from Poland and
his setup for programming gaming and
watching movies the massive wall mounted
desk was custom made by himself and it's
actually where his PC is is located on
the left side in his drawer if he ever
needs to swap parts out or clean it all
he has to do is pull it out talk about
convenience it's walking an AMD 78 50 K
and an old r7 series GPU
so it's a little outdated I'm actually
curious what games he's able to play
with these specs I do love the custom
hardware monitor display that he
installed in the drawer which is super
convenient and checking out the temps
but also adjusting it on the fly if he
ever needs to very nice now he is using
a single monitor however he does have a
55 inch OLED TV up top from LG that he
uses for watching videos and gaming on
its Xbox one X it looks like the only
audio source he has are the Edifier
speakers that are mounted on the wall
judging by the wireless keyboard and
mouse this setup is mostly used for
productivity and actually now that I
think about it I think he meant that he
uses this setup for console gaming and
not PC gaming which actually makes more
sense now cable management is pretty
much flawless
he did build a rack underneath the desk
which holds up all the cables and the
parish tips for the setup and keeps it
nice and hidden away from sight
a very nice custom-built setup by Julius
thank you for entering wrapping up the
episode is Nate and his black and red
setup that he uses for gaming screaming
and CAD Nate is also an avid watcher of
my channel and this setup was inspired
from watching set up wars over a year
now in fact here is the evolution from
his setup since the beginning as you
guys can see he made some nice upgrades
along the process so he's working two
different monitors that are mounted
against the desk and below that we got
the cursor k55 RGB keyboard and the
razer naga chroma mouse i'm actually
very glad that you drilled a hole in the
desk for cable management it looks very
clean
speaking of cable management he did an
excellent job across the setup the
routing is some of the cleanest I have
seen in a long time it looks very
organized and I could definitely tell
you spend some time on this he used a
bunch of cable clips to help with the
routing and even has a jhl raceway
holding up majority of the cables he
mounted a power strip and the power
brick for the monitor underneath here as
well even the cables behind the setup
and the PC are managed beautifully
overall fantastic job I'm very proud of
you Nate I especially loved the fact
that he took my advice from setup wars
and installed a pencil drawer underneath
the desk for additional storage great
choice for audio he's using a pair of
Logitech Z 333 speakers HyperX cloud 2
gaming headset that's hanging underneath
the desk and we also got a blue Yeti
microphone hooked up on the right side
of the desk for console gaming he does
have an Xbox one with a controller
charging stand however the system
powering the setup is a custom PC
equipped with a 7700 K 16 gigs of ram
and the almighty Strix 1080 from Asus I
do like the color scheme of the setup
it's mostly black with subtle red
accents which is what I actually prefer
I see a lot of black and red setups with
a 50/50 split between each color and I
honestly get tired of seeing it but I
think that Nate did an awesome job
keeping the red very minimum here of
course we can't ignore his love for
Funko pops he has an entire collection
on the top shelf dedicated to showing
them off alongside a few that are
scattered around his setup it always
makes me happy seeing awesome setups
like these that are inspired from set up
Wars
