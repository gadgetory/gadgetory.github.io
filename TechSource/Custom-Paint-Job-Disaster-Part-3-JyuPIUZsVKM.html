welcome to part three of my
water-cooling journey as you can see on
the table we have quite a few products
this time around so we got the case of
course the Lindley PC zero nine or oh
nine we got the motherboard from part
one which we put the CPU block RAM
sticks the m2 and of course part two of
the video we did the GPU blocks both of
these are set and ready to go in case
you guys missed those episodes I'll
leave them I'll leave the whole playlist
linked down below so make sure you guys
check it out but anyways out for this
episode I guess we're gonna try and put
the motherboard I'm gonna try we are
going to put the motherboard in the case
we're gonna put on the GPU blocks as
well and if I'm not dumb enough we can
put on the radiators the only problem
with this is the fans that were sent to
me were I'm just gonna be honest I'm
sorry that they're they're ugly as hell
these are the fans the static pressure
fans that I'm supposed to put on the
radiators I mean would you put this in
your case I'm just saying if I'm going
to do a water-cooled build or any PC on
my channel I got to make it stand out
that's the that's a signature of tech
stores these builds stand out so I reach
out to a few companies they're probably
gonna send me some LED fans to spice the
build up obviously I want some yellow in
it this is just black on black it
doesn't even look nice so yeah because
of that I may not even put the radiators
in the case so why don't I will see you
will see what happens
so the standoffs already on here so I
guess we can just place you know what
you gotta put the rival shield in first
so where is it
put the i/o shield on first and goes the
motherboard all right so now that the
motherboard is finally in the case let's
go ahead and put on the screws and
tighten them up real quick
all right so now that the motherboard is
secured these fans have to go now
because they are ugly which they are but
the other radiator has to go in this
place
so yeah let's take the support
I just realized I forgot to put on my IO
shield
I guess this can be officially my first
mistake
looking sexy so after putting on the GPU
blocks I kind of stop and just look at
the bill for a second and I realized you
know what there's not enough yellow in
this I mean look at it's only the RAM
sticks and of course the tubing as well
which I'm gonna be using yellow liquid
and then he got the cables so that this
majority of his build is black and I got
me thinking you know what I'm gonna
change some things up a bit which is why
I picked up some yellow paint also some
other parts came in the mail today got
my static pressure fans from thermal
tape these are gonna have the yellow
LEDs much better than the ugly black
fans that I showed you guys earlier and
I also ordered a new sli bridge because
the one I had before didn't match the
didn't fit with the two GPUs because
it's a spacing I think I got the single
spacing this one's the the two slot
spacing so this is going to work a lot
better and of course I'm gonna paint
that as well so the parts I'm going to
paint on here are going to be the PCI
brackets I'm also going to be painting
the thumbscrews for the CPU block
bracket and of course the black bracket
itself that is surrounding the block so
that's my plan that's what I'll be doing
for the rest of this episode let's go
ahead and take this apart and go
downstairs and start the paint process
so got the pci brackets over here the
cpu block brackets got the sli bridge
cover got some screws for the the back
of the GPU which connects these I think
this is called the GPU bracket whatever
you call it I'm gonna paint those yellow
as well then I mention this already
the thumb screws for the CPU block as
well so everything is good to go grab my
paint and go downstairs you guys are
gonna crack up on this here is my ghetto
paint setup don't judge me
so basically I have three boxes covering
all sides because it is a bit windy I
don't want the wind to blow some dust
and some dirt on my paint so and then I
added some doggie pads near the bottom
of course and then some here at the top
I'm actually gonna cover it so there's
no I guess dust hitting it from the top
guys I'm working with what I have all
right so this is what I've been doing
for all my paint jobs for all my PC
builds so and it's been working fine I
have no complaints but anyway so I got
the brackets set up on four individual
boxes to one each I'm gonna be painting
the GPU brackets on here on this
specific box and you got the SLI bridge
and then the CPU block right over there
so I usually do two to three coats I
usually wait anywhere from 10 to 15
minutes between each spray the only
parts I think I need to paint the
surface is the SLI bridge and the CPU
block there's no need to paint both
sides because you're not you're not
going to see the other side anyways so
there really is no reason for that
you
all right so I did my two coats I'm
gonna let them dry in here for a little
bit it's getting really dark out right
now maybe let them drive for an hour
before I bring them in and then leave it
overnight and then next morning we're
gonna flip it over and then paint the
other side so definitely happy so far
with the way everything turned out the
only thing is I think this yellow is a
little too dark I think I think I should
have gotten more brighter yellow this
one's more of a dark yellow but I think
you'll still work out I don't know we'll
see but look at these beauties they came
out perfect so today I'll be flipping
them over and of course painting the
opposite side by the way it's gonna look
weird and the build I think the SLI
bridge came out the best there are no
uneven spots on here really smooth and
you got the GPU brackets or GPU oh yeah
cause you can call GPU brackets there's
one tiny little spot over here but
should it be noticeable you know this is
perfect and you got the rest of the oh
let's take a look at the screws actually
so we're very happy with the way the
thumb screws came out as well
I thought it'd be okay but it's not and
me having OCD problems I can't let this
go I just can't I know I'm gonna hate
the build if I do complete it so I'll
let you guys be the judge
so here are the painted parts which by
the way came out beautifully
no complaints but take a look at the
color of this and take a look at the
color of the cables and the color of the
RAM sticks they're both different types
of yellow this was more of a darker pale
it's called hot rod yellow and these are
more like sunshine yellow according to
the the color chart so I'm not happy
with this at all it's not gonna match I
mean these parts are gonna stick out and
then I don't know I mean I don't want to
do it I want to continue I mean look at
this it's so it's so different like I'm
gonna order a different paint and just
spray over it I mean that another choice
that's my only other option if I want to
continue on with this bill which I do
and it sucks cuz I've been waiting two
days it took me two days to paint these
because I had to wait a day for the
paint to dry and then do the other side
and then wait another day so it's like I
want to get this bill done and I feel
like I'm dragging this series on so but
I wanted to be perfect you guys know me
like I'm
I try to be perfectionist you know I'm
not a perfectionist but I try to be and
all that reflects you know my PC build
so I want to make sure I put in
everything that I can into these builds
so like if I can't make it perfect I'm
not gonna even bother trying so I just
ordered some paint
I shall I go to order some paint two
days shipping from amazon hopefully once
you get that in do the painting again
and then we can finally continue on with
the build so I mean even a fans let me
show you guys I mean the fans are a
little simmer
I would say if you guys really look at
it closely I think it's pretty much the
same color as these but the fans aren't
the main part about the build you know I
mean the LEDs are going to be bright
yellow I'm sure but the main thing is
are the cables of course and the RAM
sticks which really bring out the the
color scheme of this build it's not only
so much about the fans even though I
guess the colors do look similar I don't
know I mean I'm not a nobody guys think
by the time my pink arrives this video
should be uploaded so you guys can let
me know in the comments section should I
leave this as is and please be honest
guys if the difference was minuscule
honestly I wouldn't even care but this
is this is pretty much night and day so
anyway don't wrap this video again I'm
really sorry guys I know this is not
what you guys expected but you have to
understand I'm trying to perfect these
things and I just I won't be able to
sleep at night knowing that the colors
don't match it's I don't know I Roberto
CD I don't know what it is it's gonna
drive me crazy so I hope you guys
understand thank you so much for support
a series has been actually the most
popular series of the channel so far so
I'm glad you guys are liking it and yeah
I think that's it hopefully next time I
the next video guys are watching it's
pretty much all the parts are ready to
go I'm not gonna even show you the
painting process I'm just gonna get that
done with and then we can start putting
the rest of the parts together but
anyways there's so much I love your
faces and I will see you in the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
