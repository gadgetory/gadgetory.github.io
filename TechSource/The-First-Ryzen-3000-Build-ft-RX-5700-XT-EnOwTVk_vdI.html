ships as well as the new Navi GPUs are
here and I thought what better way to
show off their performance than in an
actual PC build let's get to it I want
to give each thanks to Nord VPN for

a gaming streaming and productivity PC
featuring the Rison 9 and 3900 x12 core
processor we also got 32 gigs of ram in
here and the RX 5700 xt which is a m--
these newest GPU based on their rDNA
architecture the 5700 xt is made to
compete against the RT x 2070 while d
5700 goes head-to-head with the RT x
2060 you will see gaming benchmarks on
all four of these cards later in this
video so I decided to go with a
stormtrooper color scheme for this build
hence the name storm and the purpose of
this build like I mentioned before is
for gaming streaming and productivity of
course the three included intake fans
provide plenty of fresh air for the GPU
and practically the entire case really
and then I added three more fans as
exhaust we have one in the rear and two
more on the top needless to say the PC
definitely has plenty of airflow the
g.skill transy royal RAM sticks adds a
nice amount of bling to the build
finally I threw in some custom sleeve
cables for the finishing touch I wish
there was a way to turn off the red
Radeon logo on the side because it kind
of messes with the color scheme I mean
the red accents around the card I can
deal with but the LEDs not so much so
the 3900 X actually comes with their
rate prism RGB cooler and I thought this
would be the perfect opportunity to test
it out and see how well it cools the CPU
during heavy workloads and gaming that's
pretty much the only reason why I didn't
install a beefier cooler I want to see
what this thing can do
the Wraith president my GB cooler comes
included with your third generation
rising 7 or higher CPU starting from the
3700 X based on the current prices the
total cost of this build is around
$2,500 give or take a few bucks
including the CD key which you can pick
up for only $15 if you buy it from your
CD key calm just make sure to use my
code for an extra 10% off as always of
course I'll drop a link to it below
alright let's get into temps real
quickly on stock the 3900 X idles
between 65 and 55 degrees you guys can
tell by the histogram that it would peak
at 65 Celsius and then dip down to 55
and then it would go back up this is
what the fan profile said to normal I
did not touch any of the settings in
BIOS unload the CPU peaks at 88 degrees
and stays there consistently and this is
after 2 hours of non-stop rendering I
mean the cooler does its job and keeps
it from overheating but I do recommend
going with an aftermarket cooler if you
plan on overclocking both the 5700 and
xt models idle around 40 degrees and a
peaks at 91 degrees while gaming for a
couple hours even inside a case with
lots of air flow both GPUs tend to get
pretty hot now let's get into the
performance starting with a synthetic
benchmark Like Heaven we can see that
the 5700 XT Falls a little behind and
both resolutions compared to the 2017
same goes for the 5700 the RT X 2060 bit
score higher however it looks like the
gap is much smaller in 1440p csgo can
pretty much run on any potato so the FPS
I was getting here were really high
across all the cards in both resolutions
however the 27 he did score an average
of 5 fps more on both runs for some
reason while the 57 X T
capped at 250 it looks like in pub both
aimed en Nvidia cards showed similar
performance in both 1080 and 1440p with
the AMD cards edging slightly ahead by a
couple FPS similar results for overwatch
however the gap between the 5700 and
2600 is much wider compared to the 5700
XT and 2070 on Tom Clancy's siege
however both AMD cards dominated the
r-tx cards showing as much as a 30fps
difference and 1080p and 9 fps and 1440
when it comes to Apex Legends both cards
traded blows with the our Tex 2070
slightly up performing the 5700 XT in
both resolutions
while the 5700 slightly better than the
2060 on port night the roles have been
completely reversed with both Nvidia
cards doing noticeably better than the
AMD cards and both resolutions however
the gap between the RT X 2070 and the
5700 XT seems to be bigger battlefield 5
seems to favor the AMD cards more on the
X 11 since both AMD cards do noticeably
better than nvidia even in 1440p the gap
remains the same looking at overclocking
performance we can see some really nice
gains from both cards an average of 10
FPS gain on the 5700 XT and 9 FPS on the
5,700 I mean these are extra frames for
free just by increasing the memory and
boost clock so what does this all mean
which cards perform the best looking at
the average FPS across all four cards we
can see that the 5700 XT and RT X 2070
are pretty much neck and neck for both
1080 and 1440p gaming however the 5700
I've performed the RT X 2060 but only by
5% in 1080 and 1440p gaming between the
5700 XT and the Arctic's 2070 based on
MSRP prices alone the 57 XT is clearly
the obvious choice when it comes to bang
for your buck
since it's $100 cheaper than the our Tex
2070 and offers similar performance you
are paying only a dollar 90 cents per
frame compared to two dollars and 37
cents for the r-tx 2070 for 1080p gaming
but then you end up paying way more for
1440p the best bang for your buck card
goes to the
radion 5700 you are paying less per
frame for both 1080 and 1440p compared
to the rest of the cards on the list now
with that said the 5700 isn't quite
ready for 1440p gaming so I do recommend
this card only for gamers who are on a
budget looking to max out their games in
1080p also someone who has 144 Hertz or
fresh great monitor to take advantage of
the high frames this card not only
performs better than the RT X 2060 but
it offers more bang for your buck so
obviously the clear winner in a 1080p
category I would say is the 5700 now if
you look at the jump into 1440p gaming
or maybe you have a really high refresh
rate monitor like 165 or higher than the
5700 XT is the perfect card for you now
for similar performance compared to the
RT X 2070 but it cost $100 less of
course this is all based on MSRP pricing
and performance on the reference models
prices can change and other board
partners can offer different pricing for
their own cards this video is kind of
just an overview to show you guys what
type of performance you can expect from
aim these new cards and with that said I
hope you guys enjoyed the video I'll
drop a link to all the parts I mentioned
in this video down below including the
parts are used and build consider
subscribing because I have some pretty
awesome builds coming up especially some
budget builds from a and B as well thing
he's getting so much for watching as
always I love you guys and I'll see you
in the next video once again I'm gonna
