another unboxing slash giveaway today
we're looking at the brand new Sony Vaio
pro 13 laptop so let's get started
so this is the sony vaio pro 13-inch
laptop recently released it is available
in two different sizes 13 and 11 inches
the 13 inch that we are unboxing today
goes for 1250 on retail and both of them
are available in either silver or black
I also included some links below in the
description for both sizes and where you
can find them alright so let's put the
laptop aside for now see what's in the
box let's go ahead and move this to the
side in here you will see the
accessories that is your power cord that
is your actual charger itself you would
connect the power cord to it and from
that you would connect the laptop of
course so you can charge it and then you
have your plastic bag here with all the
warranty information and installation
set up and such I'm not gonna bore you
guys with that so let's put this back
inside and take a closer look at the
laptop itself this is a very thin laptop
and it almost resembles the MacBook just
because of how light and tiny it is if
you were to compare this with the
MacBook Air they are both the same size
and height they are both at point 68
inches at their thickest point as always
for this generations computers they all
come with Windows 8 already installed
but there's one feature that the MacBook
doesn't have and that's touch screen
capability that's definitely a very nice
feature to have if you are carrying a
laptop which it replaces and don't feel
like using a touchpad or even connecting
the mouse to it it's very simple and
very convenient to use the
responsiveness is very accurate as you
can see here and a lot of people are
always concerned about the fingerprints
when consistently touching it and all I
can say is that most touchscreen laptops
nowadays come with fingerprint repelling
coats over their screens and that's the
same technology that Sony is using on
their laptops so you barely see any
fingerprints when you're done using it
so let's take a look on the right side
of the laptop here you have your SD slot
headphone jack 2 USB 3.0 slots and an
HDMI port alright on to the other side
nothing special here all there is is a
charging port and a laptop's air vent I
personally would prefer to see the air
vent on the back of the laptop but I'm
sure there's a really good reason of
putting it there instead
so this laptop also comes with keyboard
backlighting which is a must for me
because I do use my laptop at night and
I'm sure a lot of people do and it's
really nice to see what you're typing
one thing I wanted to demonstrate for
you guys is the NFC feature on this
top you take your NFC capable smartphone
and lay down on a touchpad like so and
initiate the transfer by tapping on your
phone first then a notification comes
from the laptop confirming the request
once you hit accept it transfers
whatever you wanted to share from your
phone to the laptop for this
demonstration it was a simple YouTube
video that I wanted to share from my
phone to the laptop and as you can see
here it was a really smooth transition
and as soon as it was accepted it starts
playing automatically so these are the
stock specs for the sony vaio 13-inch
model we have an Intel Core i5 1.6
processor an Intel HD graphics 4400 a
13.3 inch monitor with a resolution of
1920 by 1080 P and for the memory we
have 4 gigs of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
storage space on an SSD so that will do
it for the unboxing thank you once again
for watching the video if you guys want
to enter for a chance to win the sony
vaio pro 13 laptop all you have to do is

and like the video you must reach all
three requirements in order to qualify
and I will choose the winner on August
