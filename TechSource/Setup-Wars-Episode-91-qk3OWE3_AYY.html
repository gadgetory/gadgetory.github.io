once again link is down below let's go
ahead and dive into the episode starting
off the episode we got duncan and his
black and white set up with a pre-built
desk in his uni room he's rocking the
EC's 27 inch 144 hertz gaming monitor
that hooked up to his beast machine
that's equipped with a 6700 K and 2
ZOTAC gtx 1070 s in sli i love how clean
the build turned out and those custom
back plates though very nice he's also
using the corsair k70 RGB keyboard and
scimitar RGB mouse that's sitting on top
of the mm 300 extended mouse pad also
from corsair and what's interesting is
that duncan decided to wrap the cables
near the back using a cable sleeve and a
cable drop I guess it's not as obtrusive
since it's black but it's still
noticeable I would use something more
thinner like the wiremold channel from
coordinate I know it's in white but it
will actually work with your setups
color scheme you can even paint it in
black if you are that picky for audio
he's using a pair of both companion size
speakers the Audio Technica m50 X's that
are hanging out of the desk and a blue
snowball ice microphone that's hooked up
to a newer boom arm the boom arm looks
like it's hanging from the top shelf
cable management seems to be under
control he's using another cable sleeve
to group up all the wires that are
running into the cable box also great
use of the cable clips that are keeping
the wires from hanging
down a very solid gaming setup to start
to show off Thank You Duncan for
entering Kari coming in at number two
with an interesting spread out corner
desk set up black and white is the color
scheme and gaming is the purpose a lien
widow I mean there's iBUYPOWER there's
even Origin PC hell even hot wheels make
better pcs than Alienware the rest of
the gear though I prove we got the Acer
34 inch predator as the main monitor
then we got a 28 inch 4k a suits on the
right side and an iMac 5k for a
Productivity I'm assuming Kerry's also
using the coarser strafe RGB keyboard
and m65 trail mouse on top of the
Firefly mousepad now I don't know if
those were pre-drilled holes that came
with desk or what but I'm glad to see
that you ratted them through there
nonetheless for audio he's using the
popular Logitech V 5450 wireless
surround sound speakers and of course
they're void RGB that's hanging from the
Luxa to stand everything is nicely
spread out and doesn't look cluttered at
all then again he does have a lot of
surface area to work with the only
potential issue I see is the iPhone
stand being too far off while you are
using the gaming setup I do want to take
this time and give you props for not
only staying consistent with overall
color scheme but also furnishing your
room very well the black on white
contrast is looking amazing throughout
the entire room I'm not so sure how he
modded the desks but it looks like
there's some space in between the two
tabletops that he used and you managed
to system LED strips and therefore a
nice lighting effect job well done cable
management has also done well but that's
to be expected from a setup like this a
very refreshing setup no doubt Thank You
Kerry for entering now here is a
stunning white and black setup from
Steve's god
dayum the color coordination is
next-level he's using to 27-inch 4k
monitors from Acer which are hooked up
to his gigabyte gtx 980ti as inside the
NZXT Noctis 450k it appears that this is
a Productivity set up as well judging by
the 59 60 X processor 32 gigs of ram and
the Apple keyboard I mean I get the
Wireshark ooh mouse but why go with a
wired Apple keyboard if they have one
Wireless I feel like the desk would have
looked a lot cleaner with the wireless
keyboard for audio he's using the
Edifier Prisma encore bluetooth speakers
which looks like something
great out of a sci-fi movie and also a
pair of white Alpine wireless headphones
that are resting on me so touchy
headphone stand he does have a
microphone setup as well
we got the MXL studio 24 USB microphone
hooked up to the newer suspension arm
which by the way is in a great location
it doesn't interfere with the monitors
nor does it get in the way of anything
some other things on the desk that also
complement the set up very well is the
iPhone dock from sim juromaru which is
actually the one I'm using for my own
setup and the popular Note II smart
light cable management also seems to be
under control
I don't think I've actually seen this
before but it looks like Steve used some
paper clips to keep the cables under the
desk hey if it works it works right you
also managed to hook up his power outlet
against the wall I honestly don't have
any complaints here I mean it's not the
prettiest but it works if it weren't for
the black and red chair completely
throwing up the color scheme this would
have been a perfect white and black
setup thank you nonetheless Steve for
entering at number 4 we got true pay
with a quad display set up a rainbow
quad display set up actually a massive
55 inch 4k TV from Samsung up top 27
inch 4k monitor in between - 23 inch
1080p monitors from Lenovo and all that
is sitting on top of a custom made desk
there's definitely a lot going on here
but oddly enough is somewhat symmetrical
I like how you hooked up two of his
Logitech speakers on each side of the
wall with a cable Tunnel hiding the
wires on the surface you got the Razer
BlackWidow chroma key board and the asus
rog spatha mouse on top of the glorious
extended mousepad i guess he was going
for a white and black bean but the
rainbow colors and the blue LED from the
keyboard kind of throw it off a bit
great work with cable management also it
looks like everything is kept off the
ground
so I don't have any complaints here also
down here on the brainwave singer are
two headsets the logitech g930 3 snow
Edition nd JBL Everest elite 700
headphones I also just noticed a
microphone sticking out from behind the
TV it looks like an MXL 990 and he also
has a 9 91 on the other side not too
sure why he needs two microphones though
the pc that's pushing all these pixels
might mess with your OCD because it's
running on a 6p 50k and two different
GPUs actually the same r9 390x but
they're from two different brands to be
fair he just put in the notes that he is
waiting for this 1080
TI's to release and that I bought these
GPUs at different times aside from the
GPUs this is a very nice-looking black
and white build props on the cable
management as well I'm guessing you get
a lot of poo tanks from the set up you
bring a girl over set her down on the
couch and show her your light show and
then afterwards let's just say she's
going to check out your other setup last
but not least we have Vega with a more
simple setup so he's running to a 27
inch gaming monitors a Razer BlackWidow
chroma and a Mamba mouse on top of an
extended mousepad seems like a very
organised white and black setup with
purple accents the PC that's powering it
has a 6700 K and a gigabyte 980ti
inside the NZXT s340 case very clean
work with the cable management and I'm
loving that backplate for audio he is
using a JBL charge to speaker and to
headphones
we got the turtlebeach xo7 headset and
the popular audio Technica's I'm not so
sure which model that is since he didn't
mention it in the notes he also has a
blue Yeti microphone set up on the road
boom arm but ladies and gentlemen can we
take a look under the desk please
what a work of art he has both of his
consoles on top of some custom-made
shelves which also appeared to be
skinned by D brands that is what I'm
talking about no complaints here
everything is neatly organized under the
desk superb work I don't know how I feel
about the controller stands being in the
center of the desk I mean I get that it
adds to the symmetry and the overall
theme of the setup but it's like there's
no real purpose to be right there in the
center instead I would move them closer
to the PC on the right side to clear up
the center of the desk more but that's
just my two cents
regardless is a very clean and organized
set up no doubts Thank You Vega for
entering so that is if it is episode of
setup always make sure you guys download
the app nice and both within the app
because the tracking is done in real
time and yes can see who the winner is
but either way I will be announcing the
winners on my social media platforms
fingers much watching and I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
