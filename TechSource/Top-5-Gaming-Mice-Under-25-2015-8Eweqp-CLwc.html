and in this video I will be going over
the five best gaming mice that you can
currently buy under $25 as always I'll
be showing my favorite and least
favorite mice out of the five near the
end of the video and you guys can find
the links for each Mouse in the
description section down below so with
that said let's begin so first up is the
all relly 4000 DPI optical gaming mouse
with six programmable buttons and RGB
LED color options it has a matte finish
and features asymmetrical design which
is great for both left and right handed
users the DPI button on the top cycles
through four different dpi settings
which you can control from 250 all the
way up to 4000 also each setting is
attached to a color that you pick in the
settings that's a really comfortable
design and the back and four buttons are
super easy to reach now I did gain for
about 30 minutes on each Mouse and I
found that the ala le Mouse was super
responsive it's extremely light which
helps while gaming because I have full
control when moving the mouse around and
time sensitive situations the only thing
I don't like about this mouse is the
scroll wheel it's slightly harder
pressing it down compared to other mice
but other than that it's a solid gaming
mouse if those come with its own
software that you can use to program all
six buttons and here is the DPI settings
menu over here you can assign a dpi
setting for any color on the RGB chart
and cycle through them on the mouse next
up is the scroll x1 from a tech city
it's a 2400 dpi optical gaming mouse
with seven programmable buttons with
three LED color options that include
green red and blue
unfortunately the LED colors are tied to
the VPI cycle buttons so you are stuck
with either color depending on what dpi
setting you are using it has a matte
finish for the surface with a classy
plastic on both sides so it will attract
finger prints this mouse is also only
for right-handed users and has 60 grams
of built-in weights for improved
resistance the grip is somewhat
comfortable and it's designed for both
fingertip and claw style gripping the
front and back buttons however are large
and really easy to reach and when it
comes to gaming it does a great job I
honestly don't have any complaints that
has really smooth move
and it's responsive I grip my mice in
cloth form and I can say that the scroll
x1 feels great it slides really well on
my mousepad however it's super slippery
when I use it on my desk I just wish the
LEDs will not attach to the DPI cycle
buttons the x1 also comes with its own
software although you can't customize
the LEDs but you can definitely program
all seven buttons as well as adjust the
polling rate click speed and a few other
options at number three we have the
e-blue mazer - 2500 dpi wireless optical
gaming mouse it features six non
programmable buttons with a dedicated
dpi button on the top it also has a
matte finish for most of the surface
however the bottom portion is made out
of glossy plastic the only LED color
option you get is blue and it doesn't
even come with its own software so if
you want to program the buttons you can
only do that in game it's only designed
for right-handed users and it's pretty
comfortable in the hand the back and
four buttons are also really close by
making it super convenient to press and
underneath you will find the switch to
turn the mouse on or off as well as an
option to turn the mouse on without
activating the LEDs it does come with a
battery and depending on your use it's
expected to last anywhere between three
to six months when it comes to gaming
it's not as responsive as I would have
liked to I mean I know it's wireless but
I expected faster response times the
best example I can give you guys is that
it's like playing on a thirty Hertz
refresh rate monitor now if you're
playing racing or action-adventure games
like Batman Arkham Knight then won't
really bother you since you are most
likely using your keyboard
however for quick reflex games like FPS
shooters I wouldn't recommend this Mouse
if you're like me and hate wires and are
looking for your Wireless Gaming Mouse
on a 25 bucks then this is as good as it
gets
next up is the shark 35 hundred dpi
optical Gaming Mouse it features 9
programmable buttons with two dedicated
buttons on top for swapping between DPI
settings it has a glossy plastic finish
for the entire surface of the mouse with
plastic sides and it also has a
symmetrical design which is great for
both right and left-handed users under
the mouse you'll find a button near the
top which switches between the color you
selected and blue I'm not sure why they
have a button just dedicated to
switching to blue LEDs but it's there if
anyone needs it it also comes with a
cartridge with eight removable weights
in it giving you complete control on how
heavy you want the mouse
to be which is pretty cool the design is
very comfortable for all types of grip
and the back and four buttons are
convenient to press as well
the LEDs unfortunately don't stay lit
and instead you get a pulsating effect
which can't be changed
the only thing you can change is the
speed of it pulsating from three
different options gaming on this Mouse
is awesome it's fast responsive and
slides really well on my mousepad and
it's even smooth on my desk the mouse
buttons are very clicky and offers great
feedback so even if you have headphones
on you will feel the feedback I like how
the middle LED light will display which
dpi setting you are using and it won't
mess with the actual LEDs of the mouse
as stated before you can program all
nine buttons using these software you
can also adjust the sensitivity and
polling rate along with access to seven
LED color options last but not least we
have the habit 2400 dpi optical Gaming
Mouse with six non programmable buttons
it has a button on the top to cycle
through four dpi settings and as a matte
black finish for the entire Mouse and
it's only designed for left-handed users
the habit Mouse has a much wider design
compared to the other mice in this video
even for my large hands the front and
back buttons are a little close to my
thumb and I find myself sometimes
accidentally pressing it it does feature
seven different led colors however you
can't control them and the mouse will
slowly pulsate between them also there
is no software with the mouse to program
the buttons or turn off the lights when
it comes to gaming it gets the job done
for the most part I mean it's fast
responsive and smooth on the mousepad
but it's really rough on practically any
other surface so if you don't own a
mousepad then I would strongly recommend
you to stay away from this as it will
damage the surface of your desk because
of its wide design that's almost
impossible to pick up the mouse quickly
while gaming so if you're playing FPS
games it's gonna be really annoying but
I mean for only 10 bucks you get a
decent Mouse now normally I don't
include any extras but this time I have
to give an honorable mention to the Z zu
2,000 dpi Wireless Gaming Mouse with
seven non programmable buttons this
mouse has the exact same design as the
shark Mouse but instead it has a matte
finish for the surface and it's Wireless
it doesn't have any software so you
can't program any buttons or change the
LEDs but I wanted to give this an
honorable mention because it's more
responsive than the e Blu wireless mouse
and as you much better
it's still not better than any of the
wired mice I went over in this video but
if you guys have to have a wireless
gaming mouse on-the-go then I would
strongly recommend this one so my
absolute favorite Mouse out of all of
these is the shark without question it
has an awesome design that's super
comfortable and it's great for gaming
because it's smooth and really
responsive some added bonuses include
it's very own software to adjust
practically any settings to meet your
needs and it comes with seven led color
options my least favorite is the habit
Mouse because it's too wide for me
making it difficult to pick up during
gaming and the back and front buttons
are too close and I accidentally pressed
them from time to time it's also a major
turnoff not having a choice on the led
colors but that's basically it for the
video if you guys enjoyed it and want me
to continue doing these top five videos
and make sure to beat the crap out of
that like button I do have a bunch of
other top 5 tech videos as well so I'll
leave a link to the playlist along with
all of the mice that I featured in this
video down below in the description
section also let me know what I should
feature next in my top 5 video by
leaving a comment because that's where I
get all of these ideas from but anyways
thanks again for watching and I'll see
you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
