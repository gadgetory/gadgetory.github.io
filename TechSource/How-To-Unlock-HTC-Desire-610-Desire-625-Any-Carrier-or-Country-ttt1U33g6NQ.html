here to show you the process of
unlocking your HTC Desire 610 smartphone
so you can use it with any GSM carrier
in the world for this demonstration I
will be using my lock 18 T Desire 610
and unlock it so I can use it on my
t-mobile network but it's the exact same
process for any carrier so first off we
need to get the unlock code to start the
unlocking process the place where I get
all my lock codes is the unlocking
company comm because you have the
cheapest prices online and I get my
codes much faster than other websites so
headed over to the unlocking company
comm I select your phone manufacturer
and the phone model from the drop-down
list and on the next page go ahead and
select the country the phone was
originally purchased from and the
carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
original carrier is AT&amp;amp;T before we
continue we need the IMEI number of the
phone and the way you look that up on
the phone is to open up the dial pad and
enter in star pound zero six pound once
the phone displays the IMEI number you
have to go back on the website and enter
that in once everything is filled out so
let's get a locking code and that will
take you to the final screen where you
have to check out after checking out
they will email you the unlock code the
price and delivery time of your code
varies by phone but don't worry because
as I said before you are getting the
cheapest price online with the fastest
delivery times once you receive your
unlock code from your locking company
comm it's time to unlock your phone but
before we continue make sure that the
phone is powered off go ahead and remove
the side cover which should be located
on the left side of the phone and insert
in the SIM card that you want to use
with the phone I want to use the Desire
610 on my t-mobile network so I'm
putting in my t-mobile SIM card now if
your SIM card is a different size than
the tray then you have to adjust the
size in order for it to work there is a
link below to show you how that's done
now if there is SIM card is installed
we'll place the side cover and boot up
the phone once the phone boots up it
will take you straight to this SIM
unlock page and this is where you enter
the unlock code that you received from
the unlocking company after inputting
the code and hitting a lock you will get
a message stating that the unlock was
successful and the phone will
automatically reboot now once it
restarts and takes you to the home
screen your phone is now permanently
unlocked and you can begin using it
immediately as you can see I'm using an
AT&amp;amp;T Desire 610 on my t-mobile network
so that's how you unlock your HTC Desire
610 for any GSM carrier in
world if this video helped you guys out
