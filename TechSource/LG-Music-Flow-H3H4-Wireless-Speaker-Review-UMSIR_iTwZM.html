source and in this video we're gonna be
taking a look at some awesome wireless
speakers from LG these are the musicflow
h3 and h4 and they aren't your average
wireless speakers these connect on a
mesh network and you can build yourself
your very own wireless home theater
system but more on that later if you
don't have a Wi-Fi network to connect to
you can still use the Bluetooth
connection method instead for any of
these speakers so the musicflow h4 has a
matte black finish with your standard
media controls on top with the power in
audio jack and connection buttons being
on the side this is a true wireless
speaker with built in battery so it
doesn't need to be plugged in for it to
be powered on it also has 20 watts of
output power on two channels the h3
speakers on the other hand need to be
plugged in at all times to power it on
it's wireless in the sense that you can
use your phone or tablet without having
to connect to it via cables on the top
you'll find the media controls along
with the power option I like how there
isn't a physical button on top and
instead it's touch sensitive and the
back is where the power in is located
along with an Ethernet port and the
connection buttons the build quality on
these speakers are very solid and it
definitely feels like I'm using a
premium product then again I don't
expect anything less from LG so to pair
it up it's really easy first you'll need
to connect to your Wi-Fi network then
make sure all the speakers are plugged
in and ready to go after that you will
need to download the music flow player
app on either your Android or iOS device
and then go ahead and launch the app
after that it's a matter of following
simple instructions you do need to
choose which device you are trying to
connect to as well as the connection
type whether it's wireless or wired if
it's wireless you will need to tap on
the Wi-Fi icon on the back of the
speaker so it can connect to the network
now that I've connected the first
speaker I do need to add the other two
as well so I can build my very own
wireless home theater system the process
is the same except this time I have to
press on the plus button instead now
here's where the fun begins I now have
all three speakers connected on the same
network and using the app I have full
control over each one of them hitting
the chain icon I am able to connect any
or all the speakers together now because
the speakers have Google cast built-in
you can control them using any streaming
services that also feature Google cast
like Spotify I
Radio Pandora and a bunch of others you
can also play music directly from your
smartphone's library and what's also
great about this app is that you can
control the volume on each speaker as
well as switch back and forth between
stereo or mono outputs with a setup you
can split up speakers and put one in
your bedroom the kitchen and even the
living room and have each speaker play a
different song as you can see here I'm
playing three different songs across the
three speakers the more speakers you
have connected the more options you have
here's a quick sound demo between the h3
and h4 speakers
honestly I am in love with these
speakers they are practically part of my
desk set up now and I can't get enough
of them
get yourself an LG 34 inch ultra white
curved monitor and hook up the speakers
together with your PC via bluetooth and
you have yourself a minute either
experience I can also separate the h3
speakers and put them in the corners of
my room and have a real surround sound
entertainment setup if you guys are
looking to create your very own wireless
home speaker system Network then I
strongly recommend trying the LG Flow h3
and h4 speakers but that basically does
it for this video I will leave links to
the speakers down below for anyone
