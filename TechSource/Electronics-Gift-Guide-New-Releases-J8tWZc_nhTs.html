if you're dreading the holidays because
you either hate shopping or don't know
what gift to buy someone then you came
to the right place in this video we're
gonna take a look at some new releases
while the next episode we're gonna focus
mostly on gaming here so make sure
you're subscribed so you don't miss out
Amazon actually partnered with me and
sponsored this video but the items in
here or handpicked by me so kicking off
the episode we got the ultimate Pro
streamer bundle from blue which makes
some of the best audio gear out there
this bundle is perfect for gamers
because it comes with the blackout yeti
microphone and the Mophie headphones you
also get two cables a 1.2 meter cable
with built-in controls and a microphone
for Apple devices and a standard three
meter cable you also get a quarter inch
adapter and a 3.5 millimeter airplane
jack adapter the microphone is a USB
plug in play and it comes with a stand
that lets you adjust the angle however
you can also mount it on a boom arm
which is what I recommend simply for
convenience this is a really tall
microphone so if you place it directly
in front of you it's gonna block your
monitor depending on how high your
display is with a boom arm you can
actually have it on the side of the desk
and bring it in whenever you need to use
it
the Yeti has a volume knob in the front
for the headphones as well as a button
to mute the microphone on the back is
where you will find the knob for the
gain which will increase the volume of
the microphone input and below that as
the pattern selection you can basically
set which direction for the microphone
to pick up noise from here's what it
sounds like so the audio is very clear
however it does pick up some background
noise so keep that in mind if you are
screaming in a very loud environment the
noise that you are about to hear is the
fan noise from my computer the
headphones that it comes with are
awesome so these are closed back
headphones with very comfortable ear
cups that go over your ear it's
excellent for noise isolation as well
but the coolest feature about these
headphones is the built-in amplifier it
comes pre-loaded with three audio
profiles which you
adjust using the knob near the 3.5
millimeter jack unfortunately the
amplifier does use battery and it's
expected to last around 12 hours on a
full charge but one thing I love about
these headphones is that they actually
turn off once you take it off your head
which saves battery life in the long run
this is a brilliant feature that I want
to see more in battery powered
headphones the cushions are really soft
and there's a wheel next to the headband
that lets you select the tension of the
clamp
you can basically tighten it all the way
for maximum noise isolation or keep them
loose to allow some background noise to
leak in in case your mom is yelling at
you that dinner is ready
overall this is the perfect bundle for
gamers streamers and especially content
creators whether you're doing voiceovers
for your YouTube channel or maybe you
just want to upgrade your gaming gear if
you buy this set for your kids or
relative or even your parents they're
gonna absolutely love it I think that
this would make the awesome gift and if
your parents don't watch youtube videos
then you might want to share with them
just to you know give them some ideas
for the upcoming holidays next up on the
list is the new Bose Soundlink micro
bluetooth speaker
although the battery life isn't the best
giving you up to 6 hours of music this
tiny speaker offers incredible audio
clarity and a rich deep bass between the
power and the Bluetooth button up top
you will find an indicator light which
will display how much battery life is
left and the cool thing about it is it
would actually vocally tell you how much
battery is left or once you turn it on
70%
connected to Ed's iPhone the middle
button is a play and pause button
however if you double tap it it will
skip the track as well the Soundlink
micro also comes with a microphone
allowing you to take calls and it comes
with a built-in strap near the back
making it the perfect Bluetooth speaker
for on-the-go you can strap it to your
bike backpack or anything similar
this is the ideal gift for anyone who
loves listening to music and especially
someone who loves the outdoors the
person who likes to camp and hike the
included clip on this really makes the
sound Lake micro the perfect portable
bluetooth speaker the final piece of
tech on the list is actually my favorite
believe it or not and it is the oral-b
pro 7500 so this is an electric
rechargeable toothbrush that comes with
a travel case and three brushes this is
actually the perfect gift for your
parents or older siblings that still use
an outdated brush or anyone that you
know that stuck back in 1999 still using
the hand brushes it's time for an
upgrade okay so the reason why it's my
favorite item in this video is because
I've been using the oral-b 7000 for the
past six months which is the previous
version of this toothbrush so now I
actually get an upgrade
that I'm excited about these 7500 is
lighter and lasts longer I was able to
brush twice a day for a whole week long
without charging it the 7500 also comes
with five different modes with an LED
indicator in the front displaying which
one you selected overall I would say
that the tech has been definitely
improved from the previous version and
it's available in white and black and it
will make the perfect gift for anyone
dental hygiene is very important but
sadly a lot of people disregard it you
