welcome to another episode of what's in
the box and before I jump in I do want
to take this time and plug in my website
deal source tech if you guys are
planning on paying full price for your
next tech purchase I'm here to tell you
why would you pay full price that's what
deal stores that tech is about we have
six total ambassadors searching websites
like Amazon Newegg and eBay and we are
constantly finding the best deals and
are posting it on the asuras tech just
so it's all in one place and it's easier
for you guys to shop around and save
money
so either bookmark it or check back once
in a while maybe that keyboard or that
monitor TV is finally on sale and we
managed to find it and post it on the
asuras tech for you to find
we do have US UK Canada and Germany
deals updated every single day anyways
with that said let's go ahead and unbox
mtech shall we alright we can start off
with this long box because I do love
long things this what sometimes my jokes
just make no sense what could possibly
be in this box oh hey we got some more
PEP G tubes also this is from ek okay I
think I remember what these are so these
are the water blocks for my 1080 TI the
reason why they sent me these actually
let me open this up quick so the
original blocks that ek sent me were the
basic all-black ones which I didn't
really like and these ones were actually
out of stock at the time so now they're
back in stock and that is why ek sent
these in which by the way if you're
watching I love you thank you so much
these are the ones I want to be using in
my build which honestly look way way
better than the other ones and I'm gonna
show you why Wow
tell me that this is not a sexy GPU
block as opposed to just a black cover
right in front of it
so this is the mikkel plexi and once I
pour the liquid in if you guys can
actually see it
through the GPU block which is gonna
look all I guess it looks so amazing so
we got two nickel plexi blocks for the
graphics card and I guess they sent in
some more tubing because they probably
saw my first water cool build and
they're like Edie you suck at bending
tubes you're gonna need some more tubing
that's I'm just kidding this is actually
a different material this is PPG I think
the one they sent earlier was acrylic if
I'm not mistaken and these are just a
lot easier to work with so that is why
they sent these alright guys so this is
something I purchased myself from Amazon
it is finally here it's from silhouette
and this is basically a printer this is
actually smaller and I thought well okay
so basically the idea behind this
printer is that once I hook it up to my
PC I can print custom stickers using
this printer I can design a sticker
inside a thing that there's a software
that comes to the printer or I can use a
third-party software and I can import it
into the program and print it out using
this printer and the reason why is
because I want to do more for my custom
bills guys I want to do more than just
plug it in parts together maybe throwing
in some custom cables I want to do more
modding to the actual PC I feel like my
bills are getting more redundant as I
build them there's really nothing
special about them anymore so I want to
try and push the boundaries of what I
can do for each PC build and this is
definitely one of the steps I actually
have a different box that I'm gonna
unbox at the end of this episode which
is gonna really push my PC building to
the next level I'm very excited to share
that with you guys so yeah anyways
that's what this is for so this one is
actually sent by someone that is
subscribed to my channel I'm not sure if
it's a company or if it's an actual
person it's a big box and it's actually
pretty heavy so I'm curious what they
sent me this is from Marcelo limas
which by the way if you guys do want to
send me something whether you're a
company or just someone was watching the
video and you want your product featured
in this video or in the series you guys
can send me stuff to my p.o box which I
will link below or written here
somewhere so yeah unfortunately I'm not
accepting letters I'm lonely reading
those off the camera
the only things that I'm unboxing in
these episodes are actual parcels actual
boxes 10 things to know about your
Google home max did somebody send me a
Google home max what oh my god I got a
Google home max once I've been watching
these pop up everywhere this is heavier
than I thought Wow okay so this is
basically Google home on steroids
it's a massive speaker with Google
assistant built-in you can ask it what
the weather is you can see what movies
are playing right now you can have a
play music stuff like that so yeah and
it's got better audio of course check
this up whoa okay wow this is heavy this
is nice I actually really like this
color I actually want to hook this up
well quick just just to hear it how do
you turn this damn thing on
okay welcome to Google home to get
started download the Google home app on
a phone or tablet
goddamn the base is incredible oh man
I think I'm in love with this thing holy
crap and apparently if things like 400
bucks Jesus Christ that is very steep
for this speaker but damn it sounds it
sounds fucking awesome Thank You Marcela
whoever you are I don't know what
company you work with but I love this
speaker seriously I've only had up like
five minutes and I'm in love so thank
you so much for sending this in
it will be put to great use I promise
you that I don't even want to continue
this unboxing anymore I just want to
shut this off and listen to some more
music Dan that was that was some good
stuff I'm not gonna lie oh Jesus
oh okay okay so this is the power supply
that performance PC sent me which is
gonna be used with that giant box next
to me which I'll show you guys very soon
so I'm gonna put this aside for now oh
okay I think I know what this is
yes ladies and gentlemen in this bag I'm
just gonna open it actually we got some
terrible grisly and this it's upside
down this is what I've been waiting for
the past few weeks now
they made us trip back from Steven over
at gamers Nexus they went ahead and D
lid my processor this is the 79 80 X 18
core processor that's gonna be going in
my personal build so I sent it over to
them and they went ahead and D lid my
processor they even we sealed it for me
so it's pretty much ready to go I'll
have to do is pop it in and I am all set
they were even kind enough to include a
chart basically showing its performance
before and after the deleting process
and if you guys are looking closely you
can see a 14 degree difference before
and after deleting the CPU which is huge
obviously I've never deleted a processor
before and I wasn't going to start now
on a $2,000 processor and then end up
screwing it up which I'm sure I would
have so huge huge thanks to Steven over
at gamers Nexus for doing this for me
I'll drop a link to their article as
well as the video that they did on this
processor and the deleting process if
you guys want to check
all right now then let's move on to the
finale of this episode which is this
enormous box so this is coming from Matt
over at PC performances and yeah he's
what's in this box is gonna basically
push my PC bills to the next level and
I'm excited to share this with you
there's so much popcorn in here I
instantly regretted that Christ I just
realize it's in my color scheme
I didn't even know you guys can do that
dude thank you so much Steve I got my
logo on here in the corner what this is
freakin awesome all right guys so
basically what this is I don't know if
there's an actual term for this but
basically it bends acrylic so you put
the piece of acrylic on here then you
would hook up the power supply to this I
don't know if it's based on a timer but
once it gets warm enough you would
basically I think lift up this portion
or lift up this portion and then you
would bend the acrylic board into
whatever degree you want and that's
basically what's gonna help me make some
killer custom mods to the upcoming PC
builds so this is gonna help me do stuff
like custom PSU shrouds also modify some
parts of the case where I can replace
with acrylic and just really push the
boundaries of what I can do on my custom
rigs and this is definitely the next big
step so because obviously there's gonna
be a learning curve but again huge huge
thanks to Matt from PC performance for
saying this in I did pay for it
obviously but again really huge thanks
to the custom work you did this is
really like personalized to to me and I
really appreciate that thank you so much
so yeah I think of my wrap up the video
if you guys enjoyed these what's in a
box videos tossing a like to show your
support would be awesome and if you guys
want to send me something anything at
all drop a link to the PL box below as
well and I'll feature it in the next
episode
let's pretty much a thing guys so much
again for watching I love your faces I
can't wait to bring you some awesome
content and I will see you in
