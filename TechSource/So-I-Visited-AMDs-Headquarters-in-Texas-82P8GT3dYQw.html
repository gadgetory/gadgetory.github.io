here today in Austin Texas
courtesy of MSI and Andy we're actually
with the dragon squad on a very special
mission will be checking out the secrets
of horizon but before that before we
head out to one of Amy's headquarters
and check out the really cool stuff we
are a special unboxing for you guys so
when we checked into the hotel there's
little package waiting for us so I'm
gonna show you guys or to do a little
boxing real quick and see what's inside
here we got the dragon squad logo here
best secrets of risings are going to pop
this open boom boom it looks like we got
some goodies over here this is a what is
this that's msi dragon mini series this
is pretty cool black and red of course
just like my color scheme I think this
will be a nice prop on my desk maybe
I'll open this up later
we also got a risin 5 GPU I think this
one is the 1600 X so actually I think I
have two of these now officially so I
think I might do a giveaway on this I
don't know let me know if you guys are
interested in that in the comment
section and also on the bottom of the
box we've got the msi tomahawk be 350
motherboard stops open real quick
huge shout out to AMD and i'm aside for
the hook-up you guys are awesome
that is a good-looking motherboard all
black with some grey and red accents
really nice once again thank you to AMD
n MSI for being and it's down here and
also for the awesome hookup
the days just beginning guys it will be
vlogging this entire is actually next
2-3 days and show I got some really cool
stuff at one of em these headquarters
let's go
crazy to me that this is the first time
that we've had you guys in because we've
had a partnership for forever so the
entire 10 years that I've been here I
worked really closely with MSI you know
in order to innovate and to drive things
being a smaller competitor you know
compared to some of our other
competitors we have to do things in a
different way the first one gigahertz
GPU so we make the Asics that's the core
of MSI graphics card and so there were a
lot of firsts that were in the industry
and we power the ps4 we you and that the
Xbox one and there are even some you
know new consoles that have been
announced that we will continue to drive
that innovation we just got them from
AMD's presentation now we're here at the
cafeteria which by the way it's awesome
probably the coolest cafeteria I've ever
been in to be honest and we're having
some lunch I got myself a chicken
flatbread sandwiches freaking awesome I
would say pick a nine out of ten and of
course gotta finish it off with dessert
lovely little outlets as a strawberry
cupcake anyway after this we're going to
go back in there and I think we're gonna
do some b-roll of the pretty cool
motherboards that they're showcasing as
well as someone FTP so stay tuned so
that we got invited to one of the AMD
briefing rooms and here MSI's displays
some of their a.m. for motherboard
lineup ranging from the Arsenal category
all the way up to their enthusiast
Edition like their ex 370 XPower
titanium MSI not only has four different
categories of motherboards but they are
actually the only company out there with
the most models as well eighteen
different am for socket motherboards
just for rising with more on the way
they got pretty much every type of
motherboard perfect for your budget and
color scheme they also come with some
pretty cool features like mystic light
which is a software that lets you
control all RGB lights from compatible
parts inside your case like GPU Ram
stick motherboard and even RGB LED
strips you can pretty much synchronize
them all together and create some pretty
cool light shows inside your PC or if
RGB isn't your thing you can always keep
the lights static or just turn them off
another cool feature on these boards is
the m-dot - shield which is actually the
first in the industry basically it's a
steel armor plate that covers the m-dot
to SSD which is claimed to keep the
temperatures down for increased
performance and to protect the SSD from
getting damaged but to me personally I
just think it looks cool and it's a
great way to hide those and that two
drives with ugly PCBs and finally a XMP
which is the world's first one second
ddr4 performance and stability feature
basically you can set your memory
timings and speed to its optimal
settings in a single click for the best
performance and stability and then we
got invited to their demo room which
basically showcased a lot of real-world
use of their processors like slot
machines and casinos you got the Mac Pro
which is running AMD chips and fun facts
for those of you that didn't know both
ps4 and Xbox one are using AMD
processors they also set up a demo
showing the rendering speeds of the 7700
K and 1800 X which are running the same
GTX 1080
obviously the system with the 1800 X is
rendering out the image faster because
it has double the core count and I did
do a more in-depth benchmark comparison
with the 1800 X and other processors so
make sure to check that out if you guys
are interested also another fun fact
that is actually one of the first
companies to get invited for a campus
tour at a Indies headquarters in Austin
Texas
so that about wraps up the vlog I hope
you guys enjoyed it
huge thinks that I'm a sign Envy for
bringing us down here in Austin Texas to
check out what of AMD's headquarters
these past few days have been a blast
thank you guys so much for that anyways
thank you so much for watching I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
