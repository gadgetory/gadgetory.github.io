what I'm looking for in these
submissions but anyways with that said
look the setup boards begin hey guys so

cd-key for less than 15 freakin dollars
but if you guys use the code ts 20 you
can get an extra 20% off from your CD
case comm so check the link below if
you're interested this is crazy
kicking off the episode as Colin from
Colorado and his ridiculous wooden
themed setup that he uses for pretty
much everything from gaming
entertainment and design like I keep
saying in previous episodes wood is not
my cup of tea but Colin over here makes
it look real good and I officially got
wood from this pic and you know what I
just noticed his plaque on top of his PC
that right there is my official set up
wars seal of approval plaque that I give
to people with a perfect set up okay so
this guy was from episode 56 back in
June 2016 and goddamn his setup has
changed by a lot since then I also
noticed he had went back then as well if
you know what I mean so tomorrow choices
are interesting here and I like that he
wins with a single ultra right in the
center which is sandwiched by two 22
inch new Sonic monitors there's no
reason why anyone should put two let
alone three ultra wide side by side
other than to flex and show off let's be
realistic here your eyes can't see that
wide so why on earth would you put two
or even three ultra wide side-by-side
you literally have to like lean in to
see what's going on on the corner of the
monitors I mean to be fair even Colin's
monitor setup is a bit wide for me but
if it works for him then so be it
on top of the triple displays is a
massive 50-inch 4k TV as an overhead and
all that is mounted against the wall
with a couple
ways to hide the wires going down and
behind his setup on the desk he's still
using the corsair strafe RGB keyboard
from before but he did replace his MX
master mouse for a logitech g502 I also
like that he drill a hole in his desk
for both wires and speaking of the desk
it's custom made from beetle kill pine
wood and resin which is what that blue
translucent material is going across the
surface you can actually look up resin
tabletops they look pretty cool some of
the stuff he has on a desk are his
crystal pokeball of alakazam and a few
Xbox one controllers with bee brand
skins he did a really great job keeping
the surface clean and minimalistic I
also noticed that he kept the same
microphone as before but this time he
mounted it on a boom arm next to his
bookshelf speakers the only other audio
source he has are the a th and 50 X's
which are hanging from the side of the
desk and this is also where he keeps his
Xbox one console neatly tucked away
underneath his desk while we're down
here let's take a look at the cable
management looks like he did a great job
keeping the wires hidden behind the back
board and I just realized what those
pipes are used for actually I thought
the monitors in TV were mounted against
the wall but it actually turns out it's
mounted on a giant piece of wood that's
being supported by the metal pipes
that's interesting that is actually a
really smart way of not damaging or
poking holes into your walls so kudos to
you good sirs finally let's take a look
at the PC that has been upgraded the
most senses last time on the show real
quickly this is what his PC looked like
over two years ago it's nice to see some
up-to-date specs like the 6700 K 16 gigs
of ram and the asus strix 1070 nicely
done I also like the custom woodwork on
the front panel of the PC and the
drawers once again it's not my cup of
tea but since the desk is so huge it
does blend perfectly with it and keeps
the theme consistent throughout the
setup excellent attention to detail and
organization you have taken a great
setup and made it even better Thank You
Colin for entering and Congrats on that
nice upgrade next up is a fellow
Armenian from LA his name is ho-ho
I'm surprised you didn't mention
anything in the notes about being
Armenia and B
I don't know if you know this by its yes
LM high so this is the setup he uses for
gaming and watching movies he's rocking
the 34 inch ultra wide gaming monitor
from Asus and the cursor k95 Platinum
keyboard with the Wireless razor Mamba
mouse I like what he did with his
speakers it's actually very clever
they're sitting on wall shelves and
because the wall is covered in the
acoustic foams he's able to route the
wires behind them for a cleaner look now
one thing I would have done differently
was maybe use some red acoustic foams to
give off some nice contrast between the
black foams especially since there are
some red accents across the setup and
inside the PC or option number 2 would
have been to paint the IKEA shelves in
red which would have made them pop more
since the speakers and the foams are
both in black but that's just my taste I
do like where he keeps his headphones he
has them hanging from the left side of
the desk when he's not using them and
that's also where he charges them along
with the switch
very nice kataoka me bon Hardison L at
Naqada match of Karen I'm gonna feel
really dumb if you don't speak Armenian
I'm just talking to myself in Armenian
but yeah if you understood what I said
let me know in the comment section so
the TV up top isn't exactly centered
with a setup and he offered an
explanation in the notes stating that
the studs on the wall prevented him from
centering at which I can understand the
cable management is very clean I love
that he took advantage of the acoustic
foams and basically routed most of the
wires behind it and out from the bottom
behind the drawer with the help of a
channel race waves nicely done the
massive PC on the desk is packing some
nice specs as well it's got the 7700 K
32 gigs of ram and the Strix 1080 TI 32
gigs of ram is definitely overkill just
for gaming and watching movies which
leads me to believe that you picked up
three two gigs just to fill all four
slots of the motherboard I'm not gonna
give you any hate because this literally
sounds like something I would do
I also love how clean the build is
custom cable sleeves and the a IO
sleeping kit from cable mod is
definitely a nice addition I just what
I'd love to see more red across your
setup now it doesn't have to be
over-the-top but some red accents would
be really nice
there are some nice mouse pads on Amazon
with red stitching which would look
really nice and even some skins on the
Xbox would spice things up and really
bring together your entire setup I think
that you have a solid foundation here
but I feel like with some minor tweaks
you can definitely improve the aesthetic
of your setup Thank You ho-ho for
entering coming out number three is john
from canada and this awesome vici
inspired so actually never mind about
that we got a Captain America shield and
he's spider-man right in the center so
actually now that I'm looking at it it
looks like DC is on the left and we got
Marvel on the right but anyways back to
the setup he's rocking an ultra light
from LG that's mounted on the wall and
below that is the razor or not a chroma
keyboard and he logitech g502 proteus
mouse i like the cable management but i
have concerns about the cable slack of
that mouse is it me or does it look like
there is just not enough slack there so
a fun fact about john he actually used
to be a hardcore console peasants before
watching my channel till today he
actually has over 300 games across I
think four consoles he said I couldn't
be more proud that you are now part of
the PC master-race welcome I do have to
give points to John for his amazing
coordination just look at the symmetry
it is on point from the centred wall
shelf up top to both the Zelda swords
and even the shelves holding up the
collectibles well done good sir Bharati
I was rocking a pair of Logitech
speakers which he ended up painting to
match the color scheme and he's also got
a say DS gaming headset hanging from the
side of the desk I loved what he did
with the wire management so he used a
bracket that he picked up from Home
Depot to wrap the cables around that's
actually very clever all the
collectables around the setup are nice
and it definitely adds personality don't
get me wrong but I much prefer things
that are unique and cannot be bought or
replicated for example the art that your
wife painted the Joker we got Kratos
from God of War and that badass venom
vs. spider-man paintings had way more
personality than any figurine or
collectible because it's unique and it
also has sentimental value cables are
hidden behind a desk very well with the
help of some channel raceways covering
the monitor wires and also looks like we
have a cable sleeve wrapping up the
wires behind the pea
see it's not the best-looking rig out
there which makes sense why it's on the
ground but it does pack some serious
juice we got the 47 19 on K version 16
gigs of RAM and 1080 founders Edition
which is plenty for a 1080p gaming a
very impressive setup with lots of
personality and the symmetry just gives
me more wood than the first setup
featured on SEPA so d thank you John for
entering at number 4 is Rob from
Montreal and his mancave so he's got a
TV set up for console gaming and
watching videos while the other set up
on the right is used for gaming taking
coding courses and the occasional fab
session why do people keep writing down
the notes so he's rocking three monitors
all of them are different models so my
OCD just kicked in that's great the desk
itself is pretty straightforward we got
the elimin tabletop with an Alex your as
support I do advise against the lemon
tabletop because it's not really built
well especially for a triple monitor
setup and you'll start to see bowing in
the center just like Rob's setup I
always search people who are going with
a multi-monitor setup to avoid linman
tabletops for this very reason they are
not built well guys there's a reason why
it's this cheap
I recommend shopping in the kitchen
counter top section of Ikea if you must
buy a table top separately these are
built much better and can support more
weight for peripherals we got another or
not a chroma key board from Razer paired
with the Mamba however this time he has
an extra mouse which I'm guessing is
used for specific type of games probably
a memo if I'm not mistaken so I love the
hold that was modded in the desk before
the wires and this is actually
interesting he used another mouse pad
which sits underneath the sound bar and
provides padding for his other tech but
it also covers the wire from the
keyboard
kind of like a multi-purpose mousepad
other than the sound bar he does have a
razer kraken headset hanging from
underneath the desk and i just noticed
this collection of World of Warcraft
I don't know if he's still playing but I
started playing at the end of BC and I
quit one week into Cataclysm and that
game literally sucked
three years of my life away but you know
what it was fun
ko Management is interesting so we have
a power strip that's mounted on the wall
instead of underneath the desk
some reason maybe because of the weight
but either way it's a pretty clean job
down here I also like how we use cable
clips to route and keep the wires from
hanging down good work
now the PC is using is a prebuilt but I
do agree behind his reasoning back then
GPU prices was ridiculous because of
cryptocurrency and believe it or not it
was way cheaper buying a prebuilt
instead of building your own because of
that so the TV setup on the other side
is pretty sick he's literally got a
gaming chair this thing is hooked up to
a pro flight X 56 system plus he's got
his ps4 console the only thing I would
recommend later down the line if you do
end up changing your monitors is getting
a different tabletop something that's
more sturdy but other than that I'm
definitely digging this man cave I think
you did a great job putting everything
together
thank you well before entering wrapping
up the episode with Skyler with this
very clean and ultra wide gaming setup
so he's rocking the x34 from Acer that's
hooked up to the wall and below that we
got the ps4 and some Corsair gear the
k70 RGB keyboard and the harpoon RGB
Mouse I feel like if I were ever to get
a wood tabletop for my setup it has to
have a glossy finish like this one I
feel like it looks way better than the
original / audio he's using the razer
kraken pro v2 headset which appears to
not have a dedicated place but he does
have logitech speakers as well nothing
fancy when it comes to cable management
who got the basic a cookie cutter setup
with the Parrish tip underneath the desk
and some cable clips holding up the
wires the PC is probably the coolest
part of this setup it looks pretty damn
amazing with the white and black color
scheme I like the white custom cables
and the MSI 1080 TI trio but what's up
with the RGB lighting from the RAM
sticks
I noticed the RGB lighting from the
keyboard and mouse as well I mean it's
not a big deal but I'm just curious why
the PC and some parts of the setup have
specific colors but the lighting is left
on the default RGB colour saree Garlits
if they dope set up pretty
straightforward nothing I can really
recommend here to improve Thank You
