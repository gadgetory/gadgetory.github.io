you got your CPU and GPU and most of the
parts figured out like you're kind of
slick on the storage you're thinking
should I save some money and go with the
hard drive or should I spend a little
bit more and pick up an SSD or maybe
even an MDOT - what if I told you you
can actually save money and get similar
speeds to that of an SSD by paying the
price of a hard drive I'm sure some of
you already heard of it it's called
octane memory where we basically combine
the Intel memory module with a hard
drive to increase the speed of the hard
drive so in this case the memory module
we are using is 16 gigs which will cost
you 150 bucks and a 4 terabyte hard
drive which cost a little over $800 this
puts you at a total of 166 dollars now
if you were to buy a 4 terabyte SSD
it's going to cost you a little bit
let's just say it's not even worth it
even if you guys buy 4 separate one
terabyte SSDs
you're looking at close to at least
$1000 anyways with the octane memory
combination not only do you get similar
speeds of an SSD but you get way more
storage imagine you guys have an 8
terabyte SSD right inside your PC that's
kind of what this is all about
you get SSD speeds much higher
capacities but at a hard drive price I
also want to thank Intel and Seagate
we're saying these parts in and
sponsoring this video so that I can test
these claims and see if it's really true
I also have some extra hardware which
I'll be giving away so make sure you
guys stick around to the end if you are
interested also guys keep in mind that
you need a motherboard that's octane
memory ready and has Windows 10 64 bit
installed so basically you will need a
keyblade processor as well as a
compatible motherboard currently the
only chips us that it supports are 270
and 250 but you guys have to make sure
to check with your motherboard
manufacturer it's also labeled right on
the box some other boards may even need
their BIOS flash in order to support opt
in memory so be sure to have that
updated as well you also need an m2 slot
so how it works is simple once you have
your hard drive plugged up to your PC
you will need to install the option
memory module right on your motherboard
now if your MDOT Siuslaw comes with a
shield simply pop it open and enter the
module inside @m screws in place after
that it's a matter of prepping the BIOS
and following the on-screen instructions
to set up everything I strongly
recommend you guys to watch the tutorial
video that way you don't run into any
problems installing this in your PC I'll
jump a link to a few of them down below
alright so how fast is this Intel op 10
memory module combined with a hard drive
compared to just a regular hard drive by
itself
well it'll be comparing transfer speeds
boot up times we'll be launching a few
applications as well as some games and
here are my findings alright so starting
off with the boot time as you can see a
significant decrease from 40 seconds all
the way down to 18 seconds the time
literally got cut intact launching
programs like Word or Excel takes about
two seconds on the octane memory and
hard drive combination which is a lot
quicker than the standalone hard drive
transfer speeds were also improved
significantly so I transferred 11 gigs
worth of 4k files and accelerate the
hard drive finished it in a minute and
17 seconds compared to almost three
minutes from the standalone hard drive
opening up editing programs like Vegas
Pro 14 took only one third of the time
and launching Chrome was practically
instant compared to two seconds on a
hard drive even searching files within
Windows is a lot faster it took 19
seconds to find a file I was searching
for from the start menu
compared to 47 seconds on the hard drive
and then I tested a bunch of games by
starting it up and also loaded a few
games so you guys will notice that the
speed than most of the games are nearly
half of the speeds compared to the hard
drive
whether you are launching the game or
loading a save game you will notice a
substantial difference in lo times
so in conclusion it's actually a pretty
simple one if you guys already own
hardware that's compatible with Intel
octane memory it just doesn't make sense
to not take advantage of those extra
speeds all you have to do is pick up and
all you have to do is pick up an Intel
obtain memory module which cost you
about 50 bucks and you can combine it
with the hard drive that you already own
your PC now you don't have a hard drive
or don't even have a PC and are planning
to build one that I strongly recommend
combining the Intel optic memory with
the Seagate fourth terabyte hard drive
with this combo you guys get the most
bang for your buck you get high-capacity
storage and speeds similar to SSDs at a
cost of a hard drive seriously you guys
get massive amounts of storage like 4
terabytes and you get speeds similar to
SSDs but at a fraction of the cost
that's pretty crazy the only downside I
see going with this route is if your
motherboard only has one MDOT 2 slots
then you have to really decide what you
want should you spend a little bit more
and get an m2 SSD which is a lot faster
than anything I talked about in this
video but you get much less storage or
you get the Intel optic memory 6 and you
combine it with the hard drive and get
way more storage and similar speeds to
that if SSDs that is the question you
need to ask yourself so that is it for
the video as I mentioned before I will
be giving away 5 4 terabyte Seagate hard
drives and 5 Intel octane memory modules
to my subscribers so if you guys want to
enter to win one all you have to do is
leave a like and comment down below what
do you think about this video what are
your thoughts on combining the octane
memory module with a hard drive to get
SSD speeds at a fraction of the price
anyways I hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
