Texas and today I'm going to be
comparing the camera and video on both
the galaxy s5 and the HTC One and mate
so Before we jump into it let's go over
some camera specs real quick the HTC One
m8 has a four ultra pixel rear-facing
camera with a 2.0 aperture which should
allow for more light absorption and
ultimately leads to better night shots
while the Samsung has an aperture of 2.2
and a 16 megapixel camera which is great
for editing and cropping so without
further ado let's sit back relax and
look at some samples
so here are some shots we took under
low-light conditions even though the m8
has a lower aperture the s5 clearly does
better under low-light conditions it
just goes to show you that specs aren't
everything here's another example of
low-light shot and this time we use the
flash on both bones to see the
difference and it's pretty obvious here
that the s5 has a much clearer picture
than the m8 another thing we looked at
was the HDR feature and this allows for
greater dynamic range between the
lightest part of an image and the
darkest part so I want you guys to pay
attention to the part under the tree
while HDR is off and this is what it
looks like when using HDR so you can
clearly see a big difference there
however with the HTC One m8 the
difference is much greater when
comparing the before and after shot
another feature we took samples of was
the s5 selective focus this first
picture has the sine and the background
in focus and when I use the selective
focus feature we can blur the background
although it's not really that accurate
since the s5 uses software to do this
the m8 however utilizes its second
sensor to complete the same task but
with more accuracy
when it comes to cropping the 16
megapixel on the s5 really comes in
handy
seeing as you can crop it all the way to
75% while still maintaining a beautiful
shot however the same can't be said with
the four megapixel m8 camera the more
you crop the worse it gets
here's a quick shot taken with the front
facing camera on both phones and we can
clearly see that the m8 does a much
better job due to its higher megapixel
front-facing camera when it comes to
video the s5 definitely has an edge
because it can record in 4k
however the m8 has a more vivid color
contrast than the s5 it also appears to
be less shaky while moving around and
while neither the camera has a built-in
stabilizer the m8 stabilization software
does a much better job than the s5
when it comes to autofocusing the s5
wins hands down as they claim to have
the fastest autofocusing when it comes
to smartphones which is at point three
seconds the difference is honestly
minuscule picking a phone because of how
fast that focuses shouldn't even be on
the list nonetheless a super fast
autofocus is always nice to have so
which phone is the best when it comes
down to their cameras I wish it was a
simple answer but both have their
strengths and weaknesses I personally
choose the s5 because I usually edit my
pictures and the 16 megapixel camera
definitely comes in handy not to mention
it's more true to life than the MA when
it comes to pictures and the fact that
it can shoot 4k is also a huge plus the
m8 on the other hand shoots better
pictures when it comes to outdoors and
it's a great phone for people who take a
lot of selfies and not to mention the
software on the m8 is much better than
the s5 when it comes to image
stabilization anyways that's it for the
video if you guys enjoyed it feel free
to leave a like if you didn't you can
dislike the video and let me know in the
comments section what you guys think
about the cameras this is at from tech
source and I will see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
