welcome to the best tech deals of the
week for my UK and Canada followers make
sure to check out the links below got
some really awesome deals for you guys
out there so the first deal i want to
share with you guys is this really
awesome vacuum by anger it's the
quietest vacuum I've ever heard it's
super light and probably the coolest
thing about this is that it's wireless
there is a charging base that you can
attach it to that will give you 60
minutes of use in normal mode and the
amount of dirt this thing picks up in
just a few seconds is crazy the suction
power is pretty insane on this little
guy it is a two-in-one vacuum which
means that you can detach the body and
have a handheld version for those super
tight spaces this isn't a sponsored
video or anything and you just decided
to reach out and give you guys a great
deal on their awesome vacuums you can
get up for nearly thirty percent off
using the code on the screen I'll go and
drop a link below if anyone is
interested alright guys so I'm not a
huge fan of refurbished products since
everything i buy has to be brand new but
I know people out there do so I might go
over to really great deals the first one
is an unlocked iphone 5c that's going
for only 125 bucks it also comes with
the ugly-ass Apple k so not a bad deal
another great deal you can find on ebay
is this refurbished xbox one that comes
with three games and 500 gigabytes of
space for only 239 it sold more than
seventy four percent of its stock so
hopefully there are a few left by the
time you're watching this video the last
two deals on ebay are brand new we have
a 55 inch 4k smart TV from Sony going
for only 900 bucks with free shipping
and a smaller 50 inch from LG going for
only 388 but keep in mind that this is
1080p and not 4k we have a bunch of
great deals on amazon so imma zoom
through it as quick as possible nine
dollars on a microsoft wireless mouse 35
bucks on a pair of four gigabyte ram
sticks from kingston which is perfect
for budget builds an asus strix gtx 960
going for 200 bucks and an HP 21.5 inch
IPS monitor for only one hundred dollars
you get a 60 Hertz refresh rate but a
seven millisecond response time which
isn't great for gaming but for
productivity and media consumption it's
perfect I haven't featured a laptop in a
wild in these episodes so this Asus one
is not only the best seller on amazon
but it's also knocked down on price to
three hundred and seventy dollars all
the specs are listed on there so i won't
go over it to save some time my most
favorite power bank that i use
religiously every day is also on sale
for only thirty bucks and this is the
anchor power cord that i take everywhere
with me if you only got ten bucks in
your pocket and I looking for a really
solid bluetooth speaker for the money
then this is something you guys need to
check out and finally let's take a look
at some good deals on games diablo 3
reaper of souls expansion is going for
twenty bucks on pc while starcraft 2 is
going for only ten dollars both of which
are great games running up the episode
are a few deals from newegg first up we
have the sapphire r9 380 that's going
for only 180 bucks after the initial
savings and the 15-dollar mail in rebate
if you are patiently waiting for a great
deal on an SSD well your time has paid
off you can pick up a 960 gigabyte SSD
from sandisk for only two hundred bucks
it's currently one of the twenty dollars
off making it one of the best deals on
an SSD that I have ever seen newegg is
also having a sale on three intel cpus
which ends on the second of april the 58
20k 47 ATK and the 46 90 k all are
discounted for a limited time we got a
pretty sweet 29 inch ultra wide monitor
from Samsung that's forty five percent
off on newegg flash and a pair of JBL
bookshelf speakers for only 44 bucks
there are a few more deals being
released on the 29th and 30th that I
can't see the price on but if you guys
are interested in an r 7 360 or even a
24 inch 144 hurts gaming monitor you
should probably bookmark this page and
check back on these days and i will do
it for this week's episode thank you so
