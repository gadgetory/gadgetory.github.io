unlocking company the fastest and most
affordable way to unlock your phone we
have seen budget 4k monitors from
Samsung Dell and now Asus has released
one of their own
since Asus took their time and came in
last will therefore came honor be better
than its competition that's what we are
here to find out this is at from tech
source and let's get this started
so this monitor starts around six
hundred forty nine dollars and it is
priced to compete with both the Dell and
Samsung actually Dells 4k monitor does
not even compete in this bracket because
its refresh rate is only thirty Hertz
running on 4k which is why we didn't
even bother doing a video on it but we
are going to be comparing the Asus 4k
monitor with our samsung 4k monitor in
the next video so those of you that want
to see that make sure to stick around if
you do decide to pick one of these up
then you can expect to find an HDMI
cable inside followed by a DisplayPort
and the actual base mount and lastly the
power cable taking a look at the monitor
I noticed that the bezels are relatively
the same size as Samsung's coming in a
little over than half an inch another
thing that I noticed is that this
monitor does not have buttons on the
screen also like the Samsung model
instead they are located in the back
which is once again a terrible idea it
can get really confusing figuring out
which button you are supposed to press
and I'm not sure why Asus decided to go
with this route I gotta say that the
Asus monitor is built really sturdy they
did a great job on the mount and it
allows you to adjust it quite a bit
allowing you to tilt the monitor up to
20 degrees since it has a TN panel you
have to be able to position it in a way
where you can view it perfectly and this
map gives you all the options to do just
that the height is adjustable and you
can also rotate the entire monitor
vertically and have a triple monitor to
set up if that's something you're into
the best part about this is that the
monitor also has VESA mount so she
decided to mount your monitor then you
can do that as well
also on the back are the ports now this
is something that bothers me personally
but I hate when the ports are facing
downwards it makes it really
inconvenient to connect cables ASIS they
do something to mitigate this situation
they added this removable panel which
makes connecting the cables a little
more convenient but I would still prefer
them to use a method similar to
Samsung's monitor speaking of ports down
here you will find all the necessary
connections starting with the power
followed by two HDMI which are capped to
30 Hertz one DisplayPort 1.2 that runs
in 60 Hertz and lastly your slots for
audio the color on the monitor however
is great the monitor uses 10-bit color
which means that it provides for a
smooth color gradation for a more
natural-looking transition between hues
the monitor also adopts flicker free
technology which essentially clears out
distracting flickers that would show up
on the screen the monitor also uses eye
care technology which enable reading and
darkroom modes which reduce the levels
of blue light to ensure less eye strain
and longer hours of use without fatigue
as I said earlier it is a TN panel which
means that the viewing experience will
change depending on the angle of the
monitor hence why asus gave you a
versatile amount used to make sure that
you are getting the best possible
viewing angle so what do I think about
the asus 4k monitor I think for the
price and what it brings to the table it
is definitely a solid competitor when it
comes to budget 4k monitors the only
real competition that this monitor has
is the Samsung model which we are going
to do a video on next comparing the two
side-by-side and then and only then will
I have a final verdict there are quite a
few features that the asus monitor has
that the Samsung does not end vice versa
but make sure to stick around for our
comparison video coming up shortly this
is that from Texas and I will catch you
in the next video
