source and welcome to yet another detail
camera comparison test this time we are
facing off the iPhone 6s plus against
the galaxy note 5 but Before we jump
into the samples let's take a quick look
at the specs the iPhone 6s plus has a 12
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.2 that can shoot up to 4k
resolution whereas the galaxy note 5 has
a 16 megapixel camera with a 1.9
aperture that can also shoot up to 4k
resolution profile facing cameras the
iPhone 6s plus has a 5 megapixel camera
that can shoot up to 720p and the note
5s 5 megapixel camera can shoot up to
1440p so without we singing over time
let's sit back relax and take a look at
some samples
when it comes to water focusing the 6s
Plus does a great job it utilizes its
focus pixels feature to detect the
object quickly and focus with 100%
accuracy the note 5 has blazing fast
focusing speeds and it's a lot faster
than the iPhone 6s and I find that funny
because last year it was the complete
opposite it seems like the roles have
been reversed for daytime video both
phones shoot really crispy video at 4k
resolution the note 5 has a much wider
field of view and has much warmer colors
compared to the cooler colors of the
iPhone 6s the iPhone ever has a better
dynamic range if you guys pay attention
to the mountains in the back you can see
that it's overexposed on the note 5
whereas it's not so much on the 6s when
it comes to low-light video the note 5
appears to have brighter and more clear
footage then again it's kind of expected
with an aperture of only 1.9 compared to
the iPhones 2.2 there's also a lot less
noise from the note 5 footage for the
stabilization test both phones were shot
in 4k resolution and were strapped on a
device to ensure a very accurate
stabilization reading and from the
footage is evident that the Galaxy Note
5 has a much better optical image
stabilization what's up guys and welcome
to the front-facing video and microphone
quality test portion of the video
between the iPhone 6s plus and the
galaxy note 5
both of the cameras are being shot in
its highest resolution and also there'll
be an audio icon somewhere on the screen
that will indicate which phone's audio
is being used also if you guys are
listening to this on your headphones you
can hear the background noise and I'm
going to stay quiet for a bit
for front-facing video the note 5 not
only has a much wider field of view but
sharper footage as well thanks to its
higher resolution the dynamic range
however is slightly more balanced on the
6s as it doesn't completely over expose
the background like it does on the note
5 in some of the situations for the
microphone test the note 5 has a much
louder and clearer mic which also picks
up a bunch of background noise whereas
the 6s is more on the quiet side picking
up less background noise let's take a
look at daylight pics so as I said
before the note 5 shoots more on the
warmer side whereas the 6s sticks to the
cooler colors I also find that the
sharpness on both photos identical
despite the note 5 having more
megapixels which is pretty odd but it is
consistent throughout all the photos for
selfies I really like the wider field of
view that the note 5 offer is however
the colors tend to be a bit more
saturated and you can tell by comparing
the color of my shirt exposure is
another thing that the 6s does well the
dynamic range is one of the best I've
seen in any smartphone and it's
consistent through every picture though
no 5 does have an overall brighter image
but at the cost of over exposing some
areas mostly the skies you can't even
see the clouds on any of the note 5
pictures whereas it's completely visible
on the iPhone 6s now if we're talking
about true-to-life colors the iPhone 6s
pictures are the most accurate the
slightly oversaturated pics from the
note 5 throw off the accuracy of the
colors my subscribe pillow in real life
is more accurately portrayed by the
picture from the 6s and the same goes
for the mustard bottle kickstart drink
and the Cricut box full of light
performance both cameras do a fine job
the difference is very minimal but these
6s actually does better and here are a
few examples the number on the door in
the shot is somewhat readable on the 6s
where it's kind of blurry on the note 5
another example is a picture of this
mouse you can still see the designs on
the poker table right above the mouse
whereas it's much darker on the note 5
and lastly the most obvious one out of
all the picture is the 6s image is
overall much brighter than the note 5
that's but at least we have the flash
and honestly both phones have a really
great flash so no complaints there so
both phones have exceptional cameras and
they also have their own strengths and
weaknesses I honestly can't pick a
winner in here but the results were
right in front of you so let me know
which phone you think has an overall
better camera the 6s or the note 5
so that does it for this video if you
guys enjoy my camera comparisons feel
free to hit that like button and let me
know which phone you want to see go up
against the success by dropping a

for watching and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
