the dumbest reasons and I know that I
have over a million loyal subscribers

guys make me wake up every single day
with a smile on my face and you make
this job so much fun so I just want to
seriously thank you guys from the bottom
of my heart so that's that's all I
wanted to say so with that said let's uh
welcome to setup wars episode 79 let the
set up wars begin

keys available for pretty much any game
I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out as always you
guys can find it gear for everyone
setups link down below also if I
recommend anything in this episode I'll
also link that down below as well so
your five contestants for this week are
Andray dunno Jason Joe and Sakura I'm
sorry if I butchered any names as always
you guys know I'm bad at names so I'm
really sorry let's go and start off the
episode so starting off the show we have
Andre with a pretty sick gaming room so
he has a PC setup on one side and a
console setup on the other very nice so
on the main desk key is using a massive
BenQ 32 inch monitor hooked up to my
favorite monitor mount of all time which
is the freedom arm and then time
watching the monitor are a pair of Adam
f5 speakers which are being held up with
some pretty interesting stands he also
has the e element z77 keyboard with a
real cat tie and mouse which are resting
on the odd valve trestle desk I think
that's how you say it
so for audio he does have a snowball mic
hooked up to a boom arm and a pair of
AKG k7 xx's hanging from the side the
LED clock does look pretty cool on your
desk but if you want something to match
with the wood tabletop a wooden LED
clock would personally look better and
if anyone is interested I'll drop a link
to it down below cable management on the
other hand is pretty good it looks like
the cables are on the bottom of the
table and I don't really have any
complaints the PC that's running the
setup has an unusual color scheme but it
does have a 4770k
and a gtx 980 overall this setup is put
together nicely thank you and Ray for
entering and sorry again if I butchered
your name Bruno Mars is next up with a
very clean looking black and blue ultra
white setup so he has the ESO x34
predator near the bottom and a massive
Sony TV near the top for console gaming
speaking of which look where he mounted
his ps4 console guys that's pretty sick
it also looks like he has a D brand skin
on that very nice on the IKEA mount desk
he has the Orion g8
keyboard any Logitech g600 two males
both of which are sitting on top of the
popular IKEA wristlet desk pad also on a
desk is a giant PC case which normally
would look weird compared to a smaller
monitor but because he is using an
ultra-light it's pretty balanced
speaking of which it's equipped with a
6800 k-6 core processor and two NVIDIA
GTX 1080 founders Edition graphics cards
Wow definitely a beast of a PC excellent
work with the cable management now
normally people would just dump their
cables on the rack but Bruno here
organized them well nice job
also down here is the EZ SMX wireless
headset but overall a pretty badass
black and blue setup Thank You Bruno for
entering and number three we have
another ultra white setup but this time
with a black and purplish color scheme
Jason too is using the acer x34 monitor
however for the peripherals he has the
courser strafe RGB ami onyx AVR sk mouse
on top of the mass drop extended mouse
pad for audio he has a pair of canto u 2
speakers and a Focusrite audio interface
which is custom painted and black to
match the setup now that's what I love
to see he does also have a late 2011
MacBook Pro near his PC which has a very
nice custom loop inside the NZXT master
case it's running on a 6700 K and an
EVGA gtx 980ti kingpin Edition graphics
card this thing is a beauty and finally
let's take a look at the cable
management it looks like everything is
hooked up behind the back board and away
from sight job well done a very nice
black and purple setup thank you Jason
for entering changing things up we have
Joe with a pretty cool white and blue
setup finally a refreshing color scheme
that we don't see as often now even
though there isn't much blue in this
setup it's still nice to see with the
combination of white so he has two
27-inch Samsung curved monitors hooked
up to the Wally mount which is resting
on a custom-made monitor riser from Ikea
underneath that is the Xbox one which is
skinned and black-and-white as well as
his surface book props ongoing with the
brands which is the best skin company
out there but everybody already knows
that for audio he is using to groove USB
speakers turtlebeach for 20 X
headphones and Astro a 50s hanging from
his PC which is running on an AMD 8350
and an r9 390x the keyboard is from red
dragon and it's the k550 mechanical
gaming keyboard which looks awesome by
the way
and he's also using the rapid v20 mouse
to complement the colors most people
don't get white mouse pads because they
get dirty real quickly so it's nice to
see that you got some guts I do want to
give you huge props for adding a drawer
underneath the desk to store your items
in I recommend these a lot on the show
and it's really nice to see someone
actually using it and finally the cable
management not a bad job to be honest I
mean there are some visible wires in the
corner over there but most of them are
off the ground so nothing to complain
here if you really want to clean things
up a bit a channel Raceway would help a
ton and once again I'll drop a link to
it down below a very sweet and subtle
white and blue setup thank you Joe for
spicing things up here on setup wars
finishing off strong we have saw Luke
with a mind-blowing triple monitor setup
god damn god damn indeed 324 inch dual
monitors hooked up on the wall with not
a single wire in sight on the custom
desk that he created himself which is
also mounted against the wall is the
cursor strafe RGB keyboard and m65 Sabre
mouse on top of the HyperX mousepad it
also looks like he went with some custom
key caps very nice for audio he is using
a pair of Logitech Z 200 speakers and an
audio technica M 30x headphones hanging
under the desk now this is just my OCD
talking but I would have loved to see
that quirky Nimbus clock in the center
of your setup instead of on the left so
that's more symmetrical but that's just
me being picky everything else is nicely
balanced you did such an excellent job
with the cable management and when you
even drilled holes for both the keyboard
and the mouse and everything is hidden
very very well
now let's take a look at the PC which
I'm sure everyone has been eyeing ever
since I showed this set up in the
beginning this water-cooled beast is
rocking a 6700 K and 2 Asus GTX 980 P is
in the coarser 780 T case absolutely
incredible if I may be picky here the
sli bridge isn't really contributing to
this amazing build and I would much
rather see a custom
did white SLI bridge but other than that
this thing is perfect even saw roofs
entire room is black and white I mean
the level of his consistency is
unmatched so huge props on that but
let's take a look at the main attraction
here ladies and gentlemen this here is a
custom-made water-cooled ps4 and Xbox
one system I'm guessing the ps4 is on
the left and the Xbox one is on the
right or vice versa I'm not really sure
which is which but this thing makes
Linus's water-cooled ps4 look like a
preschool arts and crafts project mad
