that back again from Texas and welcome
to setup wars episode 24 where you
submit your desk setup to get featured
on that channel if you guys are new to
the series and want to submit your setup
make sure to watch the video link down
below but with that said let the setup
wars begin
as always all of the gear for everyone
setups will be linked down below if
anyone is interested along with anything
I recommend in this video so that said
here are your 5 lucky contestants
Anthony Anton Charles Mahmud and Sean
congratulations for making it to setup
wars episode 24 first up we have Anthony
with a try display setup we have three
del 23 inch monitors with some sexy blue
LEDs to go with your wallpaper great job
on the color coordination on the desk we
have your wireless Logitech e x100
keyboard and mouse along with a few
other miscellaneous stuff on the desk as
well I don't know what it is with toy
cars but that seems pretty common on a
lot of setups
excellent job with cable management I
like how the IKEA table comes with a net
underneath to hide your cables in it's
definitely a nice feature
everything else is neatly wrapped and
zip tied so job well done I have no
complaints there a few things I like
about this setup is the fact that you
mounted your Kenwood surround sound
speakers in the wall and a desk lamp
that you attached near your window the
only thing I don't like is the wooden
pencil holder you have on the desk it
just feels like it doesn't belong there
I would either install a drawer under
your desk to keep those things in there
or better yet buy one of those plastic
containers and flip it on its side and
add some 3m tape on the top of it and
then you can stick that to the roof of
your desk with the open side facing
towards you that way you can store a
bunch of stuff in there with easy access
but y'all go to dropping link to the
container and the 3m tape if anyone of
you guys want to try that out for your
setup we have not much else to say a
pretty organized setup overall thank you
Anthony for entering Anton is next up
with a pretty minimalistic setup so we
have a 24-inch h2s monitor and a smaller
Dell 17 inch display next to it on the
table we have a CM storm rapid keyboard
and a Logitech G 700 s Mouse off to the
side we have a pair of hyper x
headphones resting on a self-made
headphone hanger that's just awesome we
also have some Insignia speakers needed
back and the ever-so-popular LED strips
cable management is
I don't even know what to say here I
guess it's good since it's technically
off the ground but it doesn't look like
it's organized or it doesn't have a
system going on a few things I like art
a collection of boxes you have to the
right side I definitely love showing off
quality products that I own and use
every day so kudos to that and I also
like the weird-looking Rock lamp that
you have next to your monitors it's
definitely something I haven't seen
before
and looks pretty dope this obviously
looks like a budget set up so I won't
give you crap about using the USPS box
as a monitor stand or your ghetto ass
headphone hanger sometimes you just have
to do with what you have and I'll give
you points for being creative
nonetheless Thank You Anton for entering
setup wars and number three we have
Charles with his dual setup first off I
like to point out that I love the black
and white contrast between the two
tables it looks like you swapped the
legs with each other and it looks really
nice I don't know about that pink PC
case though so the first set up we have
a 23 inch Samsung monitor a razer
blackwidow keyboard and a Logitech g9x
mouse also on a table we have a total
Beach x12 headset resting on the Xbox
360 yes I said 360 on the other desk we
have an acer v 5 laptop on top of the CM
storm cf-29 gaming laptop cooler but it
was that cute person over there he looks
very familiar I do have to give you a
point for that awesome replica of
Wheatley on your desk and for those of
you guys that don't know me I'm a huge
fan of half-life and portal so I got to
give you props for making an awesome
replica of Wheatley for your desk setup
you also did a great job on cable
management I really like those white
tubes you have on the floor that covers
the wires overall a very clean job now
let's take a look at your PC now
although I don't have anything against
pink cases I just don't see this going
well with your setup but yeah you have
to pretty dope setups Thank You Charles
for entering next up is Mahmood's
gorgeous white setup we have three
27-inch Dell 1440p monitors and that's
2560 by 1440 P resolution guys that's
not 1080p the displays are mounted on
the capstone monitor mounts which we
have seen previously on glasses set up
on episode 20 and on the desk we have a
Logitech k-8 hundred wireless keyboard
an MX performance mouse on the courser
extended mouse pad there's also a pair
of ath m50x BL headphones hanging from
the side of the desk cable management
couldn't be more perfect I really like
how the wires are hidden behind the
doors here and this also makes it
extremely convenient to access let's not
forget about that transformer looking PC
case you have from thermal pick that
thing is an absolute beast winning on a
4790k processor and a GTX 980 one thing
I really like about the accessories you
have are the tiny hands that's holding
up your remote for the LEDs I do see a
Bose Bluetooth speaker on the ground and
I know you don't want that giant thing
on your desk it just won't look good
there but it kind of looks out of place
on the floor as well so maybe grabbing a
small nightstand or even an extra drawer
would prove to not only be useful but
you also will have a dedicated place for
the speakers other than that I have
nothing else to say I mean everything
from the granite floor to the white
table and even the backdrop not to
mention the sexy looking office chair
just goes so damn well together by far
one of the most gorgeous and elegant
setups I have seen by far
and what I've given this a 10 out of 10
seal of approval if it weren't for the
colors on those headphones that PC case
and the fact that the speakers are out
of place on the floor but nonetheless
it's an awesome setup Thank You Mahmud
for entering last but certainly not
least we have Sean from frosted gaming
he was actually featured on episode 10
before but since then he has changed
around his setup so this is his gaming
room we have three Acer 24 inch monitors
and a giant Samsung 4k Smart TV right
above which I'm guessing is used for
console gaming and watching videos at
least that's what I'll be using it for
on the desk we have a Corsair strafe RGB
keyboard with custom white caps a
logitech g502 gaming mouse and a few
headphones off to the side we have a
pair of turtlebeach XO 7s and ath m50x
and a courser H 2100 s on the other side
cable manager it was great before and
it's still great even till today it
looks like you routed them near the top
and behind your desk since you last the
mission you did build a new PC as well
it seems this bad boy is running the new
skylake 6700 K which is overclocked to
5.2 gigahertz that's just ridiculous
it also has 16 gigabytes of plan around
from coarser and a GTX
980ti which is also overclocked to 1390
megahertz that's one hell of a beasty
got there man I do gotta say that you
have a bunch of stuff on your desk and
there's some JBL speakers near the back
of the monitors and even some stuff on
the shelves above but you know what they
all have their place and it's well
organized I'm diggin the acoustic films
you have on the wall and the LEDs behind
your setup and even under your bed this
is one badass gaming room and I think
you Shawn for entering setup boards
again so before I end this episode I'm
gonna give you huge thanks to Harry's
for making this video possible
they basically send shaving supplies
straight to your door now I know for a
fact there's a bunch of you guys out
there that hate shopping for razors
because I feel the exact same way you go
to a store you look for the razor you
want but they're locked up you're in the
glass window and then you end up paying
a crap-ton for them
Harry's sends everything you need for
the perfect shave straight to your
doorstep you get a premium german-made
razor handle two extra blade cartridges
and your choice of shaving cream or gel
for just 15 bucks for the starter pack
but you guys use the Kotex source you
can knock off an extra five bucks off
your first purchase but seriously guys
I've been shaving with this thing the
past week now and the razors are
extremely sharp but I also like how the
blade contours my face for a complete
smooth shave
obviously you don't have to believe me

guys can try it for yourself but make
sure to use the Kotex source to get that
discount all right so don't forget to
