functional PC build that be quiet pure
bass 680 X tower is what you're looking
for it's completely sound insulated with
dampening materials in all the relevant
places features a modular design with
removable ODB and hard drive bays for
various cooling solutions and it comes
pre-installed with two pure wings two
fans one of the things I love about this
case is the cable management area there
are plenty of pass throughs and grommets
to help with cable management something
I don't often see in most cases the pure
bass 600 comes with a three year
warranty and it's available in black and
silver accents if you want to learn more
check out the first link down below
what's up guys it's there from tech
stores and just as I promised I'm
bringing you with quick benchmark
comparison between the eight core r7
1700 and a quad core i7 7700 k if you
somehow missed my previous comparison
between these 1700 X and the 18 and X
that went up against the 6800 kme 69 and
okay that I'll be sure to link that down
below so the test beds are exactly the
same nothing has changed from the
previous benchmarks
other than the CPUs of course and for
overclocks I pushed the 7700 K to 5
gigahertz with a core voltage of 1 point
3 to 5 whereas the 1700 was overclocked
to 3.9 gigahertz also on a one point
three to five core voltage so that
wasting our time ladies and gentlemen
let's jump into the benchmark
I said it once before and I will say it
again the r7 1700 is a solid gaming and
productivity cpu the 7700 K just can't
compete with multi-threaded applications
if you do both gaming and editing the
1700 is the obvious choice here of
course you are missing out on some fps
and gaming the 7700 K is still currently
the king and of gaming or screaming is
all you do on your PC then you won't
find a better value than these 7700 K it
clearly offers the best bang for your
buck at point 38 frames per dollar
once overclock but that doesn't but it's
quick benchmark comparison as always if
you guys enjoy the video be sure to hit
that like button and if you haven't
subscribed be sure to do so for more PC
contents I'm ed from tech stores and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
