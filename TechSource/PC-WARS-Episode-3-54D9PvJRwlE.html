a channel and a chance to win a hundred
bucks if you guys are new to the series
and want to submit your setup need to
watch the video linked down below but
without any more wasting time
but without wasting it every time let
the PC wars begin
this video is brought to you by g2a
where you can buy super cheap CD keys
for any game on any platform this is
where I get all my games from as well as
Windows Keys for my monthly PC builds
but I'll leave a link down below so you
can see for yourself as always all of
the PC parts will be linked down below
for anyone that is interested but
without wasting overtime here are your 5
chosen for this week we have average
Reno's any Jesse Chris Seth and David
congratulations for making the 2 PC wars
episode press first up we have average
Reno's sadly there was no name given so
all I have is the PC name you have an
Intel i7 4790k at 4.0 gigahertz paired
with the EVGA GTX Titan X inside the
awesome liam lee pc case we also have 16
gigabytes of platinum ram at 2400
megahertz and a swift tech cpu cooler
for benchmarks we have a score of 13,000
991 for fire strike which is pretty good
with just a single Titan X I would
definitely say that the case looks
awesome with the glass window now if
you're going to be showing off parts
inside such an expensive case like that
I would at least add white LEDs along
the side and maybe even replace those
stock cables but other than that it's a
very clean and beautiful build thank you
for entering next up is any with an all
black build we have an i7 59 30k
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz that's also
paired with two gtx 980ti is kingpin
edition
we also have 16 gigabytes of Corsair
Vengeance Ram at 3000 megahertz and an H
100 GTX CPU cooler take a look at
benchmarks we got a whopping score of
22,000 for seven which puts this thing
way at the top taking the lead for this
episode I'm definitely digging the
custom black cables the black fans and
even your custom painted EVGA bridge the
parts go well with your entire scheme
job well done and thank you for entering
PC Wars next up is Jessie we have an i5
4690k GTX 970 superclocked Edition
inside the coarser carbide spec oh three
case we also have 16 gigabyte of HyperX
ram at 1866 megahertz any cooler master
hyper t4 to keep things cool we're
benchmarks it scored a 93 39 which puts
this PC at the number three spot for
this episode
nothing too fancy here is a pretty nice
budget build although I think 16
gigabytes wasn't necessary for this
configuration unless you are a heavy
editor and before we have Chris set with
yet another Intel build it doesn't seem
like AMD is getting much love on these
episodes but anyways we have a 4790k
clock - 4.4 and - EVGA gtx 980ti s and
sli inside the courser 350 d case for
ram we have four sticks of four
gigabytes of 2400 megahertz and the
popular coarser h100 eye cooler for
benchmarks that scored a 14,000 883 for
the extreme tests instead of the regular
so we don't know if it's scored higher
than an ease build but other than that
the bill looks really nice great job
with cable management and I'm definitely
diggin the red custom cables from
Corsair I do have to say that the green
g-force logo throws off the color
balance of the build so if you're daring
enough I will definitely scrape off the
green paint so you get that nice white
GeForce logo I do have a video showing
how I did it if you're interested last
but not least we have David with a very
unique build so we have a 4790k paired
with the asus strix gtx 970 on top of a
custom 3d printed case so I guess this
is our very first open case build we
also have 16 gigabytes of HyperX ram at
1600 megahertz and the be quite advanced
c1 cooler for benchmarks that scored a
10 thousand 989 ranking it at the number
3 spot really the amazing job with the
mods the customs leaving and the orange
LEDs this is definitely one of the most
unique builds I've ever seen anywhere I
especially like the ESS these slots you
have created on the case I guess you'll
never have to worry about overheating
issues although thus might be an issue
