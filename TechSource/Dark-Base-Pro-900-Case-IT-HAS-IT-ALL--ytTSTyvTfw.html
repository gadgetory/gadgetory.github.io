today we are looking at the new and
gorgeous dark Bass Pro 900 tower from be
quiet this is an extremely well-built
and high-end tower that supports all
motherboard sizes in addition to that
the entire motherboard tray can be
repositioned vertically in three
different heights which is incredibly
convenient if you're trying to install a
radiator on top of the case but the
motherboard heatsink gets in the way
then you can simply lower the board and
make room for it and by the way this
actually happened during my build it
doesn't even stop there this case is
very versatile having completely modular
parts both hard drive and optical drive
cages side ventilation power supply
mount and even a motherboard tray can be
fully inverted for those that want their
pcs on the left side of their desk I
really like how be quiet made everything
so easy to move around there's really
nothing complicated about moving the
parts for example the motherboard tray
is hooked up from the three screws in
the front and the other six in the back
once they are off you can flip it upside
down and move it to the other side and
you are basically done the tempered
glass side panel can also be swapped to
the other side so don't worry because
you will still be able to look inside
your case on either side the case does
come with seven harddrive cages that can
fit two SSDs in each tray for a total of
14 SSDs or seven hard drives there's
also an extra SSD cage in the back if
you decide to go solo or plan to remove
all the cages for some more space much
like the motherboard tray bees can also
be inverted and installed in two
different positions to accommodate all
sorts of water cooling configurations be
quiet is also kind enough to include an
LCS bracket for mounting water pumps or
something similar
although I do like the modularity of the
hard drive cages I much prefer a more
simpler approach that doesn't involve
any screws more like the snap-on hard
drive trades I've seen from other cases
although that will go against the
modularity design that be quite was
going for aesthetically this is one
giant and beautiful case no doubt the
side window is made of four millimeter
tinted tempered glass and it's being
held up by four thumb screws located in
each corner the rest of the frame is
constructed out of high quality aluminum
and ABS material it doesn't look like be
quite as cut any corners with this case
then again with a price tag of $249
there better not be the color scheme is
also fairly neutral majority of it being
black with silver accents now depending
on what colour you guys go with the
grommets will be in that same color as
well and right now there are three
different color combinations silver
orange and all black taking a look at
the front of the case you will find a
set of i/o ports two USB 3.0 and two USB
2.0 along with your usual headphone and
microphone jacks opening up the front
panel gives you access to the front fan
dust filter as well as the bottom filter
you also have access to the fan
controller with this switch you have the
option to set two modes of operation
either control the speed of the fans
manually or automatically there's also a
button right next to the switch that
controls the LEDs of the case be quiet
was also nice enough to include two sets
of LED strips pressing the button will
change the color of the LEDs to either
white red green blue orange or simply
leaving them off now for those who are
still living in the Stone Age you do get
two optical bays for your DVD or CD
drives however if you're like me and
want to install a motherboard accessory
that has a knob or something similar
that's sticking out then you would be
disappointed to find that the door will
not close completely
I wish be quite would have given
alternate mounting options for these
scenarios and finally on the top of the
case right above the i/o ports you will
find a Qi wireless charging dock that's
right guys you can now charge your smart
phone by setting it on top of your PC
tower you have to have a smart phone
that's capable of wireless charging
though the case also has excellent noise
insulation due to these sound insulating
foams that covers most parts of the
chassis
surprisingly the parts stay cool as well
that's because of their full circuit
airflow system there are basically vents
that run along the frame and other parts
of the case that provide excellent air
flow the side opposite of the tempered
glass has a two in one side panel
meaning that you can keep it closed for
maximum silence partly open it for more
intake or remove the entire panel with
the option of installing two additional
fans during idle my CPU would hover
around 32 degrees while my GPU stays at
a constant 38 degrees and join below
that I would get temps of 52 and 74 for
both the CPU and GPU respectively
here's a quick sound test during idle
and load
aside from the three 140 millimeters
silent wingspans that come equipped with
the tower
you also get loads of options for
cooling whether you are going with a
custom loop or an a i/o cooler a few
additional things I like about this case
are the add-ons of the fan hub in the
back and cable management space provided
for the wires I really like the distance
between the side panel and the
motherboard tray there's plenty of space
to work with that won't interfere with
the side panel door the extra space
behind the power supply is also nice
since I can keep bulk of the wires there
away from sight however I personally
would have loved to see a PSU cover or a
shield of some sort that will block out
majority of the power supply cables on
the bottom after all this case has a
full glass side panel and the sight of
any cables is anything but pleasing I
also notice that all the grommets got
partially blocked by my extended
motherboard which made some parts of the
cable management challenging thankfully
be quiet included a hard drive panel
rubber grommet which I used for the 24
pin connector overall the dark base pro
900 is a well-built extremely versatile
and aesthetically pleasing tower with
fully modular parts sound insulating
foam and lots of space to work with you
can pretty much build anything you can
dream up while maintaining a cool and
quiet PC honestly if you're not going to
build a high-end PC with at least a
two-way SLI or crossfire or even add a
custom loop in here then honestly this
case would be overkill for you and I
would suggest looking at the silent base
800 instead if you want a good-looking
silent PC build but that will do it for
the video I'll drop a link to the case
down below if you guys want to check
that out if you enjoyed it make sure to
leave a like and as always I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
