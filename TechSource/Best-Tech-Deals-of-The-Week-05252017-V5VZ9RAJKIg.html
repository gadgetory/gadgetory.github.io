that I love you guys so much like deep
down inside I feel so special you guys
are the best
honestly the support I've been getting
the past few weeks even months it's just
been it's been phenomenal and I have
another best take views episode and so
long and I figured why not I got some
content coming up in the meantime I want
to ring you guys something because it's
kind of been drives XO us for a while
you guys ever noticed so yeah so with
that said I was on dual source texts
checking out some deals and I was like
these are actually some pretty damn good
deals and I want to share some with you
guys so with that said let's start off
by taking a look at the extremely
popular budget cabling processor that I
features and a few of my bills now
normally this goes for $64 right now
it's going for 57 and 59 cents with free
shipping on PC Gamer using the code on
the screen gigabyte is letting the Z
270x the Zygon their motherboard go for
$170 after a mail-in rebate on new egg
which is a crap out of that one and
speaking of gigabyte you can now pick up
a GTX 1080 for only four hundred and
thirty dollars guys that's the cheapest
1080 available in the u.s. right now and
just a reference the same car is going
for 490 on Amazon so you guys will be
saving around 60 bucks if you do pick
this up the popular 77 2 K is also
discounted to 309 from its original
price of $350 so you guys are saving $40
over here I'm not sure who's smoking
what but on eBay they put the original
price at 400 which obviously is in the
case but if this is sold out on eBay you
can actually pick it up for $20 more on
Amazon which still saves you $20 so not
bad the 850 Evo 500 gigabyte SSD is
going for $147 which is $22 off of the
Amazon price and then we got the Razer
BlackWidow chroma keyboard for $100 the
retail on this is $170 the do keep in
mind that this is refurbished but it
does have a 90-day warranty in case
something does go along at least now you
can buy overpriced gear and not overpay
for it but now let's talk some console
the Wii U 32 gigabyte deluxe
addition which comes with the tender
land is going for $200 once again it is
refurbished so keep that in mind
speaking of consoles the ps4 one
terabyte Final Fantasy 15 bundle going
for three hundred and fifty dollars are
you serious right now the one time I
wanted a PlayStation 4 Final Fantasy 15
Edition it goes on sale now I mean where
was this deal months ago seriously and
finally on eBay we got a 12 month xbox
live membership for only $45 and once
again for reference this goes for around
55 bucks so you're only saving $10 but
hey a deal is a deal
now let's look at some few deals on
Amazon starting off with the Corsair
strafe RGB which is $40 off we got the
razor Mamba tournament edition which is
going for $70 and no here's a really
dope deal on the dell ultrasharp 24 inch
monitor which is going through two
hundred and forty five dollars guys
that's 75 bucks off right now
the retail on this is $320 so if you're
looking for your super thin bezel 1080p
monitor then this should definitely be
on your list and then we got the razer
kraken pro gaming headset for $43 and
once again for reference this goes for
$90 on Newegg so you will be saving
around 47 dollars if you're looking to
upgrade your storage or if you're
building a new PC then um back to SSDs
are the way to go for your main storage
right now it's $30 off and this is
actually one of the fastest nvme drives
out there up to 3200 megabytes per
second right and 1903 is that some crazy
fast speeds and finally check this out
guys in gtx 1060 from EVGA going for
only a hundred and sixty-seven dollars
which is the lowest price that steams on
any 1060 this usually goes for around
$200 so if you're building a budget PC
or one upgrade now's the time to snag it
so that is it for this episode of BTD
hope you guys enjoyed it I know it's
been awhile since I posted one of these

subtext because we post deals like these
continuously on the website for US UK
Canada and even Germany so make sure you

deals or maybe even bookmark the website

only there for a few hours so it's all
cool to check back once in a while and
before I do I want to let you guys know
