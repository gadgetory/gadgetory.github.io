and this is Jack the Ripper I have a lot
to say about this PC because not only
does it look awesome but it's packing
some serious power I also have mixed
feelings about the case so I'll be
sharing my opinions on that and also
gonna be diving into the gaming
benchmarks temps overclocking
performance and we're also gonna be
looking at the productivity side of the
PC because using it for only gaming is
pretty stupid to be honest
so grab your loop and shrap in and let
us begin the video
all right so this thing is packing the
1950 X which is a 16 core processor we
also got 32 gigs of RGB ram from g.skill
the msi x3 99 gaming Pro carbon
motherboard and 2 EVGA gtx 980ti s in
sli i already mentioned in a previous
video why didn't go with 2 Omega 64
cards and I was simply because I
couldn't get my hands on a second one so
instead I decided to reunite AMD and
NVIDIA into a glorious PC build so I
went with to 1080i instead I was able to
overclock the 1950 X to 4.0 gigahertz on
just 1.25 volts
thanks to the awesome cooling power of
the master liquid 240 from cooler master
and the overclocking capability of the
MSI gaming Pro motherboard that's one of
the reasons why I chose the MSI X 399
over other brands the reliability and
the support for easy overclocking the
extra features that came with the
motherboard was a plus like RGB lighting
3d printable heatsink covers 3 turbo m2
slots with shields and you also get an
Intel Wi-Fi card the cables I'm using
this time are from unsourced customs and
I've actually used them a few times
before the thing I like the most about
their cables compared to other brands as
the cable clips that come pre applied
and also they have a much wider
selection of colors to choose from other
places would have only one shade of
color whereas insourced customs has
actually several to choose from and
that's how I was able to get a similar
orange to match the rest of the build
but I'll drop a link to these exact
cables if you guys want to check it out
the custom back plates fan grills sli
bridge and the SSD covers are all from
v1 tech and as always they never
disappoint
I'll drop a link below if you guys want
to check those out as well and finally
powering this entire build is a 1,000
watt power supply from EVGA which I
scanned in orange dban skins to match
the build alright so the case I'm using
is called conquer and it's from Cougar
at first glance this is a dope looking
case definitely something different
compared to other traditional towers in
the PC market which is what makes this
case stand out
it's also gonna cost you $300 so already
it's catering to the enthusiasts out
there or people with money
aside from the cool design the other
things I really like about the case has
the build quality and the materials
couger definitely didn't cheap out it's
got an all aluminum alloy frame with cnc
machining for every design detail the
two tempered glass panels are also a
nice plus I also love the extra space
and room for expandability you guys can
fit up to a three and a 60 millimeter
radiator up top and a two 80 millimeter
radiator in the front which is awesome
for water cooling you also get this tray
to install one hard drive or two SSDs on
and then you get two extra spaces on the
actual frame to install two more hard
drives or SSDs if you like ok now the
things I didn't like about the case the
Cougar logo on the side panel is too
large
I get that brands want to represent
their cases but a simple logo in the
front of the case would have been enough
or the very least make the text smaller
on the sides aesthetically it's not
pleasing also the orange side frame was
very difficult to remove originally I
wanted to paint over that in a different
shade of orange so that it stays
consistent with the rest of the build
but it requires a special Torx wrench
which I didn't have and I was not about
to waste my time trying to figure it out
and buy one unfortunately I was on a
time constraint for a case that was
stated it was designed for mothers I
expected a traditional size Torx wrench
or the very least they should have
included one with their case obviously
guys if this was my own personal PC I
would definitely take that extra time
and custom paint it take it apart and do
a lot stuff because you guys know how
anal I get with small things like that
especially for my own personal PC the
fact is this piece is gonna be taken
apart and stored in the Shelf so that is
why I didn't spend an extra time that's
also one of the reasons why I didn't use
a ruler to cut straight lines for the
power supply D brand scan the power
supply is also in a weird spot if you
want to disconnect the power cable and
move your PC it's gonna be difficult
reaching underneath there because
there's a shroud that goes over the edge
of the power supply making it difficult
to reach also if you're using standard
sized for the power supply cables
unfortunately they're gonna be too short
to reach some parts of the motherboard
specifically for the CPU power and for
the graphics cards fortunately I was
able to
select the correct cable length on
insourced customs so that I got the
perfect sized cable management was
probably the hardest part assembly
because the case doesn't come with any
cutouts to help you out with instead you
get a few cable clips to help you out
which isn't enough so what I did was I
used a channel raceway to hide majority
of the cables near the top and a bunch
of velcro straps to tie the rest of the
cables together while maintaining a
clean and aesthetically pleasing route
for the cables I did my best to avoid
overlapping cables as much as possible
and I think it came out beautifully
especially considering the fact that I
had two GPUs and two SSDs that's a lot
of extra cables to connect over all I'm
off out of the case it's built really
well it looks freaking awesome and it's
got tons of expandability yeah this is
the type of case you would buy if you
want to separate your PC from the rest
all right let's talk performance so
first up we got firestrike benchmark
scores and for some reason it keeps
scoring around 23,000 and that's with
the overclock I was curious so I checked
the top scores with in 1950 X and the
numbers are so scattered ranging from
17,000 all the way up to 30,000 I mean
this guy was using two EVGA 1080 T eyes
and in 1950 X just like me but he only
scored 17,000 372 it has to do with
drivers optimization and other factors
but that's just the score I got so I'm
sharing it with you guys
rendering however is whereas PC really
shines it's perfect for CPU intensive
tasks like exporting video it's
currently the fastest pc on the list
rendering out a three minute 4k file in
nine minutes and 29 seconds however once
overclocked I was able to shave off an
extra minute and a half for a total
render time of 8 minutes and 2 seconds
when it came to gaming honestly it did
okay with to 1080 T eyes I expected
higher numbers but it can handle 4k
games without problem a 7700 K would
have given you noticeably higher frames
than the 1950 x4 GTA 5 fully maxed out I
was getting around 77 FPS on average but
once I overclock the CPU and both
graphics cards I saw an average of 4 FPS
increase max settings on doom using
OpenGL got an average of 88 FPS with
nice seven FPS bump after overclocking
pop G was also playable over 60fps
however I had to knock the settings down
too high instead of ultra after
overclocking I saw a nice 8 FPS boost
topping the average frames to 73 on high
settings Ghost Recon wildlands is a very
demanding game so I had to lower the
settings as well down to very high
instead of ultra in order to get that 71
FPS average however even with the
overclock we didn't see much gain only a
2 FPS average increase battlefield 1 saw
some nice average fps and 4k gaming over
100 and maxed out settings with a tiny 2
FPS increase after overclocking temps
were really great during full load
even after overclocking the CPU capped
at 67 degrees during full load and
that's with the overclock the PC didn't
experience any throttling as well
however I do want to mention that I did
add three extra fans near the top for a
push and pull configuration however I'm
certain that this didn't affect
temperatures tremendously because
afterwards I removed the top three fans
and only saw a three degree difference
it is an open-air chassis so
unfortunately you are gonna hear the fan
noise there isn't any noise dampening
material or noise isolation so with the
PC on full load you get around 55
decibels which isn't too loud but it's
definitely noticeable in a quiet
environment and finally let's talk
overclocking so the EVGA FTW three cards
come factory overclocked already so I
wasn't able to push it that much I was
only able to squeeze another 25
megahertz from each card and 450 mega
Hertz on the memory clock pushing the
card up to 19 11 megahertz on full load
and 6055 megahertz on the memory clock
and I pretty much wraps up this video if
you guys didn't like it feel free to
dislike but if you did like it please
consider dropping a like to show your
support because making videos like these
takes weeks to plan and build and
especially shoot shooting a video like
this takes multiple days so dropping a
simple like really shows me and tells me
that you guys enjoy these types of
content and I can continue doing them
every single month on
channel every single part used in the PC
you'll be linked below thank you so much
for watching as always I love your faces
I will see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
