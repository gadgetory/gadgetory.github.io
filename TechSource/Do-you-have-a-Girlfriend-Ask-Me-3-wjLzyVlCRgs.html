from tech stores and I haven't done one
of these in a while and I figured now is
a good time to catch up on some of the
questions that you guys have been asking
me on Twitter so with that said let's go
ahead and start the video all right so
the first question comes from ma hand
and he's asking if you have to choose
between black and red which would it be
hence it's an interesting question but
if I have to choose I would have to go
with black just because I think red is
just too much I think red works great as
an accent instead of an actual
standalone color do you have a
girlfriend or a wife it's actually funny
you posted this question on Twitter
because about a month ago I did post a
picture of my girlfriend on Twitter and
Instagram so it's not really a secret
that I'm keeping but if you follow me on
Twitter Instagram then yes you would
know that I have a girlfriend her name
is Brianna I've been with her for about
eight months oh yeah that answers your
question your inspiration for YouTube
and tips for newcomers and your first
mobile my spiration if I had to sum it
up it would be just one word it would be
music
more specifically dubstep every time I
listen to that type of music ideas start
flowing in my mind videos like the PC
build cinematic unboxings and even some
of the dubstep inbox scenes that I've
done in the past all come from that
music and that's kind of what I
choreograph in my mind as I'm listening
to those songs so that's kind of what
the inspiration comes with and that's
kind of the backbone of tech source as
far as tips for newcomers I'm gonna try
and keep it as short as possible but I
followed the triple C effect which I
made up it basically consists of content
consistency and quality and I know
quality starts with a Q but you guys get
the idea
content as far as putting out content
people want to see if you're starting
out you guys probably want to do videos
on popular products that way they're
easily found on YouTube searches and
also for consistency make sure you have
a schedule going on make sure your costs
in the uploading video
whether it's twice a week three times a
week or even once a week and also
quality make sure you guys are putting
out really nice quality you guys don't
have to shoot a 4k resolution but at
least spend some time filming and
editing and voicing over actually
recently about two months ago I actually
started to take more time in a filming
process editing process and even started
doing some color grading as well to kind
of perfect the overall footage of my
videos but yeah those would be my quick
tips on newcomers well starting off in
YouTube's tough I think that tough is an
understatement it was definitely
difficult for me starting out YouTube
about two and a half years ago
especially now I could only imagine how
difficult it's going to be because the
YouTube community is oversaturated
especially and technology content but I
it was very difficult for me I even
sometimes I lost hope and I wanted to
give up and just delete my channel just
go back to work and school full time and
stuff like that but deep down inside I
knew deep down was a passion like I
wanted to continue YouTube and I know
this is that was something I wanted to
do for the rest of my life so that's
kind of what kept me going but it's
definitely hard to start a tip to give
you guys as never give up if that's if
this is something you guys truly want to
do do you have a job this is it this is
what I do full-time I quit my job I quit
my full-time job I should say February
of this year so 2015 February and I
focused my entire time on this YouTube
channel so yeah this is basically what I
do now for a living what do you do with
the products such as phones after you
review them something you guys probably
don't know is that I actually purchased
the phones from my own pocket I never
get phones as in review units except the
LG g4 but that is the exception because
everybody and their mothers got a review
unit from LG but most of the phones I
actually do buy and I do keep for future
comparisons right now I do keep the
major flagship so I have like the Nexus
6 the LG g4 dm9 the note 4 the s6 and
the Xperia z3 along with my iPhone 6 and
I keep those so I can compare them
to the newer versions as they come out
but let's say after your year once they
go obsolete I'll go ahead and sell it
how do you go about using these tracks
without getting flagged and actually get
this question asked a lot but to keep it
simple I'm actually part of a network
called full screen I'm sure a lot of you
guys heard about it and actually a lot
of popular tech channels are with full
screen and they give me tools to use
free music in my videos and free sound
effects and stuff like that so it's
basically a really nice addition and
some of the other videos actually I just
looked up look up on YouTube
if it says copyright free or no
copyright and I basically download it
and use them in my videos and most of
the time I do give credit but for those
of you guys that have a YouTube channel
and are interested in checking out full
screen I'll go ahead and leave a link
down below what size shoe are you
well that was an actual shoe I think
I'll be 6 - but I think you meant to ask
what my shoe sizes and I'm 12 do you
lift and at what age did you get into
tech no I'm actually off bulking I
stopped bulking last year I'm actually
in my cut which is kind of why I'm
really thin and if you guys have seen my
earlier videos sometime last year you
probably have seen a huge difference in
my body but yeah that's I'm gonna be
going back to bulking sometime in August
or September and as far as what age I
got into tech I got into tech in high
school like in the 9th grade that's when
the Motorola RAZR came out so I was
really excited and that kind of what
sparked my interest and technology and I
always wanted to get the best every
single year so yeah age 15 also what TV
shows do you watch you only get one
question I'm sorry now I'm just kidding
i watch only 3 shows actually right now
my favorite of all time is Game of
Thrones
and then house of cards and then I watch
orange is the new black those are
currently my top 3 favorite shows what
is your current job or a job before
YouTube well you guys know my current
job is and my job before YouTube was I
was a teller at a bank called first bank
here in California so anyways that's it
for the questions thank you guys for
assembling them on Twitter if you guys
ask me question and I do
answered I'm really sorry I'm trying to
keep this video as short as possible but
make sure you follow me on Twitter and
Instagram because I'll be doing another
one of these in in two or three weeks
and you guys can ask me there
but anyways a quick update on what's
gonna be happening here on tech source
the ultimate gaming PC parts have been
selected I've announced that on Twitter
and I'm gonna start early in the parts
sometime this week and early next week
so we are on schedule for the release
and August also the next few videos I'm
working on currently our top three
budget laptops around 200 bucks and also
the cool tech deals for the month of
July because I know you guys have been
waiting for that that's gonna be coming
out really soon so make sure you guys
keep an eye out for that but anyways
that's basically it thank you so much
for watching I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
