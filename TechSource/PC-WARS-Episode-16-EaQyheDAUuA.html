and welcome to PC wars episode 16 five
contestants one winner
let the PC wars begin never pay full
price for games ever again guys g2a
offers the cheapest CD keys you can find
anywhere check them out by clicking on
the link below so if I've contestants
for this week are antonio christian
david rck and 40 i think as i say your
name congratulations for making it on
the show first up is antonio and his red
and yellow build which i'm going to call
the ketchup and mustard build I mean
I'll give you points for going with a
very unique color scheme but why red and
yellow any who sees the PC as a 4770k
and an asus r9 390 Strix with a custom
loop built inside the H 440 it also has
16 gigs of ram and lastly for benchmarks
it's scored an 11,000 586 but with that
let's move on to the next rig from
Christian a very good-looking white and
black build inside another a 440 case a
4700 K and two gtx 980ti s with a custom
painted as a lie bridge once again I
would like to take this time and thank
Christian for going outside and taking
these great shots so aside from the
painted a slight bridge both of the
graphics cards and the NZXT CPU bracket
is also painted white I'm not a fan of
the PCI cables but the rest of the cable
management in the case is excellent
no benchmark scores from Christians so
unfortunately this PC is disqualified
but regardless thank you for entering
David is next up with yet another white
H 440 case that he has like three in a
row I swear I'm not doing this on
purpose so the PC is called afford a
watch and it has a 4690k paired with a
GTX 970 Strix we also have a few modded
parts the GPU radiator and SSD are all
painted in white but why didn't you
paint the bottle white as well to match
the color scheme for benchmarks the PC
got a 93 12 taking second place for this
episode overall a very clean white
themed PC thank you David for entering
rck is next up with a very clean black
and red build inside the carbide 540 air
case we have a 6600 K overclocked to 4.7
single EVGA gtx 980ti take a look at the
sleeving though that is a thing of
beauty
I feel like this build has just the
right amount of red nothing too
overwhelming the build also has quite a
few mods first up is the absence of the
hard drive bays on the bottom he removed
them and laser-cut a black acrylic piece
that covers the entire bottom part of
the PC we also have a custom back plate
for the asus sonar sound card and custom
sleeving from BitFenix if you guys look
closely inside the PC you can find a
black thin tube running from the bottom
all the way up to the GPU and that's
actually installed to hold up a graphics
card and prevent it from sagging if you
look at it from the front you actually
can't see it so good job on keeping it
subtle for benchmarks the PC scored
17,000 387 taking first place for this
episode but a very sexy black build with
the perfect amount of red think you are
CK for entering last but not least we
have Tony with black snow a black and
white build rocking Lee 6700 K and 2 gtx
980ti s in sli we also have 16 gigs of
ram one terabyte hard drive space and
two 500 gigabyte 850 Evo s and raid zero
cooling the system is to be quiet dark
rock pro 3 and the case of choice is the
popular fan Tex evolve and lastly for
benchmarks black snow got a score of
22,000 729 taking first place for the
episode but let's be honest the real
black snow looks better but Delta for
this episode of PC Wars as always drop
your comments down below and vote on who
you think has the best custom PC and I
will announce the winners on the 15th on
my Twitter and Instagram accounts then
guys so much for watching and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
