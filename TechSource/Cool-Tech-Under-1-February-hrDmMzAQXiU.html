and welcome to another episode of cool
tech on the right dollar I think the
last time I did one of these was in
January of this year but because of the
amazing positive feedback in the
comments section I decided to do another
video let's begin so starting off is
this foldable stand for smartphones and
tablets it comes in a variety of colors
and just for $0.99 you can hold up your
device you can also adjust the width to
accommodate smaller devices it does
state that it can hold tablets as well
but it will depend on the size and
weight as larger tablets like my iPad
air 2 will easily tip over this next
item is an LED light for PCs laptops or
other devices that have a USB port since
you will need one to power it up and as
a steel-like build which is extremely
flexible and this is really effective
for laptops that don't come with backlit
keyboards so this is in my pitch-black
bedroom and as you can see the light is
strong enough to see the keys but not
overpowering for only a dollar this is a
pretty cool accessory this next item is
pretty straightforward that's a 3.5
millimeter splitter so if you want to
watch a video on your laptop smartphone
or tablet with someone else using two
separate earbuds or headphones then this
thing will definitely help just hook up
one end to the device and connect your
listening devices on the other end next
up we have a microphone with a clip now
I did not think you can find something
like this for on the right dollar
but if you are on an extremely low
budget and only having dollar in your
pocket then this might be what you're
looking for here's a quick demo on how
it sounds
by the way toss me a like for that new
hairstyle what's up guys is that back
again from tech source and now I'm
talking directly into my iPhone without
any microphone connected to it and this
is without editing as well what's up
guys is that from tech source and I am
talking with the mic hooked up to my
phone and this is what it sounds like
without any editing last but not least
we have Dee Brad's I'm just kidding guys
it's a case there will be no deep brands
in this video I promise so for $0.99 you
get a soft silicone TPU case for the
galaxy s say
don't expect too much protection I mean
it does get the job done
pad protecting your phone from scratches
and smaller drops but that's pretty much
it the buttons are really easy to press
and the cutouts are precise enough that
it won't get in the way of any
accessories you try to plug in it would
also protect the approaching camera from
being scratched since it's thick enough
to cover it
oh yeah it's a pretty cool case we're
just a dollar no complaints here
so as last product isn't really under a
dollar but I do want to mention it in
this video because it is a cool tech and
I get a bunch of you guys asking me
every time you see it in a video and yes
it is my jacket or my vest I should say
so the best first made its appearance a
few months back in my cool tech gifts
episode and ever since then I've worn
this in many of my videos and I
absolutely love it it's a vest from
Scottevest and for those of you that
don't know who they are
they design multi pocket clothing that
give you easy access to all of your
essentials not only does this vest have
42 pockets which allows me to carry
practically anything with me but it's
great for people that travel or go to
events since you can carry most of your
stuff on you other than functionality
these look pretty sweet and keep me warm
as well so yeah you will see me wear
this a lot on the channel but if you
guys are interested in picking one up
for yourselves whether it's a vest like
mine a hoodie or even pants then make
sure to visit Scott Eve s comm slash
tech stores and I'll drop a link down
below for you guys so even though
Scottevest is a sponsor of this video i
backed their products 100% because i use
them consistently and i am in love with
them but anyways that will do it for
this video thank you guys so much for
watching leave a like if you enjoyed it
and as always I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
