celebrating their 10 year anniversary
and I wanted to let you know that they
have a bunch of deals on tech in fact
the TV I'm reviewing in this video is on
sale for less than $350 right now with
Free Shipping and I'll drop a link below
so make sure to check them out
you know it's really difficult to when
buying TVs nowadays there are so many
different brands to choose from it can
get really frustrating there are so many
factors that comes into play when
deciding on what TV to purchase budget
is one of them the technology and of
course the quality of the TV well that's
what this video is about I'm gonna be
reviewing an affordable 4k TV from Sky
worth that goes for less than three
hundred and fifty dollars for those of
you that are familiar with skywards they
are really huge in China and now they're
focusing on the US market surprisingly
for less than $350 you get a lot making
the sky worth very attractive all for
the average movie buff and gamer however
there are also things I didn't like
about the TV which I'll be going over in
the video so one of the things that
makes this TV stand out compared to
other budget TVs in the same bracket is
that it comes with HDR which provides a
higher level of contrast between light
and dark images on the screen to create
more realistic image another thing I
noticed is that some games have trouble
detecting the HDR chipset inside the TV
I tried to enable it while playing
Uncharted but it was great out because
it couldn't recognize it and that could
be a deal-breaker for some people since
they won't be able to take full
advantage of HDR and games one thing to
take note is the picture quality out of
the box it's really bad for some reason
the sharpness was set to 13 by default
making the image look very fake I had to
lower it down to 3 to improve the
quality greatly so do keep that in mind
if you decide to pick one up the viewing
angles are pretty good you get a 170
degree wide viewing angle and I haven't
noticed a significant color shift when
watching from the sides aesthetic wise I
think that's a good-looking TV very slim
bezels on three sides a sleek base
design and a surprisingly very light it
also comes with a wall mount however the
standard base amounts will also work
near the bottom is where the front
firing speakers are and it's not bad
it's not the best I mean they do get
distorted at high volumes and the sound
is slightly tinny in some cases they're
also not that bassy so don't expect to
rattle the walls when watching a movie
but like I said earlier they're not bad
you can watch a movie or play games on
it and they won't make your ears bleed
for ports it's got one USB and an HDMI
on the side which are a little too close
to each other then I would
like we also got one USB and two more
HDMI is in the back personally I'm a fan
of the vertical orientation as it's a
little inconvenient plugging things in
but I realized that this type of setup
is standard on most TVs one thing I like
about this TV is the OS it comes
installed with Android TV which means
you have access to the Google Play Store
music and other Google services you can
hook up your Android tablet smartphone
and screen cast straight to your TV I
would say the interface is user friendly
it's easy to navigate and you can find
all the popular apps right on the home
screen you also have quick access on the
remote itself to Netflix and Google Play
however I would have preferred YouTube
over a Google Play but that's just my
preference all right let's talk gaming
so once you hook up your console or game
device the TV will adjust the processing
speed and the color to enhance the
responsiveness of the display I mean
don't expect anything similar to 100
Hertz refresh rate panel the TV is
capped at 60 Hertz so it's not gonna be
as quick and responsive but it didn't
affect my gameplay that much while
playing games like Uncharted however
playing fortnight was a different story
coming from my PC it was night and day
because shooter games requires the most
precision and you can't really get that
with 60 Hertz so if you're planning on
hooking up your PC to this just for
gaming that I don't recommend it however
if you're playing casual games like RPG
realtime strategy or even adventure
games then it will get the job done all
right so who's this TV for and is it
worth it honestly for less than $350 it
is hard not to recommend it you get a
lot for the money and that's kind of the
main selling point of this TV you get a
lot for Less 4k resolution Google Play
HDR you got great viewing angles and
color with decent sounding speakers so
the only downsides on the TV are the low
input lag when it comes to gaming and
the compatibility or support for HDR
technology when it comes to games other
than that and that's pretty much all the
other features you would expect from a
smart TV
now if the downsides don't bother you
then it's worth picking up so that does
it for my review of the skyward 49 u5a
