another unboxing and giveaway today
we're looking at the bose qc25 own so
let's get started so these are the Bose
QuietComfort 20s and they go for $2.99
there's also a QC 25 version
specifically made for iPhone and iPad
users for the same price now $300 does
seem a little steep for just a pair of
earphones so it definitely can unbox
these and see if they are really worth
300 bucks as I mentioned earlier in my
beats video that I am more of an
earphone guy rather than headphones so
I'm pretty anxious to test these out but
you know being this expensive there
definitely has to be a WOW factor in
order to impress me this is a giveaway
as well so if you guys want to win just
simply like the video leave a comment
down below I also included some links in
the description below on where to find
them if you are interested and don't end
up winning alright so on with the
unboxing it does come in a small box as
you can see here as always it's going to
put these aside and we'll take a closer
look at them later
but first let's see what else is inside
the box this looks like a piece of paper
with some bows information that's going
to toss that aside here is the carrying
case that comes with the earphones and
in here you will find some warranty
information they also included a USB
cable needed to charge your noise
isolation device which I will go over in
detail and lastly they included two
pouches with some spare earbuds going
back to the box you will find more
useless paperwork nothing special here
so let's just skip straight to the
earphone since there is nothing else in
here worth mentioning so these aren't
just regular earphones in addition to
having noise isolation they also have an
aware mode button that quiets your music
and uses the noise isolation microphone
to let you hear what's happening in your
environment without pulling out your
earphones
and pausing your music so with that
being said I'm going to show you guys
this clip will quick where they break it
down for you and you can really see the
design from within the QC 20 year phones
electronically sends the sounds at your
ears in any environment
the sounds are measured in tiny
microphones inside and outside each year
but so their processing unit is located
down here and it compares those sounds
to what you're actually listening to
like music movies or even a little peace
and quiet and it reacts instant by
instant to produce an opposite signal
that reduces the sound you don't want to
hear they also have these specially
designed ear tips that create a secure
seal that physically blocks sound before
it even enters your ear that's how their
noise isolation is that effective and a
lot of reviews actually claim that these
are the best noise isolation earphones
currently available and I can see why it
has a price tag of 300 bucks so this is
the processing unit that you see here
and that USB cable that I mentioned
earlier is used to charge this device if
you want to use the noise isolation
feature or aware mode but if you don't
care and just want to listen to your
music then you do not have to charge
this unit just plug it into your mp3
player and you are ready to go
moving down the wire you will find a
small clip hanging from the cable
nothing special going on here so let's
just keep moving down here is the
control tach mechanism this version is
for non Apple devices
for the Apple devices it is the QC 20s I
mentioned before you have your basic
functions here the black one is used for
answering or ending calls and the white
button is used to activate a wear mode
the black button can also be used for
skipping pausing or even playing tracks
as well moving on to the ear tips it
looks like they provide you with two
different sized earbuds which also come
in two different colors you have the
white ones that are small and the black
ones that are large the last thing that
I want to look at is the case not much
to talk about here really its soft its
small just like a case is supposed to be
and above all inside it has a small
pouch where you can store your spare
earbuds if you choose to which I find
pretty useful so that pretty much wraps
up on unboxing and overview of the new
bose qc25 phones are amazing and I think
that the noise cancellation or wear mode
are great features to add to earphones
I'm sure a lot of people on this planet
can definitely put them to good use but
I think that dropping 300 bucks on these
are pretty steep even for
me so with that being said if you guys
want to win these amazing earphones
simply subscribe leave a comment and
most importantly like the video to
qualify I will announce the winners on
my Facebook page on August 31st along
with my other giveaways for this month
this is the text source and we'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
