One m9 is sponsored by cell cashier com
they compared iPhone prices on the
Internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iPhone what's up
guys it's ed back again from tech source
and welcome to another speed and
benchmark test this time we are facing
off the galaxy s6 versus the iPhone 6 or
6 plus but Before we jump into the test
let's take a glance at their specs the
s6 features an Exynos 7420 octa-core
processor the first quad-core clocked at
1.5 gigahertz and its second quad-core
clock that 2.1 gigahertz with 3 gigs of
ram now the iPhone 6 and 6-plus on the
other hand uses their a 8 chip with a
dual-core 1.4 gigahertz cyclone
processor and it has 1 gigs of RAM so in
the speed test I will be giving points
for whichever phone opens their app
first and points for multitasking Google
Voice and Siri speeds as well as browser
speed tests so with that said let's
start off with the boot test
what
what's the weather like today for Los
Angeles 76 degree where's the closest
Taco Bell are you miles located one
point one miles your door well movies
are playing right now near Los Angeles a
but there are three far from Los Angeles
what time is it right now in Tokyo Japan
what is the square root of 69 square
root of 169 is 8.30 1 is approximately
point three zero six six
well there you have it it seems like the
Galaxy S six is much faster than the
iPhone 6 plus
it loads most apps especially games a
lot quicker however when it comes to
multitasking the six-plus surprisingly
wasn't that far behind
of course the s6 is the newer phone with
better specs so it's kind of expected to
win the speed test until the iPhone 6s
comes out later this year that is
anyways that is it for the video let me
know what you guys think about the speed
test and if there's a specific phone you
want to see the s6 go up against next be
sure to let me know by dropping a
comment down below and if you like this
video feel free to hit that like button

make sure you guys are subscribed to the
