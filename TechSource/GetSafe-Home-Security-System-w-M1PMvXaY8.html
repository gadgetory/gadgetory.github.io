I don't know if you guys follow me on
Twitter or not but a few weeks ago I've
actually had some security issues here
at my home long story short I had some
packages stolen from me that include a
gaming laptop an expensive drone and a
few graphics cards so needless to say
that got me thinking about the security
of my property and me of course I wanted
to find a solution that would integrate
all of my needs into an app so it's
easily trackable no matter where I am
and somehow magically gets safe saw my
cries on Twitter and reached out to me
and decided to help out so they went and
sent me their starter pack for review so
in this kit there are a few things one
of which is a smart hub we also have one
entry sensor one motion detector and a
siren they're also nice enough to
include some batteries which are needed
for the installation now everything here
is wireless with the exception of the
smart hub which you have to connect
online via an ethernet cable if this
ever fails there's actually a free AT&amp;amp;T
SIM card installed here that will
activate when the ethernet is cut off
the best part about the installation is
that you don't need any tools to set up
and get going with 3m double-sided tape
being installed on all the included
hardware as well as the motion camera
which I ordered separately gets safe
does have an installation video that
helped me pick out the best spots for
the sensors so I put the entry sensor at
my front door and both the motion
detector and camera overlooking my
living room and stairwell what appealed
to me with the get safe system is that
everything is controlled through an app
once you get the system set up you can
actually go in and tune all the settings
for each sensor on individual basis
besides the simplicity of the app as
well as the cross integration with nest
my other favorite thing about this is
the smart rules which allows one event
to trigger another and all of this is
customizable
so let's say you want camera to record
some video on a certain date and time
you can go ahead and set that straight
up from the app I haven't had any use
for the system just yet and hopefully
never will but it does add a sense of
security when I'm away from home if
someone does break into my house I will
be immediately notified via app
notification the camera will start
recording and since I purchased the
professional monitoring service yet safe
will personally give me a call to make
sure everything is okay
this particular plan is 29 bucks a month
but if you don't need the 24/7
monitoring surface then these self
monitor option is just 19 bucks a month
both of these are on a month-to-month
basis and there are no long-term
contracts which is something I always
try to avoid I can now have some peace
of mind while sleeping and also
traveling outside of the states you guys
know that I go to a ton of events out
there so knowing that these guys watch
over my home while I'm not here is
awesome
I'm gonna give huge things to get safe
for sending these units in for a few and
they actually have a really awesome deal
for you guys out there if you're the
first 50 viewers that purchased the
starter kit you guys can use the code at
es2016 and get a free motion sensor
camera with your purchase I think that's
129 dollars value alone but anyways
that's pretty much it for the video
thing guys so much for watching as
always I'll leave a link down below if
you want to check these guys out thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
