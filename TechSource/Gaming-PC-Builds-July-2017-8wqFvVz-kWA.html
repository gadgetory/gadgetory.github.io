to July's pc builds of the month I'm
sorry for not doing one for June I was
away on vacation for two weeks in
Armenia so when I came back I just
didn't have the time to squeeze one end
for June but anyways I was reading over
last episode's comments that a lot of
you guys want a balanced gaming and
editing PC around $1000 so I will be
doing one of those in this episode and
then it will be having some fun and
build a high end overkill gaming and
editing PC using the new skylake X
platform something that is worthy enough
to be on my desk I'm going to be calling
it white or big whites I believe kind of
like Big Red's brother or sister
whatever you want to call it but anyways
what that said let's go ahead and take a
look at these configurations Guild of
Heroes is not only the sponsor of this
episode but they're given my subscribers
an exclusive chest with 7,000 gold and
some extra gear Guild of Heroes is a
free to play action RPG game for both
iOS and Android that lets you grind
through levels battling mobs and bosses
to level your character and pick up some
dope loot in the process what I like
about this game compared to other mobile
RPG games is the fact that you can
switch between the three characters
without starting from the beginning the
game has amazing graphics and it's
pretty addicting it's also free to play
so check it out guys I'll drop a link
below as I mentioned before only for my
subscribers they are giving away bonus
chest with 7,000 gold an armor piece and
a critical hit booster so the first
build is a balanced gaming and editing
rig featuring The Horizon 5 1606 core
processor which is great for streaming
and productivity whether you are doing
some 3d modeling graphic design or just
editing video it just doesn't make any
sense spending more than double the
price and going with a 6 core CPU from
Intel at this point you get far better
value with the 1600 compared to the
5820k or even 1,600 K the 1600 does come
with its own cooler so we don't have to
pick one up however we do need a solid
motherboard for overclocking and
recently I've been in love with the
Azeroth ad 350 M which offers so much
for only $80 a five-star rating on
Newegg that comes at fordham slot seven
USB 3.0 ports we had type C and type A
support along with two
MDOT two slots one of which supports PCI
gen3 by four since this is a
productivity PC as well I decided to
throw in 16 gigs of ram instead of eight
however there is two more slots left for
future upgrade ability for storage I
went with the usual one terabyte hard
drive from WD however I did throw in a
240 gigabyte m2 from a data as well
which will help tremendously with boot
and loading times the EVGA gtx 1066 by
brevis card will get you 1080p gaming
and mac settings across most triple-a
titles if you're lucky to find a cheap
one with all the cryptocurrency crap
that's going on right now the case I'm
going with is the coarser carbide spec 0
4 which is a good-looking case for
$50.00 it's a military chassis with tons
of cable management support and a tinted
side panel the only reason I went with a
600 watt power supply is because it's
literally the same price as a 500 watt
power supply from EVGA however it's only
available at Best Buy for pickups so the
price might vary if you guys don't have
a Best Buy near you so the total comes
out to a little over 900 dollars and
this is the build I would go with if I
were to build my friend a Productivity
and gaming PC it's perfect for making
youtube videos streaming on Twitch and
gaming of course however if you guys are
looking for just a gaming PC then you
should check out my Mays PC build of a
month because in one of the builds I did
a $900 gaming PC with a 7600 K and a gtx
1070 so for on the same price as the one
in this video you guys getting more
powerful gaming pc so check that out
I'll drop a link below the next one is
called a big white and it's rocking the
new AI 970 900 x10 core processor from
Intel and I would go the 24 option but
that's not available yet we got to keep
the temps cool while we overclock this
bad boy so we're going to be going with
the cursor h 100 IV 2 which is my
personal favorite a i/o cooler on the
market right now and since we're not on
a budget and I'm going with an all-white
build the asus prime deluxe with an
obvious choice
perfect for overclocking these 7900 X to
its full potential plus it looks badass
we're going with 64 gigs of the Corsair
Vengeance lpx RAM sticks because why not
plus we can change the lights to white
to match the color scheme of the
build when it comes to storage we are
using the samsung 960 pro one terabyte
m2 as the main drive along with the
Seagate 10 terabytes Barracuda for mass
storage I also throw in 2 960 gigabyte
SSDs for a raid 0 configuration because
why not and we're not stopping there
nope we are going with too-tight MX PS
from Nvidia because it won't be an
overkill build without them I'm going to
be using the Corsair 570 X RGB case
because I think that this all white
color scheme would look amazing in this
old glass mid tower case from Corsair a
1,000 watt power supply should be enough
to power this build and I'm obviously
going to be throwing in some custom
sleep cables some back plates and even
paint the Titan X's in white so that the
entire build looks stunning you guys
already know we got to do with the tech
source wave and this would actually be
my first all-white build on the channel
but what do you guys think let me know
your thoughts in the comments below as
always I'll drop a link to all the parts
I talked about down below and let me
know what you guys want to see for next
month's episode by leaving a comment
below as well but that about wraps up
this video if you guys enjoyed these
types of videos be sure to leave a like
to show your support if you don't like
them feel free to dislike as well I'll
be dropping a link to all the parts I
talked about in the description section
and also guys let me know in the comment
section what I should focus on for the
next episode as always and stay tuned
guys because this month I'm going to be
doing a high-end x $2.99 build using the
core i9 processor it's going to be a
very sick build I can't wait to bring
you guys that I'm partnering with MSI
and courser to make that happen well
anyways I love you guys thank you so
much for watching I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
