build log part 5 I believe of my
water-cooling journey is taking longer
than expected to get this thing done
my apologies you went into some hiccups
so anyways let's try and get a lot of
stuff done this episode so I'm not going
to I'm not going to even edit this video
until I have at least the tubing them
because I know a lot of you guys are
upset because I only do like a few
things per episode so anyways I'm done
rambling let's go and start alright so I
got the new radiator in as you can see
it actually doesn't have a piece of the
radiator sticking out or slanting out so
if I put this on top and match the holes
we are good as you can see nothing is
sticking out so that is perfect and also
lighting here is we're seeing two
telling me to swap the radiators so
basically you want to be 240 on top and
you wanted a 360 on the side trust me
guys I did that it does not work that
way in fact that way is actually a lot
worse so you got to give me some credit
so believe me I've tried everything to
make it work so now that we got the
nigredo 2n let's go and put this on the
bracket and finally move on to the
tubing
you
you
you
how long has it been holy hell guys
I am so sorry pshh I mean I don't even
know if I I'm sorry because it smell
like it was my fault you know I think
it's been two months since we started
this freaking build and here's the real
story guys I was waiting on a few parts
part one was the cables which I got two
weeks ago let me uh so the cables that
were sent to me he worked for the wrong
power supply so that I didn't want to
touch I didn't want to continue to build
unless I got the cables that that just
OCD problems that's just me I didn't
want to progress progress progress with
the build without the gripe cables
the second issue was at the pump bracket
did not align with the holes on the
bottom of the case so that plus the
cable issue just you know what the
motivation so I'll put it to the side
and I was waiting for the cables to
arrive and it did it came two weeks ago
but at that time I only had so many
projects lined up that I just had to
push this entire build to the side and
work on the most important ones because
there was some sponsored content and
stuff that I had to get out this is not
obviously you know 100% sponsors so this
is kind of like a side project I'm doing
but anyways the we have to drill some
holes on the bottom as you guys can see
this freaking thing can focus so there
you go the four screws on there were
drilled and so now they align with the
holes on the bottom of the case because
literally that's the only place I can
mount the pump that's it there's no
other place unless I go with maybe one
radiator but I don't know is whatever
whatever the point is it's been done
let's just move on with the build I'm
sorry I dragged this low this long guys
but hopefully I can bring you more
videos and I'll try and do a lot in this
episode instead of just putting on a few
things and I'm calling it a day so
so before I start plugging things in I
have to figure out the looping pattern
which I kinda have a good idea about but
the only things really bother me right
now is that radiator in the back the
reservoir once it's filled and pump is
just it's I don't know it looks weird I
feel like there's really no purpose for
this to even be there
and then I could add some space with
this and I could actually put it against
that yeah I don't know guys I don't know
I'm not just dropping stuff now
but I might just remove this to be
honest arriving is a little overkill so
yeah looping wise so obviously n to the
GPU blocks down here to the pump from
the pump to the radiator and rater to
the top of the CPU yet assuming that I'm
not going to use this radiator but I
don't know I honestly don't think I need
it and it just seems too cramped right
now stop texting me Jesus so yeah that's
it just looks cramped to be honest
especially with the two being everywhere
and the cables it's going to look really
really cramped guys I think yeah you
know what I talked myself out of it I'm
going to move this thing there you go
much better
well ah just looks like there's an empty
space back there I just can't win as
well
alright guys so this is what I have so
far finally connected all the cables
reservoir and pump is in place all the
fans are there and cable management
looks disastrous that's even a word I'm
going to work on this next episode right
now it's really late and I'm getting
extremely tired but hopefully this will
keep you guys busy until then and no
it's not going to take a few months for
the next episode I promise next episode
we can do the tubing fill in the liquid
and then thing that's pretty much it and
then the build will be done so maybe one
maximum two more parts and then you guys
a lot of the finale for sure but yeah
Kiel Myers was going to be fun in the
next episode that's for sure but
actually I guys I can go in and put on
the fittings and then we can go ahead
and end the episode so let's go ahead
and do that
so yeah guys I'm going to end the video
I did a lot today looking very clean I'm
loving the way it turned out
couldn't be more happier but the tubing
is going to be the hardest part of
course and then afterwards pulling the
liquid and we have pretty much done and
yeah so this is my first water cooled
build so we got the intake over there
sucking in or I should say blowing in
cold air inside the case and then you
got exhaust on the top blowing out warm
air so that's the configuration I went
with and I'm actually really happy that
I went with the fans over there on that
side instead of just leaving it empty
kind of makes the case look a lot better
it'll be able to look a lot better
instead of having like an empty section
over there I can sleep better at night
knowing that but anyways let me know
what you guys think about the build so
far let me know your thoughts in the
comment section what you like what you
don't like I would say the only thing I
don't like about this build are to GPU
blocks it just blocks of black
rectangular I just kind of take away
from the rest of the build about just my
opinion but yeah guys there's one of
apologize again for the delay in the
project Electra box realizes the
problems that's one of the reasons why I
push it to the side it's not as it
wasn't done on purpose but anyways I
I'll see you guys in a few months now
I'm skating don't expect the next part
to be like next day guys it's going to
be a few days maybe a week for the next
part but it's not going to be a month
that's for sure anyways it's been doing
a series leave a like if you hate it and
you hate me feel good to dislike I'll
see you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
