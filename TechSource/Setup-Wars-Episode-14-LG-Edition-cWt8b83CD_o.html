guys g2a offers really cheap CD keys for
any game out there for any platform they
sell super cheap CD keys for windows too
and this is actually where I get my
games from as well as operating systems
that I use for my custom PC builds each
month but I'm gonna leave a link down
below so you can see for yourself
what's up guys it's that back again from
tech source and welcome to setup wars
episode 14 sponsored by LG where the
winner will receive a brand new 34 inch
ultra wide curved monitor I want to
quickly mention that I received over 150
submissions just in the past few weeks
for LG sponsored events so I want to
apologize in advance if I don't feature
your setup there's really not much I can
do I did however post a poll on Twitter
and I had you guys vote on how many
setups I should feature for the LG
sponsored event and you guys voted on 10
so that's basically what I'm going to do
starting now for these four episodes I'm
also not gonna be doing my usual
recommendations just so I can speed
through this because 10 setups are a lot
and I don't want the video to drag on so
with that said the 10 lucky chosen are
Alex Cristiano AirLand Jody Joelle Jose
Juuso Kevin Mitchell and oh L
congratulations for getting on the show
as always all the gear from the set ups
will be linked down below for anyone
that is interested so starting off the
show is Alex with his dual monitor setup
we have 2 22 inch dual monitors hooked
up to a Dell dual monitor stand on the
desk we have an apple wireless keyboard
track pad and a Logitech MX performance
mouse and Logitech Z 130 speakers a very
simplistic dual monitor productivity
setup and I'm also really diggin that
MacBook stand you have there and the
wire management is on another level the
for dimmable LED lights under the desk
is also a very nice touch next up is
Cristiano and his compact gaming setup
we have a single Panasonic 32 inch
monitor and a
secondary monitor for watching TV on the
desk we have the Logitech G 5 10 s
keyboard Wireless M 30 10 mouse on the
ever-so-popular
Corsair gaming extended mousepad I'm
really diggin the headphone hangers that
you have installed on the wall right
next to the Samsung 5.1 speakers and the
dedicated individual shelves for your
consoles cable management is fantastic
as well and kudos to the LED strips
under the desk as well behind your
monitor a fun fact this desk was
actually once his door and that's
hilarious but hey it works definitely a
really nice gaming setup well done man
at number three we have Ireland with his
green themed setup I absolutely love
that extended monitor riser you have it
just really cleans up your setup on top
of that we have the Samsung 24 inch
monitor and a pair of Dell speakers on
the desk we have the Razer Deathstalker
expert keyboard with a SteelSeries rival
mouse on the extended Razer Goliath this
mousepad
why management is spotless and I'm
really loving the LEDs behind your desk
it's as simple and clean not much else I
can ask for great job
next up is Jodi with his dual monitor
setup so we have a 27-inch Ben Q and a
24 inch Dell widescreen monitor on the
desk we have the Razer BlackWidow
Ultimate keyboard Logitech g600
MMO Mouse and a corsair gaming mm 6600
double sided mouse mat I didn't even
know they make double sided mouse mats
also on a desk are a pair of Logitech
g13 speakers and I like what you did
with your headphone hanger by sticking
it to one of the legs those are the
coarser gaming H 2100 headphones by the
way if anyone was wondering while we are
down here cable management is decent but
it can definitely be improved by picking
up an omni mount cable system or better
yet watch my cool tech video of August
to see a much better option to help you
with your cable management pretty sweet
PC as well we have a 4770k with a gtx
970
if only your setups cable management was
as good as this I'm just kidding but
seriously watch that video I'm talking
about it will definitely help you out a
lot but yeah great setup overall with
minor improvements at number 5 we have
Joelle with a Productivity type set up a
15 inch retina MacBook Pro hooked up to
a Samsung 24 inch monitor on the desk we
have a wireless keyboard from Apple and
the popular MX Mouse from Logitech
another fantastic use of the modular
riser
definitely big in these setups a pair of
insignia three speakers on top with your
ps4 on the bottom and Focusrite audio
interface all the way on the left side
just imagine if you didn't have that
stand how everything would be cluttered
together by the way this is the IKEA mom
desk that I'm starting to see a lot of
on these episodes and by the way if
you're submitting your setup please
mention the name of the model your desk
a lot of people including me are
interested
Cayla management is outstanding thanks
to the desk but yeah overall a very
clean productivity setup great job next
up is Jose with an interesting dual
monitor setup we have a 24-inch Pankiw
monitor on top and a 24-inch AUC on the
bottom I'm almost confident that people
don't use both monitors for gaming and
instead the top is usually used as an
overhead for feeds or multitasking
anyways on the desk we have the corsair
k70 keyboard logitech g502 mouse a mecco
Mouse bungee and a pair of M audio AV 40
speakers with the Sennheiser 360 3d
headset on top cables aren't visible and
great job on the mods on the side of
your desk not only is the power outlet
off of the ground but it's nearby so you
can easily reach it by the way also link
the monitor mount he used down below in
case anyone is wondering but yeah really
interesting setup I might actually pick
up another ultrawide monitor and do what
you did there but we will see at number
seven we have do so with his all-white
theme we have a Dell p27 15 q 4k monitor
on top of a riser and two KRK Rokit six
monitor speakers on a custom made wooden
speaker stand actually the mono riser
and the speaker stands along with the
coaster on the table are all custom made
by him so kudos on that outstanding
woodwork on the desk we have an apple
keyboard SteelSeries rival mouse and the
popular Audio Technica m50 s this is
obviously a Productivity setup with your
audio technica interface below the
monitor and he blue mic on the right
side I can't help but notice that you're
running a Mac operating system yet you
have a custom PC which means that this
is most likely hackintosh build which I
have not seen on this episode yet so
congrats for being the first you don't
have the MIDI cables to begin with so
kale management is not bad but overall a
really clean setup the only thing I
would change is perhaps getting a white
PC case instead of the red to go with
the theme next up we have Kevin Spacey
and his game room setup this is a very
impressive layout
I've never seen anyone mount a PC on a
wall before that's pretty insane
so the desk we have a 23 inch Acer
monitor on top of this Itachi f3 stand
and below that we have the a0 levitron
keyboard and a rat 5 Mouse why
management is great I can see that you
have a dedicated place for all the
cables under the second desk and you
have a pretty sweet black and red PC as
well a 46 70 K paired with the r9 290
just hope the rack doesn't give in
having your PC come falling down because
that laptop is very precious next up is
myth Joe and holy mother of all displays
that is just ridiculous I mean come on
there's no way you use this on a daily
basis you would be blind in just a few
days with severe neck pain this is like
sitting in a very first row at the
movies no one does that but anyways this
is your setup so I'm gonna back up on
the desk we have a massive LG 55 inch 4k
TV hooked up to the ps3 Apple TV and
MacBook also on the desk we have a
Logitech keyboard and a Razer mumble
Mouse there's also a pair of Logitech G
230 headphones hanging from one of the
four Panasonic speakers you have
surprisingly cable management is not bad
and I notice your custom-made boombox
under your table very creative I'll give
you that but if I'm being Frank your
table is just too small for the stuff
that it's holding I would say either get
a smaller monitor or a bigger desk to
balance the ratio but other than that
it's a really interesting setup last but
not least we have Olay with yet another
vertical dual monitor setup we have an
unknown monitor on top and an Asus 24
inch on the bottom I gotta say that's a
really nice levitating monitor riser and
adding those LEDs behind the desk just
works on the table we have the corsair
k95 keyboard Logitech MX performance
mouse with a SteelSeries mouse pad cable
management is spotless using those racks
to keep all the stuff off the ground
that's basically it not much more to say
I almost forgot to mention the
SteelSeries Siberia elite headset
hanging from the top which i think would
look a lot better on a stand so that's
it for this week's episode of setup wars
