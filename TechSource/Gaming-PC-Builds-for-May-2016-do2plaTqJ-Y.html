welcome to another new series I'm
starting on the channel where I
basically go over two different budget
builds under a thousand dollars at the
beginning of every month I decided to do
this just from reading your messages and
comments that I get every day because
apparently my monthly PC bills aren't
enough for you guys and you want to see
more PC content so I figured this would
be a great way to add more of that on
text source so this is something you
guys want to see done every single month
on the channel make sure to leave a like
and also drop your feedback down below
after you're done watching the video
because this is the first episode and
it's not perfect so I'll be reading your
feedback and your comments just to tweak
it a bit and make this series perfect
for you guys but always thinking about
time let's take a look at these bills so
the two PC bills that we are looking at
today are a $530 PC and an $800 build
please keep in mind that these are the
parts that I would personally use if I
were to build one for myself and these
are based on price per performance so
basically the best bang for your buck
starting with the 530 build which is
another version of volt which I recently
built on the channel and the total cost
is five hundred thirty dollars and 42
cents plus tax and shipping but please
keep in mind that prices always change
depending on when you're watching this
video so once again we're going with an
FX 6300 processor but instead we're
pairing it with the gtx 960 you get a
solid quad core cpu which will run
pretty much any game in 1080p and it's
also great for productivity and editing
videos I always try and overclock my
processors to always squeeze out the
most performance which is why I went
with an unlocked chipset motherboard
that gigabyte 78 LMT
which is it expensive but very solid
obviously since I plan on overclocking I
had to pick up a cooler to keep the
temps low and ensure the processor lives
a long and healthy life if you don't
plan on overclocking you can skip over
to cooler which will save you $30
bringing the total cost of this bill
down to only 500 but it's only $30 in
the performance you gain from it is
worth it at least it is for me for RAM
we are sticking to the popular 4
gigabyte sticks from crucial for a total
of 8 gigs and one terabyte of hard drive
space
from Seagate if you want to throw in an
SSD instead there is a super cheap
option via P&amp;amp;Y
where you can get a 240 gigabyte SSD for
only $60 and I will leave a link to
everything mentioned in this video down
below for you guys and finally putting
all these parts together we are using
the raid max vortex case just like I did
for volt since it really looks cool and
the price is affordable going over 500
watts for this build is overkill and
while you can go with a 430 watt from
EVGA for five dollars less it doesn't
make sense not to make the 50 watt
upgrade the only real difference between
this build and volt is the GPU and
motherboard if you have a bit more
moolah to spend that are looking to push
more pixels then this is the bill do you
want an $800 gaming PC rocking a 4690k
and a gtx 970
as always I want to overclock my CPU
which is why I went with the K version
of the 4690 but if you want to save $40
and don't want to overclock you can
actually ditch the CPU cooler and go
with a non k version of the cpu that
will drop the total cost of this build
down to 746 you can also go with a
fractal core 1000 case if that looks
better for you but anyways back to the
build for the RAM I decided to switch
things up and go with a gigabytes of RAM
from g.skill ripjaws and for storage we
are going the SSD route with 480 bytes
of space from P&amp;amp;Y
for the case I went to the Zelda an ATX
case since we have a micro ATX board and
it does come with a USB 3.0 port for the
front panel which is nice since the
motherboard does feature onboard USB 3.0
do sync up all of these parts as the
EVGA 500 watt power supply once again
which brings the total to 787 and 10
cents what that will do for this month
as always if you guys enjoy this and
want to see it done every month make
sure to leave a like and let me know
what price range I should work on for my
next two pcs for next month that's
basically the thing guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
