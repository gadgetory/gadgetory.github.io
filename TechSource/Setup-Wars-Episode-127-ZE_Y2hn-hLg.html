montage went great the feedback was very
positive both in the comments section
and you like this like ratio and by the
way thank you guys so much for dropping
your feedback and also liking or
disliking the video because that's
that's a really great feedback for me so
because of that I'm actually gonna
continue doing them every single
Saturday right alongside setup Wars by
the way I'm sorry for launching this
video a day late the Halloween weekend
was a bit crazy and I I just didn't feel
like recording any videos so anyways
everything will be back on track setup
words will be on every single Monday set
of montage will be on every single
Saturday and if you guys don't like the
series you can obviously skip it and
just wait for setup words for every
Monday oh yeah with that said welcome to
setup wars episode I lost track 127
will you submit your desk setup to get
featured guys I'm looking for more
submissions so please if you want to
submit your awesome setup make sure to
watch the video linked down below for
the instructions and requirements but
with that said let the setup wars begin
so guys I finally moved on to another
addicting game on mobile and it's called
cats it's a very addicting game where
you basically participate in the World
Championship and go up against other
players using fighting machines that you
build yourself you get square parts from
opening boxes that you acquire from
winning battles to build the ultimate
fighting machine but the thing that
really makes this game really fun are
the physics it's unpredictable what your
fighting machine will do in battle I
really like the simplicity of the game
it's very easy to pick up and start
playing you can even join gangs and
fight with your friends for special
rewards it is a free game to download
and it's available on Android iOS and
Amazon as well I'll drop a link to it
down below but just for my subscribers
out there you guys can actually get a
jump start on the game if you guys use
the code cat's tech in the option menu
kicking off the show we got Dan and our
very first coca-cola themed set up
featuring an ultra-wide from Asus and
the mist el borracho keyboard with the
rival 300 Mouse at first I was wondering
why on hell is there a microUSB cable
connected to the keyboard twice and then
I realized that this keyboard apparently
splits in half
yeah that's cool so the reason why the
surface of the desk is reflective like
that is because he added the IKEA glass
home on the linen tabletop and it's
actually a pretty cool modification that
you guys can do on your desk if you want
something reflective I really like the
way that the lights from his PC are
reflecting on the surface it looks
pretty cool I don't know if this guy is
sponsored by coca-cola or what but he
has a lot of props and coca-cola decals
everywhere do you guys even know how bad
coke is for the body I mean I'm talking
that Coke or just any soda in general I
feel like I need to start a health
source channel to educate some people
out there I do want to give Dan some
major props on the cable management and
the organization in his room all the
wires are nice and tidy underneath the
desk but the most impressive thing is
how he managed the wires around his
entire room a bunch of wall raceways
were used to hide and route the cables
for his projector set up on the ceiling
the speakers and even the wires near the
ground all the choices from the
furniture to the decoration on the walls
were nicely done I also kind of get this
feeling that he added those cubicle
walls in his room to separate each set
up either way everything was beautifully
planned aside from the coca-cola
promotion I really liked this setup
thank you Dan for starting off the show
d1 is next up with an interesting corner
setup and he definitely made it work
with the amount of space he had he
stacked the monitors on top of each
other using the wall amount and one
other arm and he also managed to stick
both of his speakers underneath the Asus
monitors with some 3m tape honestly I
don't think that was really necessary
since he definitely had extra space for
them on the desk and underneath the
monitors but I guess he was trying to
keep everything compact and grouped
together in the center of the desk he
also got a joystick and the eraser or
not a chroma key board with the Naga
chroma Mouse so this setup was built for
a mix of gaming video editing and work
related tasks and he's actually using
two Dell laptops one of them is being
used for personal things like gaming and
the other is purely for work he keeps
one of them tucked away in his pull out
drawer and the other one is chilling on
his laptop stand that he hooked up
against the wall I would say he did a
good job overall with the cable
management I mean it's not the cleanest
work I've seen out there but everything
is wrapped again
and kept off the ground so I'm not gonna
complain here it's a neat and compact
setup that you got there but honestly I
would save some money and buy a larger
desk later down the line that way you
don't have to stack your monitors like
that and you have extra space to work
with but regardless thank you d1 for
entering a number 3 we got dr. D Flo who
is a youtuber by the way and I'll drop a
link to his channel below if you guys
want to check it out and this is a setup
that he uses for content creation as
well as gaming right off the bat I'm
attracted to that desk it's actually a
custom-built desk using some waxed steel
i-beams
with a beautiful marble tabletop fun
fact this entire desk actually weighs
over 600 pounds so yeah good luck moving
this thing when the time comes
so dr. D Flo says he's a minimalist and
he prefers to keep the surface as clean
as possible with as few items as
possible which is one of the reasons why
he went with the wireless route he's
walking the an Pro Wireless Keyboard and
he loves tech G 703 Mouse for audio he's
using the wireless v-moda crossfade twos
and the audio engine a 5 plus speakers
that are sandwiching the x34 ultra wide
I was like his custom-made Nixie tube
clock that he built using some acrylic
and anodized aluminum for the base it
definitely adds a level of
sophistication to this already
impressive setup as expected cable
management is on point and the PC
powering this monster is equipped with
the 5820k
and a Titan X Pascal with 64 gigs of RAM
a perfectly crafted powerful and elegant
setup Thank You dr. D flow for entering
and once again I'll drop a link to his
channel below so make sure to check him
out and show him some love speaking of
powerful we got Jacob and his beautiful
extra-wide set up featuring 234 you see
87's from LG and the massive 98 inch
heck back in counter top that's sitting
on top of to Alex your units this is
actually the same countertop I'm using
for my filming desk believe it or not
the wires from the course are RGB
keyboard and the Razer Naga are perfect
just the way I would have done it if
drilling a hole in the desk was not an
option well done there's definitely a
lot of surface area to work with
so Jacob made sure to utilize as much as
you can by spreading out his Android
figurines
on one side it's got his printer and on
the other side is the PC that's powering
this setup and since the window is
facing the right side this means that
this is an inverted build it's also our
very first water-cooled Rison build
featuring the 1800 X 32 gigs of ram and
these ZOTAC GTX 10 atti
per audio he's got a pair of em 50 X's
with the mod mic 5 attachment hiding in
the back as well as a pair of
ten-year-old Logitech X 240 speakers
very small of Jacob to use the middle
leg of the table as cover for the cables
running down into the outlet the rest of
the cables are tucked away nicely
underneath the desk along with the modem
power strip and the outlet nicely done
now I don't know how practical those
ultra wide monitors really are side by
side but if it's working out for you
then more power to you this setup
showcases organization and personality
judging by those wall shelves filled
with props and figurines
excellent work Jacob and thank you for
entering wrapping up the episode is
sekar at his simple and clean setup
featuring a single ultra light from a
soos sitting on top of the add-on unit
from Ikea the desk is also from Ikea and
he drilled a hole in it for the Razer
BlackWidow chroma keyboard the eraser
lancehead mouse and the Razer Firefly
mousepad I love that he has an extended
mousepad underneath his other mousepad
and a wrist rest as well for audio he's
using the Logitech z9 of 6 speakers
which are scattered around his setup but
he also has two pairs of headsets
underneath the desk which are the astro
a40 s and the turtle beach stealth for
hundreds
Sekar also has a youtube channel and for
voiceovers he uses the blue snowball ice
which is hooked up to a boom arm on side
he's also on top of the cable management
game not only did he keep all the cables
underneath the desk but he drilled a
hole for each of the speakers even the
PC wires are bundled together nicely
using the omnimount cable sleeve then
again I didn't expect anything less from
another youtuber excellent works a car
I'll drop a link to his channel as
always make sure you guys check it out

equipped with an overclocked 6700 K and
