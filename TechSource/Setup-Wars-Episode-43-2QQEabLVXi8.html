I recommend in this episode so here are
your 5 lucky contestants we have
Danielle Kailyn Marcus
Moses and Sergey congratulations for
making it to set up wars episode 43
first up is Danielle with a simple setup
we have a 27-inch BenQ monitor a Zalman
K 500 keyboard and Logitech G 402 mouse
on top of the SteelSeries mouse pad not
much else really on the desk other than
a pair of micro lag speakers some xbox
controllers and a desk lamp cable
management is pretty sweet great work
with the cable clips and Perish grip
mounting and I also noticed you wrapped
some cables against one of the legs
using a velcro strap job well done
the pcs powering the setup has a FX 6300
and a gtx 760 finally AMD makes an
appearance the only thing I would change
is to face the CPU cooler so that a fan
is on the right side because right now
it's sucking up hot air from a GPU very
clean and simplistic setup Thank You
Daniel for entering Kaelyn is next up
with a triple monitor setup mounted on
the nave point triple monitor arm we
have three 24-inch Bank use with the
middle one being a different model than
the other two and on the desk we have
the corsair k70 RGB keyboard and a
logitech g502 mouse on top of the Razer
Firefly mousepad cable management is on
point but I think you can connect both
of those cables together with a velcro
strap for a cleaner look if not it's all
good it's still a very clean job the pcs
powering the setup has an AMD FX 95 90
and a GTX 660 Wow so we have two AMD
processors in a row that's never
happened before
by the way Daniel this is how your CPU
coolers should look like a rule of thumb
is to always have the fan on the right
side if your rear fan is an exhaust take
a look at this console gaming setup we
have a giant 55 inch vizio smart TV
hooked up to the vizio sound bar and
then we have a ps4 and Xbox one right
below they sell a bunch of really cool
looking MacBook stands that I'll link
below for you to
check out that would really add to your
setup instead of just laying your
MacBook flat on the table like that but
other than that you have a very clean
setup Thank You Caitlin for entering
Markus is next up with yet another
triple monitor setup so we have three 32
inch 4k BenQ displays not one but two
Logitech G 19's azande row cation mouse
on top of an extended mouse pad some of
the stuff on the desk are the Edifier
speakers and a few pairs of headphones
cable management is atrocious and
instead of recommending a bunch of items
to you I will direct you to watch my
cable management video which will be
linked below for you I mean there's a
lot of things going on here besides the
bad cable management do you have an
extra keyboard lying around headphones
all over the place and speakers on top
of a glass shelf desks or other
tabletops with glass surfaces tend to
reflect certain frequencies and absorb
others which will affect the sound so
try moving the morale maybe put them on
your desk and you can actually hear the
difference in sound quality a brainwaves
trust hanger would definitely keep two
of those headphones neatly hidden away
and lastly a jumbo monitor riser in the
middle can help you keep the second
keyboard in a dedicated place if you
really need one the middle matter would
be a lot higher but you can adjust the
height so it's level with the other two
this set up definitely needs some work
but I'm sure with a few tweaks here and
there it will be a badass setup Thank
You Markus for entering a number 4 we
have Moses with a quad display setup and
we haven't seen these in such a very
long time on the show we have three
24-inch Adel monitors and a 27 inch tail
monitor up top on the desk we have a
pair of creative t20 speakers the
courser k95 RGB keyboard a coarser m65
RGB mouse and a razer extended mouse pad
we also have an audio technica at2020
mic hooked up to a boom arm off to the
side excellent work with the cable
management
I like the cable Tunnel you have against
the wall to route the monitor wires all
the way down to the bottom and then we
have a power strip attached to the wall
I also really like the compartment on
the desk allowing you to wrap cables
through it but I don't get why you
didn't do the keyboard wire as well the
PC that's pushing all those pixels is
powered by a 4790k and a gtx 980
and we're back to Intel builds already a
really impressive setup I got nothing to
recommend Thank You Moses for entering
last but at least we have Sergey with a
setup inside of a fish tank oh what's
the wrong picture sorry here we go so we
have two LG 23 inch monitors mounted
against the wall and below that we have
the SteelSeries apex keyboard
SteelSeries sensei mouse on top of the
qck mousepad some of the stuff on the
desk are a pair of beats solo2
headphones and iPad Mini 3 LG g3
smartphone and a pretty cool looking
knife up top we have the dat speakers
which are also wall-mounted although
they aren't exactly symmetrical with
each other we also have a shelf full of
tiny alcoholic beverages and a hookah
vase in the corner vault pretty good
work with cable management the majority
of the cables are on the Signum but I
suggest picking up an omni bound cable
sleeve to cover up the rest of the
cables going behind your desk a pretty
sweet-looking headphone angle would go
great with those beats headphones and a
smart phone stand to match your
beautiful black and white set up with
some minor tweaks this setup has the
potential to be a flawless setup
nonetheless Thank You Sergey for
entering so--that's for this week's
episode of set up or is you guys know
