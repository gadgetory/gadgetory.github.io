today I'm gonna look at the new MacBook
Air just released by Apple Apple just
released two of their MacBook Airs we're
looking at the 13-inch base model which
starts at 1099 and there's also an 11
inch model release starting at $9.99
okay while I'm unboxing the MacBook Air
I'm gonna go over some changes they made
compared to the previous models I'll
start off with a battery life so with
the new MacBook Air sporting Intel's
fourth generation CPU it boosts major
battery improvements over last year's
model the new 13-inch MacBook Air
actually increased the battery life from
seven to twelve hours up to ten hours of
video playback and can be in standby
mode for over thirty days and a full
charge which is pretty impressive so
this base model has 128 gigabytes of
storage space for gigabytes of RAM and
1.3 gigahertz dual-core Intel Core i5
processors okay so let's continue on
with unboxing for now I'm gonna put the
MacBook aside and check out everything
else that's inside the box so first up
this looks like where the manual and
warranty information would go so let's
go and open this up and check it out
first thing you see are two Apple
stickers then you have a Quick Start
Guide showing you the basic functions of
the MacBook and you have your warranty
information of course so enough of that
nonsense let's move on and see what else
these are this appears to be the wall
charger and there are actually two
different kinds and sizes this one is
the basic to plug charger which you can
fold up and appears to have a removable
slot to add an extension to and this one
here is the extension for those of you
that need a much longer cable in order
to plug it in this is the part that you
need to insert into the removable slot
to make it happen so this is all
connected to the left side of the
macbook with this small two-sided
magnetic connector so this MacBook Air
actually has new Wi-Fi improvements the
MacBook Air now supports 802.11 AC Wi-Fi
allowing for wireless performance up to
three times faster than 802 11 and along
with the speed improvements this macbook
improves the overall strength and range
of the Wi-Fi signal so along with the
processors the macbook also comes in a
new intel HD graphics 5000 and can offer
speeds up to 40% faster than last gen
models
going with the whole faster thing Apple
also decided to throw in an all flash
storage that offers speed improvements
over last year's flash storage for up to
45% display wise the MacBook Air comes
with an LED display with a resolution of
1440 by 900 along with a HD 720p camera
on the top therefore FaceTime calls and
more okay so let's take a look at the
left side of the Mac you have a Mac safe
- connection which is where you plug in
and charge your macbook you have a USB
3.0 port a headphone jack and you have
dual mics allowing for background noise
to be reduced so on the right side of
the macbook there are a total of three
slots there is an SDXC card slot another
USB 3 port and a thunderbolt port now
I'm sure you notice that there is no CD
tray and that's a slight negative for
some people I'm sure but because of the
media today you can download almost
anything straight from the internet
making CD trays obsolete so that's if an
unboxing thank you so much for watching
