Squarespace the one tool needed to
create your very own website or
portfolio for a free trial or your first
purchase use the Kotex source 1 for 10%
off what is up you guys text source is
back with another comparison today we
are comparing the $3,000 base model Mac
Pro to our custom gaming PC which we
built a few months ago for the same
price if you guys haven't seen the
videos that already here is the link to
it alright so here are the specs for
both machines you can pause the video if
you need more time but for the sake of
the video I'm going to continue we will
be comparing booting speeds benchmark
scores rendering speeds transferring
speeds and lastly gaming performance to
see which computer performs the best for
the same cost keep in mind that we made
it as far as possible we removed all the
necessary background programs that are
not needed to run the computer as well
as disabling all the non-essential
startup programs for the boot up test
except steam alright so let's start the
booting test here we go
while Apple has already done booting
just after 13 seconds we're going to
speed up the PC just to find out when
that starts and it looks like it just
finishes shy of 40 seconds so the
obvious winner for the booting time goes
to Mac next up we have the benchmarks we
ran two different programs
the first being Geekbench and again we
removed all the background applications
so it won't reflect on the score and
taking a look at the score looks like
Mac's scored 30 to 74 for the single
core and 13,000 27 for the multi-core
whereas the PC scored 36 74 for the
single and 22 0 46 for the multi making
the PC the clear winner for the first
benchmark test the next benchmark test
was Cinebench r15 again nothing is
running on the background taking a look
at the scores it looks like the Mac
clocked in at 77 frames per second with
a Cinebench score of 662 whereas the PC
clocked in at 124 frames with a score of
1140 3 which gives the point to the PC
for benchmarks all right the next test
is rendering a computer isn't all about
gaming it's about getting work done as
well so for video editing we installed
Adobe Premiere Pro on both computers and
use the same exact settings to render
the same exact video we sped this up so
we don't bore you guys to death and as
you can clearly see the PC finishes
first
but the Mac Pro isn't that far behind
moving out of data transfers we copied
an 11 gigabyte movie file to the desktop
for some reason it's showing that the
file is a bit larger on the Mac but no
matter it finishes minutes earlier than
the PC we knew that as these were not
going to stand a chance against the
speeds of the PCIe flash storage already
the last and final test is the gaming
performance we ran the most intensive
game note we could find that was
compatible on both systems so we went
with the game Metro last night on max
settings for both computers and you can
already tell by the footage you on the
max average FPS fluctuated between 20 to
30 while the PC remained at a constant
60 to 70 frames throughout the game this
recorded footage doesn't really do the
test justice since the frames appear a
lot lower than it actually is on both
machines but it's pretty evident that
the PC wins in this test with a super
fast memory powerful CPU and work great
graphics the Mac Pro seems to be a
killer
machine but when we stacked it up
against our PC it had trouble holding
its own and data transfer tested PC
didn't stand a chance with the mac pro
loading up just about everything much
faster than the pc but the superiority
pretty much stops there even though the
Mac Pro's GPUs may be more than capable
they they're not compared to the single
GTX 780 when they were put up against
each other from gaming to rendering
video files in Adobe Premiere the 780
proved to be the superior card the Mac
CPU was also bested by a 3930k during
the benchmark tests even though the Mac
Pro is fairly priced and has exceptional
Hardware for the price it was put to
shame by a PC that was built with the
same budget of $3,000 in the end it does
come down to personal preference the Mac
Pro is elegant and revolutionary design
makes a nice machine for anyone who's
looking for a good performance desktop
computer that can also handle moderate
levels of professional video and photo
work the PC is for someone who likes to
be more involved in the creation process
as one can make his PC part by part and
customize it to its liking I'm going to
personally stick with my PC I'm not that
impressed with the Mac Pros performance
yes the more expensive options will get
better performance but the same can be
said about the PC so before I go I want
to thank Squarespace for making this
possible and show you guys our website
yeah we do have one in fact we had it
for a while now for those of you that
did not even know it existed we built it
using Squarespace and it was extremely
easy for us I think we got it up and
running in less than a day everything is
drag-and-drop which makes it super easy
to configure and there's a bunch of
awesome templates you can choose from or
you can even start from scratch like we
did this isn't just a website you can do
a lot more with Squarespace you can
build your own portfolio create an
online store and sell stuff and it also
scales to look beautiful on any device
