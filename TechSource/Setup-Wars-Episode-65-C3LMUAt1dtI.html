destroy one of my GPUs in front of the
camera with a hammer well I tried guys
we didn't hit 60 thousand likes so
unfortunately I cannot destroy a GPU a
lot of you guys were actually against
that in the beginning so you guys did it
you save the GPU from getting destroyed
so I'm mad about word unfortunately I
won't be destroying the MSI GTX 1080
however I will be back next week for a
different challenge
I never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest CD
keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below what's
up guys is that from tech source and
welcome to setup bores episode is 65
where you submit your desk setup to get
featured on a channel so if you guys are
interested in being part of the show
make sure to watch the video linked
below
here are 5 contestants for this week we
have Dustin Erik Luke or luck Samantha
and Tommaso congratulations for making
it on the show so starting to show off
we have Dustin and is incredibly unique
setup at first glance you might think
that this is another one of those desk
modded pcs but it's not this is actually
a handcrafted desk with motherboards
inside he's calling it the motherboard
graveyard now I don't know if those were
his past motherboards from his previous
builds but what I do know is that they
are all dead it also looks like he
handcrafted the monitor riser which is
holding up to 23 inch acer displays and
a 17 inch dell monitor in vertical mode
on the desk we have the key cool 104 RGB
keyboard and a razer deathadder mouse he
did add a USB hub on the top of the
riser for easy access right next to his
blue yeti that's also attached to a boom
arm organization definitely seems to be
present and the cable management is no
exception
very clean job hiding all the cables
behind the desk and it looks like we
also have a SteelSeries Siberia v2
headset hanging on a self-made hanger
finally the PC that's powering the setup
has a 35 70 K and a GTX 780 with some
handmade custom sleeving
very impressive and unique set of what
the hell I just noticed he made a clock
out of an old hard drive alright so I
think this is officially the most
creative setup I've seen on setup wars
and you know what because of that I want
to ward you $100 so if you're watching
this video make sure the email setup
wars can claim your prize' brilliant
work Dustin thank you for entering
arrogance next up with a very clean set
up Wow
did I say clean I meant immaculate an
Acer predator ultrawide monitor hooked
up against the wall and below that we
have a Logitech G 19 keyboard and R at 7
miles
a reservist pule a mousepad on the right
side we can see is total beach elite 800
headset and all the way on the other
side is the PC with a 5820k that's
overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz and that's
paired with a none other than the GTX
1080 founders edition graphics card I do
love the wall shelves with the figurines
and the posters I think those add a nice
touch of personality to the overall
setup but God Bernal look at that cable
management this is next-level I mean
everything is neatly wrapped together
and mounted against the roof not a
single wire is visible from the top
excellent work Eric you make me so proud
ladies and gentlemen the seal of
approval goes to
so yeah it looks like one of the bottles
has less liquid than the others so close
seriously though all jokes aside this is
a very impressive setup thank you Eric
very much for entering Luke is next up
with another very cool setup this
episode is on fire so we have a 34 inch
dell ultrasharp monitor in the middle
with a 27 inch a user right next to that
in vertical mode and below that we have
the Razer BlackWidow chroma key board
and you rat 7 Mouse on top of the
technic XL mousepad that's pretty much
all there is on a desk
other than the set of speakers and the
preamp in the center cable as well looks
pretty good I can see that he wrapped
the cables together and use the Signum
from Ikea to hold everything up the PC
that's powering the setup is an
interesting one it looks like a
custom-built case and inside that we
have the 4790k and a gigabyte extreme
gaming 980ti now although i'm against
putting that under the table you pretty
much have no choice so I get it
overall a very clean ultra light setup
Thank You Luke for entering samantha is
next up with a black themed setup so we
have two 24-inch asus monitors a
logitech 800 keyboard and m 705 mouse on
top of the VIP hands extended mousepad
also on the desk we have a pair of
logitech x2 30 speakers an anchor USB
hub and a new Alexi phone stand when it
comes to cable management she did a
really great job routing the wires near
the bottom and keeping everything else
off of the floor I will give you some
points for using cable drops and
organizers for the loose charging cables
and on the other side we have a Samsung
TV with her Wii U and ps4 underneath as
well as a nice collection of games and
DVDs I'm definitely liking the overall
organization but finally wrapping the
set up we have her PC inside the s340
case we actually got a really nice black
and red thing going on over here with a
6600 K and an msi r9 390 you already
knew I was going to comment on the wall
shelf up there since you left a note
about it but other than a minor fix and
maybe adding some more red here set up
to match your color scheme of the PC I
see that this is a very organized and
good looking setup Thank You Samantha
for entering finishing up the episode we
have tomato soup with a very modest a
single display setup we have a 27-inch
Dell monitor hooked up on the wall and
below that we
of the CM storm quickfire TK keyboard
Logitech g600 Mouse and they both sell
five soundbar also mounted on the wall
as the logitech g930 wireless headset
one of the dudes from Assassin's Creed
is here along with little Walter jr. I
still don't know what that is in his
hand we even figure out what that was
from the past episodes
I'm thinking it's meth but I could be
wrong now this is something I haven't
seen before now normally the cable boxes
are supposed to be on the floor but
Tomaso said catch and mounted it against
the roof of the desk but the rest of the
cable management is excellent everything
is neatly tied together and you also
have a wall Raceway running down all the
way to the floor and finally let's take
a look at the PC it's running on a 5820k
with a gigabyte gtx 970 there's
definitely not a lot going on here but
it's clean and I like it
the only thing I would suggest is maybe
adding some posters or maybe even a
shelf above your monitor since there's a
lot of blank space but overall a very
clean and simple setup Thank You Tommaso
