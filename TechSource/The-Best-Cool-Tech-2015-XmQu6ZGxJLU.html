growing so fast is because of the cool
tech series I started back in April 2015
believe it or not most of those videos
which over five hundred thousand views
each it became one of the most popular
tech series video on YouTube but since
2015 is over I went ahead and went
through every single one of those videos
and hand-picked my personal favorite out
of each video and I'm gonna share with
you guys all so if you guys are feeling
bored I'll go to leave a link down below
to the playlist of all of the cool tech
videos I've done for 2015 it's actually
pretty impressive to see the transition
from back then all the way till today a
lot has definitely changed but anyways
without wasting any more time let's
start the video
so everything I feature in this video
will be linked down below in the order
that they appear so it's easier for you
guys to find them so starting from the
month of June I featured the audio
technica hanger which is great and
hiding headsets or headphones on the
right table since it can rotate also in
June I introduced the cootch ear LED
lamp which is a touch sensitive desk
lamp with different dimming options and
four modes whether you are reading a
book
studying relaxing or sleeping it also
uses eighty percent less energy than
traditional incandescent lamps but
offers the same level of brightness it
features a USB port on the side and it's
the most flexible LED lamp that I have
ever seen jumping into August I featured
a bunch of really cool stuff but I'll go
over my top three picks for the sake of
time the first item is a Bluetooth lock
called the quick lock you can unlock it
using your smartphone and NFC card that
you can carry in your wallet or by using
a keychain card I still use it even till
today and it's great for travel going to
the gym or just for anyone really who
doesn't like carrying extra keys or
remembering pass codes next up are the
NX 80 earphones which was one of the
best finds for my channel even till
today I'm shocked at how a pair of
amazing earphones like these cost only
thirteen dollars the quality you get
from these are incredible considering
the price tag and it's also available in
red blue white and black
my last favorite item featured four cool
tech of August is the cheese stone this
is a wireless charger that doubles as a
four thousand milliamp hour power bank
what separates this wireless Qi charger
is that it's actually wireless meaning
you don't have to plug it into a wall
for it to work it's compatible with all
smart phones that have wireless charging
September's edition of cool tech was by
far the longest and that's because there
were a bunch of really awesome stuff
like these Wireless LED strips from
friends of you that's actually been part
of my setup for the longest time it's a
bit pricey but I can assure you that
it's worth every penny
not only can you control the lights from
your smartphone but they are RGB meaning
you can set them to virtually any color
you can think of the notification
integration makes it super easy to
switch between the scenes which you have
pre-configured and you can even turn
them off and on by simply tapping on the
scenes easily one of the best tech I've
invested in for my set up the next item
is great for travel and on the go this
the SanDisk I expand for iPhones and
iPads it's basically like an SD card but
for Apple devices instead of
transferring large movie or video files
onto your iPad or iPhone you can store
them into this flash drive and stream
the videos music or even movies straight
from it this is a lifesaver when I'm
traveling especially effective for long
flights then I go charger is also one of
my favorites and I still use it even
till today they have one available for
the ps4 and Xbox one and it basically
connects to the USB ports and acts as a
charging station for the controllers
these dongles connect to the microUSB
port and begin charging as soon as you
place them on the station and yes they
are magnetic so you can just drop them
off and they will snap in place since
they occupy the two USB ports in the
front you will find two USB ports in the
back for pass-through the last item I
featured in September are the HyperX
cloud 2 gaming headset which also
remains my favorite gaming headset today
super comfortable to wear that comes
with a detachable mic and features 7.1
virtual surround sound it's compatible
with PC and Mac as well as ps4 and Xbox
one but you might need a stereo adapter
for it to work on the Xbox one
moving on to October I featured the
popular Titan loop which is a lightning
cable made out of industrial-grade
flexible steel it's MFI certified which
means that it's made for iphone it's
great for travel since you can hook it
up to your keychain backpack or even
pocket if you have pets that eat up your
cable and this is the answer you are
looking for speaking of keychains this
next item is called an orbit key and
it's basically a wallet for your keys it
can hold anywhere from two to seven keys
and it's a great way to prevent
scratches to your other belongings if
you happen to put them in your pocket
with your phone or toss them in your
backpack with other devices you just
simply pull out the key you need to use
and slide it back in when you are done
they also come with optional add-ons
that are compatible with the orbit key
like a USB flash drive and a bottle
opener one of my favourite take on their
$5 is this foldable life in the shape of
a credit card if it's easily in wallets
or wallet cases and the blade itself is
really sharp there's also one available
in a light blue which looks a lot cooler
and finally we arrive at the last
month's episode of 2015 cool tech on
their 50 for December which is easily my
favorite episode of them all the first
item I feature is this amazing mini
tripod from Manfrotto
so that I use for vlogging it's a really
solid portable tripod that can be
adjusted by pressing down on this button
and is available in many different
colors this next item is something I use
religiously every single day ever since
I stumbled across it never again will I
ever need to buy batteries the EBL
battery charging station comes at four
double A batteries and triple-a
batteries that you can juice up anytime
you want for my experience using these
the past month they seem to last longer
than regular alkaline batteries and they
make my life so much easier
Thank You e BL for this amazing
invention seriously my new favorite
power bank of all time is from Ankur
this is the 10050 Power Core Plus which
I take with me everywhere it comes a
Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 feature and
charges my iPhone 6s plus from zero to
100% in about an hour I do not
the last item in this video is the e box
power cable box if you have a power
strip with a bunch of plugs and want to
clean up your cable management game then
this thing can definitely help out so
