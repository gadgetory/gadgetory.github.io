gonna give huge things to super evil
Megacorp for sponsoring this video
vainglory is a popular mobile game that
recently released their new mode where
you can go up against five opponents in
a true 5v5 MOBA game essentially get the
PC experience on mobile this game is
designed so well from the graphics to
the hero animations and the mechanics
this is a skill based game however it's
easy to learn and it's easy to unlock
new heroes and skins that support up 220
FPS so it's recommended to play on the
new razor phone or iPad pro but if you
guys don't have either then it's not a
big deal because you still get at least
60 FPS vainglory is free-to-play and
it's available on the App Store Google
Play and the Amazon App Store and just
my subscribers out there I'll be giving
away three $20 gift cards of your choice
and all you have to do is download the
game using my link below and send me a
screenshot of your most epic kill in
game by dropping that in the comment
section down below I'll be announcing
the winner at the end of February on my
Twitter account so make sure you guys
are following me there now back to the
episode
so we need eight so that's eight over
here and six so basically we need two
cables because this one comes at a total
of eight and this other one comes at
also another eight but you can remove
two for a total of six now what do we do
slide it well I guess we should hook up
everything first correct the back from
the back beautiful cool you led my mind
yeah
well I've actually got the cables hooked
up what is the next step
fan goes down faces down so what do we
do we take off this can Harry yeah good
stuff
actually uh before we put it in you can
do it now but it'd be a good idea to put
the bracket back on on the faster play
okay oh wait I took this this one yeah
except to the actual person god okay the
screws I gave you and then we could stop
it back in okay the best thing to do is
obviously test the components before but
we're doing the tech source way we're
just plugging everything in we're
praying for the best yeah all right
every component is connected except the
graphics card so what did you want to do
next I guess is the question the
graphics we ended up but I think will be
easier to reach some of the plugs on the
motherboard without it without the
graphics card because we have to still
plug in the SATA cable and stuff like
that what do you want to hook up the
cables yeah I want to test your
knowledge you see where each cable
connects to so let's start off with the
easy ones how about that the 24 pin
cable
yeah not in that perfect table number
two it's gonna be a USB three this is to
plug in the USB three header in the
front so what goes yes the J USB 3
perfect the only cable that looks just
like it the only port that looks just
like it so see point at CPU one is
usually like I'm where on the
motherboard below is it below the 24 no
that's the USB good job so top right or
left of the motherboard right no if I'm
wrong I'm not listen it was 5050 5050
this is the top left top left okay so
remember you were even telling me that
to wrap the cable at the top and hold
the motherboard okay alright so
everything is hooked up I'll be working
on the cable and right afterwards we've
got to make sure the computer actually
turns on so this is pretty much what it
looks like so far very gothic I would
probably all I'll call it a
batman-themed PC for sure not a single
light source in there but yeah I think
the last thing is to plug in the Bevers
card hold on do the honours plug that
bad boy oh there it is I have it you
know we keep you at office actually
oh yes good call the top one we gotta
take out the second or third second is
already offensive and then we have to
take on another one for my wife oh yes I
almost forgot about that
he picked up a wireless adapter because
I'm guessing you're gonna hook this PC
up via Wi-Fi yes
is it because your Ethernet cable is too
short the router is just yeah it's it's
with a lock on your house make sense so
this is a so ii x board connection yes
it is so we can plug that in I don't
want to plug that in the bottom as far
away from the GPU as possible so he
doesn't get to it
alright that's uh this plug this in
first actually if you want unbox stuff
we can plug that in at the end as long
as we just plug that first alright baby
beautiful yeah back in alright let's put
those back in the box with the finale
guys the GPU and we're gonna see if our
hard work paid off or not if it doesn't
post there may be a part three in this
video I don't know obviously Z wants to
play I want to start gaming as soon as
possible so let's see if you can get
this done first try also you told me you
wanted to scream right yes this is also
streaming pieces yes so what kind of
games do you want ice cream pop geo
somos yeah pop G for sure the most all
FPS is Frankie from overwatch fortnight
pub G ok anything like that I might
throwing some smite for MOBA fans but
nice okay nice you already have a twitch
channel setup and everything I have one
set up but I haven't started obviously
cuz inaudible computer yeah I do have a
page and everything yeah cool yeah you
guys want to check him out I'll drop a
link to his stream down below maybe you
can show them some love
oh yeah no way dude this Gordon plug
this baby in let's do it dude your honor
let's go ahead and peel this off they'll
bring it up closer to the mic so we can
hear that glorious peeling
we're long eautiful he's got we got one
more for the case guys yeah that's for
the finale cool let's pop it open
I mean to pull off the plastic yeah yeah
don't want to plug in the GP with that
on yeah you do want to do most take up
to almost grabs cards yeah yeah mostly
to stick up to very few take three the
triple slot ones which are like those
really yeah the ones from gigabyte
alright guys so here it is the Gotham
bill I'm calling the hash tag off that
hash tag hash tag Batman yeah the GPU
does have RGB on here of course and the
light so you can turn that off obviously
any light in here would completely mess
with the color scheme the old black
color scheme or you can just leave it on
the white just got some nice you know
some lighting in there but overall man
what do you think looks good as what you
expected is what you envisioned when you
were yeah building the pieces yeah
definitely really yeah it looks pretty
good
nice dude very nice oh yes power
distinct up let's see if it boots up and
then if it does we can work on the heel
management I'm gonna show you how to
overclock this bad boy and we'll install
the drivers to set you up awesome job
ladies and gentlemen the moment I've
been waiting for everything is hooked up
we're together let's see if it indeed
boots up you want to do a countdown yeah
we are three two one why smiling Bob
that looks good you jinxed it dude
PC shut off that's normal sometimes it
does that
sometimes
so wait
the power strip is unplugged yeah
let's restart it see what happens
congratulations man congratulations
oh I do not want to go through
troubleshooting yeah not at all at all I
was like wasting a little yeah look hey
I was gonna little nervous the first
time when we booted the episode 1 we
didn't plug in the power supply I think
right or something something went along
there but this time it was a freaking
power outlet the switch on yes exactly -
oh streak hex or sybilla's guys I'm good
at that see if you knew three in a row
for his booboo eye man so next step is
we're gonna plug in Windows 10 assist
the pro or just a sound okay cool so I'm
gonna get you loaded on Windows once I
have all the drivers are offloaded ready
to go I'm gonna cut some cable
management go do some sexy b-roll show
off the inside of the PC even though
there's no RGB that will show off the
cable management of course cuz you do
get that with the text source experience
you get the pristine cable manager work
as well and I got a little something for
you at the end all this a little gift
whoo cuz I cuz the first episode I gave
something to you know the person I was
helping build so it'd only be nice to
give something to you at the end so
we'll see you guys soon look at this up
top so the pcs done everything is
updated all the drivers are downloaded
you're pretty much good to go
the only thing we're gonna do is
overclock your 77 1 gk because it's a
shame to leave it at speeds definitely
so we're gonna push that when a tram
push the least 5 you can hurts because
it is possible if not I'll settle for
point eight or even four point nine so
basically when you restart when you turn
on your PC the first time you hit delete
to get into the BIOS school and over
here is where it's gonna give you the
options to overclock your processor
awesome what I like to do over here is
hit the f7 always that turns into the
Advanced Mode and I just like the lad
layout of the
the menu better definitely gives you
more options so down here when you go to
overclock settings and over here it says
overclock Explorer mode we're gonna
switch that to experts because we're
experts obviously okay so over here now
you have the option to set the clock
speed for each specific core now
typically these can go up to five
gigahertz based on my previous
experience and if you just search up on
our you know articles and forums people
can push it to five you guys but what I
gotta go with that high okay as at first
we're gonna start low and gradually
increase so let's just do something very
simple do 45 now next in you want to do
scroll down you guys make sure you
always enable extreme memory poor file
the XMP this is basically we're gonna
overclock your RAM
by the way número what the megahertz is
on around 3,000 to 8,000 good memory the
amount of frequency you want you want to
take it off auto and set up to the 3000
now ideally what you can do is once you
have a find the stable overclock to the
processor you can come back and you can
increase that slowly but surely so the
next one would be what 3066 you click
that option and you go your do your
benchmarking and stuff if there's a
crash go back input increase it you can
be sitting tall keep putting spot that
you know what's up so okay without that
we scroll down we got to set the voltage
now for both the processor and the ram
the ram is easy we always set it to one
point three five volts so stock it's one
point two so we hit 155 make sure we're
applying enough juice to the to the ramp
and then the processor stock 1.14 i
looked it up on the forums people are
getting around one point three five to
one point three seven five so then this
stuff no it's more 1.30 it's more
because we're gonna be overclocking
alright it needs more juice so we're
gonna set it to one point three hoops
one point three five just to start off
that's a very baseline very basic
voltage and once we've done all that all
we got to do is hit that tenth which
saves all of your information
it tells you you're looking changed well
that's cool except in profile we sent it
through four point five gigahertz and
here's our voltages for you me and enter
it's gonna do its thing and that's
basically a waiting game it's okay we're
at the program here are fifteen now
we're gonna hit the cpu benchmark here
we're gonna see so if I didn't crash
usually crashes immediately so I think
we're doing pretty good but so it's been
more stable we're good to go
remember how to score 1005 Cinebench
that score should go up the more we
clock it obviously so we'll go back
we're gonna restart yeah providing the
bias ideally you want to increase it by
100 megahertz but since we're on a time
frame well I'm gonna jump straight to
Simon ballpark yeah yeah oh yeah well
I'll do four point eight
hold on three to four point eight 48
I'll keep the same voltage because if it
crashes then I can go back and increase
the voltage so far so good let's open up
the program ideal you want to check
temperatures while you're running this -
because I didn't download the HW monitor
program okay but I don't think it's
necessary but just for your reference if
you're gonna be overclocking always have
that open up next to it so you get one
of many times if you gets too high he
gets in the high 80s 90s then your
frequency or voltage is set too high
okay you want to lower voltage to get
lower temps and if the crashes that
means the frequencies to high you gotta
know that as well okay so see 1064 so
already that's like 60 something more
points squadron alright so going
straight to five we're using a stable
same voltage see it's jumping into the
high 80s actually admitted he doesn't
know about that and we're still running
down 1.35 both so that's pretty good
it's it's stable I mean the only other a
test I recommend is to run 595 or either
64 or a few hours and see how that goes
but your system really isn't gonna be
pushed that much you're not gonna be
editing right young a mostly gaming is
GPU intensive so honestly I think you're
set look at the score 1000 I almost
almost 100 1100 almost
more than what we originally started
with itself yeah I mean I mean just keep
it the way it is no my 35 volts if
anything I think maybe we can underclock
the voltage I lowered it the voltage so
we went from one point three five to one
point three to five okay so point 25
voltage to be on the clock did okay low
a yes it's barely capping at 85 wow
that's
I am impressed that's good I'm impressed
I'm gonna bug you bite down yeah you
don't need our DB right yes if you're
going on RGB you guys are gonna get a
faster processor oh there we go guys
yeah I knew it
Illuminati was not in here it was a
freaking thermal grizzly I don't want to
speak just yet I want to figure it out
I'll get to the bottom of this but I
have a strong suspicion that the thermal
paste swapping has something to do with
these clock speeds possibly 5.0
gigahertz at one point three volts is
the sweet spot still very very impressed
and happy with that I would say you have
one civilization congratulation I'll do
you that's Pete wants a man let me show
you the cable management a little quake
on the back we're gonna put on the panel
and then you're good to get off cool
yeah that's pretty much it what would
you rate your experience over all
buildings PC with me Adam Safi solid 10
easy yes and is this as easy as he
thought PC building would be was a lot
easier when you actually put in you know
when you aren't you building yourself
when I was watching the YouTube videos I
think I should have more imagine myself
doing it more so I could put myself in
the situation because when I had the
cables I was kind of lost trying to just
imagine like you doing it okay rather
than doing it myself so but it was
pretty good though the experience was
different then as opposed to watching
and actually building not too much not
too much just a little bit with the
cables that's it yeah would you say it
was a lot easier building in the idea I
guess my question is are you more
familiar now oh yeah for sure okay sweet
sweet cool man amen before I let you go
I do have one little gift for you I miss
a kid I was like what am I gonna do I'm
giving you this mouse I know you told me
that you were gaming on a laptop or not
yeah you game on your girlfriend's
laptop yeah and even I have actual a
laptop for yourself so I decided to give
you something I haven't been using this
is the Qi woo
it's basically the MacBook for China wow
it's a very sleek very clean laptops
brand-new and you can use this for your
streaming videos do we like work it
doesn't have a gratis car intent but you
know it's pretty powerful and it does
Awesome's got a beautiful screen on
there really nice keyboard a nice
touchpad and I think you're doing wow
thank you room noise thank you very much
you're welcome dude
that's where you that's pretty much it
out wraps up this episode guys if you
enjoyed it tossing a like would be
awesome and if you guys want to check
out today's twitch channel drop below
check me though is if you shoot me
really soon with this beast PC so yes I
get home really does get home yeah
that's crazy yeah but yeah I think I saw
what you have for watching I hope you
enjoyed it and subscribe for more
