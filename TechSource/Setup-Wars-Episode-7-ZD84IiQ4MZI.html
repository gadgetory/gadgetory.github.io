tech source and welcome to episode 7 of
setup Wars where you submit your desk
setup to get featured on my channel and
a chance to win a prize I have some
every Monday and I randomly select 5 of
your submissions and feature them on my
channel you guys get to vote on the best
desk setup if you guys are new to the
series and want to submit your desk
setup you need to watch the video linked
down below for the instructions and
requirements with that said let the
setup Wars finally begin
all right so the five lucky contestants
for this week are Augustine caliper Ben
Evert and Benjamin and yes they are two
different people
congratulations for making it to this
week of setup wars by the way all the
products I mentioned in this video will
be linked down below as well as a
recommended section where I recommend
products in this episode it will have
its very own special section down below
all right so first up we have Augustine
and it looks like we have a purple theme
set up interesting enough I haven't seen
one yet so this will be the first so we
have two samsung 23 inch monitors a
Razer Deathstalker keyboard a Death
Adder mouse and Razer Electra headphones
there has to be at least one Razer
product and every single one of these
setups I swear also on the desk you have
a MacBook Pro and an apple wireless
mouse along with you blue Yeti mic all
the way on the left side I actually had
that mic when starting out on YouTube so
very solid choice on the mic you didn't
send me a picture under your desk but
from what I can see you did an okay job
I don't see that many cables underneath
awesome job on the PC it really goes
well with your entire setup and your
purple LEDs in the back tie everything
together superb job my friend
the PC rocks and Intel i7 4790k
processor with a GTX 970 FTW edition and
as always I will leave a link to the
parts and specs down below now for the
recommendation part and I'm pretty sure
you really know what I'm going to say
but get a mousepad for sure I prefer an
extended one but you can just get a
traditional square mat if you choose
also your Razer headphones are just kind
of lying there and the fact that it's
Wireless means that it will look really
good on the mov headphone holder that I
covered in my last video but I'll go and
leave a link to both of them down below
oh yeah great setup Agustin thank you
for entering setup wars next up we have
caliper that looks like a triple display
setup with a black and silver theme wow
this is actually the Samsung sync master
three panel display system it basically
comes hooked up with three monitors
which is really pricey and my question
to you would be why didn't you just
purchase three separate monitors it
would have been a lot cheaper that way
nonetheless the display looks amazing
with those super thin
bezels on the desk you have a logitech
Dyna Voki board rat six mouse and a Mad
Catz flight stick I'm guessing you're
into flight games because your wallpaper
and joystick I also notice your beretta
right next to your keyboard why would
you put that on your desk
hey and me my friends are gonna go out
to a bar tonight you coming oh that's
probably why nevermind I gotta say I
really like your desk something about it
is really attractive it's probably the
way it's designed and what in Neptune's
seventh moon is that thing behind your
desk and what planet did you extract
this thing from but I'm gonna go ahead
and take a wild guess and say that it's
your PC but that's basically all I got
actually kind of reminds me of razors
project Christine but anyways it looks
dope and cable management is also great
and I like how you set up is in the
middle of the room instead of against a
wall that's pretty interesting and oh my
dog you have a freaking couch as your
seat I'm just going to go ahead and
leave this here thank you for entering
setup boys no but seriously you have an
awesome setup I'm really jealous and I
wish I had a freaking CAPTCHA as my seat
I'm not going to recommend anything
because it seems like you know what the
hell you are doing but thank you caliper
or entering set upwards next up we have
van and before we even jump into the
setup I just want to say great job on
the rocky poster that you have on the
back I didn't even know they made white
posters like that but anyway so we have
a triple monitor set up to LG 22 inch
displays sandwich King a 27 inch Acer
monitor you don't have a gaming setup
which is fine we do need more
workstations like these to spice things
up it looks like you hooked up your
MacBook to the LG displays and you have
your Xbox 360 connected to the Acer
display I guess it's kind of a hybrid
type setup cable management is all over
the place and I have just the thing to
fix that it's called omnivore cable
management and I'll leave a link down
below I would move the speaker's from
the front of the displays to maybe
behind the monitors or if you can space
out the two LG monitors a little
it then you can put the speakers in
between them after all you want using
all the displays at the same time so it
wouldn't be an issue other than that you
have a clean set up Thank You Band for
entering setup wars Evert is next stop
and this is an interesting setup you
have here a 24-inch BenQ monitor in the
middle and two Dell 19-inch monitors set
up in vertical mode on the sides I'm
actually really curious why you decided
to do this so let me know by leaving a
comment on what the reasoning was behind
this also on the desk you have the trust
g xt 280 keyboard and trust evo mouse
you also got the sony speakers and razer
kraken headphones really great choice on
the LED strips by the way I'm actually
going to feature it in my next cool tech
video for August for those wondering you
can use the controller that he has on
his desk to change the color and it's
really easy to set up and cost only like
25 bucks I do like that yellow plate you
have mounted on the wall of your name
but why didn't you put that in the
middle of the desk so it's nicely
centered great job on water management
no complaints there however I would
strongly recommend you to pick up an
extended mousepad for your setup and I'm
starting to sound like a broken record
but I think it's really gonna clean up
your desk nicely but anyways great set
up efforts thank you for entering setup
wars
alright finally we have benjamin so a
bunch of stuff going on here you have a
2015 MacBook Pro Retina and Asus 4k
monitor and aq Nix 27-inch 1440p monitor
at least I hope that's how you say it
so when interesting variety of display
is not only in size and brand but in
resolution as well not bad this is
obviously a Productivity setup and your
MX master mouse and Wireless Apple
keyboard is proof of debt I also see
your Plantronics Pro wireless headphones
hanging from your other desk on the left
side obviously have a bunch of stuff on
that tiny desk of yours and that's fine
I won't say anything bad about it since
I'm sure you use most of them on there
but at least get rid of your two-piece
mouse pad and get an actual extended
mousepad to fit both your keyboard and
mouse if you move that tablet somewhere
else you'll definitely have room for
despite the desk being cluttered
everything looks nicely organized and
you did an amazing job with cable
management this is what I like to see
Chris PhD photos of a well-organized
setup this makes me happy I would have
been more happier to see two of the same
monitors but hey I can't be really now
but thank you measurement for entering
set up wars so that's all the
submissions for this week voting begins
