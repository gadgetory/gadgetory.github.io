I'm here to show you the process of
unlocking your LG g5 so you can use it
with any GSM carrier in the world for
this demonstration I will be using my
locked LG g5 and unlock it so I can use
it on my t-mobile network but it's the
exact same process for any carrier from
any country so first off we need to get
the unlock code to start the unlocking
process and the place where I get all my
lock codes is the unlocking company comm
because they have the cheapest prices
online and I get my codes much faster
than other websites so head on over to
the unlocking company comm and select
your phone manufacturer and the phone
model from the drop-down list and on the
next page go in and select the country
the phone was originally purchased from
and the original carrier of the phone in
my case I purchased that in the United
States and the original carrier is AT&amp;amp;T
before we continue we need the IMEI
number of the g5 and the way you look
that up on your phone is to open up the
dial pad and enter in star pound zero
six pound once you have that go back on
the website and enter that in and now
once everything is filled out select get
a locking code and that will take you to
the final screen where you have to check
out after checking out they will email
you the unlock code the price and
delivery time of your code varies by
phone but don't worry because as I said
before you are getting the cheapest
prices online with the fastest delivery
times once you receive your unlock code
from your locking company it's time to
unlock your phone so go ahead and pop
open the SIM tray which should be
located on the side of your phone and
insert the SIM card you want to use with
the g5 I want to use the g5 on my
t-mobile network so I'm putting in my
t-mobile SIM card if the SIM card
doesn't fit then you have to adjust the
size in order for it to work and there
is a link below to show you how that's
done once the SIM card is inside the
tray go ahead and slide it back in the
phone and boot up the device once the
phone boots up it will take you straight
to the SIM unlock page and this is where
you enter the unlock code that you
received from the unlocking company
after inputting the code and hitting a
lock you will get a message stating that
the unlock was successful and the phone
will reboot once it boots up it will
take you straight to the home screen and
you can see that the phone is
permanently unlocked I am now running my
AT&amp;amp;T LG g5 on my t-mobile network that's
basically how you do it if you guys
