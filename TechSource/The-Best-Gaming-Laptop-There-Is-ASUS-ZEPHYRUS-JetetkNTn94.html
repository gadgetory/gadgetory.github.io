video possible what's up guys is that
from Texas and what I'm holding here
right now is the world's thinnest most
quietest powerful gaming laptop and it's
almost perfect I've been using it for
about two weeks now and I'll be sharing
what I liked about it as well as things
I didn't like about it
this is the AC zephyrus and it starts at
twenty six ninety nine it comes equipped
with an i7 7700 HQ 16 gigs of ram and a
gtx 1080 with max-q technology so in
order to achieve this extremely sleek
form factor they had to come up with a
different approach instead of just
throwing in the best GPU in there they
went after obtaining the best
performance with maximum efficiency this
means that the clock speeds are slightly
less than other GT X 1080 laptops the
trade-off is that the GPU uses less
power
which means requires less cooling and
that also means that the laptop is a lot
quieter because the fans are smaller and
don't need to work as hard
and speaking of cooling the bottom
portion of the ACF Zephyrus opens up as
you lift the screen for better air flow
now because the clock speeds are lower
on the max-q design GT X 1080 the
performance is also affected
it's about 18% lower compared to other
1080 laptops I personally think the
trade-off is worth it because in return
you get a quiet and powerful gaming
laptop in a slim and lightweight form
factor one of the things I love about
this laptop is the design it's a premium
device from Asus and it's built really
well I don't think they cut any corners
here then again for around $2,700 there
better not be the top has a brushed
aluminum surface which does attract
fingerprints and oil and there's an ROG
logo that lights up when the laptop is
on lifting the lid up which you can
easily do with one hand we are greeted
by an interesting layout for the
keyboard everything has been pushed down
and closer to the edge so that they can
use all that extra space up there for
hardware and cooling personally I prefer
to lay out a lot more than the
traditional keyboard setup it's a lot
easier to type on and your palms won't
accidentally touch the trackpad since
it's all the way on the right side
Asus was even kind enough to throw in a
wrist rest for those that want an extra
level of comfort but personally I had no
problems at all
typing without it what's really cool
about this trackpad is that it doubles
as a number pad all you have to do is
click on this button near the top and an
LED grid with numbers will pop up which
is genius
although the
is very accurate I personally don't like
using that because it doesn't offer any
type of feedback so you won't know if
you tapped it unless you look at the
screen as you tap on the numpad if they
subside something similar to the taptic
engine on their iPhone 7 or basically if
I were to tap on the numpad you would
get a small vibration if they add
something like that to the trackpad it
would be really awesome but I realized I
was asking a bit too much
having the two-in-one trackpad &amp;amp; numpad
was probably the only design option you
had to go with in order to fit
everything near the bottom but the
trackpad and numpad are both very
accurate the keys on inter hands are
very nice to type on you get excellent
feedback and responsiveness with one
point four millimeter key travel they
are obviously backlit with three
different brightness levels that you can
choose from and they are RGB but you can
only change the colors from three
sections of the keyboard the qwe are
WASD and the rest of the keys
unfortunately you can customize each key
separately but here's what I found
annoying so the color of the grid of the
numpad + the keys on the top of the
trackpad are always going to be red so
basically if you do want to change the
colors of the LEDs on the keyboard to
anything other than red it's not going
to look good together honestly kind of
defeats the purpose of having RGB keys
in the first place if you can't change
the colors on all the keys on the
keyboard the display has a 15.6 inch
1080p anti-glare TN panel with a 120
Hertz refresh rate which also comes
equipped with G sync the front-facing
camera up top is a standard 720p camera
with a decent low-light performance no
major complaints here when it comes to
ports I was a little disappointed to
find out that there isn't an SD card
slot but you do get an HDMI 4 USB 3.0
ports and a USB type-c the speakers are
located at the edges of the laptop and
they are upward firing speakers the
quality isn't bad but on a max volume
you can hear slight distortion from the
sound vibrations
that's from tech stores and welcome to
setup wars episode 110 potatoe edition
with the crappiest of the crappiest
setups the laptop does get pretty hot
during full load but only in the area
above the keyboard I haven't noticed any
heat coming into contact with my hands
while the laptop is on full load you can
definitely hear the fan noise during
full load but the noise easily gets
now if you're playing on speakers or
have headphones on the GTX penaity does
work on every game I threw at it max
setting then 1080p I got over 100 fps
and most titles other games that were
more intensive still pushed over 60 so
I'm not complaining here
Gaming on this laptop was so much fun
the gameplay was very smooth thanks to
the 120 Hertz g-sync monitor and the GT
X 1080 with max Q technology delivers
and performance does that first even
handle editing like a champ I was able
to add a 1080p video without any problem
the video playback never started or even
lagged once overall the experience was
very smooth and also these are the
render times using Vegas pro 14 I did
one for 1080p and one for 4k and both of
these were 60 seconds RAW files battery
life however isn't the best it's got a
50 watt hour battery and it lasted 2
hours and 8 minutes before it died
watching YouTube videos non-stop from
full charge also the PC mark work
battery benchmark came in at 2 hours and
6 minutes which is very close to what I
tested and by the way both these tests
were done on balance mode with 75%
brightness so the things I liked about
laptop on the start off with the obvious
its form factor its super light and thin
making it perfect for travel I just love
the premium design and the feel of the
keyboard while typing it's very
comfortable and the trackpad is
extremely accurate it's also nice that
Asus threw in a wrist rest it's got a
pretty fast boot time of 9 seconds which
I can appreciate the 120 Hertz g-sync
display is very nice and the performance
is incredible for both gaming and
productivity it's crazy to think that
I'm able to play the same games from my
high-end desktop PC on this thin laptop
so the things I didn't like but I'm
tired integration although very cool and
creative it's not something I'm a fan of
simply because it's missing feedback it
doesn't have an SD card slots and being
a content creator I find it inconvenient
not having at easy access the speakers
are decent and are maxed volumes you can
hear slight distortion but a lot of
people don't care about speakers on
laptop since they use headphones anyways
the battery life isn't the best but I
understand that you can only do so much
given the sheer size and the amount of
space to work with expendability is very
difficult the laptop does come with a
screw driver which is weird because
that's only to access the back cover
where you can't really do anything to
access the storage you will need a Torx
wrench and even then that's the only
piece of hardware you can replace or
upgrade and finally the RGB feature on
the laptop is contradictive you can't
change the lights on all the keys the
four keys on top of the track title
always remain red
so that will always throw up the color
scheme for the rest of the keys unless
you're going with all red LEDs now I do
realize that most of these things are
just mean it picking things and that's
because the AC zephyrus is a solid
laptop and there aren't how many things
that I find wrong with it so in
conclusion the AC zephyrus is the best
gaming laptop that you can buy right now
if you're looking for the best
performance in a light thin and quiet
laptop now obviously it's a bit
expensive but honestly I can safely say
that you are getting what you pay for so
that does it for my review of the A to Z
