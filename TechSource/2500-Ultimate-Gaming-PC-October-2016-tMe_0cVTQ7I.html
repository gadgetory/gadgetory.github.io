source and this is Trigon
it's a $2,500 mini ITX gaming PC
featuring the stunning deep cooler try
stellar case I decided to change things
up a bit and go with a more unique case
now as I mentioned before it is a mini
ITX tower because the pc is split into
three compartments the top section
houses the SSDs and the graphics card
and the other to hold the power supply
and motherboard I do like the fact that
the top portion comes with tempered
glass panels on all three sides but it's
also disappointing at the same time for
the other two
since the custom sleeping and the RAM
sticks go to waste as they are both
covered nonetheless installation wasn't
difficult believe it or not and the only
issue I had was with cable management
but after removing the hard drive cages
I was given plenty of space for the
cables to be fair I accidentally ordered
much longer cables than needed and
that's because I haven't actually worked
with this case before and I wanted to be
on the safe side aesthetically this is
one badass looking case and I don't
think anyone can deny that they do have
a white version of this and maybe I'll
consider doing a white and blue build if
you guys are interested so make sure to
hit that like button if you are so the
try stellar SW has two USB 3.0 ports and
usual audio jacks in the front and the
actual power button is in the center
which also lights up after pressing it I
thought that was pretty cool so I went
with the 6700 K and paired it with the
MSI GTX 1080 gaming X graphics card to
keep the theme consistent
it also has 16 gigs of ram from a fixer
and three for 80 gigabyte SSDs from
HyperX in raid 0 unfortunately I don't
have a hard drive attached since I had
to remove the cage for cable management
nor do I have an MDOT 2 because the ASUS
Maximus does not support it I also got
tired of using Corsair coolers and
almost all of my pills so I was looking
around for something that would stick
out a bit more and came across the
captain 120 X CPU cooler not only is it
extremely quiet and keeps the 6700 K
around 45 degrees during full load but
also blends in nicely with the effects
of RAM and the rest of the build
speaking of RAM these are the waiting
series and they are from a fixer and
they have variety of colors to choose
from but as you can see I went with the
plasma red option and these are
officially the sexiest Ram sticks I have
seen sorry g-scale but you have been the
throw
it's just a shame that I have to cover
this up but I will be using these parts
for a future build so it's all good the
customs leaving you've seen this video
are from an sourced mods and honestly I
just can't go to any other brand these
guys have such an amazing job and the
quality of these cables are out of this
world not only do they offer full cables
by the way not extensions guys full
cables but they give you the option to
select the exact color you want from the
color chart as well as the pattern the
combinations are endless so if you guys
need custom sleeves for your next build
definitely check out insourced mods you
won't regret it
another small mod i did with this build
was adding LED strips but not just
regular LEDs these are called the RGB
350 and it comes in three separate
strips which was perfect since I had the
flexibility of choosing where to put
each one on top of that you get this
remote which lets you control the colors
and you can even program it for a pretty
cool light show performance-wise there's
nothing that you guys haven't already
seen on 1080 benchmarks but here are the
numbers anyways in case you are
interested
so that is it for this video as always
if you guys enjoy these monthly PC bills
be sure to leave a like to show your
support I do have a $500 budget build
coming up also late October and this
also has a build guide so I know a lot
of you guys are excited about that if
you guys are interested in seeing a
white and blue build with the other tri
stellar case also let me know in the
comments section but thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
