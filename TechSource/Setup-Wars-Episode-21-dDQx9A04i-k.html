Wars and it's gonna be a lot easier
looking at the pictures since it has a
better resolution and just a bigger
screen who is texting me what's up guys
it's that back again from tech source
and welcome to setup wars episode 21
where you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel and a chance to
win 50 bucks because I need you to see
reason want to submit your setup make
sure to watch the video linked down
below for the instructions and
requirements the little that said let
the setup wars begin
this video is brought to you by GTA
where you can buy super cheap CD keys
for any game on any platform this is
where I get all my games from as well as
Windows Keys for my monthly PC builds
but I'll leave a link down below so you
can see for yourself as always all of
the gear for these setups will be listed
down below as well as any
recommendations that I give in this
episode so with that said here are your
five contestants for this week we have
Alvin Jerry Caleb Luca and Matt
congratulations for making it to setup
wars episode 21 starting off the show we
have alvin and the chipmunks with his
elegant ultra white setup we have a 34
inch ultra white monitor from LG and on
the desk we have a Microsoft Wireless
Keyboard 800 and he met cats 5 mouse on
top of the razer mousepad what kind of a
combo is this also a desk we have a pair
of Mackie CR 4 speakers and a shure SRH
440 headphones hanging from the poll on
the left side cable management is
immaculate and excellent work with the
power strip and running your wires
through cable drops you got those cables
on lockdown
I'm also digging the USB hub you have
near the right speaker although I don't
know how I feel about that large clump
of wires from the mouse wouldn't it look
better if you routed the cables through
the back and into the PC instead of
connecting it to that hub if this was my
setup I would definitely mount the
display either on the wall or use a
monitor arm to lift it off of the desk
to give it a much cleaner look but
that's just my personal recommendation
the only other thing that kind of throws
off the balance of your setup is the red
colored Mouse but I think your setup
looks super clean the way it is and I'm
just nitpicking but thank you Alvin for
entering setup wars Jerry Springer is
next up with a single display setup we
have the very popular 27-inch asus
monitor with the gorgeous thin bezels
and this is actually the water that
everyone keeps asking me about during my
pc build videos it's absolutely amazing
on the desk we have an a/c OMG k1
keyboard and a SteelSeries rival gaming
mouse on top of the good gaming extended
mouse pad also on the desk we have a
pair of creative inspired 2500 speakers
and your ps4 off to the right side this
is the second setup feature in this
episode that's powered by a laptop
instead of an actual desktop PC a great
job with cables keeping them off the
ground I'll give you a point for routing
the LED strips and conspicuously behind
your monitor you have lots of stuff on
your desk but I guess that's okay since
you have a large surface area to work
with but overall a very organized and
dope setup Thank You Jerry for entering
at number three we have Caleb and his
Godzilla speaker setup now last week's
episode we also had a Caleb but for some
odd reason I pronounced the name as
calleb next up is Caleb with his black
and red setups I mean I know I make fun
of names most of the time but I totally
butcher the crap out of his name so if
you're watching this my sincerest
apologies anyhoo so back to callebs
setta
all right so let's try this again so
Caleb has a single 27 inch rog swift
monitor hooked up to the Amazon mounting
arm on the desk we have a razer
blackwidow keyboard and an EVGA x10
carbon mouse on top of the Razer Firefly
mousepad
now that's a dope-ass mousepad you can
actually change the LEDs to any color
you want so we will always go with your
setup the only downside to this is that
you have an extra cable to work with of
course we can't forget the center of
attention those enormous speakers on the
desk we have a pair of definitive might
those two speakers and on the left side
of the desk we have a pair of
beyerdynamic 990 premium headphones on
the silverstone headphone stand we also
have a pretty dope mic setup we have the
road MTG one mic hooked up to the sm-3
shock mount which is then attached to
the heil boom arm great work with cables
they are hidden neatly away from sight
and I just have to take a closer look at
your amazing water-cooled PC that I
notice since the beginning so we have a
4790k CPU paired with a Titan Z and I
gotta say amazing work with the cables
inside that tiny case and I would love
to see more pictures of this bad boy so
consider submitting this for my PC Wars
this is one of the few unique and very
clean setups I've seen on the show
job well done Caleb and thank you for
entering next up is Luca and his triple
monitor setup which looks like it's
located inside a serial killers room
there's just too much red in here even
for me which says a lot but anyways
moving on we have three different
monitors a 23 inch LG 24 inch Acer and a
24 inch asus monitor on the desk we have
a wireless keyboard from LG and a
wireless mouse from Hema great work with
cable management as well I don't have
any complaints there but you do have a
bunch of extra stuff behind those
monitors so maybe putting some of that
stuff that you don't use daily in that
drawer below to clean up your desk would
be a really good idea
I also recommend toning down the red
LEDs a bit since it's overpowering the
set up but it definitely has a potential
to be a great setup Thank You Luca for
entering last but at least we have Matt
and his dual display setup we have two
24-inch band cube monitors a keyboard
from insignia and the MX master mouse
from Logitech both which are wireless we
also have another good gaming mouse pad
in this
episode so lots of stuff on the desk we
have a pair of astro a40 s on the a 50
stand and a garmin smartphone stand for
the iPhone cable visor it can definitely
be improved with some cable drops that
wraps since there seems to be a lot
going on here
I do like the controller rack you have
installed on the side of your desk I
will definitely give you a point for
that now for the rest of the items on
your desk I would recommend you to pick
up a valet tray now these things not
only look awesome
but it will definitely help you clean up
a bunch of stuff from your desk there
are a bunch of options available to
better meet your needs but I did let's
take your options down below that you
should definitely check out
I personally picked up a 10 inch tray
that I'm going to use with my IKEA
drawers that way I have compartments to
work with but that does it for this
