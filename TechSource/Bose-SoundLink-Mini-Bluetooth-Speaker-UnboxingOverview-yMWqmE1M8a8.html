unboxing of the ball Soundlink mini
bluetooth speaker so let's get started
all sound like mini will run around 199
US dollars this is a Bluetooth speaker
so connect wirelessly to any device that
has Bluetooth capability the Soundlink
mini is also the most compact mobile
speaker that Bose offers to date sliding
out the box we can see that there's
actually two layers which is an
interesting box design which you don't
see that often once you open up the blue
flap and remove the black foam we see
the first layer houses the speaker
itself which is covered by plastic wrap
to protect the device from scratches
waters in the box the first time you
pick up the speaker you can feel how
small that actually is putting that
aside we get into the second layer of
the box which we can see that Bose has
included the usual standard array of
paperwork like the manual warranty
safety guide a catalogue of other
products from balls as well as
instructions on the speaker itself
honestly who reads this stuff anyways
under all the paperwork we have the
charging accessory and right below that
is the power connector and that's all
that is included with the purchase
moving on to the actual speaker we see
that it is very small and easy to hold
it features high efficiency transducers
that have twice as much air than
similarly sized transducers which
produces a more powerful sound in a
smaller package the Soundlink mini also
has dual passive radiators that improve
low notes all this technology is covered
with a single piece aluminum casing
which gives the device a nice feel and a
cold touch making our way to the bottom
of the device we see contact points to
where the charging cradle connects as
well as a USB port that allows for
software updates to the actual system
moving up to the top of the device to
our six buttons starting from the left
there is a power button a mute button
volume down and up buttons a Bluetooth
toggle and an auxiliary button on the
right side of the speaker we can see an
auxilary input and an input for the wall
charger if you do not want to use the
included charging cradle now that we've
made our way around the device let's
take a look at the accessories starting
with the charging cradle which is made
out of a matte plastic on the right side
we have the prongs that connect to the
speakers and supply power and on the
bottom of the cradle is where the anti
slip plastic that ensures your device
won't be moving left and right the same
materials also found at the top on both
the left and right side moving on to the
wall charger we see a bose logo right in
the middle and on the back we see a
pretty cool feature here which is the
prongs fold so that when traveling they
don't get in the way or get damaged we
plug this right into the
cradle to supply power attaching the
speakers to the cradle is pretty
self-explanatory you just align the
bottom prongs to the ones on the cradle
and you place the speaker down when all
charged up Bose claims that the speakers
will last up to seven hours of audio
playback this wraps up the unboxing in
