I am so excited and I am proud to
finally announce setup makeover season 2
however this time we're gonna be doing
something a little different this season
of setup makeover we're gonna be
focusing on a specific theme ladies and
gentlemen I present to you the venom
gaming room project
so just like the name says I'm gonna be
completely redoing someone's room not
just the setup guys but the PC desk and
also some parts of the room as well and
obviously if you guys haven't noticed
already the theme is gonna be venom so
the person's room I'm gonna be doing a
complete makeover on is actually a
friend of mine his name is Harry he is a
high school buddy of mine he's a really
close friend and because of the way
things played out on season one I kind
of wanted to completely reduce someone's
gaming room that's close to me it's just
for the season guys we're gonna resume
season three by picking another contest
in which that person has already been
selected his name is Heath by the way
and he knows because I've been talking
with him but yeah guys these are the
parts I'm gonna be using for the PC
build there's gonna be three episodes
for season two episode one is gonna be
the PC build for episode two I'm gonna
give his room the complete makeover
obviously an episode 3 which is the
finale I'm gonna reveal it to him even
till today guys he does not know
anything about this so he has no idea
that I'm gonna give his room a complete
makeover it's gonna be really awesome
it's I'm very excited to do this and a
huge huge huge thanks to MSI for
reaching out to me and sponsoring this
series so I'm very excited to be a part
of this all right so before we go over
the parts I do want to talk about this
awesome venom gift box from MSI so check
this out guys so for a limited time MSI
is giving out these awesome venom gift
boxes to anyone who purchases select
items from MSI and if you want to find
out which items qualify to get the gift
box then I'll drop a link to that down
below so inside the gift box get this
nice looking medium venom themed fabric
mousepad and you even get an aluminum
water bottle it even has some really
cool venom artwork right on the bottle
itself and on the top there's even a
carabiner clip so if you guys want to
clip it to your backpack or whatever you
can do so well yeah really cool stuff
it's only for a limited amount of time
obviously so check out the link below if
you guys want to snag one for yourself
alright now let's go over some parts in
case you guys haven't noticed already
it's gonna be a water-cooled PC
originally it was supposed to be
air-cooled but I told MSI you know what
make this PC special so I'm gonna do a
custom loop with soft tubing so to CP
we're going with is the rise ins second
generation 2700 x8 core processor which
is a nice upgrade from his current 4790k
unfortunately he is still stuck on the
ddr3 platform so not only are we gonna
refresh him and bring him up to date
with current parts but we're gonna give
him a really nice upgrade and
performance as well as in the aesthetics
department of course also later than the
line let's say he wants to stream games
or maybe he's using programs that eat up
more CPU power
well the 2700 X has them covered for RAM
we're going with to 8 gigabytes sticks
so 16 gigabytes total 3,000 megahertz
these are the Vengeance lpx all black
RAM sticks from Corsair which obviously
blend in perfectly with the color scheme
and also it's a nice upgrade from his
current Ram I think he's rocking eight
gigs of ddr3 at like mm something
megahertz so definitely a nice upgrade
there so for the motherboard I'm using
the B 450 tomahawk once again this is
the same board I used in my streaming PC
it's just a solid mainstream well
balanced motherboard that offers a lot
of performance for the money it's got
four dimm slots and that to support I
think over seven power phases
overclocking on this board is really
easy I was actually able to push my 2600
X to 4.2 gigahertz using the B 450
tomahawk so yeah overall very satisfied
with this board hence why I'm using it
again for Harry's PC now for the GPU I
picked the RX Vega 56 for several
reasons first of all it's a nice upgrade
from his current GPU which is the GTX
980 but 980 is good for 1080p gaming but
I'm giving them a Vega 56 because I
wanted to start gaming in 2k resolution
the monitors are quad HD resolution so
the Vega 56 will definitely help on game
in that resolution obviously there's a
bunch of water cooling parts in here
both the CPU and GPU block are actually
RGB but I'm gonna leave the lighting on
there white
speaking of lighting I'm not gonna be
doing RGB in this bill obviously it's
mostly black with very subtle white
accents but I did go with these white
LED fans of course are just so we can
light up the inside of the PC so it's
not just pitch black inside they're
gonna be some really cool custom mods
done to the
see which I'm not gonna show you just
yet it's gonna be surprised at the end
of this video my buddy actually Gary's
coming over and he's gonna bring the
parts with them and we're gonna mod the
PC together he's actually doing a venom
gaming room setup on his channel as well
so if you guys want to check that out
I'll jumbling below
alright guys so I would say we're about
halfway done with the build right now
and I'm loving the way it's shutting out
everything is going according to plan so
far everything is smooth
knock on wood this actually never
happens to me when doing a water-cooled
wheel believe it or not something always
goes wrong but so far everything's good
I also told you guys that we're gonna be
doing some slide modding to the PC
itself who can be adding some pretty
cool custom work to it at the end of the
video but I decided to do that now
because Gary's on his way and he's gonna
bring this stuff with him so I'm excited
to see what he's got
but I just wanted to get this done now
that way when I'm playing a loop and
putting the reservoir on pump I don't
want any of that to interfere with the
custom work inside the PC but anyways
Gary should be here in a few minutes
let's check out and see what he's
bringing hi guys so Gary finally made it
to the office why don't you come over
here introduce yourself man nice to meet
you that's why we do hey guys my name is
Gary also known as rage elixir on
YouTube I make gaming videos and stuff
like that and I just have a lot of fun
so today what do you have for me today
cuz I got it bring this stuff over there
let's let's see what you got so we've
been working together with v1 Tech
actually and they sent over some custom
parts for the PC and it's with him right
now so I'm excited to check it out guys
so the first thing that we have right
here is a PSU cover it actually has RGB
lighting so also this P which goes over
here and covers the power supply oh it
looks really nice we also have a GPU
backplate also powered by RGB lighting
last but not least we have the decal
stickers so I think we're gonna put this
on the outside of the PC this is
actually a good idea I did not even
think about this we can put this on the
side panel because it is a tempered
glass panel to the case and we can put
this actually a smaller one we can put
this somewhere in there so it's not
really covering up the internals but
also give it a nice Venom look at that
too so let's go and put these together
real quick and see you how the PC turns
out either the PSU shroud first I'm
gonna run this cable through the back if
you want to grab real quick let's see
how this looks
there we go that looks so much leaner
there we go
it's gonna essentially sit on like this
we're gonna put some adhesive obviously
underneath it so it stays in place but
that looks so nice with the PSU shot
because it's got the same design on
there yeah it looks like sick
all right let's figure out the sticker
situation so what are you thinking um
what do you think about like the biggest
sticker right here in the center yeah in
the center like that the thing I'm
worried about is the sticker covering
like the internals inside they're like
the loop and the parts and stuff like
that that's right so I don't want it to
be too obvious you have two more sizes
this is like a medium size as large
what about like what if we put this in
the corner as like a logo good I like
that logo idea alright so if you put it
over here it's gonna cover up the shroud
over here it's too obvious I think it
will look nice in the bottom-right
corner just to also cover up this gap
over here between the PSU shroud and the
radiator so I think think we have a
winner let's peel off the plastic first
all right I think we're ready to peel it
off things looks good
tall which is nice oh it is officially
Venom eyes oh yeah so what do you think
Gary the PC is halfway done what is your
feedback so far on the build you know I
think it looks great I think the extra
changes in laws that we made to it spice
things up a little bit I definitely
agree that the back plate and the PSU
should go well together because of the
design on it so if the decal and a decal
I think was the icing on the cake
definitely but appreciate it thank you
so much for coming over and went over
the custom mods huge things to v1 tech
for making these obviously for the build
if you guys again when I check out his
makeover for his gaming room check it
out I'll drop a link to it down below
Gary again thank you so much I think I'm
gonna finish this bill today all right
see you later all right so I finally ran
into my first issue with the build and
that is the clearance for the pump and
reservoir combo so the original plan was
to mount it against the radiator near
the bottom over here but as you guys can
see there is not enough clearance
because of the graphics card option
number two was mounting in horizontally
near the top against the 120 millimeter
fans there the top but as you guys can
see it's covered up pretty much
everything I look stupid if I were to do
like this option number three was to do
with this side which still doesn't look
that good which leads me to option
number four modding I'm gonna be
drilling a few holes on the PSU shroud
itself and mount it right on the cover
itself near the bottom like this which
actually looks way better because
there's nothing going on down here and I
can use that extra space for the pump
and reservoir so yeah this is the
current solution
luckily ek provides there are templates
for the pump so I'm just gonna basically
figure out where exactly the pumps gonna
go on the shroud and
and mark those holes and of course drill
right through them I need to position
the pump in a way I need to position the
pump in a way so that the holes are
facing the side that way the tubes come
out through the side and not go up and
hit the bottle on the GPU so there's
really only one way to do this the cool
thing about the ek pump and rest combo
is that you can actually rotate this
entire piece over here so there's a
clamp down here you just pull it out and
then you rotate the entire thing to your
desired angle so I'm gonna have a
position this see you know the holes are
facing to the side so it's gonna be a
lot easier planning the loop the only
downside to this method is it's gonna be
very difficult pouring aim and the
coolant so I'm gonna have to find a
different port to pour in the coolant
because it's no longer sitting
vertically
alright guys so that pretty much
concludes episode one of the venom
gaming room project the only thing left
to do on the PC is finish up the cable
management in the back hook everything
else up and install the drivers and get
the PC ready for Harry I'm not gonna
show you guys what the PC looks like
once it's 100% complete you're just
gonna have to wait and find out for
episode 3 which is the finale that's
what I'll be revealing everything so
yeah make sure you guys are subscribed
and make sure you have notifications
enabled because it's gonna be epic my
overall impressions with the build I
would say I feel like I'm always biased
I always say it looks good I'm happy
with the way turned out but I really at
this time this is actually the only
water-cooled build I've done which has
been the smoothest so far other than
that issue with the clearance with the
pump and reservoir combo which really
wasn't an issue I found another way
around it
overall the the rest of the build went
very smooth so I'm really happy with
that it boots I even ran a leak test for
a couple hours there are no leaks
right now there's distilled water in
there I'm gonna leave it overnight so it
couldn't clean the system inside and
then tomorrow morning I'm gonna come
flush the system and pour in the black
coolant and it's gonna look even better
with that now in terms of air flow we do
have a three sixty millimeter rat in the
front which has three 120 millimeter
fans as intake we also have a 120 mil
rat in the back as exhaust and two
additional 120 millimeter fans on the
top as exhaust as well so a total of six
fans we have that about wraps up the
video I hope you guys enjoyed it if you
guys are excited for episode 2 and the
finale of the venom gaming room project
make sure to smack that like button and
let me know what you guys think about PC
by leaving your feedback down below I
know it's not completely done yet but so
far let me know what you guys think is
there something you would have done
differently do you not agree with some
of the part choices whatever it is let
me know in the comment section because I
will be reading them all the parts used
inside this build will also be linked
below in case you guys want to check it
out thanks again for watching as always
I'll see you in the next one
