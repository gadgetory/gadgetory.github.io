unboxing and giveaway today we are
looking at the brand new studio
headphones just released by Beats
so these are the brand-new Beats Studio
Headphones that go for two $99.99 and
they also come in three amazing colors
they come in a black red and white
unfortunately the red and white were
sold out but I was fortunate enough to
grab the last black one at my store so
these headphones do come with a new
beats acoustic engine which improves
overall sound it also has a much better
noise canceling feature which does not
degrade the music quality like the last
model it does come with a remote talk
feature they also added a rechargeable
battery that lasts for 20 hours and you
can even track the life with a new fuel
gauge and lastly the adarand Auto on and
off feature all these features will
definitely be covered in detail on our
upcoming review so definitely make sure
to check it out alrighty so without
further ado let's get this unboxed I'm
really excited to see what beats
included with their new headphones
apparently these are really popular and
they are pretty much sold out in every
store near me and it's even out of stock
for Amazon so I'm assuming these
headphones are amazing I'm not really a
headphone type person I prefer using
earphones instead because it's much
smaller and more convenient for me to
carry it around
I always keep my earphones on me and I
use it at the gym however I do see a lot
of people use headphones as well I guess
it's more of a personal preference
really I mean headphones do provide
noise cancellation because it does cover
the whole ear whereas the earphones do
not what type of person are you guys are
you more of a headphone guy or earphones
let me know the comments down below I'm
pretty curious to find out alright so
after removing that top box you see the
message from the beats removing that as
well you will find the headphones case
neatly rested in the box let's go ahead
and put this aside for now and remove
the second layer of the box hit inside
here you will find the paperwork and
accessories first up is the Beats
brochure that you get every time you buy
beats product then you have the Quick
Start Guide followed by useless sticker
and some more warranty information they
also included a microfiber cloth to
clean up any unnecessary fingerprints
but let's go on and toss all these aside
and look at the box that contains all
the accessories okay so this is the
small box that contains all the cool
accessories that comes with the
headphones I gotta say I'm a huge fan of
any red and black themes as you guys can
tell from my past video so because of
that I do have a strong attraction to
Beats products but enough about that
it's going to take a look at the first
item we have the charging brick here
which has a pretty cool design you can
also fold them if you want I mean
it's pretty standard for the most part
so it's gotta move on to item number two
this is one of the three cables that it
comes with this one in particular is
probably going to be the most used one
simply because it is the cable needed to
charge your headphones so this next
cable is most likely going to be used
over the last one because this one has a
remote talk one end is an L jack whereas
the other is a straight Jack and it's
like that because it gives you the
choice of which end you want to connect
to your phone if your phone has the case
preventing an L jack connection and this
last cable is a basic cable with no
remote talk I'm guessing this is for
iPod users but phone users can also use
it as a spare if they wish this is
something I've never seen in other Beats
products I think it's something new they
introduced I'm not really sure but this
is a clip you can attach to the carrying
case of the headphones and return attach
it to your belt if you wish to
I'm guessing it's for people that don't
want to carry it in their hands or maybe
it's a new trend having the same from
your jeans I'm not really sure but it
does come with one moving on to the main
event this is the carrying case for the
headphones itself which we will be
looking at very soon this case has a
hard top and bottom to protect your
headphones if it does drop or if it
comes to contact with anything I gotta
say that the material does feel very
nice in your hand and it's very
convenient to grip with just one hand
because of how small it is I think
overall this carrying case is a huge
improvement than the studio ones finally
we can take a look at the headphones
I'll bring this up so we can take a
closer look starting on the left side
you will find your battery fuel gauge
you press the button once and it lights
up showing you how much juice is left in
the battery remember that the battery
lasts up to 30 hours so for a quick
estimate just think that each light
represents around 7 hours so the inside
of this headband is actually made out of
pure aluminum as you can see here when I
extend the headbands but the material
for the outside is made of pure plastic
tuning the headphones over looking on
the bottom here you will find your
charging port on one side and on the
opposite side you will find your
headphone jacks also on that side you
will find a play in pause button but if
you use your remote ah cable this won't
be necessary the cushions are extremely
soft and feels really great when you
wear them honestly one of the most
comfortable cushions that I've felt and
I think that's the most crucial element
of any headphones if you're going to use
them for hours
overall I love these headphones it's so
comfortable you barely hear any outside
noise when you're puttin them on without
any music and you can't hear even
thing when you are listening to music
the noise cancellation definitely works
and one of the main things actually love
about this is that they have no
batteries simply charge them overnight
and you are ready to your next day as I
said I'm not really a headphone guy but
these headphones definitely changed my
mind so that wraps up on boxing thank
