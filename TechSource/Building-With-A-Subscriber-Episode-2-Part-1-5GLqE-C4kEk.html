another episode of a building with a
subscriber it's been a while since I've
been one of these and other you guys
enjoy the first one so here we are again
and this time I'm joined with Isaiah say
there's a so tell me about yourself man
what are you coming from a small town
called Lompoc Lompoc come on man it is
about three and a half hours what was a
Christian I thought was Christian from
us I think I got you of others like only
two hours away so you're technically the
longest drive so far but he actually
stayed at a hotel he was actually smart
instead of hotel so he's all refreshed
and ready to go this morning so tell you
man what are we building exactly here is
that PC is this it's gonna be for gaming
and streaming gamey and screaming oh
cool so I guess we'll go over some parts
real quick looks like you picked up the
Asus GTX 1080 solid choice I'm a big fan
of issues we add 16 gigs of ram this is
the Corsair Vengeance 3,000 megahertz
the processor we're going with is the
7700 K not a bad choice obviously can
overclock that bad boy even show you a
few tips on how to lock it for cooling
about the h100 v2 power supply a 50 g2
from EVGA and the motherboard msi env2
70 now the case we're gonna be using is
the s340 elite I see there's so many
times even the first person that was
building with went with the s340 elite
is there a specific reason why the glass
you like that like that's a little glass
rather than the non elite because it's
cut off okay nice nice so tell me why
I'm guessing this in all black bill
honestly I the parts I like just kind of
happened uh I wasn't going with colors
when I was picking on okay I just
realized that it wasn't gonna be very
colorful but just some she's had a 500gb
so just as long as it like performs and
you don't care about the clothes yeah I
can respect that it's on top but I don't
know I can respect that I can respect
that cool cool yeah under RGB hypetrain
yeah
I just noticed through there's no ygb
strips or anything like that so I got
the basic black up like that's cool
that's cool all right so tell me I gotta
ask you this man
when did you subscribe detectors
probably about two years ago when I
first actually learned about building
computer oh no way yeah all your
tutorials is everything I know
oh nice speaking of that actually have
you even watched any of my tutorials no
I would say rating on a scale one
through 10 10 being you can build a PC
with your eyes closed and one being you
don't know what a GPU is what is your
yeah probably about a seven I think a
it's a little tricky with the wiring for
me okay so you doesn't have a lot more
experience than the previous guy so it's
gonna help a lot myself okay let's march
now I'm sorry but you know the deal
though building me I'm not gonna say
anything
yeah if you need help I'll jump in
recess new skills on how you can build
PC without any help cool and one final
question I gotta ask you is what is your
favorite series on the channel if you
have to pick I probably go with set up
set up or yeah set up morons because you
just gotta see what everyone's is so
different right inside you see some
pretty crazy stuff on there alright also
must miss that's always like no more in
choice I would say instead of words yeah
but what a video made you subscribe to
my channel Oh what video discovered
tutorials cuz I was just searching like
had it had a build one oh really
Oh interesting
okay alright man let's do this the next
over here if you want
yep we can unbox some things the first
pieces of items we'll need is obviously
the motherboard CPU and RAM I think
everything else we can just put this
side well for now alright
we have one SSD one hard drive selling
into theta right yeah we'll get this
just in case I'm curious why did you go
with the MSI board this good old black
aesthetic that it just looked good it
looked good the price was decent okay
Andy and I don't want to under pay for
things and then I like getting what I
pay for it which yeah kind of hurts me
sometimes because well you can't really
cheap out on the motherboard especially
when you're going with an unlocked
processor because we're gonna be
overclocking it so you definitely need
to solve it border and the Z 270 you
gave me from MSI is definitely a solid
choice so be gentle on their planks and
it kind of fits with the whole color
scheme - we got the whole black carbon
fibre and everything so nice dude good
choice
so what PC haven't been using this
entire time have you been my zero I know
my universe computer personal computer
how do you see yes
not even a light top I use my girls oh
yeah you're officially joining the PC
massive today exactly why that's also
dude all right
wow you have a lot more weight so tell
me how do you figure out what position
is the correct position when putting the
CPU on the corner the corner nice nice
you did watch my videos good stuff
Morris all right dope man yeah hi man so
what is the next step I am Bram all
right beautiful
there you go man cool let's see if he
knows what slots to put these in all
right looks like Tim a 2 and a 2 and
beat you why do you figure that says
right this table right on the
motherboard beautiful on the board yeah
good job so he's basically making sure
to align the notch from the ramp to the
notch on the RAM slot
beautiful pressure nice
perfect beautiful all right man step2
done very simple what is next
I guess normally two people go for the
i/o shield but the case when do the
honors of peeling the plastic now right
the way wait till the Anglin is done oh
yeah all right get the accessories from
there okay down here I don't think I've
ever built in an s3 40 elite case really
this is actually the first time wait no
the first guy he had an s3 40 only did I
think as well did it but his oh no no no
he's a 440 razor addition not right
that's why I was like wait a minute
I knew his NZXT though but yeah this is
the first time officially the circle go
to the bottom if you have exactly that's
always a good memory man yeah where's
last time you watched my build a video I
was probably I watched your in detail
tutorial like last night just to refresh
oh nice yeah the most recent one that I
yeah their full beginner's guide Oh all
right let's uh let's move on so what did
you uh we want to next you've got your
we got dial polka dot IO show put in so
I guess we check stand offs beautiful
guessing now let me ask you this first
do you want to because I know you why
you want to put the IO cooler on there
you want to put that after we put the
case motherboard inside do you want to
put the hook up the brackets on there
first
brackets on first why because I okay
there yup that's I just feel like you
probably I didn't realize overlooking a
cooler because it was an air cooler
probably okay it's gonna be a lot easier
yeah now because we're gonna have to
flip the motherboard over cuz II notice
holes on there have to hook up the
bracket on there cool and if you put it
in the case it's gonna be kind of
annoying into it why did you go with a
200 IV - I was just looking on PC part
picker to be honest with you and it is
the most popular probably right it was
it is the most popular yeah and the
price isn't bad the price is pretty good
this one you might need this okay the
manual to tell you because there are
different sockets so we gotta figure out
which standoffs to use on these right
because there's eight of them yeah
so four for one type of socket and four
for the other okay we need to know what
type of socket your CPU is using the
best way to figure that out in case you
don't know is looking at the box
oh so figure out what socket type your
CPU is you look on the bottom of the box
it says LGA 1151 and once you figure
that out you look at the manual and
it'll tell you what standoffs to use so
I'll tell you basically which screw type
to use them off which ones to say like
51 so since this one is 1151 we're gonna
be using the 1151 smooth that which
looks like this shorter ones yeah yeah
and one of the things you have to do is
you have to align the bracket in the
back correctly so if you look closely
there's a chart here that tells you what
position to put the knob on so it's nice
and snug good yeah now the tricky part
is keeping this there exactly so what I
normally do that's where the box comes
in like it comes in handy because
usually flat like this and you said now
it's time for this standoffs cool so I
got to ask you man
yeah since you have been away from PC
game in such a long time what is the
first game you're gonna pop open on your
PC stop playing first game pup G well
gee I knew it's guys it's gotta be pug
deer I got it that's what a hype set
right now is just because it's like so
popular your friends I play
and we just want to try it I just want
to stir I want to stream it I want to
get good at it on the PC side okay the
Xbox side is just irrelevant
all right that's right it released on
flex asks I heard I think it's really
sad frame rates are really crap right oh
my god if you don't have the X don't buy
it
you order from home guys not me yeah so
next step man you got those hooked up do
much it huh oh we need the throne we got
thermal paste on the cooler itself so
would you want to use it or do you want
to yeah okay so we're gonna use the
stock thermal paste cuz I got some bad
ass don't know face in the other room
got some throne blow grizzly and then if
you really want some it's up to you
stick that one well now you got me
thinking I mean is it is it worth the
switch oh if I if I didn't have any
thermal diversity I would say no but the
fact I have a bunch left over I mean for
my water because I don't mind that's the
one I'll be using on my 79 80 XE by the
way it's one of the best thermal paste
you can buy and I don't know how good
the coarser one is I just feel like it's
okay you want to put the cooler on now
what do you want to put the put it in
the case first and then put the cool put
it in the case cool
make sure the standoffs are aligned cool
and you just start screwing them in and
who's very simple all right
laptop ready to go as you guys can see
possible fresh and I picked up my
thermal Grizz they're like four of these
in the other room ready to go
high-performance thermal grease now guys
I don't know if this is gonna be a lot
better than the stock third wall pace
from the cooler I think this will give
you slightly better thermals even if
there's 0.5 degrees or one degree but
again you guys can check that for
yourself but I mean what is uh what is
the next step
cool cooler okay beautiful so before you
put the cooler on how do you want to put
it
this thing because there's two ways you
can monitor this way you can minded this
way oh man that way this way no the
other way this way yeah okay do you want
this to be intake you want fans blowing
hair blue fans blowing or this way Cola
from the outside into the case or do you
want the opposite way because there's a
there's two different ways you can mount
this radiator well this is gonna be it's
gonna be blocked well there is a cutout
over here on the top so that's basically
what has are you coming in it's not
there now it best airflow yeah but yeah
I still getting in cold I'll take up to
the intake beautiful what's what I've
done - so we got two exhaust fans stock
that are installed by NZXT these are
gonna be exhaust and I'm gonna be using
this as intake so now how do you wanna
do first do you want to put the fans on
here first or you want to install the
radiator how do you wanna do this I say
we put the fans on there beautiful this
guy knows his stuff man very very good
stuff man here you have two one two that
cool here are the fans let's see if you
can figure out the orientation a lot of
people get this wrong normally for
Corsair fans you could see on the side
here the orientation of where the air is
being blown in from okay so for example
if the arrow is pointing this way air is
going in this way so air is being sucked
in from here out from here cool so it's
not that you can make it this area right
here now another thing before you
install that a lot of people actually
forget I've actually made this mistake
many times is let's see if you're gonna
be putting at this orientation right we
rotate this around oh you got a lucky
this time can see where the cable is
coming out of yeah you want the cable
face on the opposite end so it's better
for cable management cool sometimes I
would do this way I got a plate was
sticking exactly so without accident or
no yeah 100 sent back yeah yeah good
stuff bag is that cool I'll hold this if
you want to screw it in
oh we got to put the throne good job I
was with that so let's pop this open
that's good
well I would naturally have done a
little bit more but you can cover it and
know their own face if you want alright
seems good P dot yeah people are being
triggered right now in the pen what are
you doing to this process Superman
butchered it man
let me do my job we'll check the
thermals after yeah next up is that the
correct orientation because the coarser
okay as long as the stop something just
don't apply super pressure okay like as
long as it spins like that keep going
okay so you want to make sure the the
cooler is a good contact with the
processor I think there's some spinning
going on like I gets to the point where
it gets a little tight and then it just
really yeah okay I was like looking I
was like I've never seen black thumb
screws for these yeah and then I
realized this thing the freakiest dumb
screws for the bracket is for the side
paddle of the case
oh my god I wanted to do one build
without any mistakes just run it's not
happening
that's last one that's officially one
for the record but we're good it wasn't
like a the wrong cooler Christian if you
guys haven't seen the first episode it
was an entertaining one let's just put
it out that I'll leave the link below if
you guys want to check it out it really
there's no wrong answer if you literally
be anything at this point
okay yeah you asked to always be last
okay cuz this is the last last component
that sits on the motherboard but
literally anything else to be getting
who he can put in there you start doing
some drives okay beautiful my next
choice so he's going with one terabyte
hard drive and even SSD right yeah is
that reason he didn't go with an MDOT to
drive the place right next up is to
install hard drive he doesn't know where
it goes in the case so I'm gonna see if
he can figure it out so spy just by
looking at it this would be interesting
do you see anything in the front no slip
it in the back no but now oh yeah sorry
there it is it's hidden nice meetin ya
so this way yeah good job
all right
so our drapes then we want to hook up
next SSD beautiful let's do that and I
know you say you want to hook that up in
the fun right thank you
okay let's do that why did you go with
Samsung I'm curious out of the
popularity and reliability yeah yeah
prize and they have a good reputation
Samsung so can't go wrong there yeah
- so what is the trade you'd wait okay
got your hard drives installed what is
up next
you've got the power supply and the
Wi-Fi adapter I'd go power supply power
supply good choice Wow
so let's see if you know which cables we
need we're a computer computer computer
computer sir
your computer you see what cables again
so what does that people for this is
power power for my for my home tech can
put the motherboard perfect alright so
far so good what else do we need
obviously need is to power
I don't know I don't know these ones is
usually labeled on their it even tells
you if you can case you want
they call it VGA but it's what does it
usually stand for video video all right
beautiful
now how many of these do you need do you
know how many pins your keep us I do not
have we can figure it out let's open
this up pop this open opening up the
Beast GTA X 1080 from ACS guys now I
gotta ask you did you pick this grab
this card off after the whole
cryptocurrency fiasco did you not end up
overpaying for it did you pick it up
before I picked it up I think a little
before I the price went up to about nine
dollars yeah that is like at the 1080i
territory right there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
