deals were complete ass so I spent half
the day looking for other sources for
some great UK deals that I found two
awesome websites so this week we have
some really awesome Canada and UK deals
as well as us deals and you guys can
find the links to all of that down below
so without wasting any more time let's
go and start the show starting off the
show we have two amazing deals on tvs
the first one being a 55 inch 4k sony tv
going for 899 which already has sold
over sixty four percent of stock the
second one is also a 55 inch 4k TV but
it's curved and it has a huge discount
that's currently going for 1375 and I'm
pretty sure that's the lowest price I've
seen on a 55-inch curved 4k display
jumping into gaming gear we have the msi
gtx 980 TI golden edition that's going
for five hundred and forty six dollars
and that's because you get a ten percent
discount using the code on the screen
and an extra thirty dollars and a male
and rebate also you get a free copy of
tom clancy's the division if you've been
wanting a 980 TI for the longest time
now is your chance to pull the trigger
because it does expire on the 20th if
you have a much smaller budget the EVGA
gtx 960 is going for only a hundred and
seventy dollars after a twenty-dollar
mail-in rebate and also get a copy of
rise of the Tomb Raider for free as well
and finally the last PC component on
newegg as the EVGA 650 watt power supply
that's going for sixty dollars after a
twenty-dollar mail-in rebate as well as
I mentioned before I'm not a huge fan of
refurbished products but the logitech z
five or six speakers are going for only
thirty eight dollars which makes it a
pretty hard deal to refuse there are a
bunch of great deals on amazon this week
like the courser air 240 case that's
going for 68 bucks the xbox quantum
break bundle once again still at 299 and
the Logitech G 230 headset that's also
still at forty dollars back to TV deals
real quick there was a 65-inch 4k smart
TV going for fourteen hundred dollars
and this is actually the TV I was using
before I replaced it with my lg tv the
turtle beach ear force DP Elevens are
going for
thirty four dollars and check this one
out guys the corsair vengeance c70 case
has been secretly discounted to $58
thanks to someone on reddit posting
about it the dell 27 inch gaming matter
is also going for four hundred ninety
dollars which is a bit pricey but you do
get a 144 hurts refresh rate one
millisecond response time and g-sync
compatibility a few deals on mass drop
include a pair of em 10 speakers going
for $90 which will look bomb with any
black or white set up the mic clip is
also featured on mass drop and it's a
fully reversible micro USB cable and
it's going for only fifteen dollars
attention to every one that has laptops
setups we have a desk mount for laptops
now I'm not really sure how practical
that is typing like that but is there if
anyone wants to check it out and finally
the me onyx caster RGB gaming mouse is
on master up as well for $57 which by
the way is currently my main mouse yep i
pretty much covered in my MX master and
now I'm using this for gaming and
productivity I highly recommend it so
those are the best deals for this week
as always Canada and UK deals are listed
down below thank you guys so much for
watching and as always if you enjoyed it
make sure to leave a like and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
