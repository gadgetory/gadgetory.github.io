that you guys want to see alright so
starting up the show we have a huge
discount on a camera bundle from nikon
five hundred dollars off to be precise
you get the nikon d 3333 and 55 to 200
millimeter lenses and a few other extra
stuff that include an extra battery pack

shoots pretty crispy 1080p video and if
you're on a budget or if you're starting
a YouTube channel and this is a deal you

a link down below to a video sample
using this exact same camera and lens if
anyone is interested in checking it out
this next deal is on a gigabyte g1
motherboard with an eighty dollar
discount and this next deal is actually
on a free app called the nice I found
that eight inch Windows 10 tablet that's
going for only $98 the best part about
this deal is that you can actually try
this product out before you buy it so
you don't have to pay up front if you
decide not to keep it if you decide not
to keep it just send it back to them
using their prepaid label but if you
guys interested in checking out the
tablet and some other really awesome
products up front without any costs I'll
drop a link to their app down below
jumping over to Amazon you can pick up
an acer 28 inch 4k monitor for six
hundred dollars at features g-sync and a
1 millisecond response time which is
great for gaming I've seen this next
monitor a few times on setup wars and
Here I am finally featuring it on my
best tech deals this is the 21.5 inch HP
monitor with a knife
display and not so quick seven
millisecond response time it's great for
productivity not so much for gaming
another product I see a lot of on setup
Wars is the creative gigaworks t40
speakers I think there's literally one
in every episode but if you guys I've
sick and tired of seeing this on the

here's your chance to pick them up for
thirty-eight dollars off one of my
personal favorite budget wireless
earphones that I featured on the channel

43 bucks off staying on the topic of
sound you guys can pick up an awesome
waterproof bluetooth speaker for super
cheap it dropped in price by 60 bucks

items on amazon our games the first up

ratchet and clank game which is based on
the ps2 game and you say the whopping 11
cents guys probably the best deal in
