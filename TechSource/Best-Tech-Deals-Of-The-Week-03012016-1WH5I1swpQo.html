welcome to another episode of best tech
deals of the week I've been reading your
comments this past few weeks and a lot
of you guys have been wanting me to do
canada deals as well and here's the
thing you guys as much as i want to
include every single country in this
video i can't because the video will be
like 20 minutes long and the point of
these videos is to be quick and straight
to the point and save you guys money so
with that being said since my top 3
demographics are us you can canada i
will now include UK and canada deals as
well however starting today i will go
over us deals only in my videos and i'll
go ahead and link UK and canada deals
that i find down below if you guys are
interested so hopefully that will show
in the video time and also cover deals
that you guys want to see alright so
starting up the show we have a huge
discount on a camera bundle from nikon
five hundred dollars off to be precise
you get the nikon d 3333 and 55 to 200
millimeter lenses and a few other extra
stuff that include an extra battery pack
and a 16 gigabyte memory card this thing
shoots pretty crispy 1080p video and if
you're on a budget or if you're starting
a YouTube channel and this is a deal you
should definitely check out I even left
a link down below to a video sample
using this exact same camera and lens if
anyone is interested in checking it out
this next deal is on a gigabyte g1
motherboard with an eighty dollar
discount and this next deal is actually
on a free app called the nice I found
that eight inch Windows 10 tablet that's
going for only $98 the best part about
this deal is that you can actually try
this product out before you buy it so
you don't have to pay up front if you
decide not to keep it if you decide not
to keep it just send it back to them
using their prepaid label but if you
guys interested in checking out the
tablet and some other really awesome
products up front without any costs I'll
drop a link to their app down below
jumping over to Amazon you can pick up
an acer 28 inch 4k monitor for six
hundred dollars at features g-sync and a
1 millisecond response time which is
great for gaming I've seen this next
monitor a few times on setup wars and
Here I am finally featuring it on my
best tech deals this is the 21.5 inch HP
monitor with a knife
display and not so quick seven
millisecond response time it's great for
productivity not so much for gaming
another product I see a lot of on setup
Wars is the creative gigaworks t40
speakers I think there's literally one
in every episode but if you guys I've
sick and tired of seeing this on the
show because you were broke and will now
here's your chance to pick them up for
thirty-eight dollars off one of my
personal favorite budget wireless
earphones that I featured on the channel
before actually has a four dollar off
coupon using this code listed on the
screen which isn't much but nonetheless
it's still the cheapest pairs of
earphones you can get right now if your
phones aren't your thing the philips SHP
7000 bluetooth headphones are going for
43 bucks off staying on the topic of
sound you guys can pick up an awesome
waterproof bluetooth speaker for super
cheap it dropped in price by 60 bucks
and that's pretty crazy the last two
items on amazon our games the first up
we have infamous second son for the ps4
going for twenty bucks and the new
ratchet and clank game which is based on
the ps2 game and you say the whopping 11
cents guys probably the best deal in
this episode on newegg you can find an
hour nine 290x graphics card going for
215 bucks after thirty dollar mail-in
rebate and finally a viewsonic 21.5 inch
monitor with a 6.5 millisecond response
time going for a hundred bucks so that's
what the best tech deals of the week if
you guys enjoy these weekly deals make
sure to leave a like and i'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
