CES to check out some of the new
products in fact I'm actually using some
of their parts from my January build so
make sure to stick around for that when
you're building pcs it's all about
finding the best deals out there on the
parts to make the most out of your build
and speaking of deals I'm going to give
a huge shout out to dot tech domains for
sponsoring this episode I'm all about
tech and the dot tech domain is also
great branding for startups enthusiasts
vloggers and even companies from the
tech industry the biggest example is of
course CES tech who migrated to the dot
tech extension last year and since then
dot tech crossed 300,000 registrations
and is still growing today so if you
guys want your very own dot tech domain
at a great price of 399 for one year or
$49.99 for 10 years then visit WWE Tag
and use the coupon code listed on the
screen so to start of the show and my
personal favorite is their quad stellar
case similar to the Tri stellar case
which I did a build in a few months ago
this one has four separate compartments
instead of three one for the motherboard
power supply graphics card and hard
drives it features four tempered glass
side panels RGB lighting near the front
and quite possibly the coolest feature
is their thermal solution that's inside
the case basically there are temperature
sensors located in each compartment and
depending on how hot it gets the front
panel either open or closed to get the
right amount of airflow what's also cool
about this case other than the design is
that it supports full ATX motherboards
meaning that you have more options to
choose from when deciding what build you
want to go with it will be available in
May 2017 and the price will be slightly
cheaper than the Tri stellar if you guys
are interested in seeing me build inside
this case let me know by hitting that
like button it should be an interesting
video
my other favorite case from the showroom
was the baron case liquid tower which
has a micro ATX form factor but supports
full sized ATX motherboards they were
able to achieve this by removing the PSU
cover near the bottom and moving that on
the other side quite genius if you ask
me this case also comes with our new
captain 120 X liquid cooling system
which by the way is now RGB and there's
even a flow meter for an added cool
effect the top solid metal handle is
nice for carrying around the PC however
it is optional and can be taken off by
simply removing the screws on the
sides this retails for $130 and will be
available in April 2017 cases are not
the only thing they announced that CES
deep cool has officially released their
first ever RGB fans to different
variations to be exact we have one with
an X design and the other is actually
frameless DMF 120 GT has an aluminum
alloy frame which is detachable for easy
cleaning and the fan speed ranges from
500 to 2200 rpm via a PWM connection
deep cool did state that these can be
used for both air flow and static
pressure you can use the provided RGB
controller to change the lights on the
fans or you can download a very own GS
control app via iOS or iPhone and
control the lights or effects straight
from the app which I thought was really
cool it comes in a pack of three and
goes for 99 dollars whereas the MF 120s
which are the frameless ones cost 10
dollars less they should hit the market
in April 2017 as always I got tons more
coverage on CES 2017 so make sure you
guys hit that subscribe button I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
