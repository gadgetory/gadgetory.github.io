and welcome to another cool tech episode
but this time I'm going to be doing
something a little different for the
first time ever on the channel you guys
get to try out the products I feature in
this video for free using this
invite-only app called nice and I'll
drop a link to it down below and you
guys can get your own invite code so
most of you guys already know this app
is because I featured in my previous
videos but for my new subscribers out
there nice is basically an app that lets
you try out products for free before you
buy them and it's really easy how it
works you basically log on the app and
you scroll through the list of products
you find on that you think is pretty
cool and you request it they send it to
you you try it for five days if you like
it you pay for it if not you send it
back for free so all the products I
mentioned in this video are available
through the app nice and you guys can
try them out for free for five days so
without wasting overtime let's begin so
starting up the video we have this
really cool Bluetooth game controller
from I pega which looks a lot like the
Xbox controller
you got your colorful XY ba buttons off
to the right side the two joysticks and
trigger buttons on the bottom you also
get some media controls near the right
side which you can use to play pause or
skip tracks if you listening to music on
your device after popping up the middle
portion you are greeted by the microUSB
port needed to charge the device a power
switch along with LED indicators for
both the battery life and the game mode
that you are using the controller with
the telescopic stand can stretch out to
even fit the largest of devices up to
six inches as far as the sensitivity I
gotta say I was impressed with how
responsive it is while playing racing
games like asphalt 8 I mean there is a
little lag present but not enough to
take away from enjoying the game it is
compatible with both iOS and Android
devices but it won't be compatible with
every single game as far as first-person
shooters you can really notice the lag
but again it's not that bad to take away
from the experience of the game you just
need to get used to it I mean after all
you're playing on a smartphone and it's
much better than touching the screen
with your fingers this next item is
probably the coolest power bank out
there so not only is it an extremely
thin 4000 milliamp hour power bank that
fits in your wallet but also comes with
a micro USB cable so you don't need to
everyone with you it doesn't even stop
they're popping off the cable you can
find a regular USB port and a lightning
adapter to charge Apple devices so this
is essentially an all-in-one power bank
that's super portable this next item is
an interesting case for the iPhone 6 or
6s so comes in two pieces the first part
is made out of silicon that protects the
phone from inside and the outer piece is
a hard shell to protect the phone from
drops the buttons are super easy to
press and there is nothing blocking the
ports and speakers on the bottom but the
interesting part is the slider in the
back of the case that changes the game
it basically acts as a mirror reflection
for the camera allowing you to take
incognito pictures or video you can
pretty much aim your phone at whatever
you want to take pictures with while
it's flat I can only think of one way
that's actually useful and that's if you
don't want to be obvious that you're
taking pictures or video because of the
reflection the image appears upside down
which isn't really a big deal since you
can always edit and post and flip the
image or video over there's also no
difference in image quality but I
thought I'd included since it's a pretty
cool device this next item is a bulb
that's it it's it's it's just the ball
that lights up and plays freakin music
so - all night
all jokes aside the sound quality is not
bad considering it's coming out of a
freaking lightbulb and in terms of how
bright it is
well let's just say that it's as bright
as my regular IKEA bulbs that I have in
my storage also you get much cooler
temperatures but here's a quick
difference between the two bulbs last
but not least we have another Bluetooth
speaker that lights up it's great to
have for bonfires blackouts and even for
camping in the front there is a flap
which hides the microUSB port needed for
charging a microSD card slot and an
audio jack in case you don't want to use
bluetooth it's an extremely well-built
speaker that you can easily take
anywhere you want but how does it sound
turning face nervously Ernie whiskers
it's got a really deep base and gets
pretty loud but the best part about
trying out speakers before you buy them
is that you can actually hear them in
person before deciding I mean watching a
video and it really doesn't do it
justice because of what I'm using to
record the sound and also the headphones
you guys are using to hear the sound and
this is where the app nice shines in so
as I said before all of the products
featured in this video are available to
try out for free for 5 days using the
app so make sure you guys click on the
link below get your invite code and
check them out it's only available for
iOS and they actually you have Android
coming out really soon that's basically
it thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
