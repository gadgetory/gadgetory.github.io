welcome to my new temporary series on
the channel called 12 days of tech or
each day I basically feature a different
category of tech all the way to
Christmas which is December 25th the
purpose of these series is to help you
guys find the best gifts for your
friends or family so with that said
let's kick off this episode by looking
at some of the best monitors ranging
from budget all the way to high end and
if you guys enjoy the series and like
the idea let me know by leaving a like
so yeah let's begin so starting the show
off with the cheapest 1080p monitor you
can find on planet earth the v7 21.5
inch monitor going for 72 dollars if you
guys aren't picky about design or specs
and one an HD monitor to get some work
done or even casual gaming then this is
definitely for you it's even vest
compatible so if you want to mount this
on a wall or a monitor arm then you
definitely can if you have a bit more to
spend the next best option is the AOC 22
inch monitor that sports an IPS display
5 millisecond response time and a 60
Hertz refresh rate you also get a very
good-looking monitor with extremely thin
bezels the only downside is that it
doesn't come with speakers an HDMI port
nor is it basic imperil but if you can
look past these negatives and this is a
solid buy for only $100 alright so now
let's talk gaming for a bit one of the
most affordable gaming monitors you can
buy right now is the Acer 24 6 HL which
is a 24 inch display rocking a 144 Hertz
refresh rate any one millisecond
response time this is perfect for any
hardcore or competitive gamer and it's
only going to cost you a little under
$200
it is also basic compatible and it comes
with an HDMI port however it does not
come with built-in speakers if you like
me and are into ultra wide monitors then
this one from LG is definitely one of
the best options available for under
$200
it's a 2560 by 1080p monitor with an IPS
display and that's pretty much it it's
not really a gaming monitor because if
it's 60 Hertz refresh rate and a 5
millisecond response time but it's
excellent for editing because of the 99%
RGB color space and it also is basic
compatible however it doesn't have a
built-in speaker now if you guys demand
more pixels and are not a fan of ultra
lights then the Samsung 28 inch 4k
monitor is probably what you're looking
for
not only does it have a 3840 by 2160
display but it also features AMD
freesync and a one millisecond response
time so if you have an AMD GPU this
would be amazing for gaming in UHD
otherwise if you don't care for gaming
this is an excellent monitor for graphic
designers 3d modelling and even editing
videos it is basic compatible however it
doesn't have built-in speakers back to
ultra wide monitors if you want a beefy
ultra wide gaming monitor for under 700
bucks then look no further I did do a
video on this and I was impressed with
what LG can do at such a great price 144
Hertz refresh rate 1 millisecond
response time and free sync even if you
don't have an AMD GPU this thing is a
badass
just keep vsync switched on and you
won't experience any screen tearing
honestly guys you don't need anything
more than 100 Hertz paying for G sync is
such a waste of money it's also based a
compatible however it doesn't come with
built-in speakers for my content
creators out there that do lots of
editing and casual gaming this version
of LG's ultra lite is a much better
option not only do you get more pixels
34 40 by 1440 P by the way but you also
get 99% RGB Thunderbolt 2 supports and a
curved IPS panel perfect for any
productivity setup it's also basic metal
and it comes with built-in speakers of
course with all these awesome features
it comes in a hefty price tag of $1000
and finally for those big time ballers
out there that want the absolute best in
an ultra wide gaming monitor then the
asus rog swift is currently the champion
with a 34 40 by 1440p curved IPS display
and a 100 Hertz refresh rate with g-sync
this is definitely one of the
best-looking ultra lights I have seen
it's also basic compatible and comes
with built-in speakers which are
terrible according to reviews but
personally I would go this monitor
simply because it has a higher
resolution and it just looks way more
badass I mean come on this thing looks
sick so that is it for day one guys day
two and three are going to be keyboards
and mice but if there's a category of
tech you guys want to see done on the
channel let me know by dropping your
comments down below then you guys so
much watching and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
