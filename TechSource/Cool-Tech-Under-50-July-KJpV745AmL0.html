tech source and welcome to cool tech
under 50 for the month of July if you
guys somehow miss my previous episodes
I'll go ahead and leave a link to the
playlist down below so you guys have
time definitely check them out
chances are you will find something that
you will like but anyways with that said
let's go ahead and start the video
alright so starting off the list is the
awesome headphones it is a few bucks
more than the $50 mark but I figured I'd
let it slide this time so this is a pair
of bluetooth headphones that can also be
hooked up via cable if you don't want to
go wireless
it will get you up to 250 hours of
standby time up to 20 hours of talk time
and music playback yep I did say talk
time it features a built-in microphone
allowing you to make calls using your
phone on one side you have your power
button and volume controls along with
the optional headphone jack and on the
other you have the USB port for charging
the headphones and the media controls
such as skipping pausing and playing
since these are over ear headphones they
do provide excellent noise isolation and
I would say that they are even more
comfortable than my ath m50x is that
again they are much lighter to begin
with however there is a noticeable
difference in noise isolation between
the two I can definitely hear more
outside noise with the Alstom headphones
compared to the m50 s the sound quality
is actually pretty good you get clear
vocals great lows and highs with a
really strong bass the headphones have
artificial protein leather for the
headband and cushions to provide comfort
for long hours of use and majority of
the headphone is made out of plastic
material with the exception of the
aluminum slider the ear cups also rotate
a full 180 degrees and it's actually
surprisingly flexible so if you're
looking for a great pair of wireless
headphones around 50 bucks with a
built-in mic feature then the owls dumb
headphones are for you next we have a
very stylish acrylic headphone stand
from a movi there is a transparent
option available as well but I did pick
up the black one instead since it
matches my desk setup better I think
that it really cleans up my setup and
it's a great way to keep your headphones
off the table it's mainly designed to
work well with wireless headphones but I
don't see why you can't use it with
wired headphones as well the next item
was highly requested a lot of you guys
wanted to know how I make my products
spin in place well it's no secret I use
a rotating turntable so there are a
bunch of these out there that start from
100 bucks and go higher but the one I've
been using on the channel for the past
two years is actually under the $50
price tag I mean you guys have seen my
previous video so you know how smooth
this thing rotates it features a
built-in L
the light that you can switch on and off
and you can even switch the direction it
rotates the manufacturer states that it
can load up to seven pounds but I've
actually put heavier objects on it like
a 20 pound PC and it works just fine
this thing is responsible for most of my
amazing shots and my videos you can
practically turn anything into a
cinematic video just by using this thing
the next three items are from Co tech
starting off as the 60-watt six port USB
charger it features intelligent Auto
detect technology which will detect your
device and deliver the fastest charge
but what's so special about this wall
charger compared to the other ones I
featured in my previous videos is that
this has two additional quick charge
ports which are colored blue
it features Qualcomm quick charge 2.0
technology which will charge your device
up to 75% faster than regular charging
port it's very similar to the Galaxy
lineup smartphones that come with fast
charging technology
next item is similar to the six port
wall charger however this one is meant
for your car and it has only one quick
charge port highlighted in blue the
third item from ko tech is an
interesting one as I've not seen
anything like this before but it
features two power outlets with surge
protection and five smart USB charging
ports which will once again detect your
device and deliver the fastest charging
speeds by the way I should mention that
all three of these products come with
their one year warranty with the
exception of the car charger which has
an extended 18 month warranty so the
next item is a 3.5 millimeter jack
splitter it's pretty straightforward
actually you can connect up to two
headphones using this adapter and plug
this straight into a phone or laptop and
share a movie or music with a buddy of
yours this is a great accessory for
travelling and you can even connect
speakers if you need an extra 3.5
millimeter jack the sound quality isn't
affected and I had this for over a year
now so it's pretty damn durable this
next item has appeared many times
throughout my videos but I haven't
actually featured it in my cool tech
series which is why I'm officially
including it now so there's a reason why
this is by far my most favorite power
bank that I use every single day first
off there is no other power bank out
there with twenty two thousand four
hundred milliamps or more within this
price range this is by far the best bang
for your buck when it comes to power
second it features three USB ports
dedicated for specific devices you can
charge them all at the same time by the
way if you're wondering why I got these
awesome carbon fiber skins from then
I'll leave a link right below to where
you guys can pick some up for yourself I
also love the fact that it comes in my
favorite color combination
black and red but also comes in several
other color themes as well it features a
built-in
flashlights that can be turned on by
double tapping the power button and by
pressing it once it will turn on the
LEDs which will display how much juice
is left in the power bank this next
power bank is from Chi Rho and it's a
much smaller one in size and power as
well this is a six thousand milliamp
power bank that comes in a compact thin
size which makes it great for travel it
comes with a micro USB tucked in the
side here which is great because you
don't need to carry additional cables
however the downside is that it won't
work with iPhones so only works with
micro USB compatible devices next up we
have the gorilla pod stand and this is
an affordable way to film videos using
your smartphone the mount is very
durable with steel internal structure
which is designed to survive the wear
and tear of everyday use on the go it's
super flexible as you can tell here
which makes this a very versatile stand
in fact you can get pretty creative with
it if you use your imagination there is
a locking mechanism that lets you eject
the head and install the grip tight
mount which is sold separately now there
are two different sizes one is for
smaller phones like the HTC One m9 and
the other for larger devices like the
Nexus 6
it definitely has a tight grip but it
has rubber mounts on the sides so it
doesn't end up damaging your phone you
can even install the mount on your own
tripod and just use it that way and film
completely with a smartphone
there is another secret that I have not
yet shared with anyone and it has to do
with keeping my objects upright without
any back support well I use this
material called BlueTEC and I basically
add some underneath the products and it
keeps them upright it's reusable and it
doesn't leave any residue once you peel
it off the best way I can explain it is
that it's basically a very sticky
play-doh do not underestimate the
strength of the blue tag this thing can
practically hold up anything I mean it
could even support a tablet for God's
sake now this last item isn't really a
tech product and instead I just wanted
to feature it because I think it's
pretty cool but these are the Game of
Thrones coasters that I've been using in
my office this past year and I kind of
wanted to represent my favorite TV show
of all time when I have guests over and
I think that this adds a very nice touch
by the way I do represent House
Targaryen but let me know what house you
guys represent by dropping a comment
down below actually there is one more
product I do want to mention in this
video and it's called mic flip it's
basically a reversible USB to micro-usb
cable and it's currently not out yet but
what makes it so cool is that both of
the ends are reversible the USB portion
and the microUSB portion I actually
reserved two of them for myself and
depending on when you're watching this
video I'll either go ahead and leave the
link to the IndieGoGo campaign down
below so you guys can reserve them for
yourself as well or the actual link to
the product so you guys can purchase
them if you're interested but anyways
that's it for the video thank you guys
so much for watching if you guys want me
to continue doing cool tech every single
month let me know by leaving a like on
the video and it was a specific type of
products you guys want me to cover next
whether it be the top 5 gaming keyboards
or the best budget Bluetooth speakers
they let me know by dropping a comment
down below and I'll go ahead and add
that to my list once again if you missed
my previous episodes of cool tech you
can find the playlist down below you
guys definitely have to check it out if
you have time you won't regret it but
anyways I'm gonna stop talking thank you
guys for watching I will see you in the
next video
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
