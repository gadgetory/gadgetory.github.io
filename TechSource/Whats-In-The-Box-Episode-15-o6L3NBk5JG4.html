welcome to another episode of what's in
the box as you can see we have more
packages packages as you can see we have
quite a few boxes but not as much as
before and the reason why is because I'm
trying to make this video shorter so I'm
not trying to unbox a bunch in each
episode these can go up to like 10 12
minutes long that's a lot of time for
you guys so I'm trying to shorten them
maybe six seven minutes at most but
anyways I'm not going to waste any more
time let's open up some fan mail
that I got and then we can move on to
Dean boxing's so these are from China it
looks like maybe from the same person
I'm not sure but this is another pretty
cool watch it's funny how the dial is
like all messed up on there I'll try and
get a zoom shot but pretty much says
whatever I'm late anyways and then all
the numbers aren't here at the bottom
that's pretty cool thank you very much
whoever it was that sent this to me so
this looks like some sort of earrings I
think wow these are really fancy I'm
pretty sure this was sent for free and
if that's the case thank you so much I'm
gonna give this to her and I'm sure
she's gonna love them these are pretty
Wow
these are pretty flashy thank you so
much what was that sentence to me maybe
I'll put them on those so these are a
bunch of mail I'm not gonna read them in
front of the camera like last time
because it will take forever so if there
are any items in here I'll show them but
I'm gonna be reading these off the
camera instead and put them in my bed
when I'm done so this letter is from
Matthew by the way happy birthday man
you are turning 15 in November 8th that
is awesome
hopefully this video gets out before
then but he also drew a little pretty
sweet pic a sweet picture of me and my
setup and crayon this is pretty sick
dude thank you so much man
this next one is from Mohammed this one
looks like it's a bit open now we've got
a floppy disk and two floppy disks
and some RAM sticks which are from 1920s
I'm sure I don't even know what is this
board so pretty much his old school
clothes last year and they were giving
away tons of old stuff you couldn't just
send me a letter without a little
something and I know it may not see much
but I hope you like old tech if the RAM
sticks break I'm sorry that is awesome I
love it thank you so much I don't know
what on earth I'm gonna do with these I
can't even use these I don't have any
floppy drives but thank you for RAM
sticks maybe I'll auction these on eBay
or something for a million dollars thank
you so much by the way you guys don't
have to send me anything even if you
want to send me a letter that is fine
please don't feel obligated to send me
anything I honestly will be happy if you
just write me a letter so why don't you
send me this one it's like a little of
his photoshopped or mspaint
but a TS logo which is pretty cool thank
you so much for that and he sent me a
bunch of questions which I will answer
and also he wants to be a scientist and
send it back hence why he sent me
another envelope with a stamp thank you
for providing a stamp that's all stuff
you don't have to do that
so yeah I'll ask your questions
definitely and I will email this back to
you thank you so much for sending it in
so this one is from Liam and he sent me
a picture of a GTX 10 atti so this is
like before NDA and all that stuff so
you pretty much do a picture I'll you
know if this is real or not but this is
a pretty badass drawing dude
Thank You Liam for setting this sentence
he's pretty sick and it's even in the
shape of an actual gravis car it's
pretty awesome this one is also from
Toby and he wants me to sign a piece of
paper and send it to them I'll go and
sign this one if you like and send it
back to you thank you so much Toby for
sending this letter in I also want to
thank eat and Colby for sending these
letters if there's any questions in here
