it's a some sex stories and welcome to
another episode of what knife is in the
box
seriously it's getting out of control I
pretty sure isn't even nice in this
episode so with that said let's just
dive right into it
and it's open up this yellow box first
because it is taped up so much and I
think it's coming from China
I swear that this first product is a
knife already then who on earth is
sending packages like this honestly oh
my god that was a nightmare
alright so we got three boxes from cut
and there is an emblem of knives on
there
okay let's just open it check it out all
right so this is actually pretty
interesting looks like the knives come
in a little case I'll get this I'm
digging this looks really cool instead
of a regular boring box these guys have
cuts are sending knives that are
packaged nicely looks like they all come
packaged in gamma boxes that looks
pretty cool they're actually very
lightly just nothing in here am I
getting pranked oh that that's what I
call presentation this is how you sent a
knife whoa
I know you guys grilled me on the last
knives and boxing's because I don't know
what the hell I was talking about but
this is a butterfly knife okay I'm check
out the graphic work on that ladies and
gentlemen this looks sick I'm not gonna
lie
that's two more boxes over here looks
like they're both butterfly knives as
well this one's a black and green and we
have another black and red check this
one out looks like the same pretty much
the same design actually and this one's
black and green okay guys these are
really awesome looking knives but you
know what these aren't actual knives it
doesn't look like these are just
replicas maybe just for aesthetic
reasons maybe if you want to prop on
your desk or something like that these
are purely for looks they are not for
cutting things or stabbing people
unfortunately so but you guys want to
check these guys out I'll drop the link
down below and also if you guys want to
check out the gamma boxes once again
