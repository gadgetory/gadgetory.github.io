these packages three weeks I don't visit
my peel box and this happens
no but seriously thank you guys so much
for setting these packages and it's one
of the reasons why I do these episodes
it's gonna be a long episode so make
sure you have you a cup of tea if it's
nighttime or I don't have your cereal a
cup of coffee if it's morning cuz it's
gonna be a long episode also guys I
think this will be the last episode I'm
gonna be opening up letters because look
at this there's a lot of letters and a
lot of you guys always skip the
beginning and only care about me reading
letters so I think I'm just gonna read
these off for the camera and only open
up the packages so that's okay with you
guys let me know in the comments section
otherwise otherwise these are gonna be
like 30 minutes long if I read every
single letter so I hope you guys are
cool with that I'm just gonna open
yourself real quick just to make sure
there's nothing in here and then we can
move on to the packages this one's from
Brandon and he basically quoted what I
said in last episode send me even a
penny and I will send it back challenge
accepted so he sent me a penny I'm
keeping this penny this is CPU did I get
another dead PC part dear textures thank
you for inspiring me to learn about
computers I'm taking a computer class at
middle school
I'll have already made a model of a
portable gaming console that's really
cool I figure I love your channel so
much I watch it every day I even turned
on video notifications that's what I'm
talking about
thumbs up if you enable video
notifications but yeah I'm not really
sure what's up with the CPU I'm guessing
it's probably dead if so yeah thank you
so much drew for sending this n you walk
so this one is from Jack Snyder and he
took a picture of his setup which by the
way this is a setup you guys can check
it out let me know what you think down
below and he wants me to sign it and
send it back so which I will definitely
do Thank You zachsmith Jack Snyder it
sounds like Zack Snyder the famous
director thank you so much for sending
this in alright onto the actual packages

Brad potato parcel calm is this legit a
potato do not eat this potato potato
parcel is not liable for any illness if
the potato is eaten I appreciate the
warning what might if my face is on the
potato I think every time I do one is
episodes it just gets stranger and
stranger but I think this so far tops it
off like it my face on a potato and
there's a message hey I see you got my
potato my name is aaaa gaming is from
United Arab Emirates and good luck with
the potato my only question is what kind
of business does people actually do this
like there's a business where you can
literally write your message on a potato
and send it to someone I don't want to
live in this world anymore it's just
sexy faces huh
are these finger puppets or something
okay scratch what I said about the
potato this this officially tops it off

have no idea what I'm gonna do this like
