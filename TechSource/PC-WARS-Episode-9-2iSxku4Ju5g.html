beast is running on a 6700 K and an EVGA
gtx 980ti
kingpin edition it also has 16 gigabytes
of RAM and an H 100 a GTX CPU cooler
which has an interesting placement I
think you're supposed to put the fans on
the other side so that it can blow in
cold air from outside but hey it's your
PC for much more accelerated 16000 625
placing it way up there on the charts
other than that strange fan placement
this looks like a pretty sweet black and
red build Thank You Alan for entering
armand is next up with a sweet-looking
black white and purple build called
Pink Panther we have a 2600 K paired
with a GTX 970 inside the Corsair 760 T
case not sure how I feel about all those
colors besides the pink black and white
there's also a blue and red present I
would have at least gotten different
colored custom sleeves and either pink
or white to make them stand out a bit
more and stay true to the color scheme
but it's still a sweet looking rig for
benchmarks escorting 11,000 158 taking
second place for this video coming in at
number three is Chris and Starkiller
this beast is running on a 6700 K which
is overclocked to 4.7 we also have a gtx
980ti hybrid Edition and 16 gigabytes of
Dominator Platinum's
we also have the ek pattered a 360 cpu
cooler and custom sleeve cables from ice
mods to stay consistent with the theme
it scored a 17,000 257 immediately
taking first place for this episode a
very sexy black and white build inside
the Corsair 780 T case thank you Chris
for entering at number 4 we have Justin
with the spark build that's running on
an AMD 8320 which is paired with a GTX 9
50 we also have a gigabyte of RAM and a
stock cooler breath for benchmarks that

and last place and probably will remain

four point six and two GTX 970 s and SLI
