again and this is a review for Google's
new Nexus 7 let's start with the
hardware made by asus the new Nexus 7
still has the soft touch materials like
previous nexus 7 models but this one is
more refined and elegant the new Nexus 7
sports a 7-inch display with a
resolution of 1920 x 1200 which means
that it comes out to 323 pixels per inch
which makes a display really sharp it
has good viewing angles and beautiful
color reproduction the screen gets
really bright and this excellent and
watching video especially when coupled
with the dual stereo speakers that
google and asus have put into this
tablet overall the media consumption on
this new Nexus 7 was excellent i can
spend hours watching youtube videos and
movies on this awesome display there is
also a new 5 megapixel camera on the
back of the nexus 7 but it's not real
good and usable in anything but good
lighting conditions moving on to
performance the new Nexus 7 runs on a
faster processor and a new graphics unit
that google claims is more than four
times as powerful Google's also double
the RAM from last generations Nexus 7
making you two gigabytes to make it
simple the Nexus 7 is fast games look
great even the more graphically
intensive owns and this performance
carries throughout the UI of the Nexus 7
scrolling is smooth and it is just an
overall better experience using this
tablet than any other Android tablet i
have used in the past this is probably
because of it being a Nexus device which
means it would always run the latest
version of Android which when filming
this is Android 4.3 jellybean for two
hundred twenty nine dollars you will not
find anything that beats this tablet its
battery gets me through the whole day
with plenty of juice left the Nexus 7 is
definitely recommended and pretty much
unbeatable at this price point thank you
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
