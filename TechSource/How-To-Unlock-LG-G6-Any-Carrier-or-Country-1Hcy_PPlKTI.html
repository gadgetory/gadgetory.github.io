I'm here to show you the process of
unlocking your LG g6 so you can use it
with any GSM carrier in the world for
this demonstration I will be using my
lock to g6 and unlock it so I can use it
on my AT&amp;amp;T network but its exact same
process for any carrier from any country
so first off we need to get the unlock
code to start the unlocking process the
place where I get all my lock codes is
the unlocking company comm because they
have the cheapest prices online and I
get my codes much faster than other
websites before we continue we need the
IMEI number of the phone and the way you
look that up on your phone is to open up
the dial pad and enter and star pound
zero six pound so head on over to the
locking company and select your phone
manufacturer and the phone model from
the drop-down list and on the next page
go ahead and select the country from
where the phone was originally purchased
from and the carrier of the phone so in
my case I purchased it in the United
States and the original carrier is Telus
once everything is filled out go ahead
and proceed to the final page where you
have to check out so after checking out
they will email you your unlock code
the price and delivery time of your code
varies by phone but don't worry because
as I said before you are getting the
cheapest price online with the fastest
delivery times so once you receive your
lock code from the locking company comm
it's time to unlock your phone go ahead
and pop out the SIM tray and put in the
SIM card you want to use with the phone
so I want to use the g6 with my xviii a
network so I'm putting in my AT&amp;amp;T SIM
card once the SIM card is inside the
phone it should automatically reboot or
it should take you to the unlock page
immediately and this is where you input
the code that you received from your
locking company after putting in the
code and hitting a lock you will get a
message stating that the unlocking was
successful and it will either reboot or
take you straight to the home screen
that means your phone is now permanently
unlocked please note that some newer
devices locked to u.s. carriers are now
remotely unlocked so if it doesn't
prompt for a code don't worry because
they can still unlock it without a
problem so that's how you lock your LG
g6 for any GSM carrier in the world if
this video helped you guys out feel free
to leave a like and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
