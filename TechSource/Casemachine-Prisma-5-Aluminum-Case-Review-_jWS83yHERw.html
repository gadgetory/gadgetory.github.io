I'm going to review a pretty cool case
that I just discovered normally I don't
upload a lot of case reviews because
there's really nothing interesting about
most of them however once in a while
something really cool comes along and
grabs my attention and I feel that I
should share it with the world this here
is the prisma 5 aluminum case from case
machine it's made with aircraft-grade
aluminum it weighs 22 grams and it's
available in five different colors that
you see here since the prisma 5 is an
aluminum case it does come with foam
shock absorbers on the inner walls to
protect your phone from getting
scratched from the inside most of the
quality aluminum cases are expensive
which is why I was surprised that this
case costs only 50 bucks which is pretty
insane the installation is also really
simple there are a total of two screws
holding the case together with one being
on each side the case comes with this
handy tool which you can attach to your
keychain so we don't lose it and if you
twist the cap off you gain access to the
mini torx wrench which is needed to
remove the screws off the case and
what's cool about this is that they
provide you with two spare screws which
are inserted right here in the cap in
case you end up losing the originals so
you use the tool and remove both screws
and the case just comes apart like so if
you purchase the prisma 5 you also
receive a very cool backplate like this
one here as you can see I already
install it on my phone it's made out of
high-impact polycarbonate material and
it's super thin with a slightly raised
Center making it easier to grab on a
flat surface the polycarbonate material
feels really nice in my hand and it
makes super easy for me to slide in and
out of my pocket and it doesn't attract
dust or dirt so that's a huge plus as
well so to install the case you just
have to put both of the rails back on
the phone like so and insert and tighten
each screw one at a time usually
aluminum cases feel a bit loose no
matter how much you tighten it but
amazingly the prisma 5 feels very snug
and tight so usually good looking cases
have to sacrifice accessibility in order
to achieve really nice aesthetics
however the prisma 5 is not one of those
cases the cutouts not only look great
but they are larger
to easily access whatever it is that you
need for those of you that don't know
I'm a huge fan of skin that I always add
colored carbon fiber skins to my phone
before installing a case on so having a
lot of open ports on each side of the
case allows me or anyone else really to
show off those cool colors there are
open ports on the left side of the case
for maximum signal strength and easy
access to the SIM tray you can also
access the volume rockers with ease
while holding down the phone with one
hand I know there are a lot of bumper
cases out there that make this a very
difficult task so that was one of the
things I was actually worried about
however accessing the sounds which will
take some getting used to just like all
the other cases for a lock button there
is an aluminum cap on it and despite how
it looks in the video it's actually
really easy to press down on it so I
have no problem there on the bottom of
the case you have cutouts for the
speaker's charger and audio jack once
again a lot of case companies
underestimate the size for the audio and
charging ports they make it just enough
for Apple products but fail to take into
account that people you start party
devices as well case machine made them
large enough to fit even third-party
docking stations as well as headstones
overall I'm really impressed at this
case I'm a huge aluminum case fan and
this one is by far the best one that I
have seen so far if you guys are in the
market for an awesome new case for your
iPhone or Samsung s3 then you should
definitely check out case machine calm
they have a bunch of cool designs that
will surely grab your attention so that
wraps up the video if you guys had an
iphone is this something you guys might
install on your phone let me know in the
comments down below I do have a bunch of
cool videos coming up with you guys so
