what's up guys it's a from Texas and I'm
back again from the msi booth here at
CES but this time we're gonna be taking
a look at a few of the new desktops that
are launching this year with Intel's
newest 7 gen processors now I'm going to
start to introduce - the most powerful
MSI gaming desktop PC and it's called
the ages ti3 and also it's the most
powerful in the MSI desktop so you can
see right here we're not just refreshed
about our ID we also have a lot of the
upgrade any like multiple and other
designs so the first one you can see
right here now we got more colorful
about the mystic line and also we put
some mystical eye on the VGA card side
so you can see right here it would be
more colorful so we use the PCIe
transform card to let the VGA card
become the vertical so it won't cause we
can avoid the VGA card weight and the
gravity to cause damage on motherboards
paint all of our MSI gaming desktop
we're going to use is going to use the
MSI gaming vga card and also we have the
passage step that you can hang your hair
like another biggest feature is the
silenced own cooling in order to make
our MSI gaming PC more more cooler more
quiet and cooler so we separate the
desktop into three chamber three
chambers yes because we need we want to
ensure that every key component in MSI
desktop would be well prepared for the
cooling all of the MSI desktop will come
with the VR link and plug in and our
software is called the gaming center it
will pop up and there's a function
called one-click to VR the one-click to
VR we're going to optimize the MSI
desktop into the best environment for VR
device
we can let the end-user easy to upgrade
their memories or even with the MW PCIe
SSD and also our H STI we're going to
have a overclocking as you know and in
cable a we're not only maintain the CPUs
24.6 we upgrade the overclocking to that
the ages ti3 can have the CPU like 4.8
we can come over for the ages x3 HS x3
will come with the z2 70 multiple ok it
will come with the vertical design so a
user won't have to worry about pending
the multiple ages actually will come
with the MSI customized water cooling
system okay good pulling we ensure that
VGA card will have its own cooling
system and also the VR link of course so
this one we also have to refresh its ID
so you can see right here
even with the Nibelung meaning we still
have to be our link and also the VGA is
come with the vertical design what our
GPU is this one running this one it
would be the 1070 yeah and the multiple
will come with the z250 let's go to
tried it right yeah
my favorite yeah my personal favorite my
personal favor as well anybody who don't
know about to try to make consider it as
a console box but it it isn't it is a
totally full system for MSI gaming
desktop
the Triton 3 is the world smallest we
are ready gaming pc trident 3 will come
with the i7 and i5 CPU of the cable a
and the graphic are going to come with
the 1066 key bye-bye we will have a 10-7
eventually like in march and also it
will come with the VR link as well
the Trident will come with the silenced
own cooling tube because we we still
will separate into two chambers and
right here it should be a bottle will be
the MSI gaming graphic card and the top
will be the CPU so that will do for us
at the msi booth here at CES as always
