Texas and welcome to episode five of
setup wars where you submit your desk
setup to get featured on my channel and
win some money now I host them every
Monday and I randomly select 5 of your
submissions and feature them on my
channel you guys get to vote on the best
desk setup
voting ends on the same week on Saturday
and I announce a winner on Sunday by
counting the total number of votes and
if you guys are new to the series and
want to submit your desk setup and you
need to watch the requirements video
linked down below but with all that said
let the set up Wars finally begin
alright so the five lucky contestants
for this week are Aaron Jessie Vittorio
David and Thomas congratulations for
making it to this week of set-up wars
let's go ahead and start off with Aaron
setup so we got a very clean very unique
setup and you know who says you have to
have a PC and a monitor to inter set up
words I didn't say that and you can have
a gaming setup and still enter that's
completely fine by me by the way I
really like how organized you are I
can't help but notice that you arranged
those items on the left side from
smallest to largest and you have no idea
how happy that makes me so thank you
very much for doing that so on the desk
you have some piggy banks a Pikachu
statue your Astro a 50s headset a ps4
while the Samsung charger and the one
and only Moto 360 I will commend you on
the Astro headphones I personally only a
40s and man they are awesome they are a
bit pricey but they are definitely worth
it I also noticed that you have LED
strips installed on the back of the desk
which you could control using the remote
and on a wall you mounted a samsung
65-inch 1080p smart TV that is
definitely a monster TV size cable
management is also really great you did
a good job hiding this stuff in the back
of the desk or the stand or whatever
that is but one thing I would recommend
is perhaps skinning your ps4 to make it
stand out even more kind of like what I
did with mine but I will leave a link to
a place where you can get some down
below but yeah mine really simple and
clean desk setup
Thank You Erin for entering setup wars
next up we got Jessie and it looks like
we have a gaming setup with an asus rog
swift 27-inch gaming monitor a courser
k70 keyboard m40 raptor mouse on a
coarser extended mousepad finally
someone with a k70 keyboard and an m40
mouse actually have the same keyboard
and mouse for my other set up so there's
only solid choices on a gaming gear you
also have some core set of speakers and
I also see the sign Heiser 350 se
headphones and a monster and pulse DJ
headphones all the way on the right side
next to your PC case I gotta say that is
a very unique head
anger you have over there from Omega I'm
actually going to pick one up for my
desk I'm actually tired of leaving mine
50s on the desk and I really think that
this hanger will add a nice touch see
I'm actually getting ideas from these
setups as well it's not only you guys
the only thing that bothers me is the
fact that a mouse and keyboard are way
too close to the edge of the table I
think will be more comfortable towards
the monitor but if that's what you are
used to and it works for you then by all
means no big deal I also notice you have
a custom named coke bottle and really
great job on your cable management your
PC also looks stunning you're rocking
the white 540 case with dual nine 80s
and an i7 4790k processor I will leave
links to the full PC specs and parts
down below as well if you guys want to
check it out if I have to choose on my
second favorite color combo besides
black and red it would definitely have
to be white and red so good job Jesse on
that stunning PC and thank you for
entering setup wars next up is Vittorio
and it looks like we have a triple LG
monitor setup on the table we have an
alienware attack text keyboard with a
rat 9 mouse and a SteelSeries mouse pad
on the sides you have the Harman Kardon
speakers and it looks like you also have
some LEDs hooked up in their back we
have a lot of LEDs in these setup videos
but that's not a bad thing I mean who
doesn't like LEDs right you also have a
pair of Beats Studio headphones and a
really good looking chair if I can find
out the model of that I'll definitely
have it linked below but I have nothing
bad to say it's a simple and clean setup
really great job on the cable management
and you have a really cool Alienware PC
as well so thank you Victoria for
submitting your desk setup next up we
have David and it looks like we have a
29 inch LG ultra white monitor Razer
BlackWidow Ultimate keyboard and MX
Mouse with an extended mouse pad from
perixx here's the thing about your setup
you don't have much space to work with
since you decided to put your PC on a
table and I'm glad you got an extend the
mouse pad to clean things up but I do
recommend getting a headphone stand that
attaches to the side of the desk that
way your headphones aren't just sitting
there actually I mention a pretty cool
headphone hanger that I did for the cool
tech video for June a few weeks ago and
I'll leave a link to that video down
below if you want to check that out but
I think you'll really clean up your desk
space
then had a really nice look to it
overall no cables underneath and you
have a pretty awesome PC as well you got
the core i5 3470 with a single GTX 780
and as always I'll leave a link to the
full parts below but yeah David add that
headphone hangar and you will have a
really awesome compact desk so thank you
for submitting your desk setup last but
not least we have Thomas and it looks
like we have a bunch of stuff on your
desk now here's the thing I have no
problems whatsoever with a bunch of
stuff on your desk as long as you have
the space for it this desk has more than
a few items that I would like to see for
example the Xbox controller the Nintendo
DS and that NES controller looking thing
if those are removed I think that the
desk will look a lot cleaner by the way
a point for T Microsoft so you have the
Dell 24-inch monitor and alienware
keyboard a rad7 mouse and the air force
x12 headphones you also have the Samson
meteor microphone for voice overs for
your YouTube channel I'm guessing and a
pair of creative t12 speakers I really
like the lava lamp you have on the desk
I think that add some spice to your
setup although I'm not quite sure what
that glass thing is right next to it you
didn't really explain it in a note but
anyways moving on I will give you credit
for the PC case I love and win simply
because they have the most unique cases
in the world
I mean you did go with a more
traditional square chassis design but
the fact that it's from anyone really
makes me appreciate it that much more
your packing an i7 4790k processor with
a gtx 970 along with the rest of the
specs link below now the cable
management is not too bad but given that
the case design there's really not much
you can do in the first place I do want
to recommend two things for your setup
to clean it up a bit first up is the
headphone hanger that I mentioned
earlier in the video I think that'll
definitely contribute to a cleaner desk
and the second thing is a suspension arm
for the mic not only will it give you
tons of more space to work with but it
will also be more convenient to do
recordings it's actually a funny story
how I came across that extension arm
actually my last episode of setup wars
someone was using that for that desk
setup so I immediately picked one up and
if you guys are following me on
Instagram then you already know I've
been using it
past week and it makes the world of a
difference coming from a basic stand on
a table so I'll go to leave a link to
that down below in the products
recommended section so it's easier for
you to find it but yeah once you clean
up some of the stuff on the desk it
would look a lot better but overall
wooly sweet setup you got there Thank
You Thomas for entering setup words so
that's it for this week's episode of
setup wars voting begins now so make
