part two of these venom gaming room
projects which is a series a part of my
setup makeover episode one we're
focusing on building Harry's PC which by
the way it looks really awesome it's
secured it's complete it's in the car
ready to go this episode we're gonna be
focusing on taking the stuff to Harry's
house and give his room a complete
makeover
what do you venom spice to it also guys
Harry does not know that I'm actually
doing this it's gonna be a surprise to
him I lied to him over the phone when I
told them I'm gonna be going over to his
house and shoot my new series that I'm
starting on the channel where I
basically go into people's houses and
give tips on how they can improve their
setup he has no idea that we're gonna be
giving him a complete venom makeover for
his setup and his room so I'm actually
really excited I'm a little nervous but
mostly excited I hope everything goes
according to plan and most importantly I
hope he really likes his new setup all
right so the desk wouldn't be using is
actually this it's from Rosie it's an
all black gaming desk this actor is
gonna fit this team really nicely but I
think it's actually it's also the
biggest thing obviously going to be
taking with us but oh Jesus yeah it's
too heavy I don't know if I can do this
by myself I might I might need your help
on this one
actually no what let me try I can do it
let's do it
you gotta try this at home
look at that perfect alright now for the
monitors obviously you guys can tell
we're doing a triple monitor setup I
actually took it out of the box and set
it up here because if I were being all
three boxes there was no way I would
have space inside the car so I took them
out just as make some space
alright guys that's pretty much
everything I was actually surprised I
was able to fit everything in one car
but yeah now it's time to make the trip
down to North Hollywood where Harry
lives and Surprise them on an awesome
venom themed gaming setup I do this
hey what's up dude one time no see so
Harry thanks again for taking some time
off your work to come here and you have
to leave a few hours early but you
pretty much already have an idea why I'm
here
right it's a new show I'm starting where
I go over to people's houses and I give
them tips well first off the dredgers
set up and then I give them tips on how
they can improve their setup and Harry's
kind of the guinea pig or the first
person the show obviously if the show is
successful it depending on you guys I'll
continue it but yeah with that said I
heard I think it's time for these take
us to your room sounds good
let's go here's my room here's my setup
all right I'm actually I'm digging the
the altar in sting wallpapers all right
okay this is actually not a bad setup
did rocking to 1080p my I'm against this
is 1080p oh that was older so I don't
think that's about like five years old
but this is no that's personal oh no
it's a 1440 by 900 ladies and gentlemen
not by at least you got a dual monitor
setup here now obviously I'm not gonna
get too much into cable management it's
a disaster in its own I don't think Lee
wires but honestly I would say this is a
clean set up you put together you kept
it very clean there's no like crap or
dirt or anything on the desk so except
for like milk stains from my cereal milk
stains so Harry tell me a little bit
about what you use your setup for
obviously aside from the usual gaming
well yeah gaming I do and then I use it
for work to like auto cad rhino and
whatnot what do you do what are you
doing um okay uh well I am an architect
and I work as a at an engineering
company currently so a lot of like
planned sections details
a lot of stuff and there's if there's
one thing about this setup that you
would upgrade what would it be one piece
I kind of had idea what it is - fine but
we'll stick what this I knew was gonna
be monitor so that's it let's put that
aside obviously what else what else
would it be probably the keyboard yeah
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
as far as like the spacebar will not and
it's what weeks sometimes so yeah dude I
mean overall I got no complaints
obviously there's some things that can
be improved or upgraded how's the PC DOS
take a look at this beast I know you did
I know you sent me over to spec list
it's rockin a 4790k and you also got the
gtx 980ti
which is actually pretty good for 1080
gaming has a PC giving you any issues
like in terms of lagging or stuttering
or anything like that for the most part
not really but yeah so occasionally it
does but overall like 95% of the time
it's pretty good and there's a huge
explosions and games and stuff sometimes
it kind of drops their frames a little
bit but what came what games do you play
usually well right now it's mostly
fortnightly if there's something you
would upgrade for your p on your PC what
would it be
with one main component um well probably
graphics card I would say I did so I
told you about my new series obviously
how come here give you tips on how
clearly you need a lot of tips - okay
just set up but the real reason I'm here
is actually I'm gonna completely redo
your setup what I'm gonna completely
give you a brand new setup that is why
I'm here I'm gonna give you a venom
themed setup from scratch and a new PC
get bad guys I hope you can say whatever
I'm gonna blur it I'm gonna blurt if you
curse but yeah you can no but see I got
all the stuff in the car ready go it's
kind of a surprise oh when I come here
and that's why the whole show I was
talking about was BS
well obvious that misty too but yeah
dude everything here you see is
literally gonna be gone desk monitors PC
everything's gonna be souped up so and
you're not gonna see it until obviously
it's all complete thank you well don't
think yeah we'll see we'll see if you
like the setup or not all right let's do
it so trying to just remove all this so
you got your monitor upgrade you can
just over here look okay imagine ya get
the text source experience when it comes
to Kayla man right you just got to keep
it clean once once everything's on one
of these all rights now
alright guys so after two full hard days
the setup is finally complete it is such
a badass setup I'm very envious honestly
I'm not even kidding
I'm jealous I've created a setup that's
better than mine back at home I don't
know why I keep doing this to myself but
yeah everything is just it's beautiful
but more importantly I want to know what
Harry thinks about his setup he hasn't
seen anything he hasn't been in his room
for two days while I was building it for
him so I'm gonna grab a little quick and
see what he thinks
yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
