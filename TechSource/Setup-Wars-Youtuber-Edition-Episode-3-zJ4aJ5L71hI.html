influence on you by hey guys Jacqueline
here from nothing but tech and this is
my setup my setup is primarily made from
to Ikea desk which blends seamlessly
into each other starting off on the left
side I use this desk for written work
and shooting b-roll footage since this
is primarily where I shoot b-roll shots
I picked up a salt lamp to add to the
b-roll footage and the overall look of
my setup before I move on I also want to
note the LEDs behind my desk because I
feel like they also enhance b-roll
continuing underneath the desk it's a
main storage area for my office I have
two open storage cabinets and IKEA Alex
your unit which holds products and boxes
along with cables and many other pieces
of cat moving on to the main desk this
house is all the major items on my set
up on the left side I have a Canova
slider alongside the Lenovo yoga 900
right next to that I have an external
hard drive which sis next to my main
editing computer a late 2014 5 K iMac
the specs are on screen now and even
without upgraded graphics it runs
extremely smooth underneath the Mac I
have a full-length Apple keyboard a lot
of track performance MX mouse and an
apple trackpad which are all items that
I use on a daily basis so that was my
setup if you guys liked the video be
sure to check out my channel using the
links below and thank you guys all for
watching hey what's going on guys Jake
here Ian I make technology videos over
on my channel which you can find a link
down below or I get started I want to go
ahead give ed a big thanks for letting
us show our setups over on his channel
other than that I don't got anything
else so let's go ahead and jump right
into it and I'll show you guys my setup
so the desk that I'm using is the lemon
from Ikea it is the smallest option for
this but I find it to increase my
productivity since everything is right
norms length and I need it I also have
the Signum from Ikea which is great for
organizing all my cables as for the
computer or computers I use first off is
the 21 and a half inch iMac and it's the
baseline model I mainly use it for
editing video in Final Cut Pro 10 and
photos in Photoshop and Lightroom when
I'm away from my desk
I used my 13 inch MacBook Pro I
absolutely love this computer and I find
myself using it more often than my iMac
when it comes to my peripherals I'm
using the Apple wireless keyboard
alongside the keyboard is my Logitech MX
performance Mouse I have nothing but
great things to say about this mouse the
speakers I use are from
acoustics they are anything great but
they work just fine for me whenever I'm
editing videos the headphones that I use
to monitor my audio are the audio
technica ath and 50s and to make my
voiceovers I use the blue Yeti my phone
of choice is the iPhone 6s plus there's
much less I hear other than its a solid
smart phone whenever I finish a video I
like to sit back and play some
PlayStation 4 i play on my 42 inch
Samsung Smart TV which is only 1080p but
it looks great still and the camera I
use to make my videos is the Canon 70d
so that has been my setup I hope you
guys enjoyed it and I want to take this
time to thank ed once again thanks for
watching and I'll catch you all over on
my channel what's up YouTube Jerry Layne
here with nobu tech and this is my setup
for 2016 Brennan's show behind me is my
late 2013 27-inch iMac as for my
peripherals I'm rocking a Logitech MX
master and an apple magic keyboard on
either side of my iMac my ears are
pampered with my yamaha HS 5s sitting on
top of the iso acoustic stands sitting
on the left side of my desk you'll see
my voice over microphone of choice the
blackout edition of the blue Yeti and on
the other side of my desk is my half
acoustic half electric ukulele so on top
of my desk as well as beside it I have a
couple lamps from the renard series at
IKEA now it's powering those lamps is
what's important I got to be our thirty
lifx bulbs in them and I couldn't be
happier with these finally my desktop is
actually a kitchen countertop from Ikea
called the Carl B and it's resting on
top of two IKEA
Alex drawers knives for these two Edison
bulb pendant lamps these are the newest
addition to my setup and if you want to
