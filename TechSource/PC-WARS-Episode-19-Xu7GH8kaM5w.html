always your five contestants for this
week are alessandro danielle evan jan
and mark congratulations for making it
on the show starting off the show we
have a very sick pc desk build by
Alessandro he is calling it the help hit
and it features two separate rigs a
gaming PC and a server pc so the gaming
pc has a 6700 K and a single EVGA GTX
1084 the wind graphics card while the
server build has a 47 70 and no GPU
there's also tons of storage as you can
see we have 10 terabyte of space for
each rig this would also be a perfect
streaming setup if you decide to convert
the second PC into an actual streaming
PC excellent work with the cable
management as well not only do you have
some sweet rigs but you also have a
pretty dope setup as well the benchmarks
we got a score of 17,000 658 starting
things off strong Thank You Alessandra
for entering Daniel is next up with
Winterfell a gorgeous white and black
build featuring the NZXT h4 40 case
inside here we have another 6700 K and
an asus strix gtx 1070 we also have a
pretty cool game of thrones decal in
front of the case i do like the fact
that you went with custom sleeping for
the motherboard 24 pin but why didn't
you replace the graphics card PCI cables
2 benchmarks we got a score of 14,000
722 taking second place for this episode
Thank You Danielle for entering Evan is
next up with a sick black and red build
inside one of my all-time favorite cases
from n win vs frame in here we have the
5820k and not one or two
three titan exes in sli god damn such a
great job with cable management and
maintaining consistency with the color
scheme
I also liked a really cool spiral effect
for the liquid in both of the reservoirs
I mean even the RAM sticks are
water-cooled this is nothing short of
amazing for benchmarks and scored a
twenty three thousand thirty one pushing
off alessandro and taking first place
for this episode a very gorgeous build
no doubt Thank You eben for entering
changing things up we have Jan and this
amazing white and blue pc build that is
calling blue dragon in this beast we
have a 6700 K 32 gigs of Dominator
Platinum's and two EVGA GTX 1080s
with the EVGA sli bridge I definitely
liked what you did on the bottom the
plexi plates have this cool design that
make them seem like it's cracked and
then below that we have a few props with
a rock holding one of the swords from
Game of Thrones other mods include some
custom painted fans laser-cut dragon
logo in the front and the amazing custom
sleeving
for benchmarks we've got a score of
20,000 574 barely getting beat by evans
pc and taking second place for this
episode but a very sexy white and build
no doubt Thank You Jan for entering
changing up the game we have something
entirely different from Mark now he's
calling it Zeus and it's pretty much a
$50 gaming PC with a custom modded case
it has the venom 2x4 940 T processor 8
gigs of ram and an XFX r7 265 needless
to say the benchmarks aren't impressive
but what's impressive is a performance
per dollar this thing can get you above
60fps and medium to high settings in
most games according to the benchmarks
now obviously these are all used parts
that he got on a bargain because it's
physically impossible to build a gaming
PC for 50 bucks
using new parts but nonetheless this is
a very interesting bill - thank you Mark
