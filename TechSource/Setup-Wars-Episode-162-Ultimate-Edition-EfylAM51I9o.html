welcome to the ultimate edition of setup
wars where we take a look at the past 10
epic setups that you guys probably
missed and then we're going to crown one
of them the winner and that person takes
home a beautiful custom-made plaque that
they can showcase next to their setup if
you guys like the idea make sure to drop
a like and also let me know in the
comment section what theme I should
focus on next either budget laptop
minimalistic or teen setups those are
your four choices and what that said let
the setup wars begin the red devil 8
gigabyte graphics card is power colors
premium series featuring very efficient
power delivery and VRMs for maximum
clocks and power efficiency it comes
with two modes overclock and silent
making it suitable for those who want to
push the limits with overclock or have
the most quiet card it's perfect for
1080p gaming and right now my
subscribers can get $25 off using the
code on the screen dropping the price to
only 180 $4.99 and on top of that you
get to select any of these two titles
which alone cost $99 make sure to click
the link below and use the code to get
this limited time offer kicking off the
episodes angel from episode 142 and is
insane a triple monitor gaming setup
that's powered by two gtx 1070 s and sli
i do like how personal the setup is he
isn't afraid to slap some posters in the
wall and change up the wallpapers and
lighting across his setup depending on
his mood cable management isn't the
strongest suit of this setup but it does
have personality and purpose it's always
been a pleasure watching the rog
brothers improve their setup every year
but their last submission from episode
144 had a huge improvement we got
upgraded custom pcs walking 1080p is
powering the rog ultra rides but the
most impressive thing about these setups
aren't the actual gear but the custom
work and done to the room itself you
have a massive LED overwatch logo on the
wall and there's even an RG logo on the
ceiling which can change colors and
topping it all off with a custom made
desk that was built to support both
setups lots of careful planning and hard
work went into creating this gaming room
and it's definitely one of the most
unique setups I have seen on the show
Henry from episode 146 had a really
clean gaming setup we got triple
monitors mounted on the beautiful karlie
countertop from Ikea and I really liked
how he kept the color scheme consistent
throughout the setup by using V brand
skins and custom sleeve cables inside
his PC we have the mic properly mounted
on a boom arm behind the monitors and
cables neatly managed a very organized
gaming setup by Henry from Finland David
not only had the best setup from episode
151 but he also took home the 15th seal
of approval with this awesome gaming
room I mean sure the setup was that
baked with quad displays wall mounted
speakers in the special spot in the wall
just for his PC but the real excitement
was actually behind this setup
he built a dedicated place just for VR
not only that but is designed for
friction-free gameplay using ceiling
mounts and pulleys well worthy of a seal
of approval and still one of my favorite
setups to date who can forget about
pirates epic man cave from episode 152
lots and lots of expensive collectibles
in here and I think we counted what like
four or five ps4s in this entire room
his console setup alone has two of them
and then we got two X boxes on the
opposite shelf black and red are
obviously his favorite colors and we
can't ignore the beautiful cable
management on his main setup he's got
tons of tech to connect and he took the
extra time to tidy everything even
though it's behind a backboard so you
can't even see it that episode was
definitely worth a watch if you guys
missed it because there's way more to
show off in this battle station speaking
of black and red setups Emel took the
win from episode 153 with this beautiful
dual purpose custom-made setup
absolutely love the color contrast that
he kept consistent throughout the setup
and I love that backboard he built to
mount everything against including his
PC so the main setup with the ultra
light is actually used for productivity
while the other setup is used for gaming
and both of the monitors are hooked up
to the same PC excellent cable
management and attention to detail
definitely a setup that deserves to be
in the ultimate edition Colin's setup
from episode 156 almost took home
another seal of approval
if it weren't for some interesting
choices but it's not a big deal
considering he already owns a seal of
approval from his previous set up he did
make some enormous changes coming from
episode 56 he added an ultra-wide in the
center and a massive 50-inch TV up top
as an overhead cables are beautifully
hidden using wall raceways and he used
the same material for the front panel of
the pc and his drawers to stay
consistent with the wooden tabletop
excellent work my favorite setup even
till today belongs to FC from episode
141 and truly the most epic setup i've
seen on the show and I don't think there
was anyone out there that could top this
the attention of the ETL alone was
enough to award him the 14th seal of
approval but the reason why this is my
favourite set up is because of how
unique it is
we got a massive desk that was
custom-made for cable management we got
LED lighting in all the right places a
drop-down project there that comes out
of a slit in the ceiling are you kidding
me and a dedicated spot on the wall for
his PC if I can give this guy two seals
of approvals I would outstanding work by
my dude epsy I think we can all agree
that Christians setup from episode 159
gave us all boners his insane luxurious
mancave shows us what you can do with
just over $100,000 two setups powered by
one overkill gaming PC rocking for Titan
XPS and an 18 core 79 80 XC which was
deleted and on the other side we got his
ridiculous Apple powered productivity
setup it's got all the high-end specs
that you can currently buy in the market
including a 5 K Dell monitor a 10 core
iMac with the new i9 MacBook Pro don't
even get me started on his pair of Nike
mags which are apparently going for
around $40,000 I don't even know if
that's accurate you know what that stuff
isn't even the most impressive part of
this mancave my personal favorite is the
home theater setup that he has on the
other side with a 125 inch projector
that he uses for console gaming
definitely give that episode of watch if
you want to see the rest of this insane
mancave wrapping up the Ultimate Edition
is Nate and his set up from episode 161
so he called this setup circuit breaker
since he blew the circuit three times
with this
set up one of the few gripes I had with
a setup with a desk switch I feel took
away from the overall aesthetics and the
specs of the PCs which didn't make a lot
of sense based on their purpose but
other than that it's an epic setup
anyways that definitely belongs in this
episode and that's it for the ultimate
edition of setup wars as always make
sure you guys vote in the comments
section and who has the best desk setup
because that person is gonna take home a
custom-made plaque
I lost the winner on a Twitter account
if you guys enjoy this and want to see
more of it on the channel make sure to
drop a like I love your faces and I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
