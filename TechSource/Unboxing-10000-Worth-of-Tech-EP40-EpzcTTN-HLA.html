episode of what's in the box these
intros are getting cornea and cornea but
anyways welcome back to another episode
and you want to get huge thanks to
everybody who smacked the crap out of
that like button on the last video we
had over 10,000 freaking likes you guys
are insane so greatly appreciate your
faces oh yeah what that said let's just
dive right in and unbox some stuff shall
we we have an exciting show for you guys
today some awesome stuff coming in
alright so first thing we've got is you
got the MP 300 from Corsair this is a
four hundred eighty gigabyte m2 SSD
which is going in a build I'm not I'm
not exactly sure which bill moving on to
the envelopes ah this is actually a
personal purchase not gonna explain this
these are basically temporary body
tattoos that girls put on their body for
raves and festivals and stuff like that
so we're gonna be going to EDC very
excited for that and possibly ultra
Miami so this is not mine by the way I
promise you well no it's not mine this
is coming from steel supplements
supplements and they're not order any
supplements
okay looks like you have a shirt oh we
have some dope shades that's that's
pretty though okay I like that
and we've got some some stuff some
supplements
this one's from steel hard AF wait what
are these are you the largeman pills oh
that smells really bad this was a
pre-workout kind of powder thing you got
shredded af which is fat loss gives you
energy and then you got heart AF these
are penis enlargement pills it says it
right on there erection formula who sent
this to me it just says steel
supplements I guess that I found on the
show thank you guys so much for sending
these in how did you know I need these
let's take a look at the shirt over here
oh it's a tank top definitely not on
drugs how appropriate okay I just
realized you know this is probably a
really good rave shirt those waivers out
there probably get the joke behind this
but I might even wear this for EDC who
knows and these glasses I don't know
about those pills though but yeah thank
you guys for sending this in I guess low
key on my try a few nice tonight just
just to see if it works you know why not
why not experiment I mean they sent over
they sent over free samples cut this
part of the video by the way moving
right along we have something from
somewhere okay
that was helpful
I've actually seen this as CES guys
these are white sleeved accessory cables
for building a PC we got USB 3 USB 2 and
even the front panel connectors over
here I promise you guys an all-white
build and that is going inside that oh
we are zooming through this episode
pretty quickly this isn't necessarily
tech but I were to some shoes Oh
let's check this oh oh you look so damn
cool
so these are the Anita's honestly I
don't even what they're called I saw him
at the store they look dope AF and I
know I had to have them so I placed an
order
honestly the main reason why I bought
these other than the looks is because
I'm looking for comfortable shoes and
when I try these on I said I was walking
on air solid purchase for sure okay I
actually requested this from courser how
nice of them to send it over so this is
the corsair k70 RGB mk2 se rapid-fire
keyboard with Cherry MX switches as he
stands for a special edition by the way
if you guys remember in my last setup
video I did on the channel I was
actually using a special edition white
keyboard from Corsair but the problem
with that one is it doesn't have a wrist
rest and that really bothers the crap
outta me and this is why I requested the
k7 the se instead oh my gosh keyboard
looks way nicer - Cherry MX Reds music
to my eyes what music to my ears is what
I meant to say but it's such a nice
looking keyboard I wish the frame and
the wrist rest was also white but I'm
excited to put this and my setup and
take it for a test drive I also love the
fact that they stuck with the dedicated
multimedia buttons and the volume knob
so yeah Thank You corset for sending us
over so these two boxes came in together
Oh behold ladies and gentlemen I cover
this in CS of this year I think this is
their new Graham laptop the 17 inch this
thing is so massive and so light at the
same time look at the screen size on
this you guys and how thin the bezels
are all right so while the laptop is
charging let's open up the second one
which I'm also swimming is another
laptop yes indeed so this is their 14
inch gram laptop and I'm actually going
to be doing a review on both of these
and comparing the two in an upcoming
video so this is the 14 inch gram laptop
it's got the i7 8th gen processor 16
gigs of ram and 512 gigabytes of space
on an SSD the cool thing about the 17
inch LG gram is that it comes in a 15
inch laptop body however you get a
massive 17 inch IPS screen you also get
a higher resolution up from 1080p to
2560 by 1600 on an IPS screen it's not
touchscreen but they did increase the
aspect ratio as well so from 21 by 9 to
21 by 10 which kind of gives you more
vertical real estate so I just realized
there were like four other boxes in the
corner over there so this video might be
a little longer than you're used to so I
apologize to those people who perform
idios
all right this is mcourser see what they
sent me oh my goodness okay yes yes more
parts for big red
yes so gonna be throwing in an extra 960
gigabyte em that to SSD we've got the MP
510 we also got the Vengeance RGB pro
wrap sticks right now big red has 32
gigs of ram we're gonna bump that up to
64 gigs at 3600 megahertz
beautiful last but not least we have the
nx500 this is a 400 gigabyte nvme PCIe
SSD which is also going in big red the
only thing is I'm gonna be coloring this
white so it matches the color scheme so
yeah very very stoked I think is the
next biggest box check this one out
I wish this arrived before the frosty
build a lot of you guys have been saying
in the comment section
but that build was unfortunately
finished before this was even announced
at CES so this year ladies and gentlemen
is the H 100 i RGB platinum se is an
all-white AIO
from coarser they also threw in a
commander Pro which is going in big red
and this is actually gonna be going in
the old white build that I'm planning on
inside the 460 X RGB case from coarser
which is sitting right over there I'm
starting to think all the blue tape is
from Corsair okay nothing exciting just
the power supply from coarser the ax 850
this is going in the old white build am
either gonna skin this or paint in white
so it matches the theme I haven't quite
decided yet three more boxes to go let's
do this I wonder if my water cooling
parts came in today
Oh
oh I looks nice we got some green boxes
over here we got some beautiful razor
gear the Black Widow elite mechanical
keyboard
we got the Mamba Elite RGB mouse and the
Goliath extended chroma RGB mouse pad I
won't open this one up actually real
quick razor green switches all the
packaging on this is insane I think this
is actually the first ever razor
keyboard I've been boxed on the channel
oh this is a really nice looking
keyboard the wrist strap is magnetic
okay
volume knob up here got some dedicated
multimedia buttons and the keys very
satisfying so the reason why Razer is
sending me these parts is because I'm
gonna be building an epic gaming setup
from scratch something very similar to
like the Wolverine setup you guys have
seen or maybe the cell setup so yeah
they're sending me these parts I'm gonna
be building inside the Lindley razor
case it's gonna be water-cooled it's
gonna be epic that's all I can tell you
guys for now I'm actually expecting a
few more things from razor which maybe
I'll unbox in the next episode we'll see
alright guys two more boxes we have this
massive one from Asus I always love
getting boxes or Macy's I don't know why
I just get I can't like wipe the smile
off my face so we got a few things for
my soos first up is the ROG Strix Z 390
eye gaming motherboard oh this thing is
heavy
oh my lord the rog zenith extreme alpha
oh my god this thing is a beast if you
guys remember the year 1950 xin boxed in
the last episode well that is going in
this bad boy over here it's gonna be the
water-cooled PC inside the Ennio case oh
my god is gonna be epic
it's gonna be epic last but not least we
can't end the video without at least one
GPU in boxing so they so many our
districts are TX 2080 TI which is also
going inside that massive water-cooled
build last but not least and I think I
know what this is oh yeah this is it
guys this right here is the MVP box I
sure hope you stop stabbing the boxes
IKEA Waits
I cannot wait yes yes yes yes yes hahaha
alright there's a lot of stuff in here
so I'm just gonna take everything out of
the box and I'll see you guys in a sec
so we have majority of the water cooling
parts from ek that are going inside the
rebuild of big red we got the new ek
vector RT X xx atti RGB blocks for the
GPUs we have some radiators I'm not sure
exactly which one I'm gonna be using
just yet for the case we do have a mono
block this time around for the asus
rampage
6 extreme motherboard and some other
stuff like the white fittings to match
the color scheme we got some PPG tubing
of course is gonna be hardline you guys
know that and even some back plates for
the GPU topping it up with solid scarlet
red coolant my current PC it's kind of a
letdown as so many things that went
wrong with it and I rushed it out so
it's not really representation of what I
can do I talk so much about being a
perfectionist and it doesn't show in
that last build guys so that's why I'm
redoing this to kind of just redeem
myself and my reputation that's one of
the reasons why I'm doing it but anyways
I promise you guys it's gonna be awesome
it's gonna be the best build on the
channel to date and I wraps up this
unboxing episode hope you guys enjoyed
it dropping a like or let me know to
continue to do these on the channel as
always I'll drop a link to all the parts
and boxed down below in case you guys
want to check it out
consider subscribing because I have some
epic content planned for you guys
especially some awesome PC builds coming
up I love your faces and I will see you
in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
