guys can probably already tell I love
building and modding pcs to me it's a
form of art I have to have all my bills
matching in the most important component
that any bills are the cables which a
lot of people disregard this is why I
went with Kail mod not only do they
offer full power supply cables and
extensions which you can also customize
each one of the cables to your liking
simply pick the type of cable you want
the power supply that you are using and
the model then you have the option of
selecting the cables and the sizes that
you need and the final page will give
you options and selecting the colors and
the color pattern the customization is
seriously next-level they even have
custom sleeved power and Ethernet cables
I mean that's pretty crazy so if you're
building your next PC or maybe you're
stuck with the same stock PSU cables
then you guys should definitely check
out cable mod I'll drop a link to them
down below now then let's take a closer
look at titania a 6900 k-8 core
processor that's overclocked to 4.3
gigahertz 64 gigs of RAM from a fixer
running at 26 66 megahertz and not one
but two nvidia gtx titan axes in sli
overkill would be an understatement
even the motherboard is unnecessary I'm
using the asus rampage 5 edition 10
that's packed with all the bells and
whistles you would expect from any
single motherboard the corsair HX 1000 i
is powering this entire build and
everything is packed inside the new deep
cool Janome rog edition mid tower
chassis it comes with it's very own 360
millimetre CPU cooler which happens to
be RGB as well in fact you get a remote
which lets you change the colors of the
front reservoir the water blocks and
wedi scripts and even ROG logo near the
bottom the front reservoir really
doesn't do anything and if lean purpose
is for purely aesthetics but the beep
cool did leave some extra space near the
back for those who want a custom loot
solution it can fit up to a 240
millimeter radiator speaking of
aesthetics I picked up two custom GPU
back plates from v1 txt to spice up the
build I'm sure you guys I've heard of
them at this point because I use them
pretty much in all of my ultimate bills
they just do some really amazing work on
their back plates so if you guys want to
pimp your PC make sure to check them out
you one tech or click on the link below
so in my build I decided to go with the
traditional horizontal orientation for
the graphics cards since I was going SLI
but for anyone that is going with a
single GPU you would be pleased to find
out that they offer a vertical
orientation as well with the included
PCI extension cable as far as storage is
concerned you do have space for two hard
drives and two SSDs but since this is a
temporary monthly PC builds on a channel
I decided to go with just two 480
gigabyte SSD from Kingston obviously in
raid 0 now this is for my own personal
rig I would obviously put in an MDOT 2
and maybe a few hard drives I also love
how easy cable management was there was
plenty of space between the power supply
and hard drive cage to store some access
cables in I just feel like people really
put some thought into the Janome series
when it comes to cable management and
finally for connectivity we have two USB
3.0 ports in the front along with the
usual audio jacks overall I'm very
satisfied with the case in fact I might
take apart this build and put together a
nice black and red version of this just
for me to use as my main PC alright so
how the hell does this PC perform well
happy to announce that this will run
minesweeper over 60fps all jokes aside
let's talk overclocking first so I
pushed the 16 100k to 4.3 gigahertz at
1.30 5 volts and things got pretty
heated idle temps around 34 degrees
while on full load they jump to 85
degrees and at first I thought I might
have messed up on the thermal paste so
why we applied them just to be on the
safe side and nope still the same it's a
bit on the hot side but the PC is stable
after a 12 hour prime95 benchmark so
yeah I'm just going to leave it here
I also overclock both of my Titan X's
and I was surprised I was able to push
them this far an extra 200 megahertz on
the core clock and 400 megahertz on the
memory which gave a nice boost in
performance there was also a nice boost
and fan noise and temperatures of course
the top GPU seeing temps of up to 90
degrees during full load while the
bottom GPU is a few degrees cooler
editing a video was extremely fast using
the same template I use for all my other
editing tests titania managed to shred
through a 30 second 4k video file in
just over 2 minutes tops
and just for reference you guys
compared to my other bills not even
though there are old budget bills it's
still better than nothing I suppose
as expected the PC blew the fire strike
benchmark straight out of water and it
pretty much scored in the one percentile
of all the PCs I mean seriously what did
you expect so with all that
jibber-jabber aside let's take a look at
the gaming benchmarks not all of these
are done in 4k resolution let's take a
look
so yeah how much else to say I feel like
the build speaks for itself it's
overkill and it will pretty much
dominate any game you throw at it in 4k
settings max out I don't really use the
word future-proof a lot since there are
always new parts coming out but you know
what this build will definitely last you
at least 5 years I mean unless they
start making games in HK resolutions and
yeah as always if you guys enjoy my
monthly PC bills make sure to leave a
huge like as it does up the channel
outtakes ton and you guys can check out
all the parts links down below thank you
guys so much for watching I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
