s6 edge have been officially announced
at mwc this year what's up guys it's at
from Texas and in this video I'm going
to be comparing the specs and features
of both phones alright so first let's
talk about price and availability the m9
is expected to launch sometime in March
for around a full retail price of 649
and it will be available in these
following carriers and retail stores
also HTC com will sell an unlocked
version the m9 will also be available in
the following color combinations now the
s6 and s6 edge will be available in
April 10 globally with a few colors to
choose from as well however the blue
topaz will only be available for the s6
and the green emerald will only be
available exclusively for the s6 edge
the price hasn't been announced yet for
either phone but I believe it will land
anywhere from six to eight hundred with
the s6 edge costing slightly more it
also be available in these retail stores
and carriers right now let's talk about
specs both phones are very similar in
height and width however the m9 weighs
more due to its full aluminum body not
only is that six slider but it's also
much thinner than the m9 measuring at
six point eight millimeters for its
thickness the HTC One m9 sports a 1080p
super lcd3 5-inch screen with a pixel
per inch count of 441 whereas the s6 and
edge sport a 1440 x 2560 5.1 inch Super
AMOLED screen with a pixel per inch
count of 577 software-wise the m9 is
running HTC Sense UI 7 point oh while
the galaxy s6 6 to their lag I mean
TouchWiz and to be fair Samsung actually
announced that the UI is forty percent
lighter than before so i'll definitely
be testing that out when i get my hands
on one both phones start at 32 gigabytes
of internal memory however you can
expand up to an additional 128 gigabyte
via SD card slot on the m9 unfortunately
the s6 and s6 edge there is no option to
expand your memory so you have to decide
on how much memory you need before
buying one just like the iphone lineup
when it comes to battery life only one
phone gets an upgrade while the other
gets a downgrade the m9 jumps up to 8 28
40 million battery up from 2600 from the
m8 and the galaxy s6 downgrades to a 25
50 million battery from 2800 last year
I'm actually really curious about the
battery performance and whether or not
this change is actually an upgrade for
the device or a downgrade but I guess
we'll find out once I get my hands on
one moving to camera specs the m9
finally gets rid of that horrendous dual
camera feature on the back and instead
replaces it with a 20 point seven
megapixel sensor with an aperture of 2.2
the galaxy s6 on the other hand sticks
to the same 16 megapixel camera but with
a much lower aperture of 1.9 giving it
much better low-light performance
samsung also stated that their camera is
a lot better this time around so I'm
really excited to test it out the front
facing cameras on both phones can shoot
in 1080p at 30fps however the m9 has a 4
megapixel sensor and the s6 has a 5
megapixel sensor both bones can also
shoot in 4k resolution and slow motion
at 120fps and here is a list of the rest
of the specs which I won't bore you guys
with you can pause the video if you want
time to read them all but for the sake
of time I will move forward now let's
talk about build quality the m9 has a
full aluminum body with rounded edges
and a rounded back just like the m8 was
however it's not as slippery thanks to
its coding and thicker sides making a
much bulkier and easier to hold on to
the s6 on the other hand has definitely
stepped up its game with a full metal
frame and Gorilla Glass for the front
and back finally giving the phone a
premium feel we have all been waiting
for unfortunately with that upgrade the
phone loses some key features that
include a removable battery and an
expandable SD card slot I personally
think that the trade-off was well worth
it one thing i don't like about s6 is
billed is the protruding camera on the
back it would have been nice to keep it
somewhat flush like the HTC One m8 then
again installing a case would eliminate
that problem the HTC One m9 finally
moved the power button back down to the
right side although much lower than its
predecessor just under the volume
buttons so there might be some adjust
to do to get used to it the speakers and
the front-facing camera are also still
in the same location as the m8 and the
same can be said about the galaxy s6
however the home button is slightly
larger with an improved fingerprint
reader instead of having all the buttons
on the right side of the phone like the
m9 does the s6 volume buttons are
located on the left side of the phone
whereas the power button and the sim
card slot are located on the right side
besides the s6 having its speaker is
located on the bottom of the phone this
time around instead of the back you can
find the usual headphone jack and micro
USB port on the bottom for both devices
anyways that wraps up the comparison
between the samsung galaxy s6 and the
HTC One m9 there will be tons more
content covering these two phones
including my famous camera test
benchmarks and speed test so make sure
you guys hit that subscribe button so
you don't miss out I also want to ask
you guys which phone do you prefer the
m9 the galaxy s6 or the s6 edge feel
free to leave your answer in the comment
section down below anyways once again
thanks for watching this is that from
Texas and I'll see you guys in the next
video
