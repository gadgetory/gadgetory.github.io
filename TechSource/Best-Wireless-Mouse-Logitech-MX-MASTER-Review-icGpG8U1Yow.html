creating amazing PC accessories in fact
their last year's MX mouse model was
very popular and became one of the best
Mouse's you can purchase for
productivity well can the same be set
with their new MX master wireless mouse
this is that from Texas and we're about
to find out all right so the MX master
wireless mouse from Logitech goes for a
hundred bucks and I will drop a link in
the description section for pricing and
availability for those of you that are
interested this is a high-end mouse
targeted not for gamers but for
day-to-day use specifically for
productivity but that doesn't mean you
can't use it for gaming as well so
inside the box you will receive a small
brochure that includes a set-up guide
and warranty info along with a micro USB
charging cable because you are paying
for a high-end mouse you do get all the
bells and whistles one of which is an
integrated rechargeable battery that
lasts up to 40 days on a single charge
and that's pretty damn impressive that's
actually a full day of use in just four
minutes of charging you can use this
mouse on your Windows or Mac computer
with the included unifying reciever
a small USB dongle that will also work
with Logitech keyboards or via Bluetooth
technology what's awesome is that you
can also hook up three devices and you
can switch between a desktop a laptop or
even a tablet using the easy switch
button located on the bottom of the
mouse you can either do this using the
same unifying receiver or via bluetooth
so the pair of the mouse all you have to
do is power the mouse on select which
channel you want to set the mouse up
with and then press connect
while the channel number light is
blinking rapidly insert the dongle in
the USB port and wait for the light to
stop blinking and you're basically set
to go the MX master can also be used on
any surface even on glass which is
pretty cool
using the mouse for a whole day I find
it very responsive and smooth not once
has it lost connection or a stutter that
combined with its ergonomic design
ensures you get work done efficiently
and comfortably the buttons on the other
hand aren't as silent as you would
expect you can definitely hear the click
every time and they are noticeably
louder than my cursor m40
Raptors although that really shouldn't
be an issue if you wear headphones in
the first place it also has a speed
adaptive scroll that lets you auto ship
from click to click or hyper fast
scrolling if you run your finger against
it really fast for those extra long
webpages that you sometimes come across
the button right above the wheel scroll
disables the click to click scroll and
enables full hyper fast scrolling
without having the need to fling the
scroll with force you also get a thumb
wheel for a side-to-side scrolling which
is awesome for video editing and then
right next to the thumb wheel are the
back and forward buttons and that is one
of the things I actually don't like
about this mouse I feel that they are
positioned uncomfortably and require a
little more effort to utilize at first I
thought I would get used to it but even
till today it just doesn't feel natural
using them if Logitech would have
swapped the thumb wheel and the page
switching buttons that would have been a
lot better no question there the MX
master also comes with a gesture button
by pressing and holding down the gesture
button and moving the mouse at the same
time you can perform tasks for example
while holding the button down and moving
the mouse towards you it will show the
desktop moving it away from you
maximizes the window and moving it
either left or right unlocks the Snap
feature you can also simply just press
and let go which will display the app
viewer now Mac users will definitely
appreciate the extra perk of gesture
support seeing as most of the multi
trackpad gestures can be duplicated on
the MX master now if you don't care for
those gestures then you can customize it
to do whatever you want using a Logitech
options program you can basically
program the gesture button to control
your media zoom or rotate if you're
mainly working on art or even fully
customized each task but that's not all
you can customize you can also change up
any button or scroll on a mouse to your
liking along with changing the
sensitivity of the pointer and the
wheels another downside to this mouse is
that it's only designed for right-handed
users so those of you out there that are
left-handed then you're basically Sol
overall this mouse is amazing other than
the fact that it's a little louder than
I'm used to and other placements of the
back and forward buttons are a little
uncomfortable to me this is definitely a
product I'm keeping however I have been
using the coarser and 45 miles for the
longest time and it's time for me
to upgrade $100 for a high-end wireless
mouse like this is definitely worth it
in this case you get what you pay for it
but anyways that concludes my unboxing
and review of the Logitech MX wireless
mouse as always I want to know what you
guys think so please drop your thoughts
