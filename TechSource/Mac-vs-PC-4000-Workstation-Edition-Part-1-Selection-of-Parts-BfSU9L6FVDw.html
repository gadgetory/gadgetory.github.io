possible by Squarespace what's up guys
ed here from Texas and it's finally time
we have received all of our parts for
the Mac versus PC projects what you see
here is $4,000 worth of workstation
parts for the PC build and once
completed we will be comparing it to the
$4,000 Mac Pro model to find out what
computer performs the best for the same
price the series will be split into five
videos this video which you are watching
is the introduction and selection of
parts the second video will be the
unboxing video of all the parts the
third video will be the build process
where we show you step-by-step on how to
build a workstation PC or just any PC in
general fourth and fifth videos will be
the comparison videos one of the videos
will have the PC running with Windows
8.1 while the Mac Pro runs
OSX Mavericks and the other video both
computers will run Windows 8.1 to make
sure we cover all ends of this
comparison so without further ado let's
introduce the parts let's start off with
the tower this is the fractal excel r2
and it's basically a larger version of
the define r4 which is the tower I used
for my custom PC this goes for 100 bucks
and we chose this case because we want
to go with a silent build after all the
Mac Pro is really quiet and we want to
match every aspect as close as possible
we could have bought a smaller Tower to
be comparable to the Mac Pro but we
opted for a bigger tower for future
expandability moving on to the
motherboard we went with the Asus p9 x79
WS and as the name implies the ws series
arm a TV workstation motherboards with
support for ECC memory LGA 2011 socket
support and Asus brand reliability the
p9 x79 was the best choice for the price
tag of 384 the graphics card we went
with the AMD FirePro
w 7000 we were debating whether or not
to go with workstation graphics cards
for this build
after all a gtx 780 Ti will easily beat
the performance of this card with some
tweaks the 780 Ti can also be recognized
as a workstation card and it can be used
with intense editing programs however we
did go with the
card to make this a fair comparison here
we have the Intel Xeon e5 2650 this is
an 8 core processor that comes clocked
at 2.0 gigahertz
it supports ECC memory and this is a
socket 2011 CPU that's meant for some
serious workloads we chose this over
other options because it fit our budget
and its performance should be just as
good if not better than the one inside
the Mac Pro when it comes down to power
supply we have to go with a trusted
brand which is why we went with the
Corsair CX 750m nothing special here is
750 watts is plenty of power for this
build and for the price of 90 bucks you
really can't go wrong so the storage in
the Mac Pro is PCIe based which gives an
insane amount of read and write speeds
and that's why we had to go with a o WC
240 gigabyte mercury excelsior
this goes for 400 bucks and delivers
speeds up to eight hundred twenty
megabytes per second which gives us
similar performance to that of the Mac
Pro with a great price tag we went with
the Noctua
NHD 14 CPU cooler because it's pretty
much the best air cooler you can get
your hands on in the market nakta was
well known for their quality and ugly
design in fact my current PC uses all
Noctua fans we picked this up for 85
bucks and it's performance is very close
to that of the H 100 I but with a
smaller price tag this is a silent
cooler as well and can be used on LGA
2011 CPUs and should keep things nice
and cool when we overclock the CPU
moving on to ram we went with 16
gigabytes of Crucial ram sticks because
these are rated for a speed of 1866
which is the highest natively supported
on the 4960 x we also wanted to keep the
comparison fair as the mac pro also uses
1866 weighted ram just like the mac pro
these are also ECC Ram sticks which
means that there is an extra chip on the
board itself that checks for errors and
reduces the amount of problems that a
computer can run into last but not least
we had to go with the latest operating
system for the PC so we went ahead a
picked up Windows 8 for just under 100
bucks so that is all the parts that we
are going to use for this build the
total came out to forty twelve and
seventy eight cents which is just above
the $39.99 price tag of the Mac Pro that
we are going to compare to we have
listed all
that we use in the description below for
those of you that are interested and I
wanted to ask you guys what you think
about the parts we selected is there
something you guys don't agree with or
maybe it were to pick differently if so
let us know in the comments down below
also which system do you guys think will
outperform the other the Apple made
computer or our custom-made PC you guys
don't want to miss out on this epic
conclusion so make sure to hit that
subscribe button if you haven't already
so before I head out I want to thank the
people at Squarespace for making this
entire project possible Squarespace
makes it really easy to create your very
own website or online portfolio in fact
we create our own website text or TV
using Squarespace in less than a day and
it turned out exactly how we want it to
they have so many beautiful templates to
choose from to match your needs or you
can even start from scratch like we did
everything is drag-and-drop so you don't
need to know anything about coding at
all and Squarespace really cares about
the design so all their templates are
extremely clean and allow your content
to be the focus of your website what's
also cool is that your website even
scales to look amazing on mobile devices
also starting from today all Squarespace
plans now support commerce functionality
which means that you can sell products
online no matter which plan you choose
the best part about all of this is that
is free to try seriously guys go ahead
and try it out for 14 days and see if
you like it
all you need is your name email and
password no credit card is required and
if you guys end up loving it which I'm
sure you will you can use the Kotex
source 2 for 10% off they're already
super low prices this is that from tech
source and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
