weekend I came out with a brilliant new
series idea that has to do with setups
I'm actually calling it set up montages
and basically all the setups that don't
get featured on set up Wars will be
moved over to the new show basically
it's gonna be a slideshow of setups with
some background music and also text
showing what gear they are using I get
around ten submissions each day just for
setup wars and sometimes in the weekend
I get double that so sadly I have to
delete a lot of them because there's
just no way I can fit every single one
on the show which I do only once a week
and I feel really bad to leave them
because you guys spend a lot of time
taking pictures and submitting to be on
the show so I figured at least this way
the setups that don't get featured on
the actual show can be showcased on a
different series so I did a small poll
to see if I should even do this and
based on the Twitter votes a lot of you
guys are interested in this so I'll give
it a shot it's gonna come out this
Saturday so if you guys are interested
watching it cool if not you can
obviously skip it you don't have to
watch it it's not for everyone but if
you do watch it please I ask you guys to
either leave a dislike or leave a like
that's the only way I'm gonna know if
you guys will enjoy this series and if I
should continue doing them every single
Saturday so setup words will be every
Monday setup montages will be every
Saturday and it's gonna be a very quick
video maybe two three minutes tops
but anyways with that said welcome so
with that said welcome to setup wars
episode 126 let the setup wars begin
kicking off the show we got Brad and a
very clean ultra wide set up between
three 23 inch AOC monitors that are
hooked up against the wall and I don't
know if I'm seeing things but it looks
like he painted the monitor mount the
same color as his wall interesting the
desk is custom made that he cut himself
and he's using to Ikea Alex yours as the
support he's also got the curser K 65
RGB keyboard and the Sabre RGB Mouse on
top of the pajama extended mousepad he
doesn't have any desktop speakers
instead he's using a Bluetooth speaker
from damson and the Astro 830's next to
his xbox one is the PC that's running
the setup and it's actually rocking the
i7 6700 and an EVGA GTX 970 no
complaints when it comes to cable
management looks like you know what
you're doing there are a few things
though I would recommend first off the
wood tabletop doesn't blend with the
rest of your setup I would either paint
it or skin it black carbon fiber or
black mat would look really nice on the
desk and I'll drop a link below if you
guys want to check it out
another thing that you can do to clean
up your desk surface is by mounting your
xbox one under the desk itself and you
can do that by using this mount other
than that is a pretty solid setup Thank
You Brad for starting off the show Davis
next up with quite possibly the least
symmetrical setup on the show he must
really like that picture on the wall so
much that he still decided to add the
acoustic foams even though it looks
unbalanced he mounted both of the BenQ
monitors on the desk and underneath that
he's got the worldcat isku keyboard the
Nith mouse and the Logitech g13 gamepad
for audio he's using the rock at Ranga
gaming headset but he also has the
Harman Kardon sound sticks and it looks
like he doesn't have any space for them
so he laid them both on top of a storage
container I guess that's one way of
doing it the PC next to them has a 7700
K and the Asus
dual GTX 1070 which looks really nice
inside the s3 for the elite case with
the white sleeved cables and speaking of
the cables the management is on point
maybe just clean the wall a little bit
but it really is an organized and clean
setup it's pretty straightforward
nothing I can really recommend to
improve it thank you Dave for
trained Dave number two is up next with
an insane gaming room I don't even know
where to start I mean this guy has the
ultimate gaming setup in his bedroom in
the notes he stated that everything in
his room costed around twenty five
hundred dollars which I called BS I
think he accidentally missed an extra
zero because twenty five thousand would
be a more accurate number on the left
side we got his secondary setup
featuring two HP monitors the red dragon
K 503 keyboard and the Vics Inc Mouse
the headphones he's using with the setup
are the sennheiser HD 4.30 eye which has
an interesting hanger and there's also a
dell sound bar as well the 40 inch
sceptre TV up top is mostly used with
chromecast for YouTube Netflix and
occasionally TV however it's not used
for gaming looks like this first setup
is actually more budget oriented because
he bought the keyboard and mouse used
online and the PC parts are more on the
low-end side regardless of what parts he
used a wall-mounted PC always looks
badass
his main setup is a tiny bit better he's
got four monitors three of which were
bought from eBay for $100 and he
happened to overclock them to 66 Hertz
he's also using a five year old keyboard
from Logitech and liji 602 Mouse I'm
actually starting to believe that he did
buy everything for $2,500 I mean after
all most of the parts he bought are used
so it was a lot cheaper it also looks
like he was going with a black and white
color scheme because of the acoustic
panels on the wall also the white out
blue yeti microphone with white pop
filter and also a bunch of other white
accessories on the desk I honestly
expected white skins on his m50x s but I
guess he kept it stuck he also has three
Dell sound bars mounted under his
monitors because one is obviously too
mainstream I also got to give Dave some
major props on the clean cable
management job on a glass desk I like
how you used the cable raceways near the
bottom to route the wires on his second
setup and small things like adding an SD
card reader underneath the keyboard and
also a USB hub reader nearby but the
side of a show which I'm sure everyone
can agree on is this wall-mounted custom
water-cooled PC featuring an EVGA GTX
980
TI 16 gigs of ram and the xeon e5
2680 processor which is an 8 core I know
the motherboard and the RAM sticks
triggered a lot of people including me
but workstation motherboards never
looked good anyways so there's not much
you can do there if you really bought
everything in this room for $2,500 the
new sir are the budget King a very sick
gaming room setup
Thank You Dave number 2 for entering
coming out number 4 is Theo and his
custom-built setup next to his I want to
say bunk bed but the bottom portion
doesn't really look like a bed so I'm
not sure what that is either way his
setup features the 34 inch ultra white
from LG with an asus monitor up top it
looks like both of them are mounted
against the wall and check out his
microphone setup he mounted his rode NT
microphone against the mounting bracket
for his monitors that there is the
optimal position for a boom arm if you
can get it up there it's off your desk
and it doesn't block your monitors it
also doubles as a nice headphone hanger
on the desk he's got the courser k95 RGB
platinum keyboard and the razer naga RGB
mouse with a pair of logitech zi 623
speakers I'm not sure what's up with the
random CPU and RAM sticks you've got on
the desk but I'm guessing it's to offset
the charging dock on the opposite side
to keep it somewhat asymmetrical I mean
you got the extra space for it so adding
small props like that isn't really a big
deal the PC powering the setup is
equipped with horizon 7 1700 X and the
asus strix 1070 but holy sheep tits look
at the cable management guys beautiful
work with the cable ties and mounting
that cable box up there was the icing on
the cake I'm also happy to see that you
used a wall Raceway for the moderner
wires up there it is music to my
eyeballs a beautiful and clean setup
thank you very much Theo for entering
finishing up the episode we got a simple
yet powerful gaming setup powered by
Asus he's rocking the asus rog swift
monitor we also got to Asus mice and the
Corsair k70 RGB keyboard I'm curious as
to why he didn't go with the Asus
keyboard since most of his parts are
from Asus I mean they do make some
pretty dope keyboards like the Claymore
core sticking with the Asus team his PC
is equipped with the
Crick's x99 motherboard with a Strix GTX
1080
paired with D 6800 K processor other
than a few mouse pads he's got his
custom Xbox one controller by bum
controller and that's about it on his
desk under his desk is the sennheiser pc
363 gaming headset hanging from the most
interesting headphone hanger I have seen
on the show I don't even know how those
beads are hanging to be honest if you
zoom close you can see that it's just
somehow attached to the metal frame of
the desk I mean with that logic it has
to be magnetic otherwise there's just no
way it's hanging like that
okay sure the cable Wiseman is flawless
I like the cable sleeves that's covering
the PC wires and everything is tucked
away nicely inside the net underneath
the desk but let's focus on the most
impressive thing in his entire room his
organization skills no joke look at this
shelf over here there was literally no
more space left on the sides of the
shelves
he used the perfect size and the perfect
amount of boxes to fill up from one side
to the other I mean this guy is a Tetris
master okay maybe the top shelf has some
extra space there about overall he did a
fantastic job and I feel really good and
relaxed just by staring at it I'm pretty
weird and it's like that across the rest
of his room like this red shelf he has
over here he made sure to take advantage
of all that extra space a very nice
organized and powerful set up Thank You
