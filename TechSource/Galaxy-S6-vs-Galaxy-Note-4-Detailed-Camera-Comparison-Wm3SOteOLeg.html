camera comparison video this time we are
facing off the Samsung Galaxy s6 I guess
the Galaxy Note 4 but Before we jump
into the samples let's take a quick look
at their specs the Galaxy s6 and s6 edge
both have the same exact camera which is
a 16 megapixel rear facing camera with
an aperture of 1.9 that can shoot up to
a resolution of 4k at 30fps the note 4
also has a 16 megapixel rear-facing
camera with an aperture of 2.2 that can
also shoot up to 4k resolution at 30fps
for front-facing cameras the galaxy s6
and edge both have a 5 megapixel camera
that can shoot in 1440p at 30fps
and the same can be said with the 3.7
megapixel camera on the note 4 so that's
it for all the specs now let's sit back
relax and enjoy the show
you
you
the continuous autofocus on the galaxy
s6 is really fast as you can see here it
quickly detects the object and focuses
within milliseconds the accuracy is also
spot-on
I've uses phone for about a month now
and it hasn't given me any problems when
it comes to focusing even in low-light
situations the Northport on the other
hand is a bit sluggish though it does
take a few seconds to adjust it still
gets the job done at some points it
would even have trouble picking up
objects if it's at a distance but as
long as the object you are trying to
focus is nearby you shouldn't have to
worry when it comes to 4k video both
phones deliver amazing 4k footage the
quality looks nearly identical with the
exception of the galaxy s6 having
slightly more saturated colors both
deserve a point for 4k video now
low-light video is a different story the
galaxy s6 easily takes the point for
much better low-light performance the
footage is just a lot more clear thanks
to its 1.9 aperture and the no 4 is just
completely covered in darkness so the
point goes to the Alex es6 for low-light
performance what's up guys and welcome
to the video stabilization and
microphone test part of the video there
will be an audio icon somewhere on the
screen which will basically tell you
which phone's audio is being used and
also both of the phones are being
strapped onto one device to ensure a
very accurate stabilization reading now
both phones are also being shot in 1080p
to ensure that optical image
stabilization is enabled for audio
quality both devices sound very loud and
clear the difference is marginal so I'll
give a point to each of them for that
however for a stabilization the galaxy
s6 seems to do a lot better than the
note 4 even though both phones have
optical image stabilization moving to
daylight pics once again both phones are
neck-and-neck the galaxy s6 has more
warmer colors compared to the note 4 but
other than that both pics have amazing
detail and sharpness the dynamic range
on the phones are also very similar it
feels like I'm looking at the same
picture twice then again both phones are
Galaxy devices so it's no surprise
moving indoors is where the galaxy s6
takes the lead with crispy and more
detailed pic stand
note for you can see the texture on the
ps4 controller trackpad in this shot
whereas it's really blurry on a note
forest pic both cameras have a decent
flash as well other than not being able
to take pics of white objects because of
its flash power it does noticeably well
on other objects however it does look
like the note 4 has a stronger flash
than the note 6 which completely over
exposes the object giving the point to
the s6 by the way in this shot the s6
was able to produce a great flash pic of
the white flower because there was a
yellow lamppost that was being aimed at
the flower which helped a lot so the
final verdict both phones are nearly
identical for daylight video and
pictures however when you move into
low-light situations that's when the
galaxy s6 shines so once again the
galaxy s6 wins this camera comparison
giving it a 4 win streak
good job Samsung so that's it for the
video I hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did please hit that like button if you
didn't feel free to dislike and let me
know what you guys think about my
results do you agree or disagree with me
if you want to see my previous camera
comparisons with the galaxy s6 they will
be listed in the description section
right below and make sure you subscribe
to the channel so you don't miss out on
future videos like these if there's a
specific camera comparison you want to
see the galaxy s6 compete in next let me
know by dropping a comment down below as
well anyways thanks again for watching
this is it from tech source I will see
you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
