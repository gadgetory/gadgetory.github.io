a PC maybe the cable management
now it's everything
what's up guys it's edy from tech stores
and I am proud to present my new series
on the channel the perfect desk setup
it's in the title the purpose of the
series is to put together the perfect
setup it has to look clean cable
management has to be on point
the color scheme has to be consistent
and most importantly it has to have
purpose this setup is perfect for PC and
console gamers and light productivity
but more on that later the total cost of
this entire setup along with all the
links to the products mentioned in this
video will be listed below or anyone
that is interested in addition to that
some of the products featured in this
video will be available to try for free
using the app called nice and I'll leave
you a link to that down below as well
what are we singing over time let's
begin so let's start off with the PC
that's powering this entire setup this
is man --tx the ITX gaming PC I built
for the month of March is running on a
6700 K which I overclocked to 4.5
gigahertz and I paired it with the msi
gtx 980ti the fact that I can pack in
all of this power inside the tiny NZXT
mantas case means that I have lots of
extra space on the desk to work with I
did do a video on the PC so if you guys
want to see benchmarks and stuff make
sure to check it out
whether you like playing with friends
who have consoles or want to get your
hands on that ps4 exclusive game you
can't go wrong with having a console
next to your gaming rig I hooked up the
nikon charging dock slap some
carbon-fiber dbrand skins and call it a
day the charger was actually featured in
my cool tech of september and they come
with these two magnetic dongles that you
can attach to the controllers which
snaps in place making charging super
convenient what's awesome is you can
still charge the controllers this way
even if the ps4 is in rest mode but
since it takes up the two front USB
ports the charging dock does come with
two extra USB ports in the back that you
can still use to connect headsets or
other devices the monitors I'm using our
24 inch Asus gaming monitors these
babies feature a 144 Hertz refresh rate
any one millisecond response time which
is ridiculous for gaming I've been using
sixty Hertz for all my life and let me
tell you guys I have been miss
seeing out the difference between 60 and
144 Hertz is night and day
and it has greatly impacted my skills
the responsiveness is on another level
and if you guys get a chance to try one
out for even a minute you will know
exactly what I'm talking about the
reason why I got to is for multitasking
purposes and productivity it's great for
screamers so that they can view chat
windows or browse the Internet and you
can utilize the second window when
editing as well the monitor mount I'm
using is from wali and this is one of
the few mounts that works with a mon
desk
it doesn't require any drilling or
clamping it just sits on the desk like
this and the center of gravity keeps the
monitors from tilting over which is
pretty cool it also comes with clips
that you can attach to the arms and neck
which make cable management a breeze
when deciding on peripherals I had to
make sure they are both from the same
brand I also want to make sure that it
not only fits the color scheme and looks
badass
but it's worthy enough to be part of the
perfect setup so this is the Lenovo Y
gaming keyboard and mouse the keyboard
is mechanical and features a set of
macro keys on the left side which can be
programmed into 18 command it also
features a detachable wrist for s than a
USB and audio pass-through on the right
side which is perfect for hooking up the
mouse to and hiding extra cables the
mouse on the other hand not only looks
badass but also features 9 programmable
buttons one of which is a dedicated dpi
button on top and an 8200 dpi sensor
with a 1000 Hertz polling rate the mouse
is only for right-handed users and
features a flat ergonomic design which
is great for palm grippers but it was
really comfortable for me as well
considering that I'm a claw gripper the
mouse also comes with removable weight
cartridges to give you the perfect
resistance needed for specific games
finally underneath all that gear is an
extended mousepad from Sean I wanted to
get something that will make the setup
pop instead of going with a boring black
mousepad the awesome scorpion logo
combined with the red border really adds
some spice I didn't go with any speakers
this time around and instead went with 2
headphones the m50x is with custom brain
waves ear cups for extended comfort and
the HyperX cloud revolver gaming headset
both of which are resting on the
brainwaves headphone anger on the
the desk the m50 X's are more for audio
monitoring while the revolvers are for
gaming HyperX definitely doesn't
disappoint when it comes to gaming
headsets these are a worthy successor to
the cloud tubes it features 50
millimeter drivers a steel frame and a
detachable noise cancellation microphone
now even though these have a closed back
design they offer studio great sound
stage basically it has a wider audio
range that creates depth and width
meaning you get to hear all sounds in
the game from the wind blowing against
the leaves to the enemy footsteps a mile
away most of you guys know that I'm
obsessed with my cloud - well let's just
say that these easily replace them the
best part about this headset is that it
works on all platforms especially
consoles under the desk I've done some
modifications one of which is this Anker
PowerPort USB charger that I attached on
the roof using some 3m tape it features
five ports with IQ technology which
means that it will detect the device
plugged in and provide the fastest
charging option available and then you
get one quick charge 2.0 port which
allows compatible devices to charge 75%
faster lots of smart phones have this
feature like the galaxy and Note series
along with HTC Nexus and a bunch of
other companies the cable I used to
charge my phone is the anchor power line
Plus which is stupid strong I mean I
practically towed a car with it and yes
I did do a video on it so if you guys
are interested be sure to check that out
the reason I don't use a normal microUSB
cable is because those tend to rip or
break after a few months so if I'm going
with a charging cable I'm going with the
power line plus next to the charging hub
I used a few cable clips to route the
headset adapter alongside the roof and
into the back of the PC so basically
whenever I need to put my headset on i
hook up the 3.5 millimeter jack into the
panel and I'm good to go if I want to
play on the console I simply switch
inputs from the monitor detach the
headset from the adapter and hook it up
straight to the ps4 controller like I
said before everything has purpose that
all of the gear works seamlessly with
each other cable management was really
easy thanks to the mom desk having a
storage compartment in the back I just
picked up a Belkin surge protector
plugged in everything and
in the back the rest of the cables from
the monitors and PC are routed in the
back using some cable clips and velcro
straps so that they are not all over the
place the desk is awesome it's not too
small that it's large and strong enough
to hold my PC and still have room for
two monitors and other things on the
desk I also like the fact that it comes
with two drawers I picked up this
organizer which fits perfectly inside
and has a bunch of bins to accommodate
practically any sized item I have the
power line plus cable the detachable mic
for the headset and a few other items
stored away from sight the only other
thing besides the ps4 that's sitting on
the desk is my smartphone the galaxy s7
which is skinned by you guessed it the
brand's I have it sitting on the anchor
stand and vertical mode so that I can
see all incoming notifications without
having to grab it or move my head around
and by the way you guys can pick up the
same skins that are featured on the ps4
the headphones and even a smartphone by
visiting the first link below I setup is
not perfect without the right chair the
icing on the cake is this gaming seat
from a blue so this is called the Arosa
x1 and it's one of the coolest gaming
chairs out there made out of filament
leather and resilient foam padding this
is one comfy chair to sit in for hours
at a time the base is made out of steel
and it's surprisingly easier to roll
around and there's compared to my
dxracer chair you get your usual
adjustable backrest armrests and seat
height but what I found interesting is
that you can rotate the armrests a full
360 degrees but what sets this apart
from other gaming chairs well it has
LEDs built in the back it comes with a
power bank that gives you ten days worth
of juice to power up the LEDs so you
don't have to worry about charging it
constantly the way it works is this
there is a sensor in the front of the
chair once occupied the LEDs will change
depending on one of the four settings
that you can select from the back it's
not only visible during the day but once
it gets dark out the LEDs definitely
stand out add some LED strips in the
back of your desk and you have the
perfect desk setup so let me know what
you guys think about my new series if
you guys enjoyed it and want to see more
make sure to hit that like button so I
know you can

products in this video are available to
try for free using the app nice and I'll
