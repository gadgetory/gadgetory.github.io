paladin to check out and boy was I
excited not only was big read already
due for an upgrade but their gamer
paladin PC that they sent me has some
pretty beefy specs it came equipped with
an i7 6800 k-6 core processor which I
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz at one
point 25 volts guys that's a full 1
gigahertz overclock with a low core
voltage they did throw in 16 gigs of ram
from g.skill which I also have a clocks
to 3200 megahertz and their very own CPU
cooling system for storage I have a 256
gigabyte Samsung 950 pro SSD as my main
and AWD black 2 terabyte hard drive the
motherboard of choice is the msi x99s
li+ with a neutral black PCB and finally
we have an EVGA GTX 1080 super clock
graphics card by the way huge things to
EVGA for supplying the graphics card and
the 850 watt power supply that's juicing
up this entire system now the case
that's a different story they're calling
it the element it's a custom modded s340
case with tempered glass windows for the
side and front it's easily one of the
cleanest and stunning cases I have ever
seen and I just had to have this on my
desk it even as red LEDs glowing from
underneath and inside the case there's
actually an RGB strip on the top that
allows me to change the color or give it
some pretty cool effects personally I
think that MSI GPU would go better with
the color scheme but overall I'm very
satisfied with the build and cable
management in terms of acoustics this is
a very silent PC before I couldn't turn
on big red behind me while recording
video because of all that fan noise but
now well now it's not an issue in terms
of performance well if you watch my GTX
1084 to win review then you can see the
performance of the 1080 super clock as
well because there's really not much of
a difference between the two but I'm
sitting here playing Doom maxed out at
34 40 by 1440 P and getting over 100
frames per second this thing is a beast
for gaming and it does very well on a
Productivity side as well needless to
say this is going to be my main rig at
the moment until I have enough time to
do a ridiculous high-end water-cooled
build early next year whoa whoa whoa
hold on a second you guys
be asking Eid I thought you were a guest
people PCs one earth are you promoting
this on your channel good question I'm
against overpriced pre-built pcs and
considering that most of them are iPad
power is actually one of the very few if
not the only company that doesn't over
price their pcs and here's the proof so
I managed to gather up all the same or
equivalent parts used in this exact same
build and it came out to a little under
2100 the total cost of the gamer paladin
on iBUYPOWER is 23 24 now keep in mind
that the extra difference that you are
paying for is in their three-year
warranty custom modded case that's not
available anywhere along with some other
mods like the LED fans RGB strips and
custom red sleeving not to mention the
time it takes for them to build a PC on
top of all that you also get a free
mouse keyboard and headset with your
purchase so if you add all these up the
total cost of the actual custom PC would
be around 20 to 50 which is pretty much
the same cost as a prebuilt gamer
paladin the huge difference here is that
you have peace of mind knowing that if
your PC were to have problems that
iBUYPOWER is right there to help you out
honestly I don't know how these guys
manage to build a very powerful and
good-looking PC with pretty much the
same cost as retail I feel like they are
more targeted towards beginners who
don't know how to build one themselves
yet or for people I just don't have the
time or patience to learn how to build
one but with that said I'll going to
drop a link to the game repeal and down
below if you guys want to check that out
or other pcs from iBUYPOWER
but whichever piece you guys go with
you're definitely getting your money's
worth
I pretty much proved that in this video
once again a huge thanks to iBUYPOWER
for setting this in and sponsoring this
video thank you guys so much for
watching as always I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
