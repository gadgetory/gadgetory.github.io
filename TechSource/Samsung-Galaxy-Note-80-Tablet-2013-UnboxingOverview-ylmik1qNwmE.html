another unboxing samsung just released
another new tablet called the Galaxy
Note 8.0 so we're gonna unbox this and
take a look at it so let's get started
so this is the Galaxy Note 8.0 and it's
399 it comes with only 16 gigabytes of
space and you could choose between white
or black let's take a look at the specs
real quick you got the 8 inch super
clear type LCD screen you have a 1.6
gigahertz quad-core processor 5
megapixels camera 2 gigabytes of RAM and
you have full HD 1080p playback and HD
recording alright so let's open up this
box and see what's inside it's nice to
see that Samsung kept the style of the
box the same they got the wooden beam
going over here like they do with most
of their devices and I think it's pretty
cool alright so the first thing you see
is the tablet itself obviously you can
tell that we went with the black version
instead of the white I'm just gonna go
and put this aside for now continue on
with the unboxing lifting this tab open
you see everything else is neatly packed
here and the first item is the wall
charger followed up by the USB cable
which is obviously needed to charge the
tablet and connect it to the computer
and lastly you have the manual and
warranty information which I'm not going
to bore you with overall this is a very
thin very light tablet and this is what
I would like to call a perfect tablet I
believe this is how real tablet should
look like in terms of design and size
there are just so many different
versions out there that are either too
big or too small but this one just works
perfectly so I'm gonna go ahead and peel
this off real quick and show you all
four sides of the tablet I'm gonna start
off with the bottom over here you can
see that there's two speakers along with
your micro USB port in the middle on the
top side you have one 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack of course and I'm moving
on to the side here you have your volume
buttons and your power buttons and on
the bottom right you have an easy access
to a stylus pen for those of you that
want to keep the screen clean so they
kind of made it really easy to access
and store just pretty cool I think and
on the front of the tablet on the top
here you have your front-facing camera
and your notifications light so there's
one other thing I forgot to mention on
the tablet and that's on the top-left
side of it then there is a microSD slot
to increase your memory space up to 64
gigs if you choose to so when a 1280 by
800 resolution screen size everything
you see is crystal clear the software
runs pretty smooth for the most part
although it's not as smooth as I
expected simply
because of the skin that Samsung has put
on top of the stock Android you kind of
see what I'm talking about over here
when I try to move the tablet from one
position to the other kind of takes a
while for the tablet to readjust
compared to other tablets that I've used
and it's actually a really smooth motion
and it's not only about that it's using
the apps and you know multitasking it
you kind of get like a rigid movement
instead of a nice smooth transition I
also like how precise the stylus pen is
and you don't have to really try hard to
get it to work and I'm sure that's a
huge plus to people that write on their
tablets daily so here's a sample video I
found in the gallery that's in 1080p I'm
not sure if you can tell but the quality
is sharp and simply stunning you get the
same quality that you have on your TV on
your tablet without sacrificing the size
and that makes it that much more
enjoyable watching so that concludes
today's unboxing thank you guys so much
