this is the ergo maniacs office desk
as crazy as it sounds it's not only
meant for comfort this was actually
designed to also minimize all the
pressure on your spine standing desks
which I've blown up in the past few
years actually do worse in this regard
as there's always pressure being put on
your legs knees and back and even
withstand their desks there's still a
considerable amount of pressure being
put on your lower back when you're
sitting down so yes this is definitely
more comfortable but how practical is
having this in your office or home well
as a pen it takes up a lot of space with
the working panel giving you about 24 by
58 inches of usable real estate which is
enough to mount a few ultra-wide so
we're talking about the whole desk size
into consideration it's not that much
they do have a smaller version available
as well and it's cheaper and has enough
space to accommodate a single large
monitor it comes in at $700 and
personally this is the one I would go
for but options are always nice to have
these desks are handmade in California
from solid oak and coming a light wood
finish through custom order however orga
Maineiacs can make custom desks with
different wood and painted finishes
because I'm definitely not a fan of the
wood look although I'm sure a lot of
people are into that I would personally
have mine painted in white there's
actually a lot more storage than you
would think at first glance there's a
rack hidden away near the back that
works great for cable management also
the angles panel is hinged and it can be
held up to reveal a spacious area and
this is where we put our MSI Trident PC
I do wish however they would have
incorporated a locking mechanism so I
wouldn't have to hold or prop this up
this would make accessing the storage
area a lot more convenient and Notley
enough that's actually the only
complaint I have about the build the
wood is really well put together and you
can tell someone spent a lot of time on
it the moderate amounts being used here
actually comes included with the price
of the desk so that's really nice as
well the keyboard and wrist rest are
being held up by Velcro which is great
if you ever want to change the
positioning of your peripherals for
instance if you need to look down at
your keyboard when you type you could
easily move it up without a problem a
cool little trick that easily came to
mind when using the desk was to use a
keyboard itself as a holder because
let's face it you
can't really put stuff on the desk
without it sliding off so I put my phone
up there my mouse when I'm not using it
and even a bottle of water with complete
faith in the holding power of the Zeljko
of course this also depends on a
thickness of your keyboard if you have a
very slim keyboard then you probably
don't have enough surface area to hold
up things on the desk getting in a
comfortable position and using the desk
was enough to have me sold I could
seriously be here for eight hours
without any fatigue after all I'm just
laying down the best way I can describe
it it's like laying in your bed with
some elevation my weight was being
evenly distributed on my back and not
just on a single point which left me
feel weightless in the chair as a person
who spends the majority of their day in
front of a computer something like this
takes comfort to a whole new level it
even has a footrest there's one thing I
couldn't get used to though and that was
using the mouse at such an angle
especially if you have a heavy Mouse and
if it is wireless you're constantly
fighting against gravity to try and keep
it upright and on the surface and
because of this I cannot recommend this
desk for any hardcore or competitive
gamer as this will definitely affect
your accuracy and responsiveness but if
using a wired mouse to remedy the
situation we attached a mouse bungee
which supported most of the weight so in
my case all I had to do was move the
mouse left and right I would use the
desk more for long editing sessions or
if I just like kick back watch some
videos or even do some casual gaming
it's really great for all of that so
what that said I would strongly
recommend this desk to people who get
uncomfortable from sitting for long
stretches at a time especially for
people who have back pain this is also
great for companies that wants to give
its employees a more relaxed working
environment I personally think it would
be sweet going into work and being able
to use this bad boy to get my job done
now this model does come in at $2,900
which is steep but when taking into
consideration the competition these
tables actually start at six thousand
dollars so this is actually not a bad
deal however like I said before this is
actually really large and as you can see
there is so much more real estate that I
did not end up using and we strongly
recommend going with the smaller version
instead that starts at $700 that's
actually one of the reasons why the guys
that Olga maniac started this company to
give the consumer a more affordable
reclining workstation the pretty much
wraps the video if you guys want to
check out their cool desk I'll drop a
link to them
to below let me know what you guys think
by dropping your comments as well thank
you so much for watching I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
