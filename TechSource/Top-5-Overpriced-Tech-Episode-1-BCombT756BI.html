welcome to my new series on the channel
called the top five overpriced tech
there's really no need to explain it
it's basically in the title let's begin
starting up the show we have a gaming
mouse and it's called the GX gaming
Morris X I don't know what's more
retarded the price of the mouse or the
name of it but what I find interesting
about this is that there is no freaking
description section how am I gonna give
you my money if I don't know anything
about it but I guess that's part of the
mystery you pay almost 50 grand and get
a surprise this probably isn't even a
mouse maybe it's a foreign girl that
doesn't speak any English that is sold
through Amazon and code names like GX
Morris X and fake pictures now let's
read some reviews I've never had an
orgasm from using a mouse before I think
it's the braided cord amazing gave it to
my son and he said he had to mortgage
the house to afford a keyboard of the
same quality definitely would recommend
to anyone who will be receiving a small
loan of a million dollars all right so
this next item is actually way cheaper
and more affordable than the last and
just by looking at the title I don't
know what the hell it is but after
reading the description section and
looking at the pictures it's apparent
that these stylus pens are for God's
let's be real here for a second now this
isn't a ripoff because you get not one
or two but three stylus pens and they
are in different colors I'm actually
thinking about buying one of these let's
check out the shipping oh my gosh
serious you charged me $11.25 for
shipping three sticks I guess I'm gonna
have to pass I sold my car and my kid
off to a human trafficking ring to be
able to purchase this item very
satisfied with this stylus it fills the
gaps it fills the gap left behind by my
car and kid definitely worth the
purchase next up you have a keyboard
called seal shield silver Co now say
that three times in a row seal shield
silver seal seal shields silver seal
seal shield silver seal I love I was
priced at 49,999 dollars and 98 cents as
if they're going to fool anyone bruh the
two cents ain't persuading anyone I find
it amusing that they're selling a
keyboard at cost as much as an SL K 250
but
can't afford a better camera to take
pictures of the freakin keyboard I
wasn't originally going to buy this
because I found a cheaper one but the
free shipping did it for me the split
key arrangement is perfect for two
people with two arms however with only
one I find it difficult to use
nonetheless it's a compact keyboard the
picture is one by one scale and the keys
really are just that close together the
picture is not distorted every time I
have grilles over it always gets them
going right away 11 out of 10 with back
so for adding that's the best review
alright so this next one I gotta give
some credit because look at that detail
section this is how it's done alright so
this is a super PC 12 monitors a
prebuilt PC some speakers keyboard and a
mouse for 89 88 this is what I found so
amusing check this out configured for
performance and stability all of our
super PC computers are expertly
manufactured for professional-grade
computing and durability of life yet it
has a freaking Radeon 7870 are you
seriously kidding me
if that doesn't convince you to buy this
maybe this will it comes with a whopping
one terabyte hard drive and 512
gigabytes of SSD guys you got storage
for days what FPS does candy crush run
in 60fps and it was answered by them so
I mean at least they have a sense of
humor best PC ever I mean the value here
is astonishing 12 monitors and it's
mediocre sound system I do not regret
this purchase as it only cost me my left
kidney now I can play minecraft with one
full block for a screen test purchase
you can make speaking of wall monitors
this last one is an NEC 55 inch ultra
narrow bezel video wall solution I think
the most insulting thing about this is
that they are charging you 454 dollars
and 49 cents for shipping something that
costs as much as a Tesla p85d
having 45 cents do you really have to be
that stingy and charge cents why not
just round it down and charge I don't
know like 450 bucks for shipping imagine
watching porn on this thing I got laid
by having this what's the best part
about this monitor is that it's so HD
that it deflects reality and creates a
new reality based on what I'm viewing
currently well this has been an
interesting experience I gotta leave a
link to the products mention this video
in case you guys want to go and read the
rest of the reviews it's hilarious stuff
down there but that thing that will do
it for this video if you guys enjoyed
this series I guess leave a like let me
know in the comments section and maybe
I'll do it once a month or something
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
