the water cool to build electro box
that's what I'm calling it if you guys
missed part one make sure to watch it
before you watch this video because
you'll you'll have no idea what's going
on but anyways in this episode we're
going to be putting on the GPU blocks on
the GTX 1080 from EVGA so that thing
that's what we'll focus on for this
episode if there is time maybe we can
put the motherboard inside the case and
put on the reservoirs as well I'm sorry
the radiators after that but anyway it's
all depend on how long this video takes
i'm so sorry for dragging on the first
video so long i had no idea it would be
magnus long holy crap so i'll try and
make this as shorter
i'll try to make this as short as
possible so let's just begin alright so
i guess you can start by disassembling
the graphics cards first i've taken
apart a lot of graphics cards before so
this is definitely not new to me I just
haven't really completely taken it apart
which I'm sure is what you need to do to
put on those blocks so this is
definitely interesting guys I'm very
excited to do this because I love trying
new things you know this is definitely
going to push texture to the next level
so that is why I'm so excited
oh that even comes with a little diagram
so that's pretty cool
so this is what a GPU heatsink looks
like in case you guys have never seen
one before I'm going to put this part in
here along with all the screws so I
don't lose them first things first we
got to wipe off the thermal paste
because we're going to be putting on a
fresh coat
hi guys so I finally finished the first
GPU block that took me about an hour to
get this thing together hopefully the
next one or the second one shouldn't
take as long but yeah this thing looks
pretty better that's nice and stealthy
with the all-black look the yellow is
definitely gonna pop in this build got
some fingerprints on there clean up
definite like in the way there
everything is turning out so far so good
no complaints no complications
so yeah it's gonna put that second one
on and see what's up hi guys so the GPU
blocks are finally completed it took me
about two to three hours honestly
because I kept making mistakes so to
come back or go back and then we do some
things but regardless the process itself
was pretty easy now that I got the hang
of it next time is gonna be a lot easier
so yeah I mean it's pretty much it I'm
actually in the video now because I'm
exhausted and it's getting late over
here in the next video we're gonna put
the stuff in side the case and then work
on the Raiders as well as always if you
guys are enjoying watching the build log
make sure to leave a like to show your
support and make sure to stay tuned for
part three coming next week thank you
guys so much watching and I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
