source and welcome to maze PC builds I
do this every single month they're
basically theoretical builds in case you
guys missed my last month's video I'll
drop a link to it down below I did some
pretty cool
Rison 5 configurations so make sure to
check that out if you are interested so
I decided to spice things up a bit in
this video and decide to go with a
high-end overkill build actually this is
my personal build I'm calling it big red
version 2 and this is the build I'm
going to be water cooling as well but in
this video I'm going to make everything
a lot simpler and just exclude all the
extra water cooling gear and stay with
air cooled parts so big red version 2
it's going to cost around $7 $7
$7,000 with all of the mods and custom
bag plates and painting and all that
stuff so it's going to be pretty pretty
ridiculous build I'm also gonna be
putting in a $900 balanced intel build
so that said let's start off so we're
going with the very popular 7600 k quad
core processor which is perfect for
gaming but we're going to be
overclocking this so we do need a
capable CPU cooler that won't break the
bank
the CM 212 Evo has proven to be the king
of value and for only $25 it will get
the job done while keeping the system
fairly quiet in the process we do need a
Z 270 board for overclocking of course
and one of the best ones if not the best
board out there for about $100 is the
MSI mode R which is a micro ATX board it
does support crossfire so if you're
planning on running to AMD GPUs and this
will get the job done for you
unfortunately it doesn't support sli so
Nvidia users are only limited to one GPU
then again it is a micro ATX board
around $100 it also features four dimm
slots and supports memory up to 3,800
megahertz and dual channel it has six
SATA ports one m dot two and it also got
three USB 3.1 type-a ports and one type
C and finally it's Intel obtained memory
ready and for only 105 dollars you
honestly get a lot of features for round
we are going with the usual two sticks
of four gigabytes from g.skill for
around $60 and since the motherboard
does have four dimm slots you can
actually add extra RAM down the line if
you like it does feature a number two
slot so we are taking advantage of that
and we're going with the Intel 600 T
series 128 gigabyte m2 which we will use
as the main drive for the OS and also
anything else that you guys want
installed on it for fast loading times
however we also added a one terabyte
hard drive from WD 4 mass storage again
I want to emphasize that storage is
always subjective and you can go with
however much space you want that will
meet your needs the GPU we are starting
off with is the 1066 cube by variants
from EVGA and this is the super clock
version which will easily get you over
60 FPS and max settings for 1080p gaming
if you want something more powerful or
wants a gaming 2k resolution
I suggest bumping up the card to eight
ten seventy we do have it like in wet
theme going on with the motherboard and
RAM stick colors so I decided to keep
that color scheme and pick up the NZXT
s340 case which works beautifully with
this configuration and finally powering
this entire build is the EVGA 500 watt
power supply which is plenty but if
you're going to be upgrading to a 1070
later down the line
I suggest picking up at least a 600 watt
power supply
once again this build will cost you a
little under $900 and I think it's a
very solid and balanced gaming PC with
lots of room for upgrades in the future
and finally we got big red version 2 or
v2 whatever you want to call it I
haven't upgraded or we built big red and
over three years for those of you
haven't followed me for such a long time
big red was my original custom PC that I
built for myself I custom painted on
GPUs everything was such a beast PC I'll
double into the video in case you guys
missed it but I think it's time to
finally build myself a PC I've been
using I buy power for the past I think
six months now but it's ready I'm ready
to move on the only reason I've been
kind of hesitant to move forward with
this build is because the x99 chipset
it's kind of outdated and I've been
waiting for skylake X which is the new
platform and they're going to be really
seeing six core eight core even ten core
processors in Computex this year so I'm
kind of waiting for that before I pull
the trigger on this because otherwise
I'll feel pretty upset if I do go with
this build and spend all this money on
it and then the better a newer 10 core
processor would come out from Intel so
that is why I'm patiently waiting so
these will be the specs of my next
gaming PC unless skylake X comes out
within the next few months so we got
these 1690
the x10 core processor because I mostly
edit videos compared to gaming and I
always want the best in my personal PC
we do need a solid cooler to keep the
temps down as well as get some high
clocks which is why I picked up the be
quiet silent luke 280 which will also
keep the PC nice and quiet keep in mind
that this will be the cooler I would go
with if I don't water cool the PC the
motherboard of choice is the gigabyte GA
x99 ultra gaming and it has all the
bells and whistles I can ask for in a
high-end build also the color scheme is
perfect for what I'm going with you guys
know that black and red is my gotu color
scheme and it's kind of getting a bit
old to be honest and I want to change
things up a bit so I'm actually adding a
third color in which is white so it's
going to be a white and black build with
some red accents speaking of red accents
I'm going to be picking up 64 gigs of
ram from G skill training Z at a clock
speed of 32 hundred megahertz which
obviously I will be overclocking for
storage I'm going with a one terabyte
960 pro m2 SSD from Samsung and a 10
terabyte hard drive from Seagate which
will satisfy all of my storage needs at
least I hope so it's no surprise that
I'm going with to Titan XPS simply
because I want the most power and my
build even though I'm probably not going
to even use them to its full potential
now these are the new Titan XPS that
were recently announced by Nvidia which
are actually a lot faster than their
1080p is the case I'm going with is the
NZXT s340 which is still even till today
one of my favorite cases of all time and
I'm going with a white one because of
the new color scheme and by only
powering this entire build is the
corsair ax 1500 i power supply which
probably is overkill since I really only
need around a thousand watts for this
build but hey why not the entire bill
will cost me around six thousand six
hundred dollars not including all the
extra mods and fans that I will be
buying to build a beautiful PC you guys
already know this if it doesn't stand
out it's not 8x or spc but that is it
for this video as always if you guys
enjoy these monthly theoretical PC bills
leave a like if you don't like the
series make sure to leave a dislike that
is cool 2w all the parts mentioned down
below thank you guys so much for
watching I love your faces and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
