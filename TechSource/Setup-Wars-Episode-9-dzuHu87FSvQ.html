about to start filming set up for is
episode 9 so apologies in advance if I
don't sound enthusiastic or energized
I'm really exhausted I'm running on
about 5 hours of sleep so I'm just gonna
go and jump straight into the video
screw the intro so some of you guys been
asking me where I've been getting my
games from that I feature in my PC build
videos and actually get them from g2a
and most of you guys already know what
that is but for those of you that don't
it's basically a site where you can buy
CD keys for dirt cheap I actually picked
one up for Witcher 3 csgo and Crysis 3
all for a really great price I'm gonna
be benchmarking those for the ultimate
gaming PC that's coming in August but
I'll go and drop a link down below if
you guys want to check that out but
anyways on with the show I so d5 chosen
for this week are Alessio Eric Matt
Maurice and rocky congratulations for
making it into setup wars episode 9 all
the products I mentioned in this video
by the way will be linked down below as
well as any product that I recommend in
this episode it will have its very own
special section down below so first up
we have Alessio and it looks like we
have a fairly simple setup a single 23
inch LG monitor with a corsair k70
keyboard and a pair X MX 200 Mouse I'm
sorry about that mousepad has to go he
also got the Turtle Beach px 22 headset
on the table and LEDs for both your PC
and your desk so point for coordination
cable management is great and I can't
help but notice that the desk has holes
in it for routing cables through which
is awesome and it definitely cleans up
your desk since most of your stuff is
black the white PC I new cabinet sticks
out and it's actually the first thing
that I noticed but the PC is walking and
AMD FX 8350 GPU inside the stylish NZXT
phantom 240 case as always I'll link the
parts down below for anyone that's
interested so a few things I would
recommend first off the tape on your
desk seems out of place and it would
look a lot better on that little shelf
on the right side also an MOV headphone
hanger with
keep your headset off the desk and add a
nice look to your setup and lastly since
your cables are going in one direction
from your PC an omni mount cable wrap
would clean it up nicely out on those
minor fixes and a new mousepad you have
a simple and clean set up Thank You LS
Co for entering set upwards next up is
Eric and we have a man cave setup by the
way you have my approval for the black
and red walls starting from the left we
have a Dell XPS Studio laptop then your
actual desktop followed by a 36 inch
sony bravia tv hooked up to your ps4 and
lastly an alienware 17 r2 gaming laptop
hooked up to a pair of astro a40 s it
looks like you have all of your bases
covered I mean you get productivity and
gaming laptops console gaming and even
PC gaming as well combine all that with
your mini-fridge and you are guaranteed
no sunlight for weeks on the desk we
have two asus 21.5 inch monitors a Razer
BlackWidow Ultimate keyboard and a Razer
Mamba wireless gaming mouse props for
having asymmetrical and very clean setup
you got the webcam in the middle
Logitech speakers on both sides and in
the middle of both monitors I also
noticed that you have the Razer Kraken
headphones hanging from the TV and a
pair of Sony wireless headphones near
the chess set I do like the red LEDs and
I think it goes really well with the
atmosphere you created however I would
prefer them installed underneath the
desk near the wall instead of on top not
only will you get a really nice glow
effect against the wall but the ground
will also get illuminated as well and
this way the LED strips won't be visible
it will look a lot better trust me I
also like how you organized the stuff on
the shelves with a bunch of your games
and the ps3 controllers although I would
strongly recommend you to pick up five
more ps3 controllers for those empty
slots I mean I'll go ahead and send them
to you if you promise to put them there
cable management looks good from what I
can tell however I'm just going to
assume that it's a mess since you are
covering them with pillows what a
cheater
anyways you've got a really cool mancave
setup thank you Eric for entering setup
wars matt is next up and we have a dual
monitor setup two LG 22 inch monitors
mounted above the desk you also have the
corsair k70 RGB keyboard and a m95 mouse
along with an extended mousepad also on
the desk you have the creative t20
speakers
sign Heiser HD headphones hanging on the
side and your LED strips in the back
excellent work on wire management there
are no cables touching the ground so you
get a point for that
so a few things I'm pretty sure you have
a good reason having your set up on the
right side of the desk so I'm not gonna
recommend moving it to the center which
is what I would have preferred so I'm
just gonna recommend an a th hanger for
your headset but that's basically it
pretty straightforward and clean set up
thank you Matt for entering setup words
next up is Maurice and it looks like we
have a single 24 inch tail monitor a
Logitech G 105 keyboard and a rat 9
wireless mouse you also have some pretty
cool-looking speakers from Edifier and
I'm really diggin that desk pad you
picked up from Ikea it really blends in
beautifully with your Ikea desk and
eliminates the need for an actual
mousepad great job with cable management
I don't see any wires and you have a
pretty dope custom PC as well there's an
i5 4690k CPU paired with the GTX 970
windforce edition inside the defined s
case with red LEDs and as always I'll
link the parts down below for anyone
that's interested one thing I recommend
is perhaps picking up an actual monitor
riser not only will that look sweet with
your setup but you can also have your
Xbox controller the external hard drive
and the speaker knob in a dedicated spot
right under your monitor and since it's
centered directly in front of you it
will be a lot easier to reach and
actually listed a few options down below
if you want to check them out other than
replacing the white mouse with a black
one to better match your setup I'll
recommend a pair of headphones since I
don't see that you have one I recently
picked up a pair of one of the best
budget gaming headphones you can buy
under 25 bucks and actually approve of
the quality but I'll go and link that
down below if you want to check that out
and it will go really great with your
setup but yeah I'm really diggin your
black and red theme setup Thank You
Maurice for entering setup words last
but not least we have rocky and it looks
like a Productivity setup with the
27-inch iMac and the Magic Mouse and
trackpad on the desk we have the WASD
custom-made keyboard
KRK Rokit 5 speakers and the rode nt1
mic hooked up to the heil boom arm i
like the fact that you hung around 50
x's on the wall and the speaker is on
the iso acoustics stand everything is
nicely organized and you did a
phenomenal job on the wire management
honestly i'm really impressed that you
were able to hide the wires on a dress
well desk it's definitely not an easy
task I was going to recommend a monitor
stand like the previous set up but then
I saw that you're using this little box
under the Focusrite audio interface as
your stand and you even have a USB hub
and lightning connector inside for easy
access
you really did think of everything
didn't you honestly if I can vote I
would easily vote for your setup I mean
you don't need a quadruple martyr set up
with LEDs and a $50,000 PC to win
sometimes all it takes is a simple clean
and clever setup like this to impress me
greatly
brilliant setup rocky thank you for
entering setup wars so that's it for
this week's episode of set up warrants
voting begins now so make sure you guys
drop a comment down below and vote on
who has the best desk setup voting will
conclude this Saturday and I will
announce a winner on Sunday on my
Twitter and Instagram accounts so if you
guys want to know who wins make sure you
are following me there as always if you
guys enjoy watching you series and when
we continue doing them every Monday let
me know by smashing that like button
that's the only way I can tell you guys
actually enjoy watching it but anyways
that's it thank you so much for watching
this is that from Texas I'm gonna go to
sleep and I'll see you guys in the next
video
