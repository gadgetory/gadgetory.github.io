welcome to another installment of my top
5 favorite apps for the month of January
all of these apps that are featured in
this video are not only free to download
but they are also available on both iOS
and Android devices and I'm gonna leave
a link down below if you guys want to
check them out so first up on my list is
an app called my mail and I recently
started using this over my default mail
app on my iPhone for several reasons for
one it looks a lot cleaner and offers
more features and two I get notified as
soon as I receive an email whereas it
takes minutes longer using the stock
mail app on iOS here's a quick example
of sending myself an email as you can
see my mail receives it first
whereas the default app on iOS requires
you to refresh it in order to retrieve
new mail Apple does this because of
their fetch system where every 15
minutes the iPhone will refresh the mail
app in order to push through new emails
that's one of the main reasons I use
this app the beautiful and clean
interface is also really nice plus you
also get some extra options when you
select an email thread like marking it
as spam which includes all future emails
as well and throwing it straight into
the trash instead of archiving it you'll
still get an option to view emails that
have attachments if you want to narrow
your search and lastly you get options
to clear your spam and trash bins
directly to the app which is a nice
feature overall it's a great alternative
to the default email app you have on
your smartphone so if you're not happy
with the one you're using now like me
then you should check these guys out the
next step on my list is called a coda
it's basically an app that pays you cash
for everyday purchases the concept for
this app is simple to completely ditch
coupons and use an app to get paid in
cash either via PayPal venmo
or get a gift card you simply log into
the app search for your favorite store
or retailer and unlock the rebates you
are interested in once you go to the
store and buy the product you can just
scan the product barcode and take a
photo of your receipt and it will send
you the money to your account within 24
hours it's pretty much that easy there
are a lot of stores and retailers
already available including grocery
stores clothing electronics Beauty
restaurants and a few others I boto is
actually running a ten dollar welcome
campaign for the rest of January so if
you guys are interested in signing up
you will receive ten bucks once you
redeem your first rebate but more info
will be listed in the description
section down below
waise is another app I use to replace my
stock Apple maps for one reason and one
reason only it shows traffic in
real-time and quickly finds a faster and
alternate route around so you don't get
stuck in traffic
you also have the option to avoid
freeways toll roads and even dirt roads
I mean the iOS maps don't even have one
of those options which is extremely
disappointing another feature I find
very useful is the police warnings
that's right guys it will warn you if
there is a cop hiding in front of you or
driving nearby which can definitely save
your ass in getting a speeding ticket
I'm sure most of you already use Waze
but if you don't check it out that's
pretty awesome the last two apps are
games and I got to start off and say
that I'm a huge square Enix fanboy so
when I found out that they made a free
game on iOS naturally I downloaded it in
a heartbeat
I've only been playing the game for
about a week now but I'm extremely
addicted so this isn't your average RPG
on a mobile device it's an RPG game with
a twist it's kind of like hearthstone
made love with Final Fantasy and this
game is its outcome each player takes
turns summoning monsters that have
attack and defense points in order to
defend their hero and take down the
opponent's monsters once all the
monsters are defeated or if there's no
monsters defending the hero
you can go straight for their main hero
and attack them there's more strategy
involved as in you play on the 7 by 3
grid where you can move your players
around and even activate special buffs
on the ground as you play you unlock
more stronger characters and leaders
which also have special abilities to
help you win there's also two ways you
can play on multiplayer either in a
league where you slowly climb that
ladder ranks or battle players in the
same room as you
magic rush heroes is the last game on
this list and this is something I also
started playing and can't get enough of
so this is your standard 5 player RPG
game where you go through levels and
kill monsters to level up collect new
heroes and power up using runes but the
reason why I'm featuring this in my top
5 apps video is because this game also
has a tower defense style gameplay this
is great because as you play the game
you come across levels that you can use
your heroes in to defend your crystal
which is kind of like a tower defense
game so in other average RPG games once
a hero has enough power simply tapping
on their portrait will activate their
special ability but in this game you
have more freedom in a sense that you
can actually select where you want to
use your special ability for instance
the Rangers ability I can basically
target which monster to use it on
another example is using an AoE spell
for my other characters in a dedicated
area I feel like this not only adds a
new level of interaction with the game
but
so adds more difficulty because you have
more room to make mistakes for example
using a stun at the wrong time and
having the boss unleash their special
ability or using AoE blast on single
targets instead of a group of mobs those
are just a few examples and of course
you get your PvP with other players by
entering the arena so that's it for my
top 5 apps of the month if you guys
enjoyed this series make sure to smack
the crap out of that like button and if
there's an app you guys want me to check
out let me know by dropping a comment
down below and maybe I'll feature it in
an upcoming video thanks again for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
