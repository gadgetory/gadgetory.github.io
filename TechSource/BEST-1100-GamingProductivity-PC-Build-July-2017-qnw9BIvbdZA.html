uploaded back in July because that is
when the time lapse video came out for
power-chord
but because of the move everything got
postponed it and it was just a complete
mess but nonetheless we are back on
track I apologize for the delay this is
the $1100 productivity and gaming PC for
the month of July are you guys on a
budget or are you trying to save money
whenever you can that's one of the main
reasons I started deal source tech with
over 10,000 visits each day deal source
our tech helps you find deals and pretty
much everything out there from PC parts
to gaming gear not only for us but UK
Canada and Germany as well believe it or
not we have a team of four people that
constantly refresh the website with new
deals and they also cross-check them
with other websites to make sure you are
getting the best price out there so
before you guys pay full price on your
next purchase maybe consider checking
deals or tech because maybe we found the
same product a lot cheaper on a
different website but anyways I'll drop
a link to it down below feel free to
check it out if you're interested if
you're watching this video and you're on
a budget and are looking to build the
best gaming and productivity PC for
around $1,000 then look no further
because Power Core is exactly what
you're looking for at the time of
building this the entire PC cost me a
little under $1100 but prices may vary
because of cryptocurrency so please keep
that in mind so for the processor I went
with the rising seven 1708 core
processor which is great for editing 3d
modeling graphic design and perfect for
streaming it's also the better choice
among the rising seven processors
because you can overclock it and get
similar performance to these 1700 X and
even 1800 X so just to recap you save
$120 and you get similar performance to
that of the 8200 X once you overclock
you 1700's if you want more performance
and don't care about spending money
honestly I would make the jump to thread
Ripper but that is a completely
different subject and a different build
the motherboard I picked up is none
other than the a/b 350m pro 4 from
asrock it's a solid board that costs
only $75 and it supports overclocking
has four dimm slots which is great in
case
means upgrade later down the line and it
comes with two m dot two slots and a
single USB type-c I decided to save some
money and not pick up a CPU cooler since
the stock cooler was good enough to
overclock and I'll talk more about that
later on since this is a Productivity
build as well 16 gigs of ram can
definitely aid the CPU in accessing
files a lot faster so for my PC I
actually ended up using four sticks
instead because that was all that was
available to me but I do recommend
picking up two sticks of eight gigabytes
each that way you still have to freedom
slots for future upgrade ability for
storage we have before terabyte hard
drive from Seagate to store a bunch of
games and editing files and for the OS
we have a 256 gigabyte m2 from a data
powering the entire build is AC Sonic
520 watt power supply and I went with
this one because this was the only
quality power supply that is also fully
modular that cost less than 60 bucks the
case I'm using is the bigger brother of
the core v1 which I used a few times and
previous builds this is the core V 21
and as a micro ATX tower with a clear
side panel I mean it's not a bad looking
case it's somewhat compact with great
airflow and surprisingly it has a lot of
room for storage we get three hard drive
bays and three SSD tray is near the back
there's even space to mount radiators
near the top it actually supports one
two eighty millimeter radiator and two
240 millimeter rads up top personally
I'm not a fan of the clear side window
because it's showing off the hard drive
and the cables near the bottom and
speaking of the cables there isn't much
support for cable management other than
bundling them up together and hiding it
underneath the motherboard and finally
the GPU I'm using is the sapphire rx 580
which I ended up overclocking slightly
mainly because it comes factory
overclocked so I was only able to
squeeze out 300 megahertz on the core
clock and memory speeds which gave me
about 160 FPS and some
speaking of overclocking I was able to
push the 1700 to 3.8 gigahertz at one
point 3 volts after increasing the fan
speed on the CPU cooler I was actually
able to hit 3.9 gigahertz but I had to
increase the fan speed to max which was
extremely loud and I do not recommend it
looking at render times it's obvious
that the power core is the fastest PC
that I built under $1500 because it
pretty much beat out all my previous
budget builds rendering out a 3 minute
4k file in a little over 12 minutes the
1,700 hit temps of 76 degrees on full
load while a GPU remained below 70
degrees and even though I increase the
fan speed the PC still remains fairly
quiet
in terms of gaming performance the RX
580 is the perfect card for HD gaming
because it will easily get you over 60
FPS and high or max settings across the
board but if you guys want to play in
quad HD you're going to have to upgrade
the GPU to either you 1070 or the new rx
Vega 56 if you guys want to see how
those two cards compare against each
other I'll drop a link to the benchmarks
down below and that pretty much wraps up
the video again I'm really sorry for the
delay and all there's a lot of you guys
have been asking me on Twitter when the
benchmark video is coming up I hope you
guys enjoyed it nonetheless I'll jump
into all the parts used in the build
down below in case you guys are
interested in if you feel about some
feel free to drop a like to show your
support and if you guys didn't like the
video clearly to dislike as well that is
okay too
I got a pretty cool thread Ripper build
coming up very soon so make sure you
guys are subscribed that way you don't
miss out I love your toenails thank you
so much for watching I will see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
