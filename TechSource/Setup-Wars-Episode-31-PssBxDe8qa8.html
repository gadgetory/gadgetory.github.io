guys is that back again from tech stores
and welcome to setup wars episode 31
where you submit your desk setup to get
featured on a channel if you all need to
the show and want to submit your setup
make sure to watch the video linked down
below a little that said and done let
the setup wars begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always everyone's gear from their setups
will be linked down below but here are
your 5 lucky contestants Julianne Marc
Rafi
Roberto Sam who that's for making it to
setup wars episode 31 first up is Julien
with a WoW setup now this is the type of
quality I expect for my submissions you
guys it doesn't matter if your setup is
just a laptop on your bed if you send me
high-quality pictures like this you will
get featured I think I rejected over 50%
of the submissions I received mainly
because of poor quality I get super dark
images very blurry very grainy pictures
but enough about that we have a
custom-built
desk and a monitor stand which holds up
to Asus 21 inch monitors on the desk we
have an anchor wireless keyboard Corsair
Mouse and a pair of cyber acoustic
speakers but that view though probably
the coolest part of this setup no doubt
but check this out guys he has blinds
that doubles as a projector screen which
he has an Xbox hooked up to we also have
a bunch of wall shelves with some lens
show fees which I'm really curious as
how you even reach the top shelves caleb
anathan is great I don't see any on the
ground and down here we have the PC and
a pair of em 50s near the bed we have a
shelf full of antique cameras and a
bunch of photos up top which is safe to
assume were taken by you it definitely
seems like you have a passion for
photography so I wish you the best in
your life and your career but thank you
James for entering next up is Mark with
a 34 inch ultra wide monitor by LG
hooked up to an arm off to the side on
the desk we have the Blackbird
mechanical keyboard and we have a
Logitech g600 two miles off to the side
to the left we have the console gaming
setup a vizio 4k TV and a ps4 underneath
we also have some headphones hanging
under the wall shelf a Sony wireless
headset and a Corsair Vengeance 1500
hanging from the Audio Technica
headphone cable management is really
good but Jesus do you really need that
many power strips
I can't 1 2 3 4 and I think there's
another one in black why don't you just
get 2 large power
and then put one on each side I think
that will really minimize the amount of
plugs you use for your wall outlet I do
have to give you props for having the
monitor arm off to the side it really
gives the monitor a levitating effect
honestly looks way cleaner that way I
may have to do the same for my setup
powering the setup is a 4770k and an AC
780ti which mark is planning to upgrade
to a 980ti
or dual nine 70s know what the 980ti if
you have the money but overall an
awesome setup thank you Mark for
entering at number three we have Rafi or
Rafi with some eye candy 323 inch
monitors a Microsoft 800 keyboard and a
Logitech performance MX mouse which
means this is a Productivity setup we
also have a pair of Sony speakers on the
table and a custom-built PC rocking an
i5 4460
and a GTX 970 great work with cable
management I like how you use the velcro
straps to combine the cables together I
would strongly advise against using zip
ties because if you ever need to swap
out or remove devices then it's going to
be really annoying but yeah not much
else to say really pretty
straightforward setup I would maybe
recommend some hangers for your headsets
but other than that a very clean and
sexy setup Thank You Rafi or Rafi Rafi
for entering next up is Roberto with a
quad display 3 ASIS 27 inch monitors any
massive Samsung TV up top which is
hooked up to the Xbox one under that's
we have a Logitech G 19 s keyboard
MadCatz rat 9 Mouse on top of the
extra-large
enhance gaming mouse pad because of a
pair of Logitech Z 5500 speakers and a
national a 50 headset hanging from
somewhere I have no idea where though
kale Baldwin is spot on we have the
popular IKEA Signum rack which is
holding up the cables and we have a
parish tip attached to the roof of the
desk I also like the cable shields you
put on the wires from the TV and
monitors that definitely cleans up the
overall desk set up the TV isn't exactly
centered with the three monitors which
really messes with my OCD and but
overall I'd say you have a killer set up
Thank You Roberto for entering last but
not least we have sand whoo with a
triple display setup three ACS 24-inch
monitor side-by-side with an apple
keyboard and mouse as peripherals on the
left side we have a sony laptop pair of
Beats solo headphones
and a sweet-looking black-and-white
build in between a 4790k clock to four
point seven and a gtx 980 hall-of-fame
addition caleb management can definitely
be improved by using cable sleeves and
velcro straps which I will leave down
below also the LED strips would look a
lot better in the back of the table
instead of the front the point of having
LEDs is to get that glow effect behind
an object and not have them visible in
the front I also think that three
monitors side by side in a straight line
like that is not productive at all I'm
almost positive that you are not able to
see the edges on both of the outer
monitors without having to lean forward
so either bring those monitors closer or
go with a dual monitor setup because I
feel like you aren't really utilizing
all of those pixels but yeah other than
that it's a great setup sound whoo thank
you for entering so that's over this
