to find out what's up guys it's that
back again from tech source and it's
that time of the month again where I
reach out to my Twitter followers and
ask you guys to ask me a question with
the hashtag ask Edgar let's do this are
you going to do a series where you help
the smaller youtubers and give them a
shout outs to help them grow yes Kyle
actually if you guys have been following
me on Twitter I announced two new series
happening either January or February the
first one is a set up Wars youtuber
edition where you guys send me a 60
second footage of your set up while
you're yeah while you are doing a
voiceover of your setup and then
obviously I'll have your YouTube account
linked there and then linked in the
description section so it's gonna it's
gonna be really great series to kind of
showcase the youtubers out there but you
have to have between 50 subscribers and
100,000 if you have less than 50 or if
you have over 100k you don't qualify the
second series I'm actually partnering up
with ash from c4e tech and me and him
are gonna be doing a series where we
basically just promote other YouTube
channels again the between 50
subscribers and a hundred thousand
basically we're gonna give you guys a
minute of on-screen time and you're
gonna be talking about your tech channel
what do you do on there and basically
anything else you want to tell the
subscribers or the viewers but yeah keep
a lookout on those like I said if you
follow me on Twitter you guys will get
all of those updates
would you ever suggest anyone to take up
youtube as a job that's a tough question
Krishna I don't know what to believe
stay there if you do YouTube as a job it
will never succeed
it always has to start off as a passion
as a hobby first and then slowly as it
becomes as it grows and then and only
then becomes a full-time job or a career
for some people if you were a girl what
would be the first thing you would do
call my friends up and have a girls
night out would you ever keep your own
setup a seal of approval I'm surprised I
never got asked that question before
Joe Rick before probably not but I've
improved my setup a lot since before
I've got the acoustic foams and the
coasters and a mechanical keyboard so
yeah you know what
probably not what's your best PC you've
built in this channel that is an obvious
one that goes to raise ox the NZXT
green-themed Titan X SLI build I did in
December I'll leave a link down below if
you guys missed that that's actually the
my best video ever done for the channel
and by far the best PC I've built and
I'm really happy with the way it turned
out how do you see the future of your
channel and do you think that there is
something to improve christian Kuta for
man for asking me that question the
answer is yes there's always something
to improve doesn't matter what equipment
you're using there's a matter of the
type of content you're putting out there
is always room for improvement so yes I
doesn't want to improve my audio and you
know what I'm thinking about upgrading
my camera even though I said in the past
I probably won't but maybe in a few
months you might see a new camera
upgrade but I'm always trying to make my
next video better than the one before
that's kind of what my motto is but yes
do you ever watch any channels of course
I'm subscribed to over 100 YouTube
channels most of them are music channels
and then three non tech related channels
that I watch religiously are dunkey
filthy Frank and stop a douchebag I just
can't get enough of those channels and I
feel like I'm gonna get just so bad
right now what was your biggest mistake
you made in your YouTube career nothing
really comes up on top of my head to be
honest I mentioned in my previous asking
me video that any mistakes I made I've
actually learned from it and I became a
better youtuber or a better person and
I've learned a lot from that so
really I don't think I believe to make
any big mistakes you believe you can fly
I think if you truly believe in yourself
deep down inside anything is possible
what tech series do you hope or want to
do in the future
I've been in the talks of making a new
series hopefully starting this month
it's called GPU wars basically it's
going to be a comparison between one
graphics card and the other where I go
straight to the point
all BS aside in and out really quickly
less than four minutes long what's the
price performance ratio how much
performance you get out of the car and
which graphics card performs the best I
think that's what people really want
when they're comparing graphics cards so
that's kind of the series I want to
start this month I'm working on a Titan
X versus dual 980 t is but I don't know
I'll put it up and we'll see how well it
goes how you become so confident in
front of the camera that's actually a
good question tutor it happens over time
you know I was super shy and very scared
of filming myself in front of the camera
because even though there are not many
people around me I know that thousands
of people who'll be watching a video so
that kind of freaked me out at first
that's actually one of the reasons why
when I started the channel I was never
really in front of the camera you guys
would only see my hands doing unboxings
and stuff like that but the more you do
it the more you become calm obviously
the more you become confident so it's
just like I said matter of time will you
ever do a challenge video that's
actually really good question this is a
tech channel you know and it'll always
be mainly a tech channel I think the
farthest I've ever ventured all from non
tech related content is my vlogs which
is funny because most of my vlogs have
more views I'm actual tech content but
that's irrelevant but I don't know I
mean once in a while maybe I'll throw in
something silly to kind of just take a
break from tech but I would depend on
the content it would depend on the
challenge of course but I did I will
leave a strap holding down below if you
guys want to see some challenges I guess
let me know by voting
what video was the most fun you had
making oh my god this was an easy one so
I made a $1000 iPhone success case about
a month ago and I think it went viral
and it got a bunch of like hate comments
on it and a lot of troll comments
because of the price
Tagg so I went through the comments
section and picked out the best comments
and I made a video of me reading those
comments and it was the best time ever I
had so many retakes I was cracking up
the entire time by far the best video
ever did I'll drop a link up there of
you guys when I check it out in case you
missed it
Berle please show us your dancing skills
that's not a question what software do
you use and do you plan on using
different software and that's a really
great question Carlo thank you for
asking me
so mention this many times before the
program I use is Sony Vegas Pro 13
because at the time when I started the
channel I picked up a free version and I
kind of just stuck with it for the past
two and a half years and I've learned so
much from it that it just doesn't make
sense for me to start learning a new
program but honestly believe me when I
say this and I always say it but if I
can go back in time and change my mind I
would definitely start using Adobe
Premiere instead just because it offers
a lot more than Sony Vegas Pro 13 right
I'm actually learning how to edit on
Adobe Premiere on the side whenever I
have free time because I know eventually
I'm gonna have to make this switch I'm
just really tired of the YouTube
tutorials they're scattered everywhere
and you can ever find a really great
video on learning Adobe Premiere which
is why I've been using the lunar comm
for the past few months I'm sure you
guys have heard me talk about it a few
times already but this website is
awesome and I would recommend it to
anyone that wants to learn something new
if you have thousands of videos shot on
HT with very clear instructions whether
you want to learn how to edit or shoot
videos or even learn how to use a DSLR
to make great videos they also have
videos on coding design business music
and a bunch of other topics but if you
like me and want to learn something new
then you can try them out for 10 days
for free by visiting lynda.com/tekzilla
not gonna drop your link to it down
below so yeah hopefully I can make the
switch to Adobe mid 2016 that's kind of
what I'm aiming at but I'll definitely
keep you guys updated so that's a for
the video thank you guys so much for
watching if you enjoy these AskMe videos
