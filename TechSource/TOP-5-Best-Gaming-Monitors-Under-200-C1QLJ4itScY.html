and welcome to another installment of my
top 5 tech series this time gonna be
taking a look at the best gaming
monitors under 200 bucks and you guys
can find the links down below if anyone
is interested now this is a little above
your budget you guys can check out my
top 5 gaming monitors under 150 that I
did a few months back and I will leave a
link to that down below as well let's go
ahead and begin so we're gonna start
from the most cheapest and work our way
up to the best gaming monitor so first
up we have the Acer 23.8 inch IPS
display now although it has a 4
millisecond response time I put this in
here since it's the best-looking monitor
and features an IPS display with super
thin bezels for connections it features
an HDMI DVI and a VGA port but please
keep in mind that this is an IPS display
which means that you get vibrant colors
and great viewing angles in exchange for
it being glossy and reflective so if you
sit near a window with lots of sunlight
you might want to look elsewhere the
only three negatives about this monitor
is that it doesn't have better
compatibility meaning you can't mount a
smarter anywhere it also doesn't have
built-in speakers and the height cannot
be adjusted the Acer R 240 hy is
excellent for a multi martyr setup
because of those super sexy and thin
bezels and that is why I included it in
this list move it on up we have the Dell
twenty three point six inch TN monitor
with a 2 millisecond response time and a
60 Hertz refresh rate the bezels aren't
as thin as the Acer monitor we just went
over but it's still pretty slim for
connections we have a VGA and two HDMI
1.4 ports which is awesome if you want
to connect your PC and a gaming console
without having to plug anything out this
is a TN panel meaning you don't get as
vibrant colors or great viewing angles
as an IPS display but you do get an
anti-glare screen however there is an
IPS option for 17 dollars cheaper if
that's something you prefer more the
negatives are no VESA compatibility
built-in speakers DVI port or height
adjustability but overall this is a
solid and fast gaming monitor for around
150 bucks if 60-hertz just doesn't cut
it for you guys the Q next 24-inch
monitor is also a great option you get a
144
Hertz refresh rate 1.5 millisecond
response time gaming monitor for only
170 bucks for connections you only get a
single DVID port which isn't the best
but at least as VESA compatible and has
built-in speakers for the record the
built-in speakers and most monitors
pretty much suck but it's still a nice
feature to have compared to not having
it
negatives the monitor doesn't come with
any HDMI ports it's not compatible with
Max or DVI D adapters and doesn't have
height adjustability also it's not
compatible with all GPUs which is
interesting so if you guys going to be
purchasing this make sure you keep the
original box because if it doesn't work
with your PC you guys can send it back
but if you're on a budget and want to
only 144 it's gaming monitor this is
pretty much a really good option for 170
bucks you won't be able to find anything
cheaper and by the looks of it it's most
likely on sale and probably won't be
available forever
at number four we have the BenQ RL 24
which is a 24 inch TN panel with a 75
first refresh rate and a 1 millisecond
response time for connections we have a
dual link DVI to HDMI and a headphone
jack the monitor is also Wester
compatible and does feature built-in
speakers which is nice please keep in
mind that even though it stays the
monitor is 75 Hertz
it does come with a 60 Hertz of fresh
straight out of the box so you will need
to manually either select the 75 Hertz
option or overclock it in order to
achieve these 75 Hertz or fresh rate
which is super easy to do I'll leave a
link to a youtube video that will show
you how the only negative is that you
can adjust the height but overall a very
solid gaming monitor with lots of
awesome features last but not least we
have a 24 inch monitor from Acer with a
144 Hertz refresh rate any one
millisecond response time ladies and
gentlemen this here is the best bang for
your buck gaming monitor under $200 for
connections and as one of each a VGA
dueling DVI HDMI and even an audio jack
the monitor is also VESA compatible in
fact the only two features that it's
missing are the built-in speakers and
height adjustability which seems to be
very common on monitors in this price
range if you have 200 dollars to spend
on your next gaming monitor this should
definitely be on your list I do want to
give an honourable mention to the 25 you
157 for those that prefer an all
- I'd murder instead this one sports an
IPS display with a 60 Hertz or fresh
rate and a 5 millisecond response time
which is pretty decent for gaming and if
you need a monitor for productivity this
is definitely something I would
recommend as it features srgb over 99%
which gives you excellent color
reproduction and accuracy for ports
unfortunately it only features two HDMI
and one audio jack it doesn't have any
built-in speakers or height
adjustability it does however have a
VESA compatibility if you've been in the
market for an affordable ultrawide
monitor this is one of the best options
out there so you should definitely check
it out as always if you guys enjoy my
top 5 tech videos be sure to hit that
like button to show your support and
want to give huge things - kamigami
robots for making this video possible
which are these little guys over here so
check this out guys these are kamigami
robots you can basically build one
yourself while learning the basics of
programming and create and play
interactive games it's perfect for any
age especially if you have kids or
family members who are into robotics
programming or just tech in general the
best part about these is that you don't
have to have any experience whatsoever
to build and play with these so I've
been messing around with these the past
few days and it's pretty addicting to be
honest I think if you have pets these
toys would be even more effective so the
way it works is this you get a sheet
with a bunch of cutouts that you will
need to build yourself a robot you can
then control it using a smartphone or
tablet as well as program and create
games and interactions while learning
the basics of coding you can make them
race battle with other robots scare your
significant other by making it seem like
there's a bug attacking err I mean the
possibilities are open to your
imagination in terms of durability these
things can surviving 60 feet drop so
rest assured that they won't break
easily I honestly think this is a pretty
cool gift for any age not only do you
learn how to build and write code but
you can have fun with it as well
normally these things go for 100 bucks
but since your subscribe to the channel
you can get $40 off the price for your
limited time just visit kamigami robots
