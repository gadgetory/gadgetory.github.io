and today I'm going to show you how to
unlock your Samsung Galaxy s5 smartphone
for all countries regardless of what
carrier you have unlocking your phone
allows you to use your phone with other
networks in the process is completely
safe and does not harm your phone in any
way so first off we need to get the lock
code for the phone before we proceed
with the unlocking procedure I
personally use the unlocking company for
all my devices simply because they have
the lowest prices in the market with the
fastest delivery speeds so to
demonstrate the process I'm going to use
the t-mobile Version and unlock it so I
can use it on my ATT network and like I
said earlier it's the same exact steps
for all countries and carriers worldwide
so head on over to the unlocking
company.com and once you're there you're
going to be selecting your phone
manufacturer and the phone model from
the drop-down list and once you do that
select get a locking code which takes
you to your next step which is to select
what country purchased the phone from as
well as the carrier of the phone and
please note that this is the carrier of
the phone that it originally purchased
from in my case it's t-mobile you will
need the phone's IMEI number to continue
and I'm going to show you how to look it
up on your phone so open up your dial
pad and enter in star pound zero six
pound and the code will immediately show
up and you will need to enter that on
the website to continue make sure you
select the correct currency for your
country before moving on and once you
select get unlock encoded purchases
securely via PayPal they will email you
the code and the price and time vary
depending on the phone but they do
guarantee that you are getting the
lowest price and fastest delivery times
once you receive your code via email
it's time to unlock your device so
before we continue make sure that the
phone is powered off next go ahead and
remove the backplate of your phone and
then remove the battery so you can gain
access to the SIM tray go ahead and
insert your SIM card that's from another
carrier into the slot if your SIM card
is a different size then you have to
adjust it in order for it to fit there's
actually a link in the description below
to show you how it's done
once you insert the SIM card into the
slot put back the battery and the back
case and go ahead and power on your
phone once it boots up it will recognize
the unaccepted SIM card and it will ask
you to enter in you
pin number this is where you input the
unlock code that was sent to you via
email once the phone accepts your PIN
number your phone is then unlocked and
you can begin using it immediately and
that's basically how you unlock your
Samsung Galaxy s5 smartphone if you guys
