went through all the stuff that was in
the bag and then I forgot to mention
actual bag itself you know sometimes I
wonder if I'm on the right path in life
so to make sure I don't make the same
mistake as last time I'm gonna talk
about the bag first this is called the
mag sach from the company nutsack
nutsack the max H is compact yet it has
plenty of space for the essentials
the bag is american-made and they use
the best materials like top grain
leather and waxed canvas to make their
bags not only look good but last a long
time it's actually backed with their
lifetime warranty as well which is
awesome I think the reason why it's
called max H is because it features a
magnetic closure system which I like it
doesn't require extra clips or zippers
to open up so how much tech can this
thing actually carry well as I said
before I only take the essentials
basically the tech I need to survive the
weekend or the whole week depending on
where I'm going by the way everything
you've seen this video will be listed
down below in the order that they appear
but zipping open the main compartment we
are greeted by a few pockets and one
more zipper pocket near the back which
is where I store my custom painted iPad
air 2 the dimensions are 11 by 7.5
inches which is perfect for standard
tablet sizes basically if you have the
iPad air 2 or anything smaller it would
fit in the satchel no problem the middle
compartment is where I store my
Bluetooth keyboard for my tablet in case
I need to respond to emails write notes
or anything that requires lots of typing
it folds up into an actual stand where I
can place my iPad on and start typing
away I love it it's awesome I personally
hate typing using a touchscreen which is
why I carry this with me and actually
feature this exact same one in my cool
tech for December 2015 and since then
I've been using it all the time also in
the bag there are two compartments on
the opposite side where I store my
anchor power bank and two charging
cables one Lightning and one micro USB
cable along with an anchor wall charger
in case I run out of juice from my power
bank I like using this specific wall
charger since it comes with two USB
ports that feature IQ technology which
means I always get the fastest charging
option available for anything I plug in
like my phone or tile
it or even the Powerbank itself and
finally the last zipper pocket near the
front is where I keep my Sony mark 4 in
case I decide to start vlogging or
taking pictures followed by my favorite
pair of earbuds which were featured in
cool tech of April a few weeks back I
absolutely love these and for the price
you can't beat them what's actually sad
is that these are way better than most
of the earphones I've used that cost
over a hundred bucks I can't recommend
them enough you guys have to watch the
cool tech video or check them out on
Amazon but that's basically all the tech
I take with me when I'm traveling for
pleasure if you guys are interested in
checking out the satchel or other bags
like this then be sure to visit the
first link in the description section
below I personally love the bag and
actually took it with me to my birthday
weekend to Santa Barbara on April 8th
and I had zero complaints so thank you
nutsack for making great bags not SEK
that's basically if they guys so much
for watching if you enjoy these what's
in my tech bag videos make sure to leave
a like I'll see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
