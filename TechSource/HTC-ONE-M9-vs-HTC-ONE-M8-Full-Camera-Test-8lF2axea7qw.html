welcome to another ultimate camera
comparison video this time we are facing
off the HTC One m9 against its last
year's model the m8 but Before we jump
into the samples let's take a quick look
at their specs so the m9 has a twenty
point seven megapixel rear facing camera
with an aperture of 2.2 that can shoot
up to 4k resolution at 30 fps and the m8
has a 4 megapixel dual camera that can
shoot up to 1080p resolution at 60fps
both of the phones also come with
digital image stabilization and the m9
can also shoot in slow motion in 720p at
120 fps so for front-facing cameras the
m9 has a 4 megapixel camera and the m8
has a 5 megapixel camera and both can
shoot in 1080p at 30fps alright so
that's it for the specs let's sit back
relax and take a look at some samples I
hope you guys enjoy the video
you
what's up you guys it's ad from tech
source and this is the sound and
stabilisation test between the two
phones that you see on the screen also
make sure to look at the audio icon
somewhere on the screen and it will
indicate which phone's audio it is being
used basically now all phones are
strapped on to one device and they are
secured so basically what you are
looking at is a fair and controlled
stabilization test also if you guys are
into these types of camera tests that
make sure hit that subscribe button
because there's a lot more coming soon
so I'm not sure why HTC didn't include
continuous autofocus for the flagship
phone you would think at this point it
would have added a very important
feature to their cameras so if you want
to focus during video you're gonna have
to manually do it by tapping on the
phone same goes for the m8 it can get
really annoying having to touch the
display often just to focus on an object
that you want you and it also shakes the
phone slightly so you won't get smooth
footage so both phones did a decent job
during the day I have no complaints on
either of the phones the m9 does seem to
have a bit more contrast whereas the m8
seems more truer to life I also notice
that the m9 has trouble picking up Reds
like this flower over here there's just
way too much contrast at times for
indoor shots dm9 has a better white
balance however it over exposes the
background when focusing on black
objects when it comes to selfies the m9
is a clear winner very sharp with
vibrant colors makes this one of the
best phones with a front-facing camera
switching to night shots is where the
competition ends both cameras are pretty
bad exposure is slightly higher on the
m8 which means you get to see a lot more
around the object but the bright lights
get washed out both phones also have a
lot of white noise especially in areas
where the light source is minimal
interestingly enough the m8 has a much
better flash than the m9 I guess HTC is
going backwards in this department I'm
not really sure what's going on there
not that the m8 flash is the best but
it's certainly better since it doesn't
flash the crap
the object for daylight video I noticed
the m8 footage a little darker if you
pay attention to the windows also there
seems to be more contrast in the m8
video the bushes have an odd tint of
green to them also the high dynamic
range on the m8 sucks
some parts are underexposed whereas the
others are overexposed surprisingly the
m9 does a much better job during the day
even though both phones don't have
optical image stabilization the m8 seems
to be less shaky from what I can tell I
don't know what you guys think for
low-light video DMA takes the lead but
only by a little the footage just looks
more sharp it has a lot less white noise
and you can actually read the signs
without any problems so the final
verdict well both phones are equally bad
when it comes to low-light performance
it's simple as that
but surprisingly enough the m8 duo
camera did a lot better than this year's
model I'm not sure why HTC has done
created like this but I hope next year
HTC can get their together and put
in an actual decent camera to compete
with other flagships anyways that's it
for the video let me know what you guys
think do you agree or disagree with my
results drop a comment down below to let
me know as well as leave a like if you
enjoy the video or a dislike if you
didn't if you want to see more chemical
persons on your favorite smartphones
then be sure to hit that subscribe
button because there are plenty more
coming your way thanks again for
watching this is that from tech source
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
