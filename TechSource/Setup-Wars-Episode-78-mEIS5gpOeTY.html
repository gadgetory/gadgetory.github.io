you want to check it out as always you
guys can find the gear for everyone
setups linked down below but your five
contestants for this week are I'm gonna
butcher this name I know it's Kevon CEO
Nigel Tim Robert and Toby let's begin
starting off the episode we have Kevon
CEO and a very clean set up and again I
apologize if I butchered your name I do
love the wood tabletop combined with the
white Alex atom unit the contrast is
amazing and I feel like the colors are
well balanced there isn't too much of
one color and that's one of the things I
really love about this setup the monitor
he is using is the Acer 27-inch that
features a 165 Hertz refresh rate and
gsync needless to say this is a gaming
setup he also has the courser strafe RGB
keyboard and a me onyx caster for audio
he has a pair of AKG K 712 pros hooked
up to a Motty DAC and amp I mean it
spelled so I hope that's how he
said I also like how he balanced that
with a cactus plant symmetry is
definitely on point for this setup and
so is cable management everything is
neatly wrapped up and hidden behind the
drawer the PC is rocking has a 6600 K
and a gigabyte GTX 1080
just beautiful work with the cable
management and overall a beautiful setup
thank you Kevon CEO for entering next up
we have Nigel and his rocking a single
28 inch asus monitor a Razer BlackWidow
chroma keyboard and a razor Mamba
tournament Edition Mouse Friday oh he
has a pair of Logitech Z 623 speakers
and a Logitech G 35 headset I think the
hole that was drilled on the desk was a
bit too big and it's noticeable but it's
a lot better than passing the wires
across the desk instead the cable
management under the desk is done well
and everything is hooked up on the
bottom of the desk the PC is very sick
it's rocking a 6700 K and an msi gtx
980ti I don't know where people get that
red ring that's wrapped around the
cooler but I think it adds a nice touch
to the overall build I'm definitely
digging the atmosphere of this entire
room you got the joker paintings the
acoustic foams
even though one of the
pieces is falling off I see a lot of
people sticking boxes on walls now I
don't know if that's considered art
these days or there's a meaning behind
it but overall a very solid black and
red setup Thank You Nigel for entering
at number three we have PIM and a fairly
clean set up so he's rocking the BenQ
27-inch monitor that he mounted against
the wall
I can't even tell if this is in the
kitchen or in his actual bedroom I've
never seen tiled against a wall before
that's pretty weird anyways moving on so
he also has the Weiser Deathstalker
keyboard cursor m65 Pro Mouse on top of
the Razer Firefly mousepad for audio he
is using solo beats and he also has an
audio interface near the back which is
hooked up to a pair of massive behringer
speakers and since we are down here
let's take a look at the cable
management not a bad job I mean there is
some tape used to hold the stuff up but
for the most part everything is kept off
of the ground I have no complaints here
it also appears that you are a Witcher 3
fan judging by the models you have on
your desk
it may seem a little random having a
motherboard in the corner there but I
don't know I kind of like it the PC now
that's a different story
so we have a custom black and yellow
water-cooled build inside the be quite
dark Bass Pro 900 case and it's looking
bouse it's interesting that you added
some red to your color scheme but
nonetheless it's a sick looking PC oh by
the way it's rocking a 6700 K and a gtx
1070 definitely some beefy specs in
there other than the obvious
recommendation for a hanger for your
headphones this is a solid setup Thank
You Pym for entering next up is Robert
with a mind-blowing quad display setup
this dude is rocking three 27-inch Asus
monitors a Samsung soundbar right above
that and a massive 65 inch panasonic
plasma TV mounted against the wall look
at this symmetry just beautiful he also
has the Deathstalker chroma keyboard and
a razor Anansi mouse which is routed
through the desk so it looks like he's
going for a black and white theme and I
liked how he kept it consistent
throughout it might seem that there's a
lot of stuff on the desk but they are
all essentials there's nothing extra or
miscellaneous that just takes up the
space he has both an Xbox one and a ps4
which are skinned and white we have an
OE ax which is used for all
emulators and also a USB hub since his
PC is on the floor for audio he's
rocking a pair of astro a40 s4 console
gaming and for recording audio he has an
audio technica ad700x microphone hooked
up to the Focusrite audio interface
which by the way is also skinned to
match his setup I definitely loved
seeing that you know just because a
product comes in a different color that
doesn't match your setup it doesn't mean
that you are stuck with that color guys
you can definitely mod it either paint
it or skin it Robert is a prime example
of this cable management is also done
really well everything is tied together
and kept off of the ground no complaints
here picking up the ground this is where
he keeps the PC which has a 6700 K and
an EVGA GTX 970 I have to stop and give
you some serious props on your drawings
dude these are incredible I think this
drawing is of markiplier but I could be
wrong and then we have Saitama I think
that's how you say it from one punch man
which is currently my favorite anime and
freaking Super Saiyan 1 Goku god damn
he's uncredible
oh and your pet turtle is really cool
too amazing setup thank you Robert for
entering last but not least we have Toby
with a simple ultra white setup so he's
rocking a 34-inch from Dell in between
2t full CS 25 speakers he also has the
CM storm rapid-fire keyboard and an asus
rog Gladius mouse on top of the Razer
Firefly mousepad what's really cool is
that Toby is actually working on a
custom mechanical shortcut keyboard
props on that also on the desk we have
two boom arms one for a samson mic and
one for his lamp cable management on
this setup is definitely planned really
well he installed some hooks underneath
which is holding the wires and you also
attached his amplifier on the bottom of
the desk using some 3m tape we also have
a custom hanger which is holding up his
bare dynamic dt9 90's near the front and
finally his custom pc is rocking a Xeon
e3 1231 processor and a GTX 1080 in a
custom loop I guess this is a very mild
black-and-red setup but a very nice one
at that with excellent cable management
Thank You Toby for entering so that is
