welcome to my new series well I don't
know if it's new series yet it depends
on you guys you can enjoy it but it's
going to be a monthly reoccurring series
at the end of every month I'm calling it
the recap unless I come up with a cooler
name because that sounds lame and boring
but it depends if you guys like it so I
did in this video if you enjoyed leave a
like if you don't leave a dislike just
so I can just do I know if I should
continue this or not but basically in
this video I'm going to recap the entire
month of tech stores give you guys some
updates on what's going on with the
channel future projects coming up any
things happening with me personally I'm
going to be going over winners of the
giveaways if there are any giveaways for
that month also go winner go over the
winners of setup wars and basically just
stuff like that I also mentioned then
you giveaways that are happening for
that month in case you guys missed it
but I think yeah what that said let's go
ahead and dive right in and start off
with the comment of the month
so Eric d-21 9 commented commuters 77
thumbs up Wow
it is a type of person to overclock his
blood flow so the reason why I like this
one is because I see a lot of these
comments as a type of guy to overclock
his dishwasher to cable managers pubes
you know I see a bunch of those comments
but this one is unique because I've
never seen this one before and I thought
was pretty interesting 377 seven people
thought this was humorous so that's why
I awarded you the comment of the month I
don't even know that makes any sense how
do you overclock a blood flow the second
update on the channel is I got a new
camera this just came in literally the
same day the Ursa mini pro 4.6 K let me
sitting at the side of the box this
thing is a beast I carefully researched
guides on my next camera upgrade because
it was time to move on from the gh4
which is what I'm using to record this
video in all my videos but I want to get
into the cinema world I want to go on
some I want better video quality guys
and huge four is pretty bad when it
comes to low lights and I'm surprised at
the gh4 got me to a million subscribers
but now I think it's time to move on
guys to bigger and better things so it
was basically between this the sony fs7
and the weapon red or the red weapon I
should say which is complete overkill I
sat down I thought about it I'm like you
know what this pretty much has the same
quality as a red weapon if you use the
right lens I've seen comparisons online
where the quality is pretty much
identical we can't even tell the
difference between this and a red camera
so yeah it's actually a lot more
portable it's more affordable I think
this is around five thousand dollars
just the body itself but much needed
upgrade guys I'm very excited to give
this a test I've already bunch of outer
two lenses I've ordered a bunch of
accessories like a shoulder rig a base
plate external battery bunch of stuff
it's going to happen so when I work on
my perfect desk setup episode 4 I
hopefully I can master will not master
it but hopefully I can get the hang of
this camera and shoot that video using
this it's going to look sick I'm excited
can't wait
my second update is I'm getting really
close to hiring two people the
announcement will happen sometime in
April I'm already looking for an office
space somewhere near my new home which
will be completed and made by the way
and I'll be moving at its place in May
so hopefully everything will be situated
by June or July so I'm looking for two
people full-time that's going to help
with text source shooting videos editing
just a bunch of things one person who is
basically knows a lot about PC contents
and one other person who knows about
everything else like TVs monitors
smartphones and stuff like that so two
people specialize in two different
things or one person can specialize and
everything then that's perfect but
anyways if you guys live near LA and are
interested in opportunity make sure you
stick around on the channel because the
announcements going to happen sometime
in April so yeah next update is I got my
AMD rising five samples as you guys can
see you got both the 1500 X and the 1600
x12 six core ones the four core quad
core whatever and I'll be doing my
comparisons against the 7700 and the
sixteen hundred K as well so stick
around for that so before I go over to
five winners of setup wars for the month
of March I'm going to be going over top
five wanted tech from a nice app and by
the way ten of these products will be
given away to you guys so make sure you
stick around if you want to know how to
enter number one on the list is the
scepter or Skepta 22 inch 1080p monitor
with five thousand one hundred seventy
seven users wanting it now this is
actually pretty cool monitor it's
actually one of the best you can buy for
60 dollars that's one of the reasons why
it's so popular and I featured it in my
perfect setup number three I believe the
budget Edition is basically 1080p
monitor 22 inch LED you got a VESA mount
HDMI port I mean this thing is insane
for 60 bucks and I think that so many
people bought it and the price got
jacked up so if it's more than $80 I
wouldn't buy this monitor but if you can
find it between 60 and 80 definitely go
with it if you're looking for a budget
solid gaming monitor oh it's also has 60
Hertz by the way
number two on the list with 4690 votes
is the Gambia's Hermes mechanical gaming
combo it's got the keyboard and mouse to
3,500 DPI Mouse it's a mechanical gaming
keyboard honestly I picked this up for I
think around 30 bucks or $40 which was a
very solid deal but right now I think
it's actually increased in price because
so many feels 71 dollars I wouldn't buy
this now because it's if they completely
jacked up the price and it's out of
stock so apparently a lot of people were
buying it but if this goes back down to
its original price around $40 I believe
then I would definitely take this stuff
because it is a solid keyboard and mouse
combo number 3 on the list is the f1
sitaji monitor stand which is a pretty
straightforward law understand for 35
bucks it's a bit pricey honestly I think
this would be better if it's around $20
but nonetheless you guys voted for this
so it's got four years B 3.0 ports they
are pass throughs of course along with
you audio jacks and you guys can put
stuff underneath the riser like a tablet
or a laptop so a pretty cool thing to
clean nectar setup check it out I'll
leave a link below number four on the
list is the gigabyte gtx 1050 pretty
straightforward graphics card budget
graphics card for those of you who are
looking to pick one up and I think this
will actually perform is better than the
rx 460 according to my top 5 GPUs on a
$200 check it out in case you missed it
and finally we got the 7600 K coming in
fifth place with 3528 votes if you're
looking for a solid gaming processor
this is definitely the one for you if
you can't really afford the 7700 K this
is basically the next best option
actually I take that back I rather you
guys wait and see the results for the
rise and 5 CPUs especially the quad core
and see how it performs against that
before you decide to go with the 7600 K
or the 1500 X so those are the top 5
most wanted products within the nice app
that you guys voted on and as always the
most voted or Most Wanted products will
be given away so I'm going to be
doubling that so there's going to be 10
products basically two of each will be
give it away to 10 lucky people if you
guys want to participate
make sure to check out the nice app
below instructions are there I talked a
lot about the nice app and for those of
you who still don't know what that is

can also watch videos on
they're early from a lot of youtubers be
included in fact Elektra box the final
video is already uploaded here's a quick
sneak peek that's not really a sneak

don't want to spoil anything if you guys

uploaded on the nice app download it
check it out but if you don't want to
it's cool just wait next week you'll be
up on YouTube and finally here are your
four setup wars winners from the month
of March episode 92 when two spiked of
course I mean this setup was sick I just
love the way he basically put together
everything the color scheme is OnPoint
organization cable management this guys
view was seriously one of the best and I
think I gave a setup a 9 out of 10 Bravo
well done congratulations spiked so
remember so 93 we got Shane who took the
win with a very simple very clean
triple modern setup nothing really crazy
going on over here
episode 94 went to Nick with a very
interesting and unique production setup
we don't really get to see many of these
on setup Wars because most of them are
gaming setup so it's nice to see a music
production setup once in a while so very
clean very organized a lovely cable
management definitely one of the
cleanest music production setups I've
seen on the show make well deserved and
this brings us to our most recent
episode 95 budget edition and the winner
was Valentin honestly still know how to
pronounce that name I have no idea why
AJ is in your name like that Valentin
genis I think it's Valentine you just
misplaced a J or something but anyways
congratulations on that plaque and red
sick-looking budget setup it's not
high-end and it's not poor anything so
it's nicely balanced hence why it's
called the budget Edition I do want to
give an honorable mention to the worst
setup from episode 92 who you guys voted
for wills setup basically set up on
carpet this guy does even have a desk
that's pretty much why he won 2111 votes
that is a lot compared to everyone else
so yeah congratulations for winning the
worst setup I don't know if he claims
$100 or not but if you're watching this
toss me an email if you haven't already
