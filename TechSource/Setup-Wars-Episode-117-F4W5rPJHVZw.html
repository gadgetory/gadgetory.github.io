electric stand-up bass it's extremely
durable comes with a built-in memory
module and it's very quiet but the best
part about it is that it supports
virtually any tabletop from 40 to 90
inches in length this means you can
build your own or pick up the perfect
top that matches your setups team I had
mine for about a month now and I
absolutely love it it has been giving me
any problems since and I talked so much
about it in my vlog in case you guys
missed it and I strongly recommend it to
anyone that's wanting to rebuild their
set up or start a brand new one that
wants a motorized desk I'll drop link to
a below check it out if you're
interested let us set up boys begin
kicking off the episode we got a very
clean gaming setup featuring the
beautiful Pavilion monitors from HP they
are resting on a custom made desk that
I'll rebuilt himself using some IKEA
parts and it looks like he connected a
table to the Shelf on his right he's
also using one of my favorite desk pads
of all time the Rizla from Ikea which
apparently is discontinued that's a
shame but on that we got the CMS
Turkey's life keyboard and the mouse
combo for audio he's rocking a typhoon
acoustic sound system and that's pretty
much it on the desk
other than some miscellaneous items and
the gamester g3s gamepad the pc that's
powering the setup has an Intel Xeon III
processor and a GTX 970 props Ani cable
management and good choice on the
sleeving
that looks very clean cable management
is also pretty clean for the most part
aside from a few cables running through
the back of the radiator which he stated
in the notes that he does not use so
that's fine I guess a pretty
straightforward and clean setup not much
I can recommend here thank you ollie for
entering next up is Jason and his
multi-purpose setup so we've got a sick
dual ultrawide monitor gaming setup with
a 2010 MacBook Pro off to the side which
is used mainly for on-the-go the main
setup is rocking the 38 inch ultra wide
from LG which is the exact same monitor
I'm using for my setup and he's also got
a smaller 25 inch ultra white on top
it's interesting to see another person
using either
eight inch because it's so massive and
there's literally nobody else that I
know of that uses the same monitor
unfortunately it is capped at 60 Hertz
making the purpose of his monitor mainly
for productivity I gotta say the
symmetry is on point everything is
centered perfectly and the cable
management is done very well curation
definitely put a lot of work into it
setup and it clearly shows my favorite
thing about the setup by far is the way
he mounted his ultra lighting so he
picked up two ham ARP oak countertops we
got one for the actual desk and one foot
in monitor and speaker riser and you cut
off a piece of it in the shape of the
curved monitor then he installed a
mounting bracket and hooked up a display
so it kind of sits flush between the two
JBL monitor speakers it's interesting
because when you look at it from the
front it kind of looks like those
speakers have its own dedicated stand
but it's actually one piece that's very
unique and haven't seen anything like it
on the show yet the keyboard he is using
is the cooler master quick-fire rapid
with brown switches with the same
typewriter key caps we saw a few
episodes ago the mouse of choice is the
Logitech G 300s and that's sitting on
top of the library expanded mousepad a
few other things he has on his desk or
his xbox one lunar control and the
ancient iPod Classic which he modded by
the way he replaced the original 30
gigabyte hard drive with a 64 gigabyte
flash card and it's also got a new shell
I love that you made that symmetrical
with the xbox controller I just can't
get over the cable management a very
clean job with the cable clips and zip
ties also the rocky installs to keep
everything off the ground is a huge plus
but check out his beef PC guys this
thing is ridiculous it's rocking a 68 50
K at 4.6 gigahertz combined with 64 gigs
of ram and not one with two EVGA GTX
1080s and sli this is one clean looking
build and I love the unique color scheme
- it's a white and black build with
purple accents and it kind of matches
the rest of his setup - there isn't a
strong dominant color scheme that sticks
out from this setup and I think that's
one of the things I really like about it
it's very subtle but it works at the
same time there's just two minor things
that bother me and again I'm very anal
when it comes to stuff like this so
don't take it seriously but I feel like
that plant placement is a bit forced
normally I don't put stuff in front of
other objects because it doesn't look
clean and you're also blocking the
object behind it it kind of feels like
you really wanted that plant on your
desk but they didn't have enough room in
the back so you decided to just leave it
in front of the lamp blocking the view
honestly putting that on top of your PC
wouldn't be a bad idea as long as you
put something under it
so it doesn't scratch your PC case the
other option would be to replace your
plants with it but personally I think
the left looks great there and balances
the overall mood as a setup and it goes
well with your wallpaper the other minor
thing is the USB hub next to your PC
that's literally the first thing that
stood out to me when looking at your PC
I loved what you did with the other
charging hub under the monitor shelf
it's tucked away nicely so why not do
the same thing for the other one I know
you have it hooked up to your PC so
picking up something like this anchor
for port USB with an extension cable
would be perfect for your setup you can
not only hook it up to your PC but keep
it tucked away right next to the other
one again that's just my two cents the
setup you have here now is amazing as it
is and that's PC though it's freaking
impressive thank you Jason for entering
next up is no one with a quad display
set up so he's walking for 24 inch
displays we got two from Acer and two
from Dell but pay attention to the
Rockville studio monitor speakers and
how he mounted them I've seen so many
people in similar situations that either
put the speaker's sideways and put it
right onto the monitors or put them
right in front of the display which
isn't right the best effective way to
add speakers to your setup without
messing with quality if you don't have
space like Noah here is to mount them on
the wall with speaker stands obviously
it's a more permanent solution but if
you have a small desk or don't have
enough space for large speakers then
this is the best option available
another option is buying height
adjustable stands and placing them on
the sides of your setup I'll double into
the ones I recommend checking out in
case you guys are interested for
peripherals he's rocking the k70 RGB
keyboard with the MX
mr. Mouse aside from the studio monitors
up top he does have a pair of Beats
Studio wireless titanium headphones I'm
not going to give you any crap on the
beats headphones because I know my
subscribers will but what's up with the
color of your walls I like where you put
his Xbox one console right in between
the Carlton wall let's countertop and
the IKEA drawers it's it away from sight
and it doesn't take up any extra space
on the desk and while we're down here
just take a look at the cable management
it almost looks like an art piece with
those cables bending in the same
direction excellent we're keeping
everything to get Oh more drawer I see a
wider I'm just kidding it's not a big
deal but if you can run it down the back
of the monitor stand so that it doesn't
stick out it will look a lot cleaner but
again it's not a big deal the PC
powering the set up has a 44 60 na oh
jeez it's such a clean build but why did
you not replace the other cables with
the custom sleeves and you also have a
stock heatsink guys if you're not going
to be pimping a PC don't get a clear
side panel it's like buying a really
nice house that looks awesome from the
outside and when you look through the
windows and stuffing but a rat's nest
don't do that please
I'm surprised you were able to power all
four monitors with that r9 290 but I
don't know that it's a pretty decent
setup Thank You Noah for entering at
number four we got Sanae who's a retired
army vet who was inspired by my channel
to build his PC that is really awesome
and I'm very grateful for your service
it really means a lot to me hearing
those words coming from a vet
I appreciate you thank you so much for
taking your time to inter set up voice
so is rocking a 29 inch ultrawide
monitor that's sitting on top of one of
the cleanest looking desks I've ever
seen so this is the Z line designs more
than white office desk with a pullout
drawer in the middle it's also got
see-through windows on the drawers which
i think looks pretty cool on the desk
keys rocking a razor desktop a keyboard
any Naga chroma Mouse along with his
pair of insignia speakers and we also
got the HyperX cloud 2 gaming headset I
like the built-in USB hub next two
speakers and that dope looking mural on
the wall
I like how slowly transitions from black
to white and then to Ray not only does
the blend nicely with the color scheme
of everything
but I think it has a nice layer of spice
to the set up as well and then we got a
specie that's sitting on top of a custom
painted nightstand I think that's what
it is it's equipped with a 6500 K and an
msi gtx 1070 one thing I also like about
Sanae is his collectibles he has so many
of them there's even a couple of shelves
dedicated to just figurines and
collector's edition art books and guides
my dude is even a fan of Final Fantasy
yes what's up but I think the coolest
thing in his room by far is the signed
game Joost 2 from the characters that
play them I guess I think that's who
signed the cover I'm not too sure
otherwise what's the point of framing it
and putting it on the wall that's only a
clean gaming setup thank you very much
Sanae for entering and if you're
watching this video can you please send
me an email with a link to purchase that
art piece because I need something to
spice up this room is looking a bit
bland anyways thank you Center for
entering last but not least we got
William and work for through
oh my god seriously thought that was
your setup you almost gave me a freaking
heart attack but it turns out this is
the picture of his setup before he began
watching set up boards and that is
freaking awesome that my show is
responsible for this amazing
transformation now this is more like my
setup Wow that contrast is amazing
he's walking the Acer predator x34 all
too wide that he hooked up on a mount
and it looks like the death key is using
consist of the IKEA Alex yours and the
lumen tabletop the black on black
actually looks pretty nice because it
makes all the red stick out that much
more the symmetry game is also strong
here we got a pair of counter yu5
speakers on each side we also got two
figurines spaced out evenly and the Xbox
one console that's skin by B brands on
the left side to balance the PC on the
right
speaking of which is decked out with a
6700 K and MSI GTX 1080 gaming X
graphics card and the cable mods leaving
very nice aside from the speaker's he's
also using the popular m50x headphones
and the HyperX cloud revolver headset
for gaming I love how he organized the
stuff on his desk he put his audio
interface down here along with a USB hub
and the SD card reader it's all within
reach and the cable management is pretty
much flawless I love that even his cable
raceway is in black I'm pretty sure he
painted that to match his setup because
I usually comes in white I love that
dedication aside from that creepy mask
above your monitor that's a pretty sick
black and red gaming setup with flawless
cable management and symmetry it's still
crazy to think that this was once your
set up before this is probably one of
the best transformations I have seen I
hope to continue to inspire people like
you to improve their setup that's one of
the main reasons I started set up wars
in fact I actually started thinking
about maybe making a new series called
set up a makeover
where I basically show people's progress
on their setups from the beginning all
the way to the present time it's going
to be it's going to take a while to do
the episode because obviously I need to
find people who have pictures from many
many years ago but if that's something
you guys want to see done on the channel
let me know in the comments
down below but anyways double due for
this episode upset boys as always makes
