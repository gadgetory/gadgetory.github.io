monitors on the channel before and in
fact a lot of you guys know that I
personally use one for myself I've been
using the 34 UC 87 C from LG the past
year and it's been fantastic but when I
heard that LG had a newer version of
their monitors I had to pick one up and
see if it was worthy enough to replace
my already amazing UC 87 C let's start
off with some specs so the monitor has a
34 inch ultra wide display 5 millisecond
response time and a 60 Hertz refresh
rate with a 34 40 by 1440 P IPS display
which means that you get really great
viewing angles and the colors are more
vibrant compared to matte displays he
also get srgb over 99% which gives you
really great accurate colors so if
you're editing or printing stuff what
you see on your screen is really close
to what you get the monitor comes with a
beautiful silver aluminum base that
complements the curve and on the back
you can see that they went with an
all-white cover constructed from plastic
which by the way contributes to a much
lighter monitor down from 22 pounds to
only 17 point 2 and that's with the
stand it has a height range of 110
millimeters and a tilt angle from 5 to
15 degrees I also love how simple it was
to set up everything just snap it in
place and you are done no screwdrivers
needed the monitor is also VESA
compatible so you can mount it against
the wall or on your desk if you choose
to and finally back here you can find
all the necessary ports you get two HDMI
one display two Thunderbolt 2.0 two USB
3.0 and one USB 3 up fun fact actually
one of the USB ports is compatible with
quick charge 3.0 meaning you can charge
certain devices like smartphones a lot
faster if they're compatible with quick
charge 3.0 of course moving our way
towards the bottom you can find 2 7 watt
speakers which uses what LG calls their
Mac's audio technology and it doesn't
sound that bad to be honest but here's a
quick sound sample
between the speakers you can find the
joystick which is used to access the
menu and other settings Asus and Acer
definitely need to take notes from LG
when it comes to navigational buttons
the joystick method is and always will
be my favorite way of accessing the menu
it's just so much easier finally let's
talk about the curve if you're coming
from any of their previous models you
will definitely notice that the curve
this time around is noticeably more
aggressive and because of that the
actual width is shorter you can
especially notice it from the top but
honestly I personally like this change
as it provides a more immersive
experience a few other changes I noticed
from the previous models are the bezels
I didn't think you can get thinner on an
ultra-wide but I guess I was wrong
the um 98 special is a little over a
centimeter wide I've also noticed that
the colors are a little more saturated
on the UM ninety-eight compared to the
previous more flatter colors you can
especially tell on the whites now the
settings for both monitors are set to
default and the brightness levels are
exactly the same and this isn't
necessarily a bad thing
I for one enjoy the more vibrant colors
and finally the backlight bleed has been
greatly improved it's barely noticeable
and you have to have all the lights off
in the room to spot them and even then
it's hardly noticeable here's the
backlight bleed from the previous
monitor and as you can see it's much
more noticeable so we all the benefits
of going with an ultra wide monitor at
this point you have all of this amazing
screen real estate which is perfect for
editing and especially multitasking you
get to fit everything on one page and
you don't have to constantly move your
head from one side to the other
with a multi-monitor setup you also get
to watch movies in the way they are
meant to be watched in full 21 by 9
aspect ratio and finally gaming more
games are supporting ultra wide
resolutions by the day and eventually
all new releases will support this and I
gotta say gaming has never been more fun
for me so far LG has made a ton of
improvements from their previous models
and I can definitely say that they are
headed in the right direction this
monitor will cost you around 1200 bucks
depending on when you're watching this
video
this is a high-end monitor and as price
like one what that being said I would
have loved to see a slightly faster
response time and a higher refresh rate
I mean I would have been fine with even
a 75 Hertz refresh rate I'm not asking
for anything over 100 but I get it nice
features like that cost money and I'm
sure that will affect the price of the
monitor another thing to consider before
buying this monitor is the saturation
levels there's not really a huge
difference but if you're a video editor
and color grid constantly then you might
want to adjust the saturation level
slightly so who are these monitors for
actually the list will be a lot shorter
if I tell you who these monitors aren't
for so we got the hardcore and
professional gamers who demand their
precious 144 Hertz refresh rate and
gsync also streamers who actually do
need a second or third monitors to watch
chat windows and stuff like that
and lastly actually I think that's it
this basically those two needless to say
I've easily made the switch and this is
now my main monitor that I used to run
the channel so there you have it my
review of the 34 UC 98 if you guys enjoy
the video make sure to leave a like to
show your support and if you're
interested in checking out the monitor
make sure to check out the links down
below I also want to give you huge
things to LG for setting this out for
review and as always I'll see you guys
