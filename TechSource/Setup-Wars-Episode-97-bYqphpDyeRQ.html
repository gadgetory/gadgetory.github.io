talk about the giveaways that are
happening on the app nice and for those
of you who are new to the channel I've
been doing these for a while now for
every single setup fourth episode giving
away some pretty cool products like
keyboards and mice and just a bunch of
really cool gear but the app knife is
basically a free app where you can add
products to your wish list you can watch
youtube videos early from other
youtubers even myself included and also
join plenty of giveaways that are
happening constantly on the app I think
the current giveaways are happening
right now are some course their
keyboards you got the iPhone 7 read on
there I'm giving away gtx 1060 there's a
lot that's going on I'll double link if
you guys want to check it out but also
in this video I'll be giving away a
courser k95 platinum keyboard and more
info on that later in this video so make
sure you guys stick around anyways
that's it I'm done let the setup wars
begin
starting to show off we got Bader who is
welcoming me to his setup why thank you
sir
so we got the 27 inch Samsung curb
monitor on top of the custom-made riser
which I believe is using the IKEA capita
legs and a wall shelf of some sort
speaking of Ikea he is using the linen
desks and the mom drawer which is
holding up his PC it's equipped with a
4690 and a ZOTAC GTX 960 gravis card
with some custom blue sleeving
if he is just going with a black and
blue color scheme for his entire setup
blue LEDs on his razer blackwidow
keyboard and the logitech g42 mouse as
well as an extended mousepad from
Peckham with blue accents I love seeing
that consistency for audio he's got a
set of FMD speakers with the subwoofer
on the desk for some reason not a good
idea to put that there but anyways he
does have a few other things like a
phone stand USB hub and some plants as
well cable management is on the control
we have the Signum rack that's holding
up the cables any cool self-made hammock
that's used as a leg rest I'm assuming
that's pretty clever he also has an Xbox
one which is hooked up to his TV behind
him and a projector positioned above the
setup for watching movies The Selfish
party wasn't that great to be honest a
very organized black and blue setup
Thank You batter or beta for entering
I'm sorry for butchering your name once
in a while I like to change things up
and throw in an apple setup this one
from David is just immaculate he kept it
very minimalistic and symmetrical with
excellent lighting powering the setup is
the 2012 MacBook Air that's resting on
the rain' design M stand and he hooks
that up to a 27-inch a2 smarter as an
external display keeping the surface of
the desk clean we got the wireless Apple
keyboard and Magic Mouse and that's
pretty much it for the top I love the
way he routed the light bulb cables down
the side of the wall that's very clean
and even though most of the wires are
inside the rack there are a few left on
the ground and I feel like those can
easily be hidden if you rather than
behind the desk in the same style as you
light ball the routing just use some
cable clips and hook them behind your
desk so that they are not visible but
they pretty much wraps up this nearly
flawless setup thank you David for
entering a number 3 we got Kate with
another clean set up definitely loving
that desk layout of
is it looks like he combined the IKEA
our lib countertop with some steel
risers and then we got two out of doors
as the support nicely done he's only
using a single monitor and it's the BenQ
24-inch that's hooked up to an arm we
also got the Razer DeathAdder chroma
Mouse and black widow keyboard with some
custom white key caps he does have a
blue snowball mic off to the side for
voice chat or recording and then he had
said he is using is the HyperX cloud
twos which are resting on the NZXT puck
the PCI styling the setup has a 60 70 K
at msi gtx 1070 with custom sleeves from
cable mod excellent work with the cable
management and even though the wood
tabletop doesn't really match the rest
of the setups color scheme it's a hell
of a setup and you did a great job
keeping it extremely clean Thank You
Tate for entering this next setup from
William does a much better job sticking
with the black and white color scheme
near the top he has a 25 inch ultrawide
monitor from LG hooked up on the wall
and then below that we got the IKEA Alex
atom unit that's holding up the AC x34
ultra wide the keyboard is from coarser
and it's the k70 RGB rapid-fire and we
also have the logitech g502 spectrum as
well one thing that stood out to me was
the black extended mouse pad and I feel
like a white one would have looked a lot
better against that black keyboard
I mean you pretty much kept the contrast
very consistent throughout your entire
setup so I'm curious as to why you went
with a black one instead for audio we've
got two massive area 906 speakers which
also match the color scheme but he also
has two sets of headphones as well both
of them are from sennheiser the HD 598
for music and the game 0 for gaming
excellent choices cable management isn't
the best I've seen but at least he has
done something about it and has them
somewhat contained in one area and
finally we got his custom PC that's
powering this entire setup and it's a
beast
it's equipped with the 59 30 K 32 gigs
of RAM and 2 asus strix
1070 s in sli with an interesting black
and orange color scheme with some silver
accents a very sick black and white
setup Thank You William for entering
last but at least we got Zack and
another sweet looking black and blue set
up with a wall-mounted PC I don't see
these often on the show but when I do
come across one I just
errata for a bit beautiful PC with a lot
of custom work done this thing is
running on a 67 TK and a GTX 1080
founders Edition which obviously is
painted in blue to match his entire
color scheme we got custom blue sleeve
cables blue carbon fiber skins that he
stuck on his hard drive and we are I oh
and he also painted the RAM sticks and
blue accents on the motherboard very
very impressive he even kept all the
wires organized by running them through
a wall channel I couldn't be more proud
the desk he is using is from z line
designs and this is the mobile
workstation desk which looks pretty cool
but I'm personally not a fan of the
pullout keyboard tray style desk he's
got a 27-inch LG 4k monitor hooked up to
a mount and below that we got the
Corsair K 65 keyboard and Logitech g600
Mouse for audio he's got a set of
Logitech V 5 or 6 speakers we got a blue
Yeti microphone with a blue windscreen
and a pair of m50x headphones with the
level of consistency throughout your
setup I gotta say I'm pretty
disappointed he did such a good job
keeping consistent with the color scheme
however it's not complete I'm not sure
how long you've been watching my channel
but the fact that you left your Nexus 6p
and the headphones alone makes me sad I
know for a fact you have heard of the
brand before and if you went to the
extra trouble of putting blue carbon
fiber skins on some parts of your PC
then I know you are capable of doing the
same thing with your other gear
especially the headphones and smartphone
did you not know that the brand has blue
carbon fiber skins seriously picks them
up and scan your device's your setup
would then be complete as we've got to
give you props on cable management
though you have redeemed yourself there
not only are the LEDs nicely placed
behind your monitor but the wiring is
just perfect if you didn't mention that
this was your router in the notes I
honestly wouldn't have even noticed it's
pretty much camouflaged with your desk
seriously though amazing work with the
cable management and just the overall
setup in general it came out great but
it's just missing some D brand skins
I'm even willing to send some to you for
free if you promise to put them on Thank
