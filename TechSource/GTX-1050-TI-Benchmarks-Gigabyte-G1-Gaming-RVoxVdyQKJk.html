and in this video we're going to be
taking a look at the benchmarks for the
GTX 1050 Ti specifically the one from
gigabyte this is their g1 gaming Edition
and I'm not going to bore you guys with
a 10 minute long video going over specs
and bunch of nonsense I'm sure you guys
can find that on other channels if you
are interested so instead I'm going to
go over some important specs of the card
and then jump straight into the
benchmarks so first things first the
card has a price tag of 169 MSRP with a
boost clock of 1506 megahertz in
overclock mode which is the mode I used
for benchmarking it also comes equipped
with 4 gigabytes of gddr5 128-bit memory
and there windforce 2x cooling system
that features two 90 millimeter fans the
card also remains fairly cool throughout
the testing with temperatures of 64
degrees Celsius during full load and 45
on idle in terms of design nothing has
really changed on the g1 gaming lineup
it's the usual black chassis followed by
their signature orange accents near the
front and also on their backplate
you do get RGB lighting but only for the
text on the side of the GPU which you
can change through their extreme engine
utility for ports you get one DVID
3 HDMI 2.0 B and one DisplayPort 1.4 and
finally the card only requires a single
6 pin plug to power up but with that
said ladies and gentlemen here are the
benchmarks which is done on my testbed
which has the 59 30 K 16 gigs of ram and
also an asus strix x99 motherboard
so there you have it some pretty
impressive numbers coming from the GTX
1050 Ti it was pretty much going
head-to-head with the RX 470 across all
of the games that in most cases it ended
up with higher frames keep in mind that
the RX 470 goes for around $200 and the
GTX 1050 TI has an MSRP of 180 so based
on the current prices out in the market
the 1050 Ti has a performance dollar
score of one dollar and 52 cents
compared to two dollars and seventeen
cents from the RX 470 what does this
mean well it means that the gtx 1050 TI
will give you a better value for what
you are paying for
if the gtx 1050 TI prices on the market
are $200 or less then it would be the
obvious choice when the citing between
that and the rx 470 so that is it for
the benchmarks for the gigabyte g1
gaming GTX 1050 Ti if you guys enjoy
these really short straight to the point
no BS benchmark style videos let me know
in the comment section down below and
also by leaving a like it does help me
out a ton thank you guys so much for
watching as always if you want to pick
up the card I'll drop a link to it down
below and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
