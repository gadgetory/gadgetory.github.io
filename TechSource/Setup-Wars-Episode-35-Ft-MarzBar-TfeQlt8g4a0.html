as always everyone's gear for their
setups will be linked down below as well
as anything I recommend for this episode
so that said here are your 5 lucky
contestants we have Luke Rene Rob Sultan
and Zach congratulations for making it
to setup wars episode 35 first up is
Luke with a dual display setup we have
two 23 inch AOC monitors hooked up to a
custom-made monitor mount now that's
something I haven't seen before
it also looks like Luke went with a
wireless setup we have a bell keyboard
and mouse combo on what appears to be
the tiniest mouse pad in the world we
will serve a pair of Alex and Singh
speakers on the desk and a HyperX cloud
gaming headset hooked up to a wall
hanger which I'm guessing is probably
custom made as well
excellent work with the cables I see you
made good use of those spiral wraps and
velcro straps and powering this setup we
have an FX 6300 and an all nine to 70
GPU see you guys AMD builds do exist on
setup pores a very minimalistic and
clean setup no doubt Thank You Luke for
entering Renee comes in second with LEDs
up top so we have two 24 inch Acer
monitors a row cat keyboard and mouse
with a pair of yamaha CRX speakers on
the desk I don't know what that giant
white block is that's holding up your
monitors but I like it
also the desk we have a pair of wireless
headphones from Jabra and an Illumina
900 B microphone hooked up to a boom arm
pretty good job with cable management
there's a huge whiteboard that's kind of
blocking the wires in the back so it's
really not visible but I do like the
spiral wrap you use for the cables and
the keyboard and mouse I guess instead
of seeing two cables on a desk one
spiral tube is better I don't know how I
feel about the wire running up against
the wall to your LEDs
top but the only obvious recommendation
I can give you as an anchor headphone
anger to keep both of your headphones on
but other than that I really nothing
else to say Thank You Rene for entering
a number 3 we have Rob with a gaming
group set up you seriously have two TVs
next to each other holy crap so let's
start off with the actual desk setup you
have a very sexy LG 34 inch ultra wide
curved monitor seal of approval just
kidding it's an awesome monitor but it's
not enough to earn the seal and the desk
we have the logitech 800 wireless
keyboard and Logitech g600 2 gaming
mouse some of the stuff on a desk
include a pair of Z 323 speaker system
from Logitech and also from logitech
g930 wireless gaming headset resting on
top of a simple yet clean headset stand
Caleb and red is not bad at least you
moved all the wires to one side and wrap
them together so I won't give you crap
about them venturing off into the living
room we enter a whole new realm of
Awesomeness we have a freaking 120 inch
projector screen for console gaming and
after the left side we have not one but
two TVs a 46 inch Samsung and a 40 inch
philips TV on the bottom you have two
Xbox ones and Xbox 360 and a ps4 okay
why the hell do you need two Xbox ones
under the same TV I understand if each
TV had an Xbox one but regardless it's a
very impressive setup thank you rob for
entering I may just have to Rob you get
it cuz cuz it the name sultan is next up
with a single HP display on the desk we
have my favorite keyboard and mouse
combo from red dragon and a Thermaltake
mouse pad to the left of the pc setup
you have an msi gs70 gaming laptop and
also on the desk we have a razer headset
which is hanging from a phone holder
that's hooked up to the side of the desk
hey if it works it works the cable
management is also really great this is
like the third tube like wire management
device I've seen on this episode but the
reason why I feature this in setup wars
wasn't because of the actual setup it's
because of this entire room I like
looking at unique setups or gaming rooms
it's definitely different than most of
these setups I've received on the show
so on the opposite side we have a
Samsung TV mounted on the wall which is
hooked up to a ps4 and speaking about
walls I'm really
the wallpaper and wall shelves you've
added nothing quite says personality
like shelves of figurines and samurai
swords I'm definitely diggin the
atmosphere you have here you know it
isn't all about the desk setup it's also
about what's surrounding it as well and
I feel like Sultan strikes a perfect
balance I really like your room setup
Sultan thank you for entering last but
not least we have Zack - 24-inch LG
monitors and Apple wireless keyboard and
Amazon Mouse on top of the Goliath is
mousepad so that's it for this week's
episode of setup wars you guys know what
to do I'm just kidding of course there
is more excellent work with cable
management I'll definitely give you a
point for that remote placement and your
containers which have labels for certain
things
very clean setup Thank You Zack for
entering so that is it for this week's
episode of setup wars you guys know what
to do drop your comments down below and
vote on the best desk setup as always
voting will end this Saturday and I'll
ask the winner on Sunday on my Twitter
and Instagram accounts so follow me if
you must
alright so moving on to the main event
of this episode Alex Brooks is gonna be
showing off his setup go ahead and take
it away man so here we are
this is my desk tool for 2060 now I've
chosen a GT Omega racing chair right
here as you can see it's made out of
really really nice premium leather next
thing is the desk I actually built this
desk myself now on the desk here I've
got a macbook pro my phone iphone 6s
plus 64 gigabyte model this is my elite
xbox controller more on that a little
bit later and this is my keyboard eyes
because I want to show you guys
underneath this is the Razer
Deathstalker now I had the mechanical
Razer keyboard but I couldn't get along
with it because it just made far too
much racket when I was trying to record
videos but as far as cable management
goes I've drilled up drilled drilled
drill they're not the word is a hole in
the desk right there with my drill and
as you can see I've got a USB extender
coming out there oh and by the way this
is the
my onyx now 7,000 Mouse a really really
really really nice Mouse and really
enjoy using that so let's head under the
desk as you can see right here I've
actually got an LED strip just one of
the old-style ones not Philips you or
anything
and she's just an LED strip from Amazon
so these are the KRK Rokit five studio
monitors legs sort of good for listening
to music as well as mixing and mastering
audio now the monitors the actual
monitors these three Tings right here
let's talk about them and let's go left
to right so this is an asus monitors 24
inches in size and then obviously we've
got the ultra wide now this is the 34
inch ultra wide from LG i believe the
model number is 34 um 67 and this is a
great monitor for editing and you
probably get Alex why have you got all
these screens you surely can't use all
of those well yeah I can you see if I
was to open up my premiere profile that
opens up my timeline and then I have my
preview on as I say the asus because
it's very true to color and then if i
open up a file explorer which has all my
information let all my files and things
in there and then i might want to have a
twitter window open so that's the
monitors and obviously i've got a webcam
up there provided by logitech now what
i've done is just pretty much drilled a
big big big big hole through this wall
into this room so to explain this better
let's actually go into this room and
i'll show you guys what's going on so
guys welcome to the computer room this
is where i keep my computer and all of
my devices charging things Xboxes
amplify for the TV Sonos and apple TV
and a skybox
this is my computer now it's a
custom-built computer I'm rocking msi
products in here because I absolutely
love MSI their products are absolutely
stellar killer whatever word you want to
use you can see that I've actually got
an LED strip behind the computer so when
I come in here it does just look really
really really sexy then if you guys were
to see but over the top of this computer
right here there that is the other side
of where the cables come so as you can
see I've got the three display cables
for my for my monitors HDMI cable that
goes out to the monitor which connects
to the elgato capture card and the other
side of the old guard to capture card
obviously goes to the Xbox
one which is here and then this is the
wireless mix amp for my headset so guys
I believe that is pretty much it my
husband Alex you guys have been awesome
and I'll see you in my next video adios
so that's all for this episode thank you
guys so much for watching leave a like
if you enjoyed it and I'll see you in
