this can be please tell me it isn't so
two silvers made of what so whadda two
silvers made of who so whatta material
all the pretentiousness is palp
what would you last meal be if you could
choose yo you got any last requests Oh
actually yeah I do I thank you so much
for the offer I'm like a chicken pasta
very light marinara sauce I don't want
it to overpower the taste maybe with
some garlic bread on the side and a
glass of wine would be phenomenal
thank you so much now here is something
we have never seen on the show before we
have an Intel G 32:58 CPU what if you
had to pick between YouTube boy or
girlfriend what would you pick you can
only choose one alright starting off
with egg wait wait a great question
already obviously YouTube I also notice
your Baretta right next to your keyboard
why would you put that on your desk and
me my friends are gonna go out to a bar
tonight come in you have to be out of
your damn mind to buy one of those I
mean the iPhone last but not least you
can buy a 120 inch full array LED smart
TV by Vizio for a measly $130,000 but if
you sign up to the newsletter you guys
can save 5% which means that you can
save 6,500 bucks on this TV sell your
house if you have to and buy this TV you
can show it off to your friends your
family I guess you won't have a home to
put it in job well done sticking with
the Green Team and what a better way to
complete the build than a PC rocking a
nvidia gtx 980ti inside that case and oh
my dog when in God's name is going on in
that case how do you get the names for
your PC builds I get this asked so many
times the process is simple
I sit there lonely at night thinking of
my past all the things I regret
things I love and care about what is the
meaning of life is their purpose today I
don't give if this was made out of
Jennifer Lawrence's hymen no cell phone
case is worth $1,000 but I guess if you
want to blow your money on something
useless these are worse things you could
buy Jennifer Lawrence's hymen totally
chamfered Brad dude last but not least
we have your wife with a there are
literally LEDs everywhere you basically
have enough lights in here to throw in
your own grave
drops phone my case this is obviously a
Productivity type setup and like most
productivity setups the wire management
is great
my heart under the giant is next up with
a you I mean a triple monitor setup I
rather into my hands and clapped and
spend $1000 on</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
