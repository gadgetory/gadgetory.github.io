from Texas and today we are going to be
unboxing and taking a quick look at the
energy to K travel charger from tilt now
at twenty two hundred milliamps this
obviously isn't the biggest travel
charger out there but we really caught
my eye with this product are the prongs
located at the back we will get more
into that later but for now back to the
unboxing as you can see here tilt
products always come nicely packaged and
this one is no exception inside the box
you get your usual documentation and the
charger itself when holding the device
it definitely feels sturdy I feel that I
can drop this device a couple of times
with no issue which is important being
that this is a travel charger but
anyways at the front of the device there
is a light that goes in between the
colors green amber and red to let the
user know just about how much juice is
left in the power brick which is always
nice to see now one thing I always look
for in my travel chargers are the rate
that it charges a device at here we have
the energy to K charger next to a
samsung galaxy s5 power brick as you can
see here the tell charger can actually
keep up with the wall charger it's not
as fast but definitely not slow either
as I mentioned a little before the real
reason I find this product appealing is
because of the prongs located at the
back this essentially allows you to
replace your standard wall charger and
use this to charge your phone from your
wall and when you have to go just pull
out the travel charger from the wall and
now you have an extra twenty two hundred
milliamps to keep your device topped off
if you guys are looking for a travel
charger I can definitely recommend you
this product I will leave links in the
description if you guys are interested
in checking them out but anyways this is
Bob from tech Soros and I'll see you
next time
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
