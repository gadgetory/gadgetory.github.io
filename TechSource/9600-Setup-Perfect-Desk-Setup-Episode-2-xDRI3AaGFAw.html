what's up guys it's ad from Texas and
welcome to the perfect desk setup
episode two this took me over three
months to plan and set up so be sure to
hit that like button if you guys enjoy
the series and want to see more and by
the way all the items mentioned in this
video will be linked below for anyone
that is interested in checking them out
so let's talk about the color scheme
Before we jump into the parts now I hope
setup wars every Monday and I have seen
pretty much every color scheme there is
and a lot of the common ones like black
and red black and white and even black
and green so I thought I would change
things up a bit and go with a white and
green with a hint of purple originally I
wanted to go with a Joker color scheme
but I've seen a lot of those as well so
I said you know what let's go with a
perfect cell theme since I'm a huge fan
of DBZ and cell being one of my favorite
characters I knew this was going to work
out
since perfect cell has some purple on
him I had to find a way to add some
purple to the setup without making it
look forced so in the end I decided to
go with some RGB LEDs that I hooked up
behind the monitor that was definitely
the last element that I needed to
complete the setup all right so let's
dive right in and see what makes this
the perfect desk setup
starting with the MVP and the PC that's
powering this entire set up gala Dex the
$6,000 ultimate gaming and productivity
PC that I built for July I did do a
video on this and I strongly recommend
you guys to check it out when you have
some time I'll drop a link to it down
below so this beast is rocking a 69 50 X
and 2 GTX 1080s and SLI I don't think I
could have picked a better case to put
this in the NZXT s340 is truly a
magnificent and compact case that does
it all if you're planning on your next
build definitely check this case out it
comes in several colors and I'll drop a
link down below for you for peripherals
I went with the Corsair strafe keyboard
and Sabre mouse both of which had to be
RGB to stay consistent with the color
scheme I try to find an extended white
and green mousepad but unfortunately
they don't exist so I went with the next
best option and black in green mouse pad
from reflex labs which by the way has a
hole drilled inside to run the keyboard
and mouse cables through for a complete
Wireless look speaking of the wireless
look I mounted the Acer XR 34 curved
monitor on the kanto desktop mount to
make it look like it's floating right
below that I have my ps4 but not just a
regular ps4 this is custom painted by
color where they do such a great job
that I seriously can't get over the
quality not only can they custom paint a
bunch of different devices in any color
or finish you want but they also do
engravings as well which i think is
pretty badass but if you guys want to
pimp out some of your devices be sure to
check out color wear comm to see if your
device is listed on there for audio I
have a few options to choose from the
main ones however are these bookshelf
speakers with built-in Bluetooth from
Kanto these are the u5 and they come in
several different colors I actually have
you hooked up to my PC via optical cable
and they're also connected to my
smartphone via bluetooth I chose these
speakers because they sound incredible
the excellent bass and sound clarity is
the reason why I use this for watching
videos listening to music and especially
gaming they are both resting on the IKEA
lack shelves which are spray-painted
green to give up a nice contrast and I
also added two perfect cell figurines on
the top of each speaker for added
personality and symmetry of course under
the desk I have two pairs of headphones
the ath m50x is for monitoring sound and
the courser void wireless
for gaming the audio technica m50x s
aren't all around a solid pair of
monitoring headphones and i only use
them for editing videos as you can tell
they do look a little different and
that's because I added some skins from D
brand
to spice it up a bit I pretty much used
e brands on most of my devices because
they are the only skin company that
knows what the hell they're doing not
only do they have the most precise fit
on earth but they offer a wide variety
of colors and materials for a lot of
devices out there so if you guys are
interested in checking them out be sure
to visit the first link below the other
pair is used for gaming only since the
void is Wireless I can easily switch
between the PC and the ps4 using the
provided dongle it's also RGB so I can
customise the lights on the earpiece to
whatever I want
also on oDesk I added a USB 3.0 hub from
anchor that adds so much convenience I
don't even have to reach behind the PC
to connect something instead I can plug
it straight into the hub without leaving
my seat a perfect example is the USB
dongle for the void headset if I want to
switch from the ps4 to the PC I can
simply remove the receiver from the
console and hook it up to the PC using
the anchor hub instead
so as I mentioned before this is not
just a gaming setup it's also for
productivity as well hence why I went
with an ultra wide monitor I picked up
the Focusrite itraq studio interface and
hooked it up on a desk using some 3m
tape I also attached the microphone to
the road psa1 boom arm and kept it
hidden behind the monitor when not in
use when it's time to do a voiceover I
simply pull it out from the back and
position it wherever I want I wasn't a
fan of the original color so I decided
to wrap the mic with some white carbon
fiber and even painted the shock mount
green so you guys might be wondering at
this point why I went with a single
ultrawide monitor instead of a
multi-monitor setup well the main reason
is because it's all I need I'm more
about efficiency rather than quantity an
ultra-wide monitor is perfect for
editing since I can have everything on
one screen and I can take advantage of
the horizontal pixels while editing on
the timeline it's also perfect for
watching movies the way they were meant
to be watched in 21 by 9 aspect ratio I
turn off the lights bump up the sound
from the speakers and have my own movie
theater experience
and finally for gaming now I'm not a
competitive gamer by any means so I
don't care much for the 144 Hertz for
fresh wait panels the ACR x34 comes out
of the box with a 75 for its refresh
rate but I actually managed to overclock
it to 100 which is plenty for me gaming
on the PC is extremely fun I get this
immersive experience that just can't be
replicated with regular sixteen by nine
monitors even some ps4 titles support 21
by 9 like the Ratchet and Clank series I
guess what I'm trying to say here is
that the Acer ultra white is the perfect
all-in-one monitor that serves multiple
purposes for this setup so at this point
I'm sure you guys know that there is a
bunch of stuff on the desk which made
cable management very difficult but
after six hours of tedious work I've
reinforced my title of cable management
guru with the help of cable clips and 3m
tape I managed to organize everything on
the roof of the desk the real MVP though
was this channel Raceway that houses
majority of the cables overall I'm 100%
satisfied with my cable management if
you're going to be gaming and working
for hours at a time you will need a
chair that will get the job done the GT
Omega evo XL chair is not only super
comfortable but looks very cool as well
the chair comes with a removable
headrest pillow and a
lumbar cushion which is great support
for the lower back what I like about the
share is that you can adjust the angle
of the seat from 90 degrees all the way
to 170 which is great if you just want
to lay back and watch a movie from your
TV or monitor the armrest can also be
adjusted from back to front side to side
and top to bottom
but overall a very solid and comfortable
chair for both gaming and productivity
last but not least we have the desk
that's holding up everything this is the
apex desk elite series a massive 71 by
33 inch adjustable standing desk that's
actually very affordable when comparing
to other adjustable desks a few things I
like about this desk is that it has two
cutouts near the back corners which is
great for cable management and the
advanced control you can set a specific
height within any of the four buttons
located here so that all you need to do
is press any of them wants to get the
desired height that you want very cool
on top of all that the construction is
very rigid the frame is actually
constructed out of steel and it doesn't
even need a support beam a very solid
adjustable desk that offers a lot for
your money but I think that will do for
this episode guys let me know what you
think about the setup by leaving your
comments down below is there something
you would change is there something you
would add philippi to leave your
feedback down below as always if you
guys enjoy my perfect desk setup series
be sure to backhand the out of that
like button to show your support and I
can continue to do these on the channel
as always you guys so much for watching
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
