making this video to correct some things
on my previous video which was the gtx
950 TI benchmarks so it has come to my
attention that the RX 470 numbers are
incorrect
even when I was benchmarking the car
like five times and even swapped pcs to
do it I still got the same result so
even though it looked ridiculous to me I
had to do my due diligence and I had to
post the numbers because that is what
was represented to me at the time but
after spending the entire day literally
spent ten hours trying to figure out
what the problem was I finally realized
that I didn't do a clean sweep of the
drivers and that was what was affecting
the benchmarks for the RX 470 which was
weird because it didn't affect the RX
460 only the 470 and both of them are
AMD cards but I don't know guys I've
been losing my mind this entire day
trying to figure out what the problem
was I almost jumped out of the window
with my testbed in my hand but the funny
thing is this actually never happened to
me I never cleaned the drivers before I
did benchmarks so this really never
affected me before but now that it has I
will definitely take precautions for all
future benchmarks there will be no more
inaccuracies on tech source and I will
make sure that but anyways guys I'm done
rambling sorta waste your time I wanted
to make this video because I hate
putting out inaccurate information so
hopefully this video with justify and
give you guys the correct results that
you were looking for here are the real
benchmarks
and finally taking a look at the
performance per dollar once again we can
see that the GTX 1050 Ti is actually not
the best value out of the four
in fact the GTX 1063 gigabyte variant
gives you more bang for your buck so I
hope you guys enjoyed this quick
adjustment style video thank you guys so
much for your support I've been reading
all the comments thank you so much for
bringing that to my attention I assure
you this will never happen again
thank you for watching as always I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
