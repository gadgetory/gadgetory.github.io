making this quick intro to let you know
that i'm on vacation and are mean here
for two weeks then i'll be back on the
25th of june so this episode of setup
wars and the next episode are going to
have an intro similar to this because as
you can see i'm not by studio so i'm
actually at the hotel and this is where
i'm going to be doing the voiceovers for
those episodes but with that said
welcome to setup wars episode 109 a lot
of setup wars begin
starting off the episode we got Casper
and an eye-popping blue and black setup
featuring the gorgeous and extremely
thin bezel LG monitors the desk is
custom made and it's actually wrapped in
blue carbon fiber and on it we got the
Microsoft curve keyboard and the itec
mouse he doesn't have any headphones so
he's relying on the Harman Kardon sound
sticks for audio but he does have a
custom sprayed blue snowball mic as well
I appreciate the effort he put in trying
to stay consistent with the color scheme
by painting the microphone and wrapping
the table and even the ps4 console but
the mousepad kind of ruins it to be
honest some people disregard the little
things like this thinking that it will
make a huge difference but it's actually
the little things that make or break a
setup at least that's what I think cable
management can definitely be improved
but what you have right now is
definitely a great start I don't know
what those cables are connecting on the
right side but if you can use a wall
Raceway to hide them it will look a lot
cleaner under here also down here we got
the PC that's powering this entire setup
which is equipped with the FX 4350 and
then our X 480 now this is my setup I
would change some things up like
mounting the microphone on the top shelf
behind the monitors on the left side
this is definitely a setup that pops but
it still needs some minor tweaks here
and there
regardless Thank You Casper for entering
lemuel is next up with a sick triple
monitor black and red setup featuring
two Asus 27-inch monitors that are
establishing the 34 inch ultra wide in
the middle on the custom-built counter
we got the Logitech g7 10 plus keyboard
and the g502 Mouse however this time we
got the appropriate mouse pad to match
the color scheme so props on that so one
of the first things I noticed for the
LED lights behind a desk you can clearly
see them and honestly it doesn't look
good I don't know if you put them there
because you had no choice due to the
fact that a desk is mounted against the
wall or what but I would honestly take
that out I would prefer to have no LEDs
than having them stick out like that for
audio he's rocking a Samsung soundbar
underneath his monitors and we got a
pair of m50 X's off to the right side
next to is PC speaking of the PC is
rocking a 1600 K 32 gigs of ram and a
gigabyte gtx 1070 that
some good stuff there is a good amount
of clutter and the devices next to is PC
which I'm not a fan of but the cable
management under his desk is clean ass
there's also another set up right next
to the main one and it's got two Dell
monitors a basic keyboard and mouse and
also a budget PC running on the AMD X 6
10 9 TT + EVGA geforce 730 graphics card
this is definitely one of the more
busier setups that I've seen and I'm not
a fan of the clutter but there is
consistency and purpose Thank You lineal
for entering shifting gears a bit we
have Michael and his Apple productivity
setup so it's running on the late 2015
iMac and we also got a second display
that's hooked up near the top I guess
you can say the best part about a
MacBook or even an iMac setup is that
you don't have a giant PC tower taking
up extra space in your setup but what's
interesting about this setup is that
Michael managed to install IKEA shelves
by drilling holes through the glass
cover I'm impressed that he didn't
shatter or crack that in process on the
top of those shelves you got a pair of
kanto yu2 speakers and an iPad air 2
that's pretty much everything on the
desk
other than the echo dot and the Apple
wireless peripherals Michael did fine
job with the cable management other desk
and above by curving those cables
running down from the elements 40 inch
TV and that about wraps tough to set up
simple and clean just the way I like it
thank you Michael for entering speaking
of simple and clean well here's the
opposite we got a badass music
production setup from Nate featuring two
27-inch Samsung curved monitors and a
27-inch apple's Thunderbolt Display up
top so what I find fascinating is that
he's actually rocking Razer gaming gear
even though he's using the Mac Pro and
I'm not hating at all in fact I would
take Razer gear over Apple gear any day
there's obviously a lot going on in
terms of audio even stuff that looks
like it belongs in NASA which I've never
seen in my life but the things I do
recognize other Mackie mr8 monitor
speakers you got the blue snowball mic
and the Sony here on Bluetooth
headphones I don't know much about music
production but this one definitely looks
like the most advanced music production
setup that I've ever entered on the show
but you guys can be the judge of that
here's the fun fact this poster over
here is Nate's first album cover
honestly it kind of looks like a penis
if you ask me
as expected cable management is nearly
perfect with most of the cables hidden
away under the desk I really like the
mixture of the RGB lights which also
match the wallpaper on the monitors and
also the jellyfish lamp is a nice touch
too I would say that this is definitely
in the top 5 music production setups
that I've seen on the show Thank You
Nate for entering finishing up the
episode we got set Ric and another black
and red gaming setup is rocking 225 inch
LG monitors the cooler master octane
keyboard and there's the Lotus Mouse the
setup actually kind of reminds me of a
smaller version of Yahoo's lead setup
for those of you have been watching a
channel for a while because he's got the
glossy black surface table we got the
led Bluetooth speaker mousepad and even
the headphone hangers are the same I
guess you can say that this setup was
inspired by Ozzie which by the way one
set up of the year for 2016 in case you
guys missed that video I'll drop a link
below so aside from the two monitors he
also has a 50 inch samsung tv up top and
two sets of headsets he Logitech G 230
and he also got the beats by dre solo
headphones
you've got admired a consistency
throughout their setup from the special
edition dxracer chair to the black and
red desk and even its PC has some mods
to match everything else he
spray-painted the SSD trays and handmade
the drive bay cover which looks freakin
awesome by the way
and speaking of custom 8 he also 3d
printed his iPhone charger cable
management on a glass desk isn't that
easy since you can't drill any holes but
that didn't stop stead trick one bit he
hooked up everything on her desk and
routed the cables beautifully there was
definitely a lot of thought that went
into creating this setup but one of the
things that bothered me a bit were the
two headphone stands it's kind of a bit
redundant having two of them and I would
prefer to have a single hanger on the
desk or have it on the right side of the
PC so that it's hidden away another
thing I would have done differently is
actually mounting the monitors on the
wall just like you did with the TV I
think it would have looked a lot cleaner
but that's all I got it's a pretty
badass setup as is Thank You Cedric for
entering so that is it for this episode
of setup for is make sure you guys drop
your comments down below and vote a huge
thing has the best desk set up there is
one more episode where I'm going to be
at this hotel so I hope you guys are
okay with that I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
