I'm making this quick video to let you
guys know that I will no longer continue
my best tech deals of the week video
every single Tuesday and the main reason
for this is because all those deals are
now moving to my website deal source
tech I'm doing this because it just
doesn't make sense spending my entire
Tuesday researching for deals for all of
us you can Canada edit the video and
upload it just for the deals to expire
midweek I think it's a complete waste of
time and also it's a kind of wasting
your time as well watching a 23 minute
video and then find out there's nothing
in there that interests you so this way
it kind of makes sense to just upload
all those deals on the website and you
guys can glance through it see if
there's anything you're interested in if
not you can move on with your day if you
guys are need to channel or somehow miss
my announcement last week I did open up
a new website deal source Tech where
basically i upload daily tech deals for
us UK in canada all these deals are
updated frequently throughout the day to
bring you guys the most fresh pack deals
but yeah it's basically all wanted to
say ever since we launched the website
last week I beginning tons of positive
feedback and I just want to say thank
you guys so much for sending those
emails in sending those tweets in we've
been adjusting the website accordingly
but that's basically it i'll drop a link
to the website below if you guys want to
check it out maybe book market maybe
check back once a week or something
chances are you will find something you
are interested in so basically thank you
guys again so much for your support and
i will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
