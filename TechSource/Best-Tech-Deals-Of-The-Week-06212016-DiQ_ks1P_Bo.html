the prices of graphics cards are
dwindling and we have a buttload of
deals so let's go ahead and start the
video so starting off the show we have a
great deal on a 23 point 6 inch monitor
from BH photo going for 120 dollars
switching to Amazon give a razor Firefly
for 45 bucks steelseries sensei gaming
mouse for $35 both of the Logitech
headsets are also on sale the g 234
forty dollars and the g for 30 for the
same price speaking of logitech the g610
orion is going for $90 and if you guys
have been wanting a drone for a while
the DJI phantom 3 is currently 124 bucks
off and you also get a spare battery
with a bundle also the new xbox one slim
500 gigabyte version is now on pre-order
for three hundred dollars not really a
deal but I thought I'd put this in here
anyways prepare your wallets guys
because the 980 TI prices have been
officially dropped starting off with
zotac which is the highest price coming
in at five hundred bucks then we have
the EVGA classified for five hundred
dollars as well and I'm moving down to
asus strix which is going for four
hundred sixty dollars with a mail-in
rebate and then we have the MSI going
for 440 with a mail-in rebate a few
pretty good deals on the GTX 980 s
include the MSI version for three
hundred fifty dollars and the gigabyte
for 399 if those are sold out there are
a few more options on newegg like the eb
g a 980 TI that's going for 450 after
eight thirty dollar MLM rebate and the
zotac variants for four hundred and
forty dollars and finally we have a gtx
960 for a super cheap 135 bucks the i760
72 k is also discounted down to three
hundred thirty dollars which isn't the
cheapest i've seen but it's still a
pretty good deal considering the full
retail on this is around three hundred
and fifty five bucks on newegg flash you
can pick up a dark rock pro 3 4 70 bucks
and an 8 gigabyte ram stick from my skin
for just twenty five dollars and finally
wrapping up the video let's check out
some deals on ebay we have a pretty
solid discount on the LG 34 inch ultra
wide going for only three hundred fifty
dollars a sandisk 120 gigabyte SSD
that's going for 36 and the galaxy note
4 unlocked that's going for 195 which is
six hundred and five bucks off
and that's because these phones are used
with noticeable scuffs and scratches the
xbox three game bundles going for only
219 which is a pretty good deal
considering it comes with three games
and finally a white ps4 controller going
for 45 bucks so that is it for all the
deals this week for my UK and Canada
