welcome to another episode of GP wars
this time we'll be facing off the gtx
1080 against the msi gtx 980
so the reason why I'm making these short
and separate GPU comparison videos is
because not everybody wants to sit
through a ten minute video just to look
at some benchmarks so not only does this
help when people are searching for
specific GPU comparisons but also short
and straight to the point that's kind of
the purpose of GPU wars is basically no
extra information just specs and pure
benchmarking and also my opinions I also
want to give a huge shout-out to my good
friend Paul from Paul's hardware he let
me come over to his house shoot some
b-roll and also run benchmarks on the
GTX 1080 so huge thanks to Paul I'll
drop a link to his channel below so make
sure you guys go and subscribe because
he makes some awesome PC content so the
GTX 1080 founder's Edition starts at
$6.99 and here's a list of their specs
compared to the GTX 980 I don't have the
reference 980 on hand so I'll be using
the MSI GTX 980 instead so we already
know that the GTX 980 will be
outperformed by the 1080 but the main
question is by how much well it's going
to sit back relax and take a look at
some benchmarks
so in conclusion the gtx 1080 not only
performed better but it pretty much
dominated the 980 and most of the
benchmarks we saw the 1080 achieving
more than double the average frames
compared to the 980 and finally here is
your price per performance ratio
according to the benchmark scores in
this video and the current price of the
gravis cards as of today May 19th 2016
the GTX 1080 has the best bang for your
buck as always if you guys enjoy these
quick straight to-the-point
GPU comparison videos on my channel feel
free to hit that like button to show
your support and let me know what cards
you want to see compared in my next GPU
or this video I think I so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
