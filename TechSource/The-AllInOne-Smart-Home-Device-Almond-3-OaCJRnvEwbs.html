many things we could do today now we can
do so easily let's say 10 years ago so I
kind of wanted to make a video to give
you guys a comparison or an example of
this and because of that I've partnered
with Sakura Phi to make this video
possible I hope you guys enjoy today in
what you will take a glance at how
cutting edge technology is being used in
the home to change and to improve our
lives leaving this evolution towards an
era of smart homes if Microsoft
Corporation among the world's leaders in
dynamic applications of high technology
let's take a look at the home of the
future as designed by innovative
engineers and scientists of Microsoft
everyone imagines the connected smart
home to be a concept of future but a
distant reality that Microsoft has
envisioned is possible right now
your weight is now over so enjoy a
comfortable connected secure home of the
future as Robin enters she just touches
welcome home on the nearest wall panel
so the house is set just the way she
likes it the president is actually
better than the future imagined you
don't have to press any buttons just use
a voice command to tell Alexa to
activate a scene you can turn on the
lights set the nest thermostat to the
preferred level and operate the
WindowBlinds by just a voice command
Alexa tell elmond I am home when the
rest of the family gets home there are
many ways the house makes life easier
Almond can store multiple scenes and can
group smart devices in one room in a
scene such as TV time
Alex sets the scene in the dining room
by selecting family dinner from a wall
panel besides setting lights and
background music this turns off the
phone all men can also block the kids
internet during dinner time easily
through the app or voice command Alexa
block the kids internet
robban meanwhile is in the home office
where she has the same control over
every aspect of the house from the PC
including heating ventilation and air
conditioning so you've seen how Robin
Chris and the kids have the convenience
of electronic lists instant
communication between family members
control over household settings and
interruptions as well as easy access to
all kinds of information and
entertainment in addition to all these
convenient features the allman app on
your smart phone can do much more with
supported accessories the peanuts plug
power monitoring switch can report the
amount of power a connected device is
using the outlet can also be powered on
or off with just a tap no matter where
you are now if you add in the elements
click we can use that to control any
connected sensors including the peanut
plug without needing to carry around a
smartphone the element app also allows
you to get a glance at the status of
your element router as well as make
modifications to some of its settings
you can change advanced settings of the
router itself reboot the device or even
get a quick glance at the settings such
as the network names and security types
while we already set a scene with the
element we can create rules as well
which will take action on their own for
example at the time at 7:00 p.m. I can
tell the element to power on the peanut
plug therefore turning on the desk light
I can also take it to a step further and
have the light automatically turn off at
11 p.m. every single day so when the day
is over my smart home takes care of it
for me the wait is finally over the home
of the future is now thinking so much
for checking out the video while drop a
link to the element down below and when
it's interested thanks again for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
