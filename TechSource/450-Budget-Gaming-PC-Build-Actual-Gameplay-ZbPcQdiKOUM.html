in this video we'll be building a super
budget gaming PC that's gonna cost less
than five hundred dollars with this PC
you're able to game comfortably in 1080p
around 60fps now obviously that depends
on what game you're playing and what
settings you're using but we're gonna be
testing a lot of games and see how this
PC can handle those games at the end of
this video so make sure you guys stick
around for the benchmarks also guys
there's going to be a build guy on this
exact same PC not only installing all
the components together but also
installing windows and the drivers as
well if the build guide is ready I'll
drop a link down below in case you guys
want to pick up the parts and follow
along yourself so for the CPU we're
going with the G 45 60 and it's gonna
cost you $60 and this is well known for
its performance per dollar it's a dual
core processor with hyper threading so
it's gonna act as a quad core in most
games this little guy can pull its own
weight if you pair it with a solid
graphics card which you will see later
in this video
speaking of the GPU we are going with
the geforce gtx 1050 TI for two reasons
it's good enough to game in 1080p and it
fits under the $500 budget however if
you guys want a better GPU for more
frames then you can upgrade up to a 1066
gigabyte card anything above that then
you can experience CPU bottlenecking so
it's not recommended to go past the 1066
gigabyte card for the motherboard I went
with the as rugby 250 m it supports a
7th gen CPUs which means you don't need
to flash the BIOS in order for it to
work with the G 4560 it has two dem
slots and that to support and six USB
ports in the back four of which are USB
three it's also a very reliable board
based on the reviews from the users so
for round $50 you can't go wrong with
this now since the CPU only supports up
to 2400 megahertz of RAM I picked up
eight gigs from g.skill these are the NT
series and they're going for $66 for two
sticks so I looked around for the lowest
price out there that was not only 2400
megahertz but also had the best timing
out there and these are the best ones
that I could find for storage we are
starting off with a one terabyte hard
drive from Seagate for less than $50
storage is always optional so if you
guys have a slightly higher budget
feel free to throw in an SSD or even an
MDOT - but to keep the budget under $500
we have to go with a 1 terabyte from
Seagate now for the case I was looking
around for something that not only looks
good but also keeps us around the 450
dollar budget and guys I was very
surprised to find this so this is the
thermaltake Versa h17 this case is going
for only $35 and it's a really good
looking micro ATX case and as he brushed
aluminum panel with three USB ports on
the top one of which is USB 3 it also
has a PSU shroud and comes equipped with
a 120 millimeter fan in the back however
the case does support up to 22 80
millimeter radiator in the front and a
120 millimeter rad in the back or two
fans in the front one on the top and one
on the back as well the fans could be
either 120 or 140 but yeah you got lots
of room in there for additional fans the
only gripe I have with this case is that
it does not have a see-through side
panel which honestly doesn't really
matter because it is a budget build and
if you guys are on a budget then you're
not gonna be spending extra money on RGB
lighting or custom cables and stuff like
that so kind of the peace of purpose of
a budget build if you're spending all
that extra money but yeah it's not only
a gripe but why don't I mention that to
you guys finally powering everything is
a 500 watt power supply from EVGA and
this is plenty for future upgrades let's
say you want to update your CP to an i3
on i-5 maybe get a better GPU or more
storage that 500 watt power supply is
gonna be plenty to power all that by the
way guys I only spend $170 on a 10 50 P
I which looking back it looks like it
was on sale but if you guys want to
spend anything more than that I'll find
a similar price GPU like the zotac one
for example which is also $170 because
typically these cards go for a 980 some
of them even go for $190 but if you want
to stick to $170 price tag for the GPU
I'll drop a link to that down below so
yeah guys these are pretty much all the
parts I'm using in the build I'll drop a
link to every single one of these down
below if you guys want to check it out
but with that said let's put it together
and see what this thing can do
alright guys so now it's time to play
some games in 1080p on the PC disable
the sound so that you guys can hear me
speak and also you can hear how loud the
PC gets in certain games right now it's
actually very silent and the first game
I'm gonna be playing is Grand Theft Auto
5 let me show you guys the settings were
using so as you guys can see DirectX 11
is enabled 1920 by 1080 fxaa MSA is off
but everything else is pretty much set
to very high or max so if you scroll
down here everything else pretty much
very high MSA a reflection is also set
to off as well as post FX is normal and
the anisotropic filtering is off and
also ambient occlusion is that normal
tessellation is also off so those are
the settings we using in GTA 5 driving
around outside we're getting good amount
over 60 FPS average it does slip a
little bit under 60 FPS in certain areas
but for the most part you're getting
anywhere from 60 to even 80 actually so
kind of Lux rates depending on what
you're doing in the game also you guys
can look at the stats on the top left of
the screen the top portion is the GPU
starts off with the GPU temperature then
it goes to the GPU percentage being used
and then the GPU clock speed which is
18:48 megahertz
underneath that is the memory clock
underneath that is the CPU temperature
over here 54 degrees about the crash let
me write out the percentage of the CPU
being used so we're about 85% 90% CPU
usage and that is the CPU clock we're at
3.5 gigahertz underneath that is Ram
that's how much RAM is being used to
play the game we're currently around 6
gigabytes I would say
and then underneath that of course is
the FPS count just so you guys know what
you're looking at across the next games
but yeah on GTA 5 you guys can expect
anywhere from 60 to 90 FPS obviously
depends on what you're doing what area
you are in the game and stuff like that
there's more action going on you're
gonna be getting anywhere in the low-60s
and then if there's pretty much nothing
else going around you're gonna get high
70s and low 80s so that guys that's
pretty much GTA 5 let's move on to the
next game guys the next game I'm playing
is black ops 4 so the settings we're
looking at 1920 by 1080 the render
resolution is that set to 100 and
everything else is pretty much set to
medium across the board there are some
settings set to OFF like screen space
where I was reflection as well as the
special effects shadows and other stuff
so indoors looks like we're getting
anywhere from 70 to even the mid 80s not
bad very smooth gameplay no stutter
whatsoever
so during gunfights obviously the frames
dip a little bit but nothing too crazy
you're still getting well over 60 fps
indoors let me actually go outside and
see how the frames differ so outside not
much of a difference really you're still
getting why even in the 80s that is not
bad
I can probably even increase the render
resolution a little more just so the
game looks sharper and I can still hit
over 60fps but the fact that it's not
stuttering or lagging is very impressive
on black ops four CPU usage is around
90%
and we're still 3.5 gigahertz there is
5.5 gigs of ram being utilized for the
game
so looks like our 8 gigs of ram is still
plenty for black ops 4 yeah guys a very
smooth gameplay very happy with the
numbers for black ops 4 moving on to the
next game alright so next game we're
playing is fortnight's here are the
settings we are using 1920 by 1080 and
the settings are set to high
across-the-board
we do have motion blur set to on vsync
off
and yeah this is pretty much what the
settings are we using also notice that
the GPU is that 99% almost 100% load and
the PC still remains very quiet so
that's pretty cool
alright so we're on the ground we're
getting around 70 FPS
as soon as you start to see more people
kind of dip a little bit
I leave the lowest I've seen it dip -
like 62 FPS so far alright next game is
overwatch over here we're playing 1920
by 1080 and we are set to high settings
as you guys can see preset is set to
high we're getting around 100 FPS doing
action oh let's get that
nice about that dad I think I'm better
than overwatch then I'm in a fortnight
so yeah we're getting minimum 100 FPS oh
nice and it goes up to 120 130 not bad
very fluid gameplay though guys no
lagging no stuttering I'm very happy
with the FPS on overwatch GPU is also a
98% CPU around 86 percent 90 percent and
still remains very quiet guys this is
actually a very silent build as well and
that's all for watch guys from getting
well over 100 FPS moving on to the next
game alright next game is the popular
csgo
we are playing 1080p maxed out settings
as you guys can see everything is either
set to high or very high whatever the
highest setting is per category FPS wise
I mean obviously this is a less
demanding game so you're gonna be
getting well over 100 FPS so anywhere
from I would say I don't know 120 to
even 200 FPS and csgo even if you have a
potato PC I feel like csgo or one
buttery smooth regardless oh my why you
are you kidding
so RAM usage is around 5 gigs as you
guys can see CPU usage around 50 I'm
sorry 76% CPU usage an around 70 75 % GP
usage temps are really low again the PC
is really quiet this is a really nice
build I'm very impressed actually
I thought the CPU fan would amp up and
it'll be really loud but surprisingly
it's a very quiet build so these BOTS
have like titanium armor and their faces
or something oh yeah not much else to
see with you guys over 100 FPS very
smooth gameplay no stuttering you're
gonna get you can play csgo
competitively on this PC without a doubt
alright moving on to the next game
alright guys next up is pop G we are
playing squads settings we are using
right now is a 1920 by 1080 everything
else is set to medium across-the-board
so once again guys this game is poorly
optimized so don't expect any crazy
frames the frames are fluctuating
getting anywhere from 50 to 70 it looks
like but I'm getting constantly above
60fps that's not bad this game is
definitely playable in medium settings
once we're outside it dips down to the
low sixties or mid sixties I guess not
bad but guys check out how quiet the PC
still is we've been I've been playing I
think for at least an hour now across
multiple games and this thing is still
super silent you gotta admit that's
pretty impressive
for a budget PC $450 budget PC look at
that smooth gameplay let's actually
drive his motorcycle see how it handles
rendering the frames moment of truth Wow
look at that they've got fluid the the
gameplay is guys not a single stutter
once you get to a new area and once the
map starts loading you might get some
slight micro stutters as you guys can
see but overall very smooth no major
complaints at all not bad yeah medium
settings pub G anywhere from 60 70 FPS
not bad if you guys want to play in high
settings you might dip down to 50s maybe
even high 40s but if you guys want to
game over 60 FPS medium settings is the
way to go for pipe G alright moving on
to the next game
my next game is gonna be the Tom Clancy
Ghost Recon wildlands this one actually
at the lower the settings down to medium
or not even medium low to achieve well
over 60 fps and honestly guys even in
low settings this game looks pretty damn
good so low settings will get you in the
high 60s low 70s and wildlands so that's
actually not bad I do see the frames dip
a little bit towards the low 60s like I
saw a dip to 60 maybe even 61 but
consistently it stays our Jesus but
consistently we're getting anywhere from
the mid 60s to low 70s so it's not bad
98% usage for the GPU and 100% usage for
the CPU Wow
okay yeah I'm not bad enter from 60 to
80 FPS on Ghost Recon wildlands so yeah
guys that is what a $450 gaming PC looks
like I was actually very impressed with
the performance I was expecting around
50 FPS maybe medium settings or
something but the fact that this thing
can push over 60 fps and high settings
across most of the games that we tested
it was just unbelievable at g45 60 and
the 1050 Ti from EVGA is a solid combo
and I'm very pleased with the
performance and the fact that it was so
quiet this entire time guys I'm
speechless what can I say oh yeah guys
if you enjoy the video and want to see
more budget build on the channel feel
free to toss a like the holidays are
coming up so I will focus on more budget
builds on the channel instead of the
high end builds that I usually do if you
guys didn't like the video please hit
that dislike button and leave me your
constructive criticism any comments
section down below and also let me know
what do you guys think about this PC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
