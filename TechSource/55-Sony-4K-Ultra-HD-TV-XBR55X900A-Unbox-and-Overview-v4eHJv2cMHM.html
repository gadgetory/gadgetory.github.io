another unboxing this time we are doing
the 55 inch 4k TV from Sony so let's get
straight into this this TV is going to
cost you around five thousand dollars if
you do decide to pick it up this is the
Sony xpr-50 5 X 900 a the 55 stands for
55 inches now this isn't a normal HD TV
this sports a resolution of 3840 by 2160
way beyond the resolution of 1080p so
long when it's crazy resolution this TV
actually supports 3d technology which is
pretty cool for those of you who like
watching movies in 3d ok so let's go
ahead and unbox this real quick this is
one of the two versions that Sony has
for the 4k TVs the 55 inch which we are
currently in boxing and the 65 inch
which goes for six thousand
unfortunately we couldn't find the 65
inch in any of our stores close by so we
went and picked this one up at our local
Fry's so this TV actually comes with two
remotes the one you see here is a much
smaller remote with the basic functions
and it's much easier to use they both
come with two triple A batteries which
is nice and it's always great to have
two remotes in case you end up losing
one so this next remote is a much larger
one with a lot more buttons and I like
how they included a Netflix button on
there which can come in handy if your
Netflix person but other than that
nothing really special about these
remotes both of them do the same exact
thing only one of them just has more
options compared to the other okay so
let's get this box open there are a
total of four of these white tabs in the
bottom here with tubing on each side of
them that we have to remove in order to
slide the box up I really like how they
designed this making it really easy to
unbox so this TV actually has built-in
speakers on each side of display each at
65 watts and there's also a subwoofer
built right into the TV so this TV also
comes a really nice looking bass mount
if you choose not to mount it on the
wall and on the back of the display we
have a total four HDMI connection ports
an Ethernet port which is actually
optional because the TV does come with a
built-in Wi-Fi we have an audio out port
audio analog ports and a cable / antenna
input there's not much 4k content out
there so buying a 4k TV with such a high
resolution as we do
in a way but if you still wish to go out
and buy a 4k TV there's good news
Sony uses their x-reality pro engine to
bring your content into 4k resolution
from games to movies the software
upscales your content to use full
potential of that monster resolution as
I mentioned earlier this TV has 3d
technology so it comes with four of
these awesome 3d glasses and it's
designed in a way so you can use your
regular glasses at the same time and it
won't interfere with you watching a
movie so here are a few sample pictures
we found on the mtv demo unfortunately
there are not much demos available for
us to show you so this is the only 4k
content we can display at the moment
until more are eventually released I did
my best to capture a still shot with my
camera showing as much detail as
possible so you guys can see the quality
but you can't really tell because of the
lens that we're using but believe me
when I say that these pictures look
stunning so that's a fun unboxing guys
thank you so much for watching make sure
you stay tuned for the future giveaways
that are coming up shortly
this is the tech source and I'll see you
guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
