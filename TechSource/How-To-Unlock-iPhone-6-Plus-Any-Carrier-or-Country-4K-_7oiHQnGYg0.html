I'm here to show you the process on
unlocking your iphone six-plus
smartphone so you can use it with any
carrier or country for this
demonstration I will be using my
t-mobile iPhone 6 plus and unlock it so
I can use it on my AT&amp;amp;T network but you
can use this video as a guide for any
carrier so first off we need to get the
unlock code to start the unlocking
process one of the best and most
trusting websites that I use today to
get my lock codes is the unlocking
company comm because the prices are
unbeatable and their customer service is
the best in the market so head on over
to the unlocking company comm and select
your phone's manufacturer and the phone
model from the drop-down list
and on the next page go ahead and select
the country the phone was originally
purchased from and the carrier of the
phone so in my case I purchased a six
plus in the United States and the
original carrier is t-mobile before we
continue we need the IMEI number of the
phone and the way you look that up on
your phone is to open up the dial pad
and enter in star pound zero six pound
once the phone displays the IMEI number
you have to go back on the website and
enter that in once everything is filled
out select get a locking code and that
will take you to the final screen where
you have to checkout so once you receive
the okay from the unlocking company
letting you know that they remotely
unlock your phone you have to finish the
unlocking process yourself and I'm going
to show you how make sure that the phone
is powered off before we continue now go
ahead and remove the SIM tray from the
iPhone and insert in the SIM card that
you wish to use with the phone I want to
use the iPhone 6 plus with my AT&amp;amp;T
network so I am inserting my AT&amp;amp;T SIM
card if the SIM card does not fit
properly then you have to adjust the
size in order for it to fit I have left
a link in the description section to
show you how that's done so after you
insert the SIM tray back into the phone
go ahead and power it back on once the
phone boots up you will get an error
message stating that the sim is invalid
which is completely fine at this point
you have to connect your iPhone six-plus
to your computer and open it up in
iTunes
once iTunes recognizes your six-plus it
will ask you to sign in to Apple ID to
finish the
cocking process so after logging in with
your Apple ID you will get a message
stating that your phone is unlocked and
you can begin using it immediately so
that is how you unlock your iPhone
six-plus if this video was helpful feel
free to leave a like and if you run into
any problems or have any questions at
all you guys can leave a comment down
below and I will get back to you as soon
as possible thanks for watching this is
that from tech source and I'll catch you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
