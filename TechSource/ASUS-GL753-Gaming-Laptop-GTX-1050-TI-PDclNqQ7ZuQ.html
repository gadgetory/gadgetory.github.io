share your mouse and keyboard between
multiple computers
check it out using a link in the
description section being in the tech
space I get to see product categories
progress as Hardware becomes more
powerful and cost-effective gaming
laptops have especially been subject to
this shift in the past few years
Ultra presets and high frame gaming was
made possible with the fairly recent
release of invidious new graphics cards
that bring desktop-like performance in
laptop size proportions ibuypower has
kindly sent us out one of their 17-inch
asus rog laptops equipped with a gtx
750ti &amp;amp; Intel's new KB Lake i7 7700 HQ
processor to test out so let's start off
with the hardware most of the laptop is
made out of plastic but the construction
feels tight and there's very little flex
both in the body and display the top is
made from aluminum it feels nice and has
these bright orange accents that light
up when a displays backlight is on the
keyboard is good the keys are Chiclets
and have 2.5 millimeter of travel
distance using it for typing and gaming
we're great that's the most tactile but
this is probably the best laptop
keyboard I've tested in this price range
through the ROG Ulrich or we can
customize these for RGB zones of the
keyboard now even though they are not
individually lit it's still fun to
customize we also get a full number pad
which is a must for me the trackpad uses
Windows precision drivers so it's super
accurate it is a plastic trackpad so not
the best feeling but it still has great
gesture recognition we get a lot of
options in terms of connectivity through
USB 3.0 ports one USB 2.0 and hdmi and
displayport standard audio connections
you got the Ethernet jack a USB type-c
port and an SD card reader located at
the front underneath the chin also an
optical drive if you still use that in
2017 the 1080 panel is bright and has
good contrast and viewing angles it has
a matte coating which makes it great to
use in bright rooms and even outside
underneath the Sun if color accuracy is
what you're after in a gaming monitor
then this is definitely not it although
doesn't only affect gaming and watching
videos the speaker is add to the
experience they do get loud and bacey
while still holding on to the overall
clarity which I'm actually surprised in
a gaming laptop
in fact here's a quick audio sample I
want to see some damn robot battery life
unfortunately isn't the best with three
hours of usage being what I typically
get on an average today upgradability is
easy to do we're moving the screws at
the bottom gives us access to two RAM
slots that support a total of 32
gigabyte as well as two hard drives but
with all that said let's take a look at
some benchmarks
you
with the 1050 TI we were able to run
most games at their high presets while
staying above 60fps looking back this
would have required hardware twice as
thick just a few years back which ties
into the whole progression thing I was
talking about earlier
there wasn't any significant throttling
going on but the laptop does get loud
and hot especially when the 1050 Ti is
being pushed to its limit now keep in
mind this is running on a quad-core 7700
HQ which is perfect for gaming however
when it comes to productivity is not as
great especially we're going to be
editing and rendering out files it is
definitely possible in 1080p but
anything other than that it is not
recommended so the model I buy power
centers cost $1,300 and honestly maybe a
bit pricey but for this price you won't
find a better gaming laptop with these
specs you get a 17 inch 1080p panel a
7700 HQ cabling processor and a gtx 1050
TI and ones all the newest games about
60fps has a great display paired with
some surprisingly good speakers the
keyboard is well made and there aren't
any negatives besides the battery lives
i'll doubling to the laptop down below
in case you guys want to check it out
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next one if you guys use
more than one keyboard and mouse because
you have several computers then synergy
is definitely something you should check
out it's an awesome software that lets
you use just one keyboard and one mouse
across two or more computers whether
using Windows Mac or even Linux they do
have a couple of different versions
depending on the features you need I
mean they got stuff like clipboard
sharing where you can copy and paste
between your computers or even drag and
drop files from one computer to another
any bunch more features I'll going to
drop a link down below where you guys
can get 25% off synergy just for my
viewers so if you guys are interested
definitely check it out
thank you so much for watching I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
