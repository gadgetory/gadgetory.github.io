welcome to another episode of BTD we
actually got a bunch of deals over the
weekend but unfortunately I can't go
over all of them in this video because
it'd be like a 20 minute video so
instead I'm going to go over some really
good deals and the rest of them you guys
can find on my website deal source top
tech which by the way it gets updated
four times a day with brand new tech
deals for US UK and Canada so if you
guys are from those countries make sure
to check those out or check out the
website if you're interested so starting
up the episode we have the Zeus smart
car charger which has actually been my
personal favorite for almost a year now
I am featuring this in my cool tech of
October which is coming up really soon
but I came across this on amazon since
it currently is on sale this little
device helps you locate your parked car
by using the app on your smartphone and
it also comes with a ton of useful
features which you will see in the video
this Friday moving to newegg we have the
cursor CX 450 on sale for only thirty
dollars now although I do advise against
the CX series since they are not the
best out there but thirty dollars is
kind of hard to beat for a power supply
for budget builds assuming you don't
mind email and rebate while we're on the
subject of PC hardware we have a bunch
more on newegg like this 810 7700 k
quad-core processor that's going for $75
it's great for budget gaming builds and
even better for a media pc considering
the processor has an integrated radeon
r7 chip the define r 5 is on sale for
only ninety dollars and that is the
lowest you'll find on this case
currently since amazon has it going for
one hundred and five bucks if you're
looking for your next budget GPU then
EVGA has the gtx 950 that's currently
going for 110 dollars with a male and
rebate however if you're not a die-hard
and video fan I would look into the
aurochs 460 that offers better
performance for the same cost here's one
from gigabyte that's actually going for
a hundred dollars and finally the h105
extreme cpu cooler is going for $94 as
well with a mail-in rebate taking a
break from pc hardware for a bit we have
the 35 inch ultra wide gaming monitor
from bank you that sports a 144 hurts
refresh rate any for millisecond
response time that's currently going for
six hundred dollars that's four hundred
dollars off retail price right now and
it probably won't stay that way
long I'm personally not a fan of
screaming boxes but if you are then
there's a really good deal on the roku
if you don't mind refurbished products
last item I knew I guard is pair of
headphones from JBL that's going for
only fifty dollars now the are made for
iOS and features built-in remote and
microphone and it is compatible PC as
well via 3.5 millimeter jack we only
have two deals on ebay and one of them
is this 32 inch samsung monitor which
already has sold over 1400 units at the
white screen display with a 2560 x 1440
p resolution 5 millisecond response time
and a 60 Hertz refresh rate not the best
for gaming but if productivity is your
main focused and this is a solid monitor
especially for the price the other deal
on ebay are these pair of earbuds that
are going for ten dollars now does
feature a microphone and music controls
which is extremely rare to see on
earbuds for this price point we do have
a bunch of deals on amazon so i will try
and zoom do them as quick as possible so
first up we have a ten thousand four
hundred million power power bank going
for twenty dollars anchors six pack
charging cable with different lengths is
going for twelve dollars which is an
awesome deal considering each cable
usually costs around five bucks I did
the way top 5 iphone 7 cases on the
channel last week and if you guys
somehow missed it I'll drop a link to it
down below but this is actually one of
the cases I didn't feature since it
wasn't available at the time but since
we are getting closer to lunch I thought
I would drop it in this video especially
since it's $13 off currently the ever so
popular jaybird x2 bluetooth headphones
are temporarily reduced once again down
to a hundred dollars which is the
cheapest price you will find on these
anywhere i will definitely snag these if
you've been thinking about it for a very
long time the razer deathadder gaming
mouse is also discounted to forty
dollars a seven port USB 3.0 is going
for twenty-five dollars and the number
one bestseller for wireless chargers is
having a sale on her cheek charger stand
finally the last deal on this episode is
the razer blackwidow ultimate keyboard
back at it again with the discount
however it's only available for the
clicky switches now the normal price of
his keyboard is a hundred dollars so
you'd be saving around 18 bucks if you
were to pick it up today but that will
do for this episode as always make sure
to check out the old source tech where
deals get uploaded multiple times a day
if you guys are interested I'll drop a
link to it
below they got so much for watching I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
