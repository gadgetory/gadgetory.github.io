LG speakers and sound system King
so looks like these speakers are in
collaboration with John one which i
think is a famous street artist so these
are definitely a lot different than
usual boring bland speakers that you
guys see everywhere so I'm actually very
glad that LG has reached out and that's
something different on their speakers if
you guys have been looking around for
some awesome Bluetooth speakers and
maybe something to spice up your overall
desk setup you should definitely check
these out I'll drop a link to them down
below maybe I'll do a video in it in the
near future but let me know which of
these speakers actually looks cool to
you guys speaker number one two or three
speaker number one and two actually have
the art on the top which is pretty cool
but the third speaker is actually in the
front so that's pretty interesting
alright moving on
Oh ladies and gentlemen oh my god I
don't have to say this but it's
happening another ultimate build is on
its way I'm not talking about the water
cool this is something different this is
4ad summer build should I tell you maybe
I'll tell you let me check the other
parts maybe maybe I'll tell you in a bit
so this year actually is a 6900 k-8 core
processor for the x99 chipset I am very
very excited I wonder if the other parts
have arrived
AHA so this is something I've ordered
for myself those of you have been
following me on social media or if you
watched the lambo video the car doesn't
have a dashcam so I kind of ordered one
just to kind of protect my investment I
looked around and I feature this and my
I think Black Friday deals and this
looked pretty cool and I picked it up on
a discount so I may do a video on it I
don't know we'll see but this thing
looks pretty so yeah I might do a video
on it I'm not really sure but this thing
has really nice quality on if you guys
can tell in the box but it's 1080p it's
got night vision and I'm very psyched to
hook this up on the hurricane so
actually this is part of my perfect desk
setup episode 3 it is a budget Edition
so I've been looking around to find
budget products to feature in this video
it's going to be awesome but even sting
rotates so that's pretty cool
so you can put it like this or rotate it
and put it like that's pretty sweet
I'm not a fan of the color so I don't
know I don't know if I'm gonna end up
using this or not probably not
there goes my dash cam mm this is a I
want open this up but this is a very
sick black and red mouse pad I'm sure
you guys have probably figured out the
theme it's gonna be a black and red
theme for the budget set up so yeah very
excited I think I was gonna like it it's
a little different there's nothing
high-end but it's something different I
think you guys like it oh this is a care
package from one plus I don't even know
they were sending this to me looks like
we got some ear buds I'm guessing this
is the phone itself so this is their one
plus three T definitely gonna be doing a
video on this after I testify a month or
so oh that's pretty cool looks like a
carrying bag or something turning bag
and a belt of some sort that's pretty
cool thank you so much oneplus for
sending this in I can't wait to test it
out and do my video on it you got a
package from Ankur
Merry Christmas 2016 limited edition
whoa this is pretty cool what's in here
power your mobile life whoa
this this looks nice it's like a little
pouch oh ho that's awesome looks like
it's a wall charger and a power bank and
we got some cables micro USB and a
lightning cable looks like this is the
new version of the Power Core 10050 I'm
still using an older version
the thing is rock-solid I use it I take
it with me everywhere I go
and pretty much an IQ wall charger very
nice thank you so much anchor merry
Christmas to you guys as well if you're
watching this is awesome
nothing can include this in my new
travel pack for sure it's here it's here
it's here I said I was gonna order it
and I did and I got here actually within
two days so this is going to be in my
water-cooled PC which is right there
next to me
very actually I'm swapping this with the
ax 1200 I because the 1200 I just it's
overkill I don't need that much juice so
I'm gonna pop this baby in instead this
is easily the longest episode I've ever
done for what's in the box how many of
you guys have fallen asleep already be
honest let me know in the comment
section woah
I did order the other stuff but I did
not order this actually if I did it was
supposed to be a black and Wed headsets
why is it black and blue ah I knew it
it wasn't black and blue false
advertising so this is gonna be the
budget headset for perfect desk episode
three actually not bad so these are the
other pair of speakers I ordered because
I wanted to test both of them and see
which one sounded better and also look
better you guys remember the other one I
was twisting around that was the first
speakers are ordered and these are the
second ones they actually they look a
lot more red and I think they look
cooler I don't know what do you guys
think with you guys well I have this on
your desk or these speakers
unfortunately I think those look cooler
because it also has some black on there
some black and lines I think this is a
little too much red and they look flimsy
honestly just by holding it something's
loose in here anyways so I might go up
with that one but again it's about the
sound so I'm gonna test out the sound on
these so guys that is it for the video
as always if you love what's in a box
episodes let's see if we can get this
video to 20,000 likes that would be
freakin amazing but basically I think
are so much watching as always if you
guys want to check out any of these
products especially these speakers I'll
have a link to them down below thank you
again for a third time and I'll see you
in the next video
I want to cook this thing right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
