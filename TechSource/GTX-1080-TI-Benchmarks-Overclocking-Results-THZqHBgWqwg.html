and I have with me and videos latest GPU
the GT x 1080 ty
yes it's pronounced I not CI apparently
and in this video going to be comparing
it to the GTX eternity and the Titan X
test Cal we're going to take a look at
gaming benchmarks and 2k and 4k
resolution overclocked performance and
frames per dollar to figure out which
card offers the best value for the money
so 1080 ty ships with 3584 cuda cores
and comes clocked out of the box at 14
80 megahertz space and 1580 to boost
which they are claiming is 47 percent
faster than the previous generation gtx
980ti Hort I should say they're calling
it the best Thai ever with a 35 percent
performance improvement over the
preceding high-end GeForce GTX lineup
that's the same TDP as their last
generation 980ti
coming in at 250 watts and only uses an
8 + 6 pin PCI connector to power up the
card is available now for purchase and
it's going to cost you $6.99 for the
founders addition while board partner
versions will get released sometime in
April so there are a few changes coming
from the GTX 1080
aside from appearance which pretty much
looks identical the tie comes with an
improved cooler that engineers have
designed a new high airflow thermal
solution that provides two times the
airflow area of the GTX 1080
but in order to accomplish this they had
to remove the DVI connector in the back
instead that area where the DVI
connector once was is used to provide a
larger exhaust for hot air to be
expelled from the GPU the 1080 Ty's
power subsystem has also been enhanced
they have incorporated a 7 phase 2x dual
fed power design essentially what this
means is that the GPU gets supplied with
even more power and less power is wasted
as heat which ultimately provides higher
GPU boost clock and overclocking with
less heat and noise speaking of heat
let's take a look at the temp
does it look like there was much
improvement when comparing it to their
Titan APEC's
unfortunately I didn't have a sound
addition 1080 on hand so I had to test
it against the EVGA 1080 FTW instead and
it looks like the 1080 ty is cooler
during idle and warm or during full load
by the way to test but I'm using for
benchmarking has the 1600 K
overclock to 4.4 gigahertz 16 gigs of
ram and the Asus x99 Strix gaming
motherboard here are the benchmarks
so looks like paternity tie pretty much
outperform the Titan X in most of the
games I tested in 4k resolution and we
even saw some bottle making and quad HD
resolution you need to say if you're
picking up a 1080 tie or Titan X for
that matter you shouldn't be gaming
anything on there 2k resolution
let's talk overclocking I was honestly
expecting a bit more from the 1080 ty
they actually stated that the card
offers a lot of headroom for
overclocking and they saw boost clocks
hit speeds of 2000 megahertz but i saw
higher numbers from the titan x and EVGA
1080 I mean the memory clock managed to
hit almost 6,000 on the 1080 ty which is
pretty impressive but I guess I didn't
win the silicon lottery for boost clocks
when it came to my 1080 ty however I did
manage to kick some ass in benchmarks
being performance increases as high as 9
fps in 4k resolution that translates to
a 6% FPS increase and 4k from both the
1080 and 1080 ty whereas a Titan X gets
a nice 9% boost in fps
not bad but again not very impressive
looking at the total frames we can see
that the 1080 ty barely outperformed the
Titan X and games set to 2k resolution
whereas the gap is much wider when it
came to 4k the 1080 ty is 21% faster
than the 1080 and 4k resolution and 3.5
faster than the Titan X but what car
gives you the best bang for your buck
well what current prices both 1080s give
you the best value you only paying 98
cents per frame when it comes to 4k
gaming the timex is currently overpriced
I mean the 1088 I not only costs almost
half the price but also out performance
by three and a half percent even in
sookay resolution the Titan Dex is
overpriced for what it offers the
choices here are obvious if you don't
have any of these cars and are looking
to buy one and already have a 4k monitor
then the 1080 ty is what you're looking
for keep in mind that it's overkill
buying the 1080 ty if you're not going
to be playing in at least 2 K resolution
so if you're stuck with a 1080p monitor
I would either grab a 10 60 or a 10-7
to be honest 4k monitors start at $300
so you're looking around $1,000
investment if you're going to make this
switch if you already own a GPX 1080 and
want the extra 20% increase in fps and
4k gaming and don't mind paying an extra
$700 then I say go for it why not you
can always tell your 1080 to try and
break even so that is it for my video on
the 1080 ties you guys enjoyed it make
sure to leave any like and I mean what
your thoughts are in the comment section
down below
I guess gonna pick one up or you'll be
waiting for Vega this is that some tech
source and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
