welcome to PC wars episode 18 we used to
meet your custom PC to get featured on
the channel so if you guys want to
participate make sure to watch the video
linked below but here are your five
contestants for this week we have Archie
Calum Matt floon and Sean
congratulations for making it on the
show alright so starting the episode we
have Archie and his gorgeous modded
infernal PC this was originally a
coarser 760 T case but Archie decided to
add his own back panel with cutouts for
the cable grommets I gotta say this
looks way more cleaner I also like the
add-on of the msi dragon inside the case
as well as the front panel and when I
was running out a 6700 K and an MSI GTX
1080 gaming X graphics card great job
keeping with the theme I feel like if
you painted the PCIe brackets red it
would have looked way cooler but it's
still a sick build nonetheless and also
excellent work with the cable management
for benchmarks inferno' got a 16,000 532
to start things off strong Thank You
Archie for entering sticking with the
black and red theme we have Calum with a
dragon v2 which is used for streaming
and video editing this too is rocking a
6700 K and a GTX 1080 but we have the
EVGA founders Edition this time around a
very clean water-cooled build with
custom sleeping and a mirror that's
added near the bottom to reflect the
parts above I also love the game of
Thrones custom modded backplate you have
there ever been more got an oh damn
looks like Dragoon VR inferno by over
8,000 points despite both of them being
a 1080 my best guess would be that the
EVGA founders edition is heavily
overclocked a job well done Calum for
taking first place for this episode
changing up the scenery and color scheme
we have Matt with his white black and
red build very refreshing to see that
color scheme you have yet another 67 GK
but this time a gtx 950 super clocked by
the way matt i would strongly recommend
putting the GPU on the top slot because
right now it's on the x4 pci slot which
means that you're not taking full
advantage of the cards performance I'm
pretty sure you put it on the bottom
slot because the backplate got in the
way
the i/o but you decide aesthetics or
performance for benchmarks that scored
6023 as expected putting it in third
place for this episode but nonetheless a
very clean build with a nice color
scheme floon is next up with black rug
or black RG depending on how you read it
the first thing I noticed about this
build is how everything is in one
direction you won't find anything that's
horizontal except the graphics card so
this beast a is rocking a 59 30 K that's
overclocked to 4.5 we also have 32 gigs
of ram from G skills very sexy RAM
sticks the Trident Z's and finally to r9
290 X's in crossfire very interesting
that you would go with AMD cards and a
build like this especially with a 59 30
K I seriously can't get over the
cleanliness of this build the cable
management is flawless and the sleeving
along with the custom logos and mods
made to the case we're all done by hand
Bravo dude as expected black ROG blue
the other three computers out of the
water with a score of 19,000 233 taking
first place for this episode then again
two GPUs are better than one a very sexy
black and red build Thank You floon for
entering
last but not least we have Sean and he's
back at it again with his upgraded PC
named pure bliss this time around he has
a 60 702 GTX 1070 s in SLI I definitely
dig the clear liquid in that PC it just
looks so much cooler at night with those
LEDs but I would have loved to see how
it would look like in daylight as well
for benchmarks we got a score of 13,000
543 putting pure bliss and 4th place for
this episode but it's still a great
looking water-cooled build thank you
