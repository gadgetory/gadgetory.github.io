to show you the process of unlocking
your Samsung Galaxy s7 so you can use it
with any GSM carrier in the world for
this demonstration I will be using my
locked s7 and unlock it so I can use it
on my t-mobile network but it's the
exact same process for any carrier from
any country so first I'm going to get
the unlock code to start the unlocking
process the place where I get all my
lock codes is the unlocking company comm
because that the cheapest prices online
and I get my codes much faster than
other websites so head on over to the
unlocking company comm and select your
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop down list and on the next
page go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is AT&amp;amp;T before we
continue we need the IMEI number of the
s7 and the way you look that up on your
phone is to open up the dial pad and
enter in star pound zero six pound once
the phone displays the IMEI number you
have to go back on the website and enter
that in and once everything is filled
out select get a locking code and that
will take you to the final screen where
you have to check out after checking out
they will email you the unlock code the
price and literally time other code
varies by phone but don't worry because
as I said before you are getting the
cheapest prices online with the fastest
delivery times so once you receive your
lock code from your locking company it's
time to unlock your phone so go ahead
and pop open the SIM tray which should
be located on the top and insert the SIM
card you want to use with the phone I
want to use the s7 on my t-mobile
network so I'm putting in my t-mobile
SIM card if your SIM card doesn't fit
then you have to adjust the size in
order for it to work there's a link
below to show you how that's done once
the SIM card is inside the phone it
should take you to the SIM unlock page
and this is where you enter the unlock
code that you received from your locking
company after inputting in the code and
hitting a LOF you will get a message
stating that the unlock was successful
and the phone will take you straight to
the home screen and your phone becomes
permanently unlocked please note that
some newer devices lock to u.s. carriers
are now remotely unlocked so if it
doesn't prompt for a code don't worry
because the unlocking company can still
unlock it no problem so that's how you
unlock your Galaxy s7 for any GSM
carrier in the world if this video
helped you guys out feel free to leave a
like and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
