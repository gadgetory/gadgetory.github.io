extra and with a price tag of $4,000 we
expect nothing less we do have the
premium model over here that comes with
an upgraded 4k display a gtx 1080 the i7
7820 HK processor and 32 gigs of ram the
only thing we can configure is the
storage and we have one of three options
either a 512 gigabytes 1 or 2 terabyte
drives all configurations are fitted
with two MDOT two SSDs in a raid 0
configuration making for some incredible
read and write speeds but more on this
laptops performance in a bit one thing
about benchmarking new systems are using
new computers in general is the hassle
of logging back into all my accounts so
I want to take a brief moment to thank
the people over at dashlane for
introducing me to their password manager
- Lane has a bunch of features built in
but let me tell you about my two
favorites the first one being the auto
log-in and fill feature the program will
keep all your passwords and personal
information backed up securely so when
you go to log in it presents you with
all of your accounts this also works for
payment information shipping details or
any forms that need to be filled out
which brings me to my second favorite
feature the multi device support so with
- Lane premium you can sync all your
passwords across multiple devices
including your laptop phone and tablet
and it does all of this securely so you
don't have to worry about anyone going
through your notepad and coming across
any sensitive information and again this
is a premium feature but if your
security buff like me this could
definitely be an important tool for your
everyday life if you're interested in
checking this out you can use the code
youtube' 2017 to get a 30-day trial of
their premium service for free as well
as 10% off if you decide to stay I'll
drop a link to it down below let's start
off with the build quality it has an
aluminum unibody design with a matte
black coating and I think that razor did
a great job over here
Julie is very robust and sturdy there is
no give anywhere around the body and
there is very little flex to the screen
it's also very easy to open with just
one hand but while it's beautiful to
look at it collects grime and
fingerprints like crazy so be sure to
carry a microfiber cloth with you if you
want it to be looking clean the laptop
is also packing a lot of connectivity on
one side we get a full sized SD card
reader eight Thunderbolt three ports we
also get three USB threes and HDMI 2.0
port as well as a THX certified audio
combo port THX certified basically means
it plays high fidelity audio which is
great if you're using a pair of
studio-grade headphones with this
opening it up we are greeted to this low
profile mechanical keyboard which is the
first I've ever seen and really the
experience is a mixed bag you're either
gonna love it or you're gonna hate it it
feels like typing on blue switches but
with a shorter throw at first I found it
uncomfortable to use because of its
short travel distance but after some
time it's kind of grown on me the keys
are also individually lit with all the
cool Razer lighting effects we've come
to expect my favorite would have to be
the in-game specific lighting mode
now this isn't supported by a lot of
titles out there but it's pretty amazing
in games that do like overwatch for
example to the right of the keyboard we
see that Razer has ditched the number
pad and instead has moved the trackpad
over here that's actually a big deal for
me because I always need a numpad in all
my laptops I just hate using the numbers
above the keyboard
I wish razer would have done something
like Asus with their laser numpad on the
zephyrus which I took a look at not too
long ago any guys you guys missed a
review I'll drop a link below besides
that the trackpad has great accuracy and
responsiveness as well as being able to
recognize gestures there are also left
and right click activation points but
they're very sensitive and I found
myself accidentally clicking them at
times which got to be annoying above
that there's a scroll wheel for audio
which is great to see and it's much more
convenient instead of using the function
buttons
however razer did leave the function
buttons on the keyboard in case anyone
prefers to use those the laptop also
comes with a two megapixel webcam that
shoots 1080p video at 30fps I mean it's
good for Skype calls but I wouldn't use
it to stream and the microphone is also
subpar here's a quick audio test
so this is the video test for the
front-facing camera on the razer stealth
pro and as you guys can tell it's not
that great it has two upward firing
speakers on both sides of the keyboard
which I was pleasantly surprised with
sound actually gets very loud and bacey
and you can crank the volume up all the
way to the max without any distortion
tying in the multimedia experience is
this beautiful 4k THX certified display
being THX certified it comes with great
color accuracy out of the box making
content creation on this laptop awesome
the colors are deep and they pop which
made watching movies and consuming
content at joy the viewing angles are
good and it also gets extremely bright
435 minutes to be exact
oh and it's touchscreen by the way which
was a feature I didn't use much but it's
nice to see included I mean if you're
going all out with a 4k display why not
add a touchscreen the only problem I
have with a display is that it's glossy
a little too glossy for my taste which
means it's very reflective if you're in
bright environments and also because
it's glossy it picks up fingerprints
super easy which makes the touchscreen
feature even less appealing alright so
let's get into the performance and as
you would imagine this thing is a
monster as expected it handles games
like a champ but I'm really interested
in its performance and Premiere Pro so
let's load up some gaming benchmarks and
get those out of the way first
so needless to say you can play any
triple a game on this thing maxed out
without any stutter if not at 4k due to
poor optimization on the developers part
then 1080p and 2k resolution for sure
now let's talk about productivity
specifically video editing jumping into
premiere and loading up 4k footage we
see that there is no lag during full
resolution playback which is very
impressive for such a thin device add
some light color grading and effects and
it still has no issues rendering times
of 4k at 30fps video or almost
one-to-one with the time of the project
itself so a 5 minute video
would render in under 6 minutes that's
pretty impressive cooling all of this
hardware are too small fans underneath
the laptop since the fans are thin and
are designed to be minimalistic there
isn't much air flow under load you can
definitely feel the heat emanating
underneath your hands just near the
keyboard area and it definitely gets
loud guys and I'm talking really loud
here's a quick sample and things get
even louder and hotter when performance
mode is turned on through the razor app
honestly I feel like razor could have
done a better job at cooling this thing
even if it meant adding a few
millimeters to its thickness this is
probably the biggest gripe I've had with
this laptop the cooling performance body
life isn't so great either with just
under 4 hours of moderate usage but with
such heavy hardware inside honestly I
didn't expect much here anyways
overall I would say this is the perfect
solution for us at tech source when we
need to be mobile and get some work done
on the go it has a color accurate for
Cadis play which is great for content
creation
it's got powerful components that can
handle pretty much any game you throw at
it even in 4k resolution as well as chop
through 4k video without any hang-ups in
addition there's great speakers and high
fidelity audio ports for our audio
production needs I'm gonna do which the
cooling situation was better which would
alleviate the jet engine noise that
comes from this thing under full load
but is it worth it well it is for us
because we're gonna be taking full
advantage of the hardware that comes
packed in the laptop
not only gaming but also editing as well
$4,000 on a gaming laptop is very steep
you guys can build actually a very nice
water-cooled PC with that amount so
let's come down to your needs do you
have the budget for it are you always
mobile and you're never home to use your
desktop and of course other factors I do
want to give you huge things to Razer
for sending in the blade pro for review
and if you guys want to check it out
I'll drop a link to it down below thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
