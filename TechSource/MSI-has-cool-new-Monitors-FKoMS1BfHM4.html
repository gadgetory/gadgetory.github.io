to CES for a chance to win MSI's new
tried an ex gaming pc all you have to do
is like the video and leave a comment on
what you are most excited about in
today's video
MSI has announced two ultra wide
monitors along with their new trident x
plus gaming pc at CES this year the
first ultra light is aimed towards
content creators and i gotta say it
looks very clean with the old white body
and a rectangular base if not to turn
off for you then you can remove the base
and mount it on the wall or your desk
because it is basic compatible so this
is a flat 34 inch 5k ultra ride with the
same 21 by 9 ratio that you see across
most ultra lights however you get a much
higher resolution this time a 50 120 by
2160 so you have way more screen real
estate vertically and horizontally to
work with it also has a 60 years refresh
rate and a 5 millisecond response time
on a nano IPS display the monitor does
come calibrated out of the box with a
dcpip 98% rating so it's great for color
sensitive work and they also threw in
display HDR support as well I was
shocked to find out that this monitor
doesn't have a thunderbolt report
considering the price of $1,800 I
expected to find one don't get me wrong
it's a great looking monitor targeted
for content creators but I'm afraid that
price tag might be a turn-off for a lot
of people especially considering that LG
also has a 5k ultra ride that costs a
lot less it's available somewhere
between June and July this year if
you're interested in picking it up next
up is MSI's newest ultra wide gaming
monitor so this is a 34 inch ultra wide
curved monitor with a 34 40 by 1440 VA
panel and LED backlighting it has 144
Hertz refresh rate and a 100 millisecond
response time however they didn't
mention if it's overclockable I would
assume that 165 Hertz is achievable
the design is very similar to their
optics lineup it's got an old black body
with RGB bars however this time they
included a microphone in the worst spot
possible I'm not really sure what the
design team was thinking because you
have to really tilt the monitor so that
the camera is facing you personally I
wouldn't even add a webcam on a gaming
monitor since a lot of people use their
own anyways speaking of webcams the
monitor also comes with a camera
you can clip on the top it does support
vase amounting and I like the fact that
they included a detachable Mouse bungee
right on the monitor itself that way
you'll have a much cleaner surface on
your desk this monitor is going for
$8.99 and will launch sometime in June
or July of this year the monitor also
comes with a built-in microphone which
I'm told will be used with AI
integration basically there's going to
be some sort of voice assistance like
Alexa or even Google assistant that you
guys can talk to and you can basically
change the settings on the monitor and a
desktop PC which i think is pretty
interesting
Imus I also introduced a new Trident
desktop PC so this is the new Trident x+
featuring the new ninth of June
processors and r-tx graphics cards and
you guys can get them in many different
configurations the Trident X plus
features the new silent storm cooling 3
which is essentially three separated
cooling chambers for the GPU CPU and
power supply
they definitely improved the design
coming from last year's it now has
tempered glass panels better RGB
lighting and it's really easy to access
the components if you decide to upgrade
the Triton X + is targeted for gamers
who prefer a powerful gaming PC and a
tiny portable form factor and it's
already available for purchase and
that's it for my coverage at msi suite
at CES then you guys so much for
watching as always I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
