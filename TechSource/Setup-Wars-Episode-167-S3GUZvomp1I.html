with that said not to set up or is begin

addicting new RPG title that's got me
playing for literally more than six
hours a day the game has a great
storyline awesome 3d graphics PvP
battles and my personal favorites
giant boss battles in dungeons you can
collect hundreds of champions and
customize them to your preference I was
actually lucky enough to get to
legendaries already big gun is my
favorite right now because he has
powerful AoE attacks that can clear
multiple enemies and just look at the
level of detail this game has it's
beautiful rate is getting popular very
quickly so make sure to click on my link

upcoming special launch tournament with
crazy prizes so make sure to click my
link below and download raid for free
you guys also get 50,000 silver and a
free epic champion as part of the new
player program kicking off the episode
is andre from columbia and a super clean
white and black theme setup featuring a
27-inch monitor thats hooked up on a
custom made desk he picked up a tabletop
and legs separately and skinned the
surface with a glossy material to give
it a nice glow sticking with the color
scheme he's got the courser k 65
keyboard with the white key caps and a
SteelSeries rival 100 gaming mouse for
audio he's using the Corsair boy pro
headset which is hanging from underneath
the desk however he does use these Sony
SRS speakers for listening to music or
watching videos I really like those RGB
lamps it adds a level of customization
since he's able to change up the colors
whenever he wants the beauty of having a
mostly white setup is that most colors
work well with it the cables are neatly
tucked away in the back using some
double-sided tape to hold up the power
strip so no complaints here and finally
we have this beauty over here on the
right side powering it all it's such a
good-looking PC and I feel like there is
a good balance of white and black in
here you could have swapped the black
fans for the white version instead from
course
or get an all-white back plate but he
did keep it consistent with the colors
of the setup well done
it's a beautiful setup with a gorgeous
PC Thank You Andre for starting off the
show so this was Dan's original setup
that he submitted to set up Wars a few
years ago but sadly it was rejected fast
forward a couple years and dozens of
setup wars episodes later we have this a
black and red themed setup that's
focused on pretty much everything the
2008 MacBook Pro is used for music
production the PC on the ground is for
media consumption while the Xbox one X
is for gaming I gotta say the
presentation is beautiful with all that
acoustic foams and a three-piece mural
right in the center a lot of people
don't realize that adding stuff on the
wall regardless of what it is adds
personality and spice to the overall
setup I mean this is what the setup
would look like without anything on the
walls do you see how much more boring it
is anyways back to the setup so
monitoring the audio are a pair of
rocket krk speakers that are
establishing the 1440p game monitor from
Asus and he mounted the subwoofer
underneath the desk instead of leaving
it on the carpet I like how simple and
clean this setup is that only kept the
essentials on his desk and he went
wireless with the Apple keyboard and the
MX master Mouse cable management is
definitely one of my favorite things
about this setup so he routed the cables
underneath the desk using a channel
raceway and some cable clips but then he
split them up so the cables from the
Xbox and the MIDI keyboard I routed
beautifully into the cable box on the
right side and then the rest of the
cables are routed in the back of the
desk to the cable box on the left side
excellent work so the PC that is using
for media consumption is tucked away in
the corner and some of the parts were
given to him so he doesn't know most of
the specs but what we do know is that it
has a 4790k
and 32 gigs of ram with no dedicated GPU
then that's such a great job putting all
this together it's such a clean and
productive setup thank you for entering
and I'll drop a link to a SoundCloud if
you guys want to check him out and show
him some love so this setup is actually
very unique and that's the only reason
why I want to feature it in this episode
so this is Casper's setup from Denmark
and it uses a four graphic design and
light gaming mostly the elbow three
and counter-strike what's so unique
about this setup is that it actually
folds up that's pretty sick
so obviously this desk is custom made
and he built it all out of Pinewood and
he hooked up some LED lights behind it
as well the desk stays shut using
magnets and it's clever how the bottom
portion is supported once it's opened up
so there are two sticks on the bottom of
the desk that kind of extend into the
base of the unit and they help keep the
table supported I was all about there's
a dedicated place underneath the set up
for his cables and power strip which he
can also cover up on the surface he
doesn't have much just a wireless
keyboard any Mouse from Apple and his
2016 MacBook Pro on the right side of
the desk he did hook up a USB hub and an
optical drive for easy access and then
we have his Plantronics headset hanging
from the wall once Casper is done using
a setup he takes his MacBook with him
puts everything else inside the setup
and then closes it up like a briefcase
that is pretty damn cool Casper lives
with his wife and two kids in a small
apartment so he doesn't have the space
for a real desk so instead he builds a
compact set up that transforms just
brilliant Thank You Casper for entering
coming on number four is Nash from the
Philippines and his Star Wars inspired
setup that he was just for gaming photo
editing and studying we have the Acer
predator x 34 ultra wide sitting on a
desk that he built himself using plywood
what's interesting here is the placement
of the speakers he mounted them sideways
underneath the desk which isn't exactly
the best place to put them because you
want the speaker's to be directed
towards you at ear level in the pull out
drawer he's got the coarser K 65
rapidfire RGB keyboard with custom key
caps and the coarser glaive RGB mouse
you know as much as I think a white
wrist rest looks really cool in any
setup it gets dirty really easily and I
advise strongly against it I mean
there's a reason why they come in mostly
black what I do like about this setup is
actually the PC it's a sick custom built
rig using the i7 6700 and the galaxy GTX
1080
I love the sleev cables and the custom
work on that h7 cooler and even some
parts of the case even though it doesn't
have any RGB fans I think it looks
really dope regardless I like that he
put the PC on the left side of the desk
to hide the cables coming out of it and
also extra point
for modding the desk with a power switch
to turn on a lighting of the setup and
the PC that's pretty sick
you also built a dedicated place for
cable routing in the back of the desk
and it's built with a hinge making it
easy to open and close this setup has a
lot of little surprises and I think it's
built really well with some minor tweaks
it has the potential of becoming even
better Thank You Nash for entering
wrapping up the episode is Santa and his
mancave built entirely from scratch in
his garage this entire project took him
over a month to complete side note I do
like your mancave rules this place is
filled with tons and tons of gaming gear
and collectibles in fact there are so
many pictures that I'm just going to
show you a quick montage of all of them
so this is the main setup that he uses
for gaming it's got an ultra-wide from
Ben Q we got the Razer Deathstalker
essential keyboard and the Razer Naga
chroma Mouse on top of the Z line more
than a desk which is actually one of my
favorite desks because of its super
clean design and the amount of storage
there's even a pullout drawer in the
middle to store a laptop or something
wide but saniye keeps his xbox afterglow
controller here for audio he's using the
Insignia speakers but he does have the
HyperX cloud tubes as well powering the
setup is a custom PC inside the fantex
Eclipse p400s and it's pretty beefy with
a 6700 K and the GT X 1080 from MSI
looks like you installed you Ram in the
wrong slots I would move the first RAM
into the second RAM slot in order to
take advantage of dual channel shout-out
to India for this awesome watercolor
painting that she did I only recognized
a piccolo from Dragon Ball Z and
kampachi from Bleach the other two I
don't know but maybe you guys can help
me in the comment section serious props
to your daughter for drawing this she
definitely has talent I mean what can I
say you've transformed an ordinary
garage into an awesome mancave well done
Sonny and thank you for entering I'm
sorry if I butchered your name by the
way and that's it for this episode of
setup wars as always make sure you guys
leave your comments below and vote on
who you think has the best that's setup
from the episode and you guys enjoy the
