choice is an lg ultra wide it provides
an ideal workspace for editing videos
and most games I play at this point
natively support 38 40 by 1600
resolution however I wouldn't say that
the model I'm using which is the 38 you
see 99 is suited for serious gamers with
the tie price of $1500 refresh rate of
only 60 Hertz and a 5 millisecond
response time but the good news is that
manufacturers have finally noticed the
growing demand for ultra wide gaming
monitors and that's why the LG 34 you
see 79g comes in but for the sake of
this video I'm going to call it the 79 G
instead it's a lot more affordable at
$700 has a 2560 by 1080 IPS panel with a
144 Hertz refresh rate and a 1
millisecond response time it's also free
sync ready and comes with a handful of
software additions geared towards gamers
but does LG achieve what they set out to
do with the 79 G let's find out compared
to other LG ultra vires I would say that
this is more aggressive than elegant
with its geometrical stand and
accompanying red accents it actually
feels well put together with its plastic
body and because of this material choice
it comes in at 19 pounds 14 pounds
without the stand so on the back we get
hdmi 2.0 ports DisplayPort 1.2 a USB 3
pass-through that gives us two
additional USB 3 ports and then you get
the audio jacks and of course the DC
power input
fun fact USB port one is actually quick
charge enabled which is something I've
seen before and I found this to be
extremely convenient if the only device
that's quick charge ready in the box you
get a single HDMI and display cable a
cable management hook as well as a three
pronged power cable LG didn't however
include a pass-through cable which is
kind of a disappointment seeing as this
is a feature that comes built-in to the
monitor and I wouldn't have custom that
much to include it the stand lets you
move the display up 4.5 inches
vertically as well as giving adequate
tilt angle I found I could be using this
sitting down or standing up without any
problems you don't get any pivot or
swivel adjustment however and finally
the legs are super easy to install with
no tools necessary and it can also be
detached and used with VESA mounting the
34 inch IPS panel
a gentle curve to it nothing too
aggressive and no matter what angle I
was looking at it from I didn't see any
loss in quality it also has a matte
coating so gaming in a brightly lit room
posed no problem especially if you sit
next to a window where there's lots of
sunlight the panel has a resolution of
2560 by 1080 P which obviously isn't the
highest when we're talking about ultra
lights but I feel like this is the
perfect resolution when it comes to
gaming ultra wide monitors that way it's
not as aggressive on the graphics card I
mean considering that the response time
is at one millisecond and 144 Hertz
refresh rate on top of that things
wouldn't run as smoothly if there were
more pixels to push as far as backlight
bleed is concerned it is somewhat
noticeable if you're in a completely
pitch dark room however if there is some
light source then it is hardly
noticeable we must also consider the
price now if LG was to implement these
high performance specs into a panel that
was let's say third a 40 by 1600 and the
price would be certainly over $1500 all
right so this panel supports 8-bit color
and the color gamut covers 72% of NTSC
well I found gaming and media
consumption to be enjoyable
I wouldn't recommend this panel for
professionals that need the most
accurate of colors for example a 99% RGB
coverage something else I've noticed was
the low brightness when compared to
other ultralights I've tested the panel
goes up to 250 nits which when compared
to the monitor I'm using has a max
brightness of 300 nits
which means that this monitor is 17%
dimmer now even though that's a
noticeable difference on paper I found
these 79 G's max brightness was adequate
for my usage but it's something to keep
in mind something else that stands out
about this monitor is all the built in
features and presets we had several
different modes that include game mode
fps RTS modes cinema mode reader mode
and of course custom I personally select
the custom and tweak the panel settings
for my needs but it's nice to have quick
access to presets for different usage
I found myself for example switching to
reader mode often when using a monitor
at night it kind of dims things down and
gives a screen a red tint to reduce
eyestrain navigation is done with the
joystick that is located on the bottom
just like all the other LG ultra lights
and even till today LG still has the
best interface for their monitors
everything is easily accessible and the
joystick eliminates the need for extra
buttons
I'm glad that LG hasn't changed that and
I hope other manufacturers adopt this
method as well oh by the way these
aren't speakers in fact the 79 G doesn't
have built-in speakers at all now
personally I don't mind this one bit
since I do use an external audio
solution but I could see this being a
deal-breaker for a lot of you guys that
rely on your monitor for audio so
besides all its quirks as stated before
the monitor was great for consumption
with his game focus specs the 79 G
brought a breath of fresh air into my
gaming experience and is definitely
noticeable coming from my 38 you see 99
the lower lag as well as the higher
refresh rate was immediately noticeable
and even the software add-ons that I
thought were going to be gimmicky were
enjoyable now I'm not gonna make a wild
statement like this monitor made me a
better gamer but it did improve my
gaming experience so in conclusion if
you take your gaming somewhat seriously
and don't mind the lack of speakers or
unfavorable color accuracy for content
creation then I could definitely
recommend this monitor going back to my
38 you see 99 is going to be a bit
difficult but I am a content creator
first and a gamer second if in the
future LG decides to combine aspects of
this gaming monitor to the monitor I'm
using currently then consider me sold I
don't mind if the prices go up a bit but
if I can get the best of both worlds I
will definitely do that then guys so
much watching I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
