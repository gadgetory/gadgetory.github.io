video possible what guys does in Texas
and welcome to the pc build of the month
for the month of August when we building
the best gaming PC for around $600 and
I'm going to change things up a bit and
build an HTP CV for around $400 as
always all the parts mentioned in this
video will be linked down below so with
that said let's begin
so the first build is going to cost you
around $600 we're throwing in the new
rising 3 1200 CPU which is currently the
best quad-core CPU you can buy right now
for the money and it's only going to
cost you 109 dollars and you guys can
even overclock it to 3.9 gigahertz very
easily with the included cooler we don't
need a CPU cooler since it does come
with one however we do need a solid
board to overclock that bad boy and then
what I picked up for the build is the
MSI B 350 M micro ATX motherboard which
cost only $70 I've used this one a few
times before on the channel and I really
liked it I had no problems using it and
overclocking is very easy it supports up
to 32 gigs of RAM features 1 m2 slots
and 4 SATA ports it does have two DIMM
slots however so I went with only one
stick of RAM from crucial in case you
guys need to upgrade later down the line
for storage we are rocking the one and
only one terabyte hard drive from WD
which you can pick up for around 50
bucks we're also going to be pairing the
rising 3 1200 with the GTX 1066 gigabyte
variant this is the sweet spot for 1080p
gaming if you don't want to hit any
bottlenecking
make sure to check out my bottlenecking
video in case you guys missed it but if
you guys want to play in 2k resolutions
and you can even upgrade the GPU to a
1070 without a problem but if you're
only playing 1080p games then I
recommend sticking to the 1060 anything
higher than that and you won't be
getting your money's worth in case we
are going with is the world's well srmo
one which isn't the best looking case
out there but we are trying to save some
money and for $30 this is a solid option
it's got a fun USB 3.0 port and a place
to mount an extra 120 millimeter fan on
the side
for storage you have space for one SSD
and two hard drives
it does have a closed side tunnel which
is great because you're not too worried
about buying RGB lights or custom
sleeves inside the PC to make them look
good I always tell people if you're
doing a budget build obviously get a
case with a closed side panel because
you have to spend extra money on RGB
lights better-looking fans customers
leaving and all that's going to cost
money and kind of defeats the purpose of
going with a budget build in the first
place and finishing up the build is a
450 watt power supply from EVGA which is
plenty of use so this entire bill is
going to cost you about $600 and this is
the best gaming PC that you can build
for this price point in fact I might do
a build using this exact same
configuration in August and if you guys
want to see a build guide and time-lapse
be sure to let me know in the comments
section and also leave a like so this
next one is a home theater PC rocking
the G 45 60 dual core processor and the
reason why I went with this is because
it handles h.265 decoding a lot better
than other generation CPUs and you're
also able to watch videos on Netflix and
4k without any problems unfortunately if
you don't use a TV light processor you
can't stream 4k on Netflix
thanks Intel so we don't need a cooler
since we are using the stock heatsink
and since we don't need to overclock it
we can pick up a budget motherboard the
asrock h1 10m will get the job done as
long as the BIOS has the updated version
if it does then you don't need to flash
it I actually bought one of these in
February from new egg for my $350 PC
build and it came out of the box with
the new version installed which was
awesome because I didn't have to flash
it it's going to be a closed case build
so I don't really care how ugly the RAM
sticks look eight gigs of ram is more
than plenty to run emulators play games
or whatever it is that you guys need to
do one terabyte of storage is a great
place to start and if more is needed we
can always throw in some later down the
line the gtx 1050 from ZOTAC will supply
just enough power if you want to do some
gaming and 1080p obviously you're not
going to get close to 60fps and max
settings but some latter games like
overwatch or even csgo shouldn't be a
problem if you're not going to be gaming
and instead you're going to use the HTPC
for basic media like screaming or
watching videos Netflix Kodi and even
some emulators
you can save $100 and not get a GPU the
HD graphics 610 from the CPU is plenty
just for that we're going to cram
everything inside the tiny elite 110
case from Coolermaster for around $40
and powering the HTPC is a 450 watt
power supply so this will cost you a
little over $400 if you go with a
dedicated GPU or $300 if you don't
so before I head out and give huge
thanks to Squarespace for making this
video possible if you guys ever wanted
to create your very own website but
found it difficult to do so then you got
to get Squarespace to try they make it
extremely easy to create your very own
website I mean even I to do it
everything is practically drag-and-drop
you guys don't need to know anything
about coding and the customer service
team is also really helpful and they
respond very quickly in case you do run
into any problems recently they added 16
new beautiful templates to choose from
or you guys can even start from scratch
kind of like what I did with my current
website deal source tech and just for my
subscribers out there you guys can get
10% off your first or if you visit
squarespace.com
slash tech stores I'll jump a link below
but that's it for the video as always
all the parts will be linked below if
you guys enjoy these monthly PC builds
make sure to leave a like to show your
support if you guys don't like it feel
free to dislike as well that is cool to
think I so much for watching I love your
necks and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
