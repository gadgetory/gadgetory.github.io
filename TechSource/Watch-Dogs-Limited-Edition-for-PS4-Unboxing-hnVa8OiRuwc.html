and today we're gonna be taking a look
at the limited edition watchdogs for the
PlayStation 4 the Limited Edition will
cost you 130 if you end up picking one
up for yourself and the standard edition
goes for only 60 bucks however if you
own a ps3 or a ps4 then you get
exclusive content that's only available
on the PlayStation so that's a pretty
cool bonus there so with the limited
edition you get some cool stuff along
with your exclusive content you get a
collectible 9 inch figurine an art book
a mask original game soundtrack and a
cool steelbook game case to keep your
CDs in but those of you that don't know
already I own a ps4 and I'm a huge fan
in the console I normally play most of
my games on the PC however there are
some games that I prefer using the ps4
and this is one of those games if you
guys want to see me do some gaming on
the watchdog's or even a game review
then let me know in the comments section
down below and I will get started on
that so the first thing I pulled out is
the figurine and I'm gonna put this
aside for now when we can take a closer
look at it later they also included a
blue box with the rest of the contents
inside we have the watchdog's art book
the vigilante mask and the steelbook
case for both the discs so the main
character of the game is Aiden and he
wears this vigilante mask and I guess
this is supposed to be an exact replica
of that to be honest I'm not sure where
you can wear this outside of your home
but it is a pretty cool mask to own in
this steelbook case are both the game
disc and the original game soundtrack
and over here on the left is where you
can find the codes for the downloadable
content this here is the exclusive 80
page art book which has a lot of pretty
cool concept art the book contains
drawings of every character that's in
the game along with the levels that you
will be playing in and near the end
there are even some cool graffiti
illustrations so what the watchdog's
limited edition comes along a figurine
it's a 9 inch statue of the game's
protagonist Aiden Pearce which is done
with an insane amount of detail the
statue is cool and all but is the
collectors edition really worth 130
price tag I think if they threw in
Aiden's hat and coat then it'll
definitely be worth it
but anyways that is it for the unboxing
portion if you guys want to see some
gameplay action and hear my opinion on
the game they let me know in the
comments section down below I also left
some links below if you guys are
interested in picking up the game for
yourself we have a bunch of cool videos
coming your way so make sure to stick
around this is that from tech source and
I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
