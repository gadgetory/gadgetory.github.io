high-end builds on the channel which I'm
sure a lot of you guys are familiar with
and then I do the occasional budget
builds but I've never actually built a
streaming PC before until today so this
is gonna be a mid-range streaming PC
that's gonna cost you around a thousand
dollars and if you're lucky enough you
might take this home that's why guys
there's gonna be a giveaway on this
exact same PC all the parts that you see
on this table are gonna be given away to
one lucky subscriber and it's actually
worldwide so if you want to find out how
to enter stick around all right so let's
take a look at the parts starting with
the CPU this is a screamin PC so we do
need extra pours in here the 2700 X is
perfect for the job with its six cores
and twelve threads this is M the second
generation CPU and it offers more
optimization and performance than last
gen when you're screaming you're also
encoding and doing multiple things at
once so a higher core count will help
you in that right now the 2600 X offers
a lot of performance for the money
pairing it with the right motherboard is
also very important you can't cheap out
so that's why we're going with the MSI B
450 tomahawk this board supports second
generation rising chips and it's great
for for clocking because of the extended
heatsink design and seven power phases
it also has four RAM slots and m-dot to
support the cool thing about the v4 50
boards is that they now come with AMD
store mi which is equivalent to Intel's
obtain memory so check this out guys
this is what I mean we're gonna be
combining the 2 terabyte drive from
Seagate with the 240 gigabyte SSD from
HyperX into one single drive with SSD
speeds this way you're gonna have
high-capacity storage space of a hard
drive with SSD speeds and this is gonna
boot your PC faster it's gonna transfer
files faster and more importantly your
games are gonna load faster so when
you're streaming you're not gonna be
experiencing any long load times and
also no stuttering or lagging because
your games I'm gonna be running off of a
drive with SSD speeds we're gonna try
and squeeze as much performance as we
can out of the CPU so that is why we're
going with an a IO
time around he Coolermaster ml 240 will
get the job done and it's gonna look
pretty doing it program we're going with
16 gigs which is plenty for gaming but
it's also gonna help out when streaming
now if you guys are just building
yourself a gaming PC then a gigs is more
than enough but however we are building
a streaming pc hence why the additional
ram is gonna help out multitasking will
be a lot smoother and quicker
thus screaming will benefit from it as
well the extra gigs of ram will also
benefit anyone using programs like
editing software or even graphic design
so this is a 1080p streaming PC in order
to get at least 60 FPS while streaming
we do need an Oryx 580 the msi rx 580
mech Edition has one of the highest
clock speeds out of the box
1.3 4 gigahertz core and 1.3 840 boost
clock plus it looks really cool I think
it's gonna fit really well with the
black and red color scheme that we are
going with I really like the red accents
on the backplate powering all the
components is a 550 watt power supply
from Coolermaster and it is fully
modular so we're only gonna be using the
cables that we need to minimize the
cable clutter and keep the PC looking
very clean I mean the power supply and
most of the cables are gonna be hidden
anyway is underneath the PSU shroud from
the case so overall it's gonna look
really clean inside so I'm gonna be
using the TD 500 from coolermaster
because it's such a good-looking case it
also comes with three RGB fans already
installed and an extra 120 millimeter
fan in the back you get all this for
less than $100 that's a really good deal
so yeah these are all the parts I'm
gonna be using in my streaming build
let's put it all together and see what
it can do
hey guys welcome back to my stream today
we are playing csgo we have a total
viewer count of 0 I'm streaming to
myself obviously but the sake hit the
video so let's just play csgo and see
how I do actually I'm gonna start off
with practicing with bots you know I
really like the the ow
Oh see that clutch anyways guys I'm
screaming in 1920 by 1080p at 60fps do
you recommended okay Wow I am so bad at
this game Jesus Oh
even the OBS recommends around 3,500 for
the bitrate but I decided to update to
6000 just because 3500 doesn't look that
good it looks very pixelated so the
higher the bitrate is the sharper your
video is or your stream is so instead of
keep it at 6,000
oh damn nobody has touched me I look at
I have 100 HP and a hundred armor I
thought medium BOTS would be a little
challenging oh oh
I'm really excited killing BOTS so hey
guys this is max settings 2560 by 1440 P
I'm getting well over 200 FPS in-game
but I'm actually outputting to the
stream in 1080p at 60fps also one thing
to know guys the stream that you're
watching is not the same quality as
what's being shown on my monitor
obviously the quality is gonna look a
lot less through the stream but so far
no stuttering no lagging this is very
smooth gameplay it's actually hovering
between hundred sixty to 220 fps and 2k
resolution that is not bad
with these with these specs oh so I
overclock the CPU to 4.2 gigahertz at
one point three seven five volts alright
so this is csgo obviously a less
demanding title so let's go switch to
something a little more demanding like
fortnight alright ladies and gentlemen
now it's time for some fortnight you get
to see me failed miserably in here I'm
actually a lot worse than fortnight than
I am at csgo believe it or not so this
time we change the settings a bit we are
down to 1080p instead of 2k just because
I want to hit well over 60 fps and 2k
resolution I was getting anywhere from
40 to 45 FPS which isn't that good to me
so that's why I lowered it to 1080p just
so the game plays a lot more smoother
and we're getting a lot higher frames
yeah guys overall very smooth gameplay
no stuttering no lagging some really
nice frames anywhere from 60 to 80 fps
I'm very impressed so far with this PC
it's also right next to me I know if you
guys can tell but there is no side panel
as well so if you guys can't hear any
fan noise then your viewers watching
your scream won't be able to hear any
fan noise as well
it's gonna be a long run and I don't
feel like running halfway across the map
so I think it's time to move on to the
next game let me just open up his chest
actually real quick
hi guys finally the last game we are
testing is pop G we are 1920 by 1080 and
we are high using high settings
it was getting late at the office so I
took the PC back at home and this is the
next day which is why the background is
a little different and I'm also wearing
a different shirt so this game is the
most demanding out of the three games
that I've been playing and so far we're
going - pretty good frames in the sky
we're getting around 90 to 80 but let's
see what we're getting when we actually
land there's one thing I noticed while
playing pop G is every time I open up
the inventory window like you can see
the frames dip so if I'm gonna be
looting for example check this out see
that dips down for like 50 60 it's
interesting and it's like that
no matter what PC I use only when the
inventory is open not sure why otherwise
indoors we're actually getting high 80s
low 90s and on the outside we're getting
also around 80 not bad oh god I'm dying
here who the heck is shooting me well I
can't kill with the shotgun so I'm gonna
get the hell out of here
I'm gonna die here
there we go all right so I think I
embarrassed myself enough times for
today I think I'm just gonna stay away
from a battle royale games and stick to
RPG and mobile games because that is the
only games
unfortunately that I have good at but
yeah overall I'm really happy with the
way this turned out that's a really
clean looking PC but the MVP here of
course is the case itself I'm still
surprised it's going for around 70 $80
when it comes to three pre-installed RGB
fans in the front a single 120
millimeter fan in the back it's got a
PSU shroud and a really dope looking
acrylic side panel of course you're
getting a lot of performance for the
money as well if you're looking to spend
around $1,000 for a solid gaming and
streaming PC then this is the
configuration I recommend going with the
2600 X is a beast CPU especially once
you overclock it to 4.2 gigahertz it's
gonna help you so much when it comes to
encoding streaming or any multitasking
really but yeah what do you guys think
about the PC let me know your feedback
in the comment section down below
also let me know by dropping a like if
you want to see more types of these
videos where I build a PC and do a
hands-on style benchmarking so instead
of just running usual benchmarking video

out the games in front of you so if you
guys do want to see more of that type of
videos let me know in the comment
section also by leaving a like if you
don't want to see that type of content
leave it this like so that I know
alright guys now it's time for the
giveaway if you want to enter for a
chance to win a PC just like this
they're actually sending out all the
parts to whoever wins so you can build
it yourself of course this is worldwide
if you want to participate all you have
to do is check out the gleam link down
below the giveaway will be announced on
my Twitter account on the day that it
ends so make sure you guys check back on
