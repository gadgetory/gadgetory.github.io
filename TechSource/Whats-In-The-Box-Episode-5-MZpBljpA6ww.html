s340 by clicking on the link below was
it our way in the same shirt last
episode what's up guys is Ed from tech
stores and welcome back to another
episode of what's in the box I love
doing these and I hope you guys enjoy
watching them so I just came back from
my trip to Iceland I was there for four
nights because LG flew us over to cover
an event and it was such an amazing time
but if you guys watch my vlog then yea
you guys know what I did there so before
we get into the unboxing guys I'm gonna
show you a few things that LG gave me
back in Iceland that I brought over to
the US if you guys already watch my
vlogs then you already know what is
these boxes but for the rest of you
you're not gonna believe what is in here
check this out guys
this first one is an action figure
yep this is pretty much me in my chair
with my tech stories hoodie and you got
my dxracer chair in the back I mean the
attention to detail is phenomenal on
this and honestly I was so shocked when
I saw this at the hotel in Iceland
everything is so freakin accurate the
chair my hoodie the logo on the hoodie
my pants and I don't even know how they
got my shoes right this is seriously so
dope
alright and this next one is pretty much
a portrait of me with the northern
lights or the Aurora actually in the
background and as you can see kind of
transitions into my face and I just
thought this looks pretty damn cool they
also gave me this pretty cool stand and
it's kind of a replica of their their
new LG g6 TVs so if I put this on the
stand pretty much looks like they're
super thin TV that's kind of what they
were going for with this and whoa and
yeah I just thought it looks really cool
and I can't wait to find a place for
this and my action figures somewhere in
my setup or maybe somewhere in the
studio but anyway just want to show you
guys that and now we can continue on
with the unboxing so yeah again huge
thanks to LG can't thank you guys enough
honestly it was truly an amazing
surprise alright let's get into the good
stuff it's just a freaking this is a
Pokemon hat this lipstick something
actual where I did not remember ordering
this alright so moving on to the other
packages this is what is this James
donkey I have no idea what this is
natural-born player okay don't tell me
this is another sex toy
because if so I did not order this oh
thank God it's just a gaming mouse
that's supposed to do a video on so yeah
aha
so yeah pretty much I ordered a ring
video doorbell for myself because
recently I had an incident where a few
my packages got stolen while I was over
at Iceland UPS came over and dropped the
packages off at my door which she wasn't
supposed to they were supposed to be a
signature guaranteed or signature
confirmation so I was supposed to sign
for the packages so hopefully with this
video doorbell I can now record and see
who comes at my door stop and steals
things
so I'm gonna go install this today all
right so this is the new nvidia sli
bridge that I ordered for gala Bex
because well you guys saw the video then
you probably know why I ordered one
basically the top/bottom GPU is too
close to the bottom and yes as these are
pretty much restricting air flow so with
this I'm able to move the GPU up one
slot and provide better air flow and
lower temps plus I think it looks cooler
than the EVGA sli bridge I wish it had
some more green on there because I don't
think this really goes well with my
white and black theme so I may have to
do some painting on this
this is another 6700 K processor and a
Maximus asus motherboard i am not sure
who sent this to me because i did not
order this from amazon i don't know
where these came from
but i'll have to think through my emails
and see maybe there's a company that
wants to do a build because I honestly
don't know what he can came from
I like 3ds now I'm guessing this is
gonna be a mini ITX build but again I
have no idea who sent this so I'll have
to dig through my emails and find out
all right we got one from DHL so I can't
wait to check it out alright sweet so
looks like we got a gaming headset and a
gaming mouse so this is a Lenovo Y
gaming optical mouse and this one is
called healing over Y gaming stereo
headset I'm gonna be featuring both of
these and a gaming gear bundle type of
video so that should be coming up in a
few weeks so yeah pretty excited so this
one's from China not only sure it's look
at the trash can of some sort
what the hell is this this isn't it's
literally a trash can I called it so
send this to me um there was no note in
the package so if you sent this to me as
spam ill thank you so much I really
appreciate it I'm actually I was in a
market for a trash can believe it or not
because my tiny macbook style trashcan
wasn't big enough so this is gonna be
awesome
thank you so much for sending this in I
just wish you left a note maybe your
name I can thank you and keep in front
of the camera but this is pretty sweet
thank you so much all right this next
one is from ex aviation maybe I'm
getting some airplane parts to build an
airplane I'm going to share why is this
sent from ex aviation that makes no
sense
so this is the MSI gaming X GT x 1080
finally some black and red action oh
yeah check this out this looks pretty
sweet honestly all I need is one more
GTX 1080 and I can make a top 5 GT X
1080 comparison video either I get one
from gigabyte or ZOTAC and I should be
good to go so you guys understand
checking that video out let me know by
dropping a like but I will be working on
this video sometime next week and yes
and expect the review maybe in two to
three weeks because by now pretty packed
with other projects alright so it's one
of the biggest box I have
so we have a box inside this box oh this
is the DJI phantom4 holy crap
this is pretty cool comes in a little
briefcase that is a thing of beauty I've
never received that drone before so this
is definitely gonna be an interesting
experience I think this is one of the
best Jones currently out there and VG I
sent this to me out DJI said this to me
so I can do a comparison with the other
high-end drill and I think it's the URI
or something like that and actually
sending that over as well actually
that's the vestige own that was stolen
from me from Monday so I know they're
gonna do maybe send another one in or
file an investigation so yeah enemy time
I'm gonna be messing around with this
one hopefully I don't crash it and then
you guys can expect the comparison video
sometime and made August I'm honestly so
stoked to give this a shot
hopefully I don't crash I've seen
some pretty horrifying things on YouTube
people passionate Joan so hopefully that
doesn't happen with this especially
since how expensive this is but that's
pretty much it for the video as always
if you guys enjoy your series make sure
to leave a huge thumbs up pictures you
guys watching thank you so much and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
