and in this video I'm going to be
showing you guys how to unlock your
samsung galaxy note 7 so you can use it
with any GSM carrier in the world for
this demonstration I'll be using my
locked galaxy note 7 and unlock it so I
can use it on my t-mobile network and
also please keep in mind that this
process works no matter which country
you purchase the phone from now there
are a bunch of a locking websites out
there and it doesn't really matter which
one you use but if you're looking for
the cheapest prices and the fastest
delivery times then you should check out
the unlocking company com that's
actually where I get all my lock codes
from so the first step is to find the
imei number of the phone and you can do
that by opening up your dial pad and
typing in starbound 06 pound once the
number pops up you have to visit the
unlocking company com and enter in all
of the information put in the
manufacturer and the model of the phone
and the first page and on the next page
of to select which country the phone was
originally purchased from and the
carrier of the phone once you hit next
you will need to put in the imei number
that we just looked up on the phone and
finish filling out the rest of the boxes
once you finish checking out they will
email you the unlock code so once they
email the lock code here's what you have
to do go ahead and pop open the sim tray
which should be located near the top and
put in the sim card you want to use
within note 7 in my case I want to use
it on my t-mobile network so I'm putting
in my t-mobile SIM card once the SIM
card is on the tray go ahead and slide
it back into the phone and then we start
your galaxy note 7 once the phone
reboots it will take you to the unlock
prompt screen and here's we have to put
in the locking code that you received
from your locking company once you input
the code and hit unlock you will get a
message stating that the lock was
successful and then it will take you
straight to the home screen as you can
see here I can now use the galaxy note 7
on my t-mobile network so that's
basically how you lock your galaxy note
7 for any gsm carrier in the world if
this video helped you guys out feel p
