guys and welcome to setup wars episode
111 where you so much' desk setup to get
featured on my channel if you guys want
to participate you already know what to
do make sure to watch the video linked
below but with that said other setup
wars begin starting off the show we got
Abdul and an eye-popping white red and
black setup the contrast of the setup is
seriously next-level from the acoustic
films on the wall to the actual
wallpaper on the 24-inch BenQ monitor
and even the decals on his PC I'm
already loving the presentation of this
setup and it looks like he has a YouTube
channel over a hundred thousand
subscribers based on that silver play
button I'll drop a link to his channel
below you guys have to watch his desk
setup video it has the most epic intro
that I've ever seen anywhere seriously
so on the IKEA mom desk he's rocking the
k70 RGB keyboard and the final mouse
2016 he does have an audio technica
at2020 microphone for voiceovers along
with a pair of Bluetooth speakers I love
the red accents he added on the edges of
the desk
it not only blends perfectly with the
setups color scheme but also pairs well
with his PC case so this is the NZXT
noctus 450 case and it's rocking a 1600
k-6 core processor 64 gigs of ram i
think it is just in my pants and a
gigabyte gtx 1080
Wow even the PC has some custom work to
match the theme like the painted PCI
brackets is logo near the PSU shroud and
some custom work on the SSD this dude's
dedication to keep the color scheme of
this setup consistent is unlike anything
I've ever seen his iPhone even has a red
case with a red apple logo in the back
and even has a red candle a candle are
you serious right now this dude will
make anyone who has OCD feel very
satisfied I don't have any complaints
with the cable management looks like
everything is under control and I just
noticed that he hooked up a white SD
card reader and replaced the black ear
cuffs on the BT 770 and also the floor
mat is even red
this dude is something else but even
with all the attention to detail there
are some things that personally would
have done differently first up with the
acoustic foam clearly this was added for
aesthetic reasons because it's not
covering most of the wall making its
purpose less effective
I was definitely try and fill in the
side without affecting the design that
he was going for because there is a lot
of unnecessary empty space the two
speakers on my desk should be split up
now I don't know if these are the same
speakers that allow you to connect both
of them at the same time but if they are
that's all the reason you need to split
them up maybe put one on the left side
and the other on the right also there is
no contrast with the mousepad black on
black doesn't really look good
especially in your setup so either a
white and black mouse on top of these
black mouse pad would work or a white
and red mouse pad under your black mouse
the coarser m65 Pro RGB Gaming Mouse
would be perfect for your setup actually
to change the yellow cursor logo to red
and you are pretty much set and finally
the black and white chair doesn't really
go well with the rest of your setup so
instead of this white and red gaming
chair with black accents from verdaguer
with metro set up way better and I'll
jet building to everything I talked
about in this video down below if anyone
is interested but anyway those are just
my two cents that's definitely one
badass gaming and youtube setup that you
got there
thank you updo for entering Georgia is
next up with another badass gaming setup
and he's rocking two displays the 30
inch LG smart TV up top and a 35 inch
curved gaming monitor from Bank U on the
bottom the keyboard is from coarser and
SB k70 RGB with cherry MX red switches
and he's also using SteelSeries rival
300 gaming mouse as well he didn't
really hold for the keyboard and mouse
so he just routed the keyboard behind
the martyr and the mouse cable is being
held up by a bungee for audio he's
rocking a pair of Logitech Z 623
speakers which are being blocked off by
the ultra white monitor and we got the
popular logitech g930 gaming headset as
well cable management is pretty good the
ikea big hands desk comes with a net
underneath to store all the cables and
the jar they even added a spiral sleeve
to hide some of the wires down
there and also for the cables from the
top monitor the PC that's powering this
setup also has the same color scheme and
it's rocking a 6600 K and a gtx 1070 if
I were you I would find another place
for those speakers so that they are not
being blocked off by the monitor I mean
I would move the monitor to the left a
bit to make some room for them on the
side but then the lg tv wouldn't be
centered with the BenQ monitor and I
think that would drive me crazy other
than that it's a solid gaming setup
Thank You gr tey for entering taking a
break from all the black and red we got
Jimmy and his black-and-white simplistic
setup looks like he just has the
essentials on his desk and nothing more
exactly 24 inch asus monitor the cooler
master light RGB gaming keyboard and the
mouse combo with the white glorious
extended mousepad the only audio sources
he's got are the logitech z 200 speakers
and the HyperX cloud 2 gaming headset
and speaking of gaming the PC that gets
the job done is also in black and white
the back of the setup looks a bit busy
but it seems to be under control thanks
to a couple of twisty ties and
electrical tape so I don't have any
complaints it's a clean and minimalistic
gaming setup Thank You Jimmy for
entering coming in at number 4 we got
Miguel with a dual ultrawide monitor
setup featuring the asus rog pg3 for 8 q
gaming monitors I love how he hooked up
a curved wireless sound bar from Samsung
to match the curve of dumb monitors I
haven't seen that on the show yet that's
pretty cool
so the actual desk set up he's got
consists of the IKEA Carl B countertop
an Alex your unit and some stainless
steel legs that are holding up the other
side which is resting on his mini-fridge
he even made use of that extra space by
putting his Xbox one elite on there
they're also damn here he's got the
Astro a40 gaming headset it looks like
Miguel drilled in a few hooks on his
desk to help with the cable management
with the help of some cable clips velcro
straps and 3m tape he managed to clean
up all the wires from the ground
nicely done speaking of drilling holes
it looks like he drilled some for the
keyboard and mouse and for his surface
book and wireless charger for
peripherals he's rocking the courser
gaming k95 keyboard the sabor RGB Mouse
on top of the RGB Polaris mousepad
which he synced together using the
cursor
q lightening software the ripple effect
is his favorite so whenever he clicks on
a key a wave of light gets sent into
each direction across this keyboard
mouse and even mouse pad which is pretty
dope the PC that's powering the setup
has a 60 50 k-6 core processor and two
EVGA GTX 1080 FTW additions in SLI okay
so I get the surface book the wireless
charger and even a Bioshock Big Daddy
figurine being on the desk but what's up
with the zombie quick revive Cola
bottles being right there in the middle
it kind of looks out of place to me
everything else is pretty much perfect a
very sick gaming setup thank you Miguel
for entering last but not least we got
prints and right off the bat the cable
management is making me want to jump off
a bridge there are just too many cables
that are left unintended I mean if you
could build a custom water-cooled PC I
know you have the skills to manage a few
cables unless the PC wasn't built by you
then I can understand the desk is using
is the Atlantic gaming desk Pro which
isn't something I would recommend
because it's very light and flimsy but
he's only got a 29 inch curved monitor
from Samsung on it so for this setup
it's actually fine I definitely don't
recommend this desk for multi-monitor
setups or for people that want to put
their pcs on the top one of the things I
do like about the desk is the fact that
it comes with a cup holder the headphone
hanger and two speaker stands which are
holding up your Logitech C 533 speakers
so none of that we got the Razer
BlackWidow chroma keyboard and he does
had our mouse and for audio he's rocking
a pair of sony MDR headphones and a
Logitech G 430 gaming headset sadly he's
only got space to hang one of the
headphones I do feel like this setup
needs a lot of work
the cables being priority over here I
don't like the fact that the speaker
cables are laying on top of the desk
like that also the random RGB LED remote
that's hooked up against the wall and
then the random colors throughout the
entire setup I mean you got a black and
green PC with Razer gear so why not go
with a black and green color scheme I
just feel like the red LEDs on the
keyboard and mouse plus the blue colors
from the headset really throw off
everything and that's why I feel like
the coordination is one of the major
things that is lacking from this setup
it definitely has potential though so if
you spend some time to change a few
things up and tidy up the cables I
promise you this setup would look
a lot better I'm also tempted in
starting a new series called setup
makeover where I go across the country
into people's homes and completely
revamp their setup from bottom to top I
don't know I'm just throwing some random
ideas out let me know in the comments
section if that's something you guys
want to see done on the channel it's
going to be pretty pricey but if you
guys are interested in that type of
content I will make it happen but
anyways that is it for this episode of
setup orders make sure you guys drop
your comments down below and vote on who
you think has the best desk setup as
always I'll announce the winners on my
Twitter and Instagram accounts make sure
you guys are follow me there if you are
interested thank you so much for
watching I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
