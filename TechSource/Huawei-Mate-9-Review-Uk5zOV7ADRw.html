you might have heard of this Chinese
brand but if you're an average consumer
chances are you haven't the Chinese
manner has shipped over 100 million
smartphones in 2015 and for a few years
now they've made very good attempts in
expanding their US presence just like
last year at CES when they released the
mate 8 while way this time around has
unveiled their new flagship the mate 9 I
received my review unit one week before
it was announced and I've been using it
as my daily driver ever since so with
that said let's get into the review so
this thing is big in fact it's as big as
it gets in the Android phablet
marketplace with a screen measuring 5.9
inches now even with such a massive
screen it's not as hard to use as you
think
in fact the dimensions come close to
that at the iPhone 7 plus that's
equipped with a 5.5 inch screen it's
rocking an LCD panel that has a
resolution of 1080p and I know nowadays
that the numbers seems small compared to
the quad HD panels that are in the
market but the low resolution is great
for battery life and honestly I can't
tell the difference unless they are
side-by-side the viewing angles are
great and it's nice and bright even
outside and most importantly I do enjoy
consuming content without any complaints
the unibody metal construction is very
similar to that of the mate 8 which
isn't a bad thing
everything's just seamless and the small
details like the curves and chamfers
really makes for a premium feel it's a
good time to note that there is micro SD
card support as well so the speaker is
loud and clear and when you use the
phone horizontally it will automatically
start using the earpiece as a speaker as
well but unfortunately this doesn't add
much as it's low in volume in fact
here's a quick sample
powering the phone is Huawei is Kiran
960 SOC and that's an octa-core CPU but
also an octa-core GPU that makes for
some crazy performance playing all the
newest and most intense games and just
navigating the new EMU i-5 interface
resulted in no hiccups or choppiness
whatsoever
also the Kirin 960s 3d runtime supports
the new Android 7 standard of Vulcan
graphics which basically reduces the
phone's reliance on the CPU while
maximizing the GPU capacity Huawei
claims this results in a 400 percent
improvement in graphics performance
they've also managed to lower power
consumption by 15 percent coming from
their last generation SOC I'm happy to
say that they've improved their
interface from version 4.0 and now
finally feels like a skin I could use
daily in my opinion is vastly better in
terms of looks when compared to
something like the cartoonish Samsung
skins with its very light theming and
straightforward looks
Huawei claims that their emu i5 actually
keeps this phone running smooth even
months down the line which is something
other Android manufacturers can't often
say this is done when the software
analyzes and adapts to consumer usage
behaviors it basically allocates
resources for the users most crucial
tasks however it's a bit early to tell
if this is just a bunch of marketing
terms so we'll have to revisit this
phone in a month or two one thing to
note is that while weighs actually the
manufacturer of both the hardware and
software allowing for a tightly knit
integration all these optimizations help
with battery life as well as is with
most of the mate lineup the battery in
here is giant coming in at 4000 million
power I could easily get through an
entire day of heavy usage my screen on
time would hit four hours before it
would drop below 30 percent which is
fantastic combined with the new charging
technology Huawei has implemented which
allows for five amp charging rates makes
for a powerhouse of a phone I would plug
in the meat 9 at 27% and 15 minutes
later it would be at 52% I do want to
mention that the charging port is the
new industry standard USB C as well
Huawei has once again partnered with
Laker to bring the new dual sensor set
up found on this phone it consists of a
12 megapixel color sensor with oh is and
a 20 megapixel black-and-white sensor
that helps pick up extra detail this
package makes for great images in both
well-lit and low light situations
the benefits of the monochrome sensor is
that it helps capture more detail with
some software tricks the phone combines
both images in an effort to increase
overall detail it doesn't compete with
the iPhones and galaxies but it does
come close another one of the benefits
of having a two sensor setup is the
depth effects more specifically the
white aperture mode a photo shot in this
mode can have its point of focus
adjusted after the picture has been
taken the auto focus is now also twice
as powerful it combines laser focus
phase detection focus death focus and
contrast focus all of this sounds great
but in practice the camera struggles in
certain low-light situations to pull
focus the camera setup has a lot of
potential unfortunately it seems most of
the problem with the pictures this
camera produces is down to the software
once you get into the pro mode and start
to play around with the settings you get
some pretty good results the front
shooter is 8 megapixels and it produces
more or less of what you expect it's
pretty high in resolution but struggles
in low-light as most other front-facing
cameras do if anyone's interested there
will be a link down below for some
original pictures and video from the
mate 9 this is why ways best phone yet
they really made an attempt at solving
some of the biggest gripes with the mate
8 the biggest being the improved camera
and user interface unfortunately there
are a few things keeping me from making
this my main device what a wish is this
lack of waterproofing something I've
grown accustomed to with my iPhone 7
plus but if looking for a smartphone
that has a big screen solid performance
and microsd expandable 'ti then the mate
9 is something to consider if you guys
are interested in checking out the mate
9 I'll drop a link to them down below
I'm gonna be huge thanks to Wow way for
sending this in for review thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
