and welcome back to another keyboard
video however this one is gonna be very
different and interesting from the other
keyboards I reviewed on the channel so
this is the expose organ on my keyboard
and I've been using it for about two
weeks now and all I gotta say is this is
not your typical keyboard it hasn't been
released yet but judging by the high
demand for it on Kickstarter I think it
might be the next big thing for PC users
so first off let's talk about the design
and as I said before this is a very
different keyboard than what you're used
to the layout is pretty much the main
thing that separates itself from the
traditional keyboard there is definitely
a learning curve you guys can't just
switch from a traditional keyboard
layout to this one and expect no
difference when I first started using
this my typing speed went down
drastically I went from about 70 words
per minute to 19 wpm which is about
three times less than what I'm used to
but after using it for about a week my
speed did increase gradually as I got
used to where the keys were located and
I don't have to look at the keys as much
while typing it may turn some people off
by looking at the layout but after using
it for some while I gotta say it has
some great aspects about it the best way
to explain it is that there are two
major sections for all your letter keys
unlike a traditional keyboard where all
your letter keys are compacted and close
to each other this keyboard is more
strategically scattered what I think is
neat is that there are two space keys
one is on the left side of the keyboard
and the other one is on the right making
it convenient to reach either key from
either side while you type I like the
large space key on standard keyboards
but those are not the only different key
locations for example the delete enter
ctrl and shift keys are in between these
two sections which is what I had the
hardest time getting used to the
keyboard is not too long in fact it's
very compact it is mechanical and it has
RGB lighting so that is a plus for me
personally the buttons feel nice and
clicky and there is good key travel
it also has gator on switches that I've
been rated up to fifty million clicks
which is the highest on the market
however there are different switch types
like red blue black and brown depending
on your preference the model we have
however has red switches which feel a
lot like the Cherry MX's
there are 15 lighting movement effects
with controllable brightness speed
direction and even color according to
their Kickstarter page there's also this
blue arrow type symbol at the center
which I think gives it a pretty cool
unique look now there is one thing I do
not like about the keyboard because of
its form factor and how compact it is it
does not have a ten key now for gaming I
played some pub G and overwatch and as
expected there was definitely a learning
curve but after a few games I wasn't
doing so bad at times I thought maybe I
couldn't pull off what I usually do with
a regular keyboard for example due to
the more slanted layout and how compact
it is I was able to be more focused on
handling my controls I feel over time
the more you play with this keyboard the
more you will see an increase in your
performance I can see how this can be an
esports keyboard given how small it is
and how some key locations can benefit
you having an upper edge against your
opponent I would say if you're a gamer
and want to try something different then
you should definitely check out the
expose keyboard because of the keyboards
layout there are some keys that are
closer and also easier to press compared
to traditional keyboards and I feel like
that can benefit you in your gaming now
if you're someone who types a lot and
writes a bunch of essays or scripts for
example then the ergonomic form factor
of this keyboard can definitely benefit
you more than a traditional keyboard but
like I said before there is definitely a
learning curve so please be patient with
it if you're gonna pick one up and I
would say give it about a week to test
it out and if you still don't like it
then you can switch back to the
traditional layout so this begs the
question is the expose organ AMA
keyboard worth it and honestly I wish I
had an answer for you guys it really
comes down to the person and what
they're gonna use the keyboard for as
well as their budget personally I think
I'm gonna stick to the traditional
keyboard layout because I don't think
I'm gonna be gaining much switching to
the xposed keyboard first of all I'm not
a hardcore gamer so I'm not gonna be
gaining much from that category and - I
don't type a lot so from the ergonomic
standpoint I don't think I'm gonna take
advantage of its ergonomic design the
Corsair k70 Lux keyboard I'm using right
now works just fine and honestly I have
no complaints but they're pretty much
wraps up this video if you guys enjoyed
it feel free to toss a like to show your
support
the channel it's a very simple gesture
takes less than a second but if you guys
didn't like the video feel free to
dislike as well and let me know your
feedback in the comment section if you
guys want to check out the keyboard I'll
drop a link to it down below thank you
so much for watching and I will see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
