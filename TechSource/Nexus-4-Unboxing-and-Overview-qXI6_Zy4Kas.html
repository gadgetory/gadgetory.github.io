today's unboxing and giveaway is the
Nexus 4 smartphone by Google so let's
get started alright so this is actually
a special giveaway we're doing this is
something we wanted to try for a while
now and we have partnered with milkers 5
to make this happen
if you guys want to enter for a chance
to win this awesome phone check out the
description below it has all the simple
steps you need to do in order to get
entered into the drawing and I will
actually announce the winner on June
15th ok now let's get back to the
unboxing this phone is actually a pure
Google phone now what do I mean by that
it's running Google's vision of the
Android software without the skins like
HTC Sense or Samsung TouchWiz on the top
as well as a few benefits like getting
the latest Google updates exactly when
they come out and being able to use
Google Wallet so it's going to take out
the phone real quick the phone actually
has a glass back and the front is
surrounded with soft plastic type
material on the sides I'm gonna actually
put this aside real quick and see what
else the phone comes with as usually old
phones come with a QuickStart guide
nothing fancy here they actually didn't
include earphones for the Nexus 4 which
I think it kind of sucks but you know a
lot of phone companies are starting to
do that because everyone has their own
paradigm guessing and you have the wall
charger this is actually much wider much
longer compared to the other wall
chargers for other smartphones like the
s4 of course and iPhone 5s and here you
have your micro SB cable of course to
connect your computer to charge files to
transfer files and of course to use for
charging and the last and certainly not
least you have a SIM injector tool to
obviously help you take out the SIM card
and insert it in and there's nothing
else left in the box as you can see
which I'm clearly showing you and here's
the phone itself so this phone is
extremely light and thin although it's
not a thinner or lighter than iPhone 5
it certainly comes really close from
first impressions actually on this phone
as a material feels really nice in your
hand it's kind of nice screen size at
4.7 inches for people that actually
don't prefer the 5-inch screen size so
while I'm bleeding up the phone actually
I'm going to go over some few specs as I
mentioned before the screen size is 4.7
inches
with a resolution of 1280 by 768 with a
pixel density of 320 the front screen is
actually covered with Gorilla Glass 2
and those of you that are not familiar
with that it's basically engineered for
a combination of thinness lightness and
damage resistance the phone is unlock
that also runs on old GSM networks this
phone also supports wireless charging
which is a really awesome feature they
added although it does run on all GSM
networks unfortunately it does not have
4G LTE ok so let's talk about the
cameras real quick it has an 8 megapixel
back camera that records in full 1080p
and a 1.3 megapixel front camera capable
of recording in 720p
this phone also has a 2 gigs of RAM and
ones that a quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
CPU overall this is such a great phone
honestly and it just has so much to
offer to the users being a pure Google
phone has its own benefits as well you
get the latest updates months before
it's released on other Android phones
and the phone runs much smoother and
faster compared to the other smartphones
running Android so that's it for the
unboxing and overview guys don't forget
