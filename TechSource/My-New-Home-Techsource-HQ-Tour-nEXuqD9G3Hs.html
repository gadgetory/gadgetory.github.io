tech stores so I finally moved into my
new place this is my new apartment I'm
gonna give you guys a quick tour I did
bring everything in and it's actually a
pretty big mess because there's still a
bunch of stuff flying around but I'm
going to give you guys a quick tour so
this is the living room
got the couch coffee table this is where
the new setup wars and PC Wars will be
filmed at so kind of have to get used to
that this world of TV is going to go by
to another of course got some paintings
like I said it's just a bunch of stuff
around so obviously moving slightly
upstairs and the dining room area this
is where the poker table is as you can
see this is the only place that actually
could fit the poker table so that's kind
of why it's there so yeah I'm going to
have coconuts hopefully once again every
weekend in the night hopefully so in
here is the kitchen area
not sure why there's two instances but
there is some not complaining I guess
you can start off from that side we have
the tables and chairs I think what I'm
saying and here's the laundry and
watch them dryer I should say unit
that's a pretty nice plus about this
place on this side we have obviously got
your dishwasher so microwave and the
others actually bought a really about a
new fridge for us so super nice owners
and it comes complementary with three
champagne bottles I haven't even tried
these so hopefully they're good but
awesome owners thank you guys so much
for that crack it open and celebrate
alright it's basically after that let's
now go upstairs oh it's the trash can
the famous trash can and the mini fridge
that we bought from the office so
exiting out this is the Harry I call
this the Harry Potter closet just
because it looks like the closet alright
Potter I don't know why I'm showing you
the bathroom but hey it's it's I guess
we're going to be using this for the
guest bathroom that's what the purpose
for this is and I'll set nonsense let's
go back upstairs or let's go upstairs I
should say if you haven't been upstairs
yeah alright so up here is basically
another closet when you reach the top
just a bunch of shelves nothing fancy
here this is my bedroom or our bedroom I
guess as you can see there's nothing on
there yet but this is my queen bed I'm
actually gonna buy it maybe 40 50 inch
TV mounted on the wall over here and of
course I'm gonna pick up a dresser stop
so it's it's honestly looking a lot of
play now but it will
a lot better I would say a few weeks not
about them here nothing special
now on to the good stuff so this place
is actually technically two bedrooms but
this room is so small that they don't
even count it as an actual bedroom so
instead of being three bedrooms actually
two bedrooms but this is where the
storage unit is going to be I'm gonna
buy a bunch of shelves from Ikea and
categorize these alphabetically these
are basically all product reviews that
I've either done in the past or I need
to do in the future as you can see it's
a complete mess just standing here gives
me an anxiety so that's just the sleeve
quickly before we get it to be main
master fetter this is about the Raiders
is the Astor bath I guess is that even
such a thing called Instagram what
whatever
get your tub standard shower which is
extremely small look how small this
shower is like if the waters anything
facing me so I'm gonna probably replace
that and get a bigger shower
this method is taken be mine on me she
has her own bathroom there in our
bedroom
so yeah ladies and gentlemen prepare
yourselves this is the new headquarters
of Texas work-in-progress of course I
welcome you with open arms as you can
see my station is set up but I'm still
working on the alternate station and if
you
things as a bunch of cables and crap
lying around but yeah this is where the
alternate backup station will leads
where Bob will be editing videos for
tech source over here we have the
charging station aka charging dock with
some minor modifications underneath for
different charges but you're not going
to show you that and this is the filming
table this is where the products will be
the reason why I put it against this
wall is because I have a long wall to
work with since I'm going to be using a
wide angle lens I figured this would
really the table would benefit being
against this wall over here and of
course one of the things I'm very proud
of I still don't know where I'm gonna
hang this so I'm kind of looking around
I was thinking about hanging it on top
of my PC but then it's like the same
wallpaper it kind of looks lame so I'm
going to put in put my silver play
button actually on top of my piece yes
where that's gonna go this I have no
idea still looking around Bob actually
told me - what would you tell me put it
over there over there Bob told me to put
the painting or poster over here so I
don't what do you guys think let me know
your comments down below I kind of want
it over there on the alternate station I
want to be mounted up there but let me
know what looks better guys by dropping
a comment down below
basically it one of the things I really
love about this place is the natural
light as you can see there's two windows
on both sides so I will see don't even
need to use my soft boxes this thing was
extremely bright around 12:00 or 1:00
o'clock so I can basically use natural
light in my videos and it will look a
lot better for sure
so it'll could cost on electric bill so
that's a huge plus we have basically it
have a little closet in that corner over
there a chicken I put some stuff in
and put some stuff in there which a
great tour okay I think I said I'm just
gonna wrap it up here thank you guys so
much for watching the video I will make
another update once everything is
settled in once I get more furniture in
oh yeah let me know what you guys think
about the new place let me know what you
guys think about the headquarters of
Texas then you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
