their elbow once you know it's not
really fair for me because my biceps are
in the way what's up guys is that from
Texas and it's that time of the month
again actually shouldn't say that
because I missed out on a few months but
usually I do this every single month I
reach out to Twitter and ask you guys to
send me in your questions so without
wasting any more time it's gonna answer
some of these how did you pay for things
before you started YouTube what was your
job I should never really paid for an
item or a product I went to Best Buy or
Fry's I basically bought the item did a
video on it and then returned it back so
technically I never really paid for
anything other than some restocking fees
sometimes the struggle was real can we
do a collaboration video together I'm
always open to doing collabs with tech
youtubers no matter their channel size
because everyone starts somewhere you
know back in the day when I went X
versus only a few thousand subscribers
it was really difficult growing and
gaining new audiences in fact I even
reached out to a few bigger tech
youtubers to kind of collab with them
and maybe gain new audiences and I was
just rejected so I know that feeling
that sucks and I basically vowed to
never be like that so that is why I host
set up or Z to Perdition I almost like
keyboard collab videos and just
collapsed aisle videos on my channel to
try and introduce smaller and very
talented tech youtubers but if you guys
have any video idea you want me to
participate for your channel be sure to
hit me up on email I am always always
down
what's text source channel future plan
so the future plan is hopefully hire
some employees early 2017 that is when I
can move out of the space get my house
and also get an office space close to my
house and really start cranking videos
and take tech soars to the next level
because right now I'm very limited and I
can only do so much as one person so
yeah that's the plan I'm gonna make it
happen I'm excited
why do you use Windows and not Mac
Brad would you rather never have sex or
never be able to touch or have
technology phones PC parts etc that is a
very evil question Katie I guess I'm
gonna have to be best friends in my hand
again do you think you will give a set
up wars seal of approval to a Mac setup
I say why the hell not if the setup was
me I can care less if you're winning a
laptop or a potato if it's a badass
setup yes definitely we should have a
video do you like making the most
honestly I like making these types of
videos where there's no script and I can
just send from the camera and just say
what's on my mind or answer questions
and just talk to you guys who records
and goes through submissions right now I
do all the work I have my good buddy
Kevin Lee Ozzy I'm sure you guys have
heard me talk about him a few times he's
in charge of downloading the submissions
categorizing them and sending me the
final bulk every single week because
right now I can't handle hundreds of
submissions each week that is just way
too much and I cannot work on my video
so big shout out to Kevin meows even
helping me out on that what is your
daily schedule what do you do throughout
your day so I usually wake up around ten
eleven sometimes 12 p.m. depending on
how late I work the previous night and
then I go to the bathroom take a poop
brush my teeth
I come and I sit on my desk check emails
I usually takes about an hour go through
my Twitter feed my Instagram feed and I
watch my YouTube subscriptions i watch
my youtube videos that I need to catch
up on and then I go downstairs make
myself breakfast and get to work what's
the biggest mistake that you have ever
done in a video all related to YouTube
nothing really comes to my mind I
usually catch these mistakes as I'm
watching my video because every time I'm
done rendering a video I would sit there
and I would watch my own video very
rarely some mistakes well I shouldn't
say that but sometimes mistakes go
through but nothing really major there
was one time though that I leaked my
phone number and there's one time I
leaked my credit card number on one of
the best tech deals and some person or
multiple people found that number and
they started buying kind of stuff
Facebook and on Amazon I was like what
really what do you do for living before
doing YouTube video so before I started
doing video YouTube videos I wrote that
a bank first bank to be specific here in
California I was a CSR aka a teller just
basically handling cash for customers
and stuff and I did that for about eight
months but before then I was also a
banker a teller I should say at Wells
Fargo and also looked at Chase and just
a bunch of I've been in banking for
seven years and it was I hated banking
can you be my daddy well depends is your
mom Jessica Alba how do you turn out so
many videos in a week is there a more
efficient way to edit videos so I've
developed a system where it makes it so
easy for me to pump out videos where I
can basically keep up with five to seven
yeah five to seven videos a week and
that's basically multitasking right now
I'm sitting in front of a camera talking
and I have scripts ready on my next
projects already lined up on my iPad so
when I'm done recording this video I'm
gonna change my shirt and then start
voicing over the next video so basically
my philosophy is kill ten birds with one
stone
so yeah basically just mastering
multitasking and also when it comes to
editing I have a preset file for almost
every type of my series that I'm doing
for example that set up Wars or PC Wars
everything is already laid out in my
Sony Vegas Pro 13 program so basically
all I have to do is plug in the photos
plug in my new video and audio and I'm
set to go for the most part the rest of
the stuff is already edited ready to go
so it only takes me like about an hour
to edit each video can you do an extreme
budget PC build the fine extreme budget
because the cheapest one I've built on
the channel that actually plays games is
budget Ron that 350 dollar gaming PC and
that kicks ass in GTA 5 over 30 fps and
also a bunch of other games check that
out I'll have it linked below would you
never touch an iPhone again for $100,000
I take keep my freaking money right now
is your girlfriend into tech actually
Briana is not
Tech and in fact she's not even tech
savvy so I'm always the one to help her
on her iPhone 6 and laptop issues and
geez why PC builds become so popular for
small channels what is the reason behind
it it could be a few reasons one is
maybe just tired of making whatever
content that they're making - there's
also inspiration they see other larger
channels that are doing PC build a PC
content and you see how well it's
working for them and I guess they're
trying to adapt that on their channel as
well it's kind of the only two things I
can really think of can you start
blogging again please see well here's
the thing my vlogs are currently on hold
for several reasons one I currently
don't have the time to vlog and - I have
nothing interesting to vlog about if you
guys want to see vlogging of me working
all day then no that's not gonna happen
that's boring and I usually vlog when
there's something interesting going on
if I'm going out of town but I know you
guys are so many guys really like
watching that so it's definitely not
gone it's just currently shelved until I
work on other tech projects to catch up
I'm actually leaving for Taiwan at the
end of May May 29th and I'll be taking
my vlog camera and I'll be vlogging my
experience for Computex so I'll get you
a vlog or two there will be another
setup Wars potato Edition with Kyle oh I
don't know I don't know if Carla will
ever return ever since he knocked me
unconscious to another day but it seems
like a lot of guys really enjoyed that
episode episode 50 by the way of setup
wars
so maybe Deadpool will make an
appearance can you recommend some good
LED speakers for my setup I want some
that look awesome and sound awesome
oh the best LED speakers that I could
think of currently are the bass pulse go
groove speakers I'll drop a link to it
down below I think they have some for
red blue and green and they have some
insane amount of bass sound clarity is
amazing
there I think affordable tooling there
under 50 bucks but anyways I'll drop a
link check it out how are you so cool
