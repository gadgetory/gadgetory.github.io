that so lame
what's up guys it's ad from Texas and
today we have a different type of video
as you can see I have a massive box in
front of me which I have no idea what's
inside all I know is that it's from
Intel and honestly I'm hoping that it's
their new 69 50 x10 core processor so
let's go to unbox this and find out and
I don't have my knife already alright so
let's go ahead and open this up and this
is definitely something new I'm doing on
the channel so let me know if this is
something you guys enjoy watching of
this style of unboxings is something you
fancy if so let me know in the comments
down below alright let's keep going
this box is pretty beat-up so we have a
bunch of these popcorn things in here
and it appears to be a backpack let's
get this out of here see what's the Sun
I mean there's something else down here
nope nothing else all right so this is
what was inside the entire box a
backpack that says extreme rig challenge
and it's like a little envelope attached
to it that says classified let's go to
open gonna open this up and see what
it's all about
so we got a little note here Department
of Strategic Services agent you have
been activated at this morning blah blah
blah
until us equip them with key ingredients
to start including the new Intel Core i7
processor Extreme Edition and the intel
SSD 750 series obviously I'm not gonna
read the rest of it you guys can pause
the video and check it out I'm gonna
gonna put this to the side and open this
up and see what's inside here they're
pretty cool looking backpack ow I may
use this for a CES you never know
alright so on the top there is this
flashlights
oh alright put that way oh look at that
sweet looking knife which may be my new
unboxing knife this thing's actually
pretty beat-up so I may have to replace
it this looks pretty sweet let me see if
I can open it up oh there we go
uh yeah pretty dinky looking knife
actually this looks way more badass but
let me know what you guys think of which
knife I should continue using this is
actually isn't that sharp and some
pliers check this out guys this is like
an all-in-one Swiss Army knife so yeah
definitely uh this can definitely come
in handy check the top well I wasn't
even open that way oh yes so we got a
few things here and see we have a
lighter I don't I don't smoke and tell
what is this and we have a looks like a
USB cable some sort a micro USB cable
for something to charge my lighter whoa
what is this this is a freaking taser
whoa no hell no I'm not I'm not gonna be
dazing myself on camera actually if this
video gets 10,000 likes I will tase
myself with this and one of my setup was
video so you should be interesting sorry
zippers all right nothing there
so this looks like a water bottle
extreme challenge very nice let's check
out inside got some manuals and some
paperwork pretty cool look in the bottle
over here alright it's gonna open this
up and oh yeah we got a wait a copy of
tom whoa Tom Clancy's Rainbow six siege

shot
we got a pass
all-access PAX Prime pass from September

going oh it includes airfare hotel and
conference take a look at that thank you
guys
what else is in here it looks like
nothing else all right let's move on to
the main compartments of the backpack
whoa a lot of stuff in here so I guess
we can check this I don't know what this
is it looks like a battery charger of
some sort and get a pair of headphones
from cave these look pretty sweet the
worldcat cave
xtd headphones the very light headphones
I'm curious about the build quality
alright so let's put that aside and
check out this final thing
there is no processor oh well maybe next
time
it looks like we have a pretty cool
shirt Xtreme rig challenge which
honestly looks a little too large for me
but very cool shirt and I've got this
little thing here
so basically Intel gave 12 system
builders ingredients needed to create
the ultimate gaming rig they also got
Intel's
i7 69 50x processor which is the first
10 core desktop processor with 20
threads this is an overclockable
processor and you get up to 40 lanes of
PCI so there's another one for Intel's
enthusiast series so that's pretty much
it yeah there's no processor or any SSDs
in here
but we got a bunch of cool stuff and the
backpack itself is pretty dope so thank
