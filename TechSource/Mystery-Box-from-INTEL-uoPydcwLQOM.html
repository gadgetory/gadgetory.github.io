inside all I know is that it's from
Intel and honestly I'm hoping that it's
their new 69 50 x10 core processor so

I don't have my knife already alright so
let's go ahead and open this up and this
is definitely something new I'm doing on
the channel so let me know if this is
something you guys enjoy watching of
this style of unboxings is something you
fancy if so let me know in the comments
down below alright let's keep going
this box is pretty beat-up so we have a
bunch of these popcorn things in here
and it appears to be a backpack let's
get this out of here see what's the Sun
I mean there's something else down here
nope nothing else all right so this is
what was inside the entire box a
backpack that says extreme rig challenge
and it's like a little envelope attached
to it that says classified let's go to
open gonna open this up and see what
it's all about
so we got a little note here Department
of Strategic Services agent you have
been activated at this morning blah blah

until us equip them with key ingredients
to start including the new Intel Core i7
processor Extreme Edition and the intel
SSD 750 series obviously I'm not gonna

gonna put this to the side and open this
up and see what's inside here they're
pretty cool looking backpack ow I may

sweet looking knife which may be my new
unboxing knife this thing's actually
pretty beat-up so I may have to replace
it this looks pretty sweet let me see if
I can open it up oh there we go
uh yeah pretty dinky looking knife
actually this looks way more badass but
let me know what you guys think of which
knife I should continue using this is
actually isn't that sharp and some
pliers check this out guys this is like
an all-in-one Swiss Army knife so yeah
definitely uh this can definitely come
in handy check the top well I wasn't
even open that way oh yes so we got a
few things here and see we have a
lighter I don't I don't smoke and tell

USB cable some sort a micro USB cable
for something to charge my lighter whoa

I'm curious about the build quality
alright so let's put that aside and
check out this final thing
there is no processor oh well maybe next
time
it looks like we have a pretty cool
shirt Xtreme rig challenge which
honestly looks a little too large for me
but very cool shirt and I've got this
little thing here
so basically Intel gave 12 system
builders ingredients needed to create
the ultimate gaming rig they also got
Intel's
i7 69 50x processor which is the first
10 core desktop processor with 20
threads this is an overclockable
processor and you get up to 40 lanes of
PCI so there's another one for Intel's
enthusiast series so that's pretty much
it yeah there's no processor or any SSDs
in here
but we got a bunch of cool stuff and the
backpack itself is pretty dope so thank
