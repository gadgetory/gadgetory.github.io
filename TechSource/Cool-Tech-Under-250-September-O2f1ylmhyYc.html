and welcome back to another episode of
cool Tech in this video I'm gonna be
focusing on cool tech on their $250 but
if you guys missed the series make sure
to smack that like button because I do
have a cool tech on there 50 coming up
soon kicking off the episode is vector
by unki this tiny little guy is not only
a very smart home robot but he also has
a personality right now if you're in the
US you can actually get early access to
vector through Angie's Kickstarter page
and pay 20% less than the retail price
so you will be saving $50 if you pick
him up before September 7th so vector is
always on and he's aware of his
surroundings through touch sight and
sound so you can leave him on your desk
without worrying about him crashing into
things or falling off he does have
sensors and lasers to help him navigate
around and he's always learning another
cool thing about vector being autonomous
is that he's completely capable of
charging himself you don't have to worry
about charging him or shutting him off
he pretty much takes care of himself so
the main selling point of vector is that
he's not just another robot sidekick
he's a companion that grows and learns
with you while at the same time offering
some useful utilities for example you
can ask him what the weather is like and
he can show you in his own character
driven way through his LCD screen you
could also ask him to set a timer in
case you're cooking something or other
useful things like that that's what I
love about vector how unki is bringing a
robot to life utilities are cool and
instead of competing against Alexa or
Siri vector is about actually having a
robot full of personality as HD camera
allows them to see the world and
recognize people in the room as well as
learn their names you can even hear
commands from you and your family and
friends if you say hey vector using the
microphone built inside the main purpose
of vector is to grow and learn with you
while bringing joy to your life
the fact that he has his own personality
and offers some pretty cool utilities is
why I think he's a cool piece of tech
and why deserves to be on
number one spot in this video vector is
also available for pre-order in the UK
Canada Australia and New Zealand and
he'll be released on October 12 I'll
drop a link below to on keys Kickstarter
if you want to check him out next up is
the popular Nano leave these are easily
the coolest piece of tech you can add to
any setup or room really to spice things
up I can make an entire video on this
alone since there's a lot to talk about
but to simplify things
there are triangular RGB panels that you
can control through your smart phone I
mean there are endless amount of
possibilities you can control the
brightness the color temperature of each
panel and you can even set animations
and control the direction of the
animations they occasionally update the
app with new scenes that other users
submit so if you're lazy to create your
own you can just download and use one
that's already been created so these
panels are basically connected to each
other using this small chip which serves
as a bridge so you hook it up on one
side and then you would attach it
together like this and then of course
you would add some 3m tape over here on
the sides to keep it together and also
at the same time mounting it against the
wall another cool thing that nano leaf
comes with is this thing called with
them and it's an add-on with a built-in
microphone that can listen to incoming
sound and respond by lighting up the
panel's the rhythm is best paired of
music and it even has a headphone jack
so if you want to plug in the source
directly for even more accurate panel
response then you can do that the only
downside is you won't be able to hear
the source because it's being plugged in
here
so I don't really know why that's there
but anyways here's a demonstration of
what this thing can do so the panel is
already hooked up and you can see how
sensitive it is picking up my voice 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
next up is the bank you smart desk lamp
the only reason why this is in the video
is because of its cool and modern design
doesn't have a ton of buttons and it
doesn't take up much space on the desk
you can tilt swivel rotate and pretty
much any angle you want and what I like
to do is hide it behind the monitor once
I'm done using it the cool part about
this desk lamp is that its touch
activated simply tap on the ring to turn
it on and off and additionally you can
even adjust the brightness using the
knob and you can even control the color
temperature this is apparently the
world's first desk lamp for monitors
it also features zero flicker technology
basically the light coming out of the
lamp is much smoother than other desk
lamps and this basically means no
flicker and no eye strain the lamp also
detects the light levels around you and
automatically adjust its brightness
accordingly which i think is pretty cool
oh and they also have other colors to
choose from so silver is not your only
option
I think the lamp is a really cool
addition to any set up obviously more
cater towards the productivity side
buddy can use it for gaming as well I
just wish it didn't cost almost $200 for
a desk lamp but I don't know judging by
the reviews it's got over a hundred
reviews four and a half stars apparently
people are loving it and last but
certainly not least we have this little
guy right over here which even till
today still remains as one of my
favorite pieces of tech ever longtime
subscribers are probably tired of seeing
us because I mentioned it so many times
but for those of you that never heard of
it
allow me to introduce you to the link
there's so much that I love about this
first off it's completely wireless you
don't have to plug this into a wall just
use the two provided double-a batteries
second no subscription is needed all the
files are stored on their cloud for free
and you can access them through your
smart phone on top of all that it comes
with a built-in microphone so you can
hear what's going on it's also got a
motion sensor and an LED light which
lights up if the area is dark so how it
works is once the camera is armed
through the app it will start recording
once a detects motion this way it
doesn't use up a lot of battery now once
it detects motion it will send you a
notification and you can immediately
view it on your phone you can also go
into each camera settings manually
and adjust the settings like the
sensitivity the clip length and you can
even check the battery percentage you
can either arm and disarm the camera
manually or you can set a schedule for
it to do it on its own the video quality
is not bad it is 720p to conserve
battery life but it's clear enough to
see what's going on during the day and
night and at the end of the day that's
what matters I always recommend this to
my friends and family every time someone
will ask me what security system I would
recommend to them this always comes up
simply because I've never had any issues
with it for the past I don't know three
four years I've been using it and it
gets the job done it's wireless it's
easy to install and most importantly you
don't have to worry about paying for a
stupid monthly subscription and I've
pretty much wraps up this video of cool
tech under $250 if you guys missed the
series or enjoyed this one tossing a
like would be awesome if you guys want
to see more of these obviously make sure
to subscribe because I have cool tech on
there 50 coming up very soon I thought
we got to check out the Kickstarter
campaign for vector it is ending
September 6th I'll drop a link to that
down below along with everything
mentioned in this video thanks again for
watching I love your faces and I will
see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
