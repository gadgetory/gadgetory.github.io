welcome to my ultimate smart home
episode two
so let's kick off the episode by looking
at one of the many Wemo switches that I
have around my house it's a very simple
piece of smart home tech that allows you
to control your outlet using your smart
phone you essentially plug it into any
outlet you want you download the app and
sync it together and you're pretty much
done the most common thing that I see a
lot of people using their remote switch
with our labs so instead of having to
walk over to the lamp and manually turn
it on I can just log on to my app and
turn it on or off from there
another cool feature about the app is
that you can set schedules so that the
lights can turn on and off on specific
times of the day for example you can
have the lights turn on before you get
home from work and have it go off a few
minutes after you get in bed and those
are just some examples next up on the
list is my front door lock and because
security is really important to me I
picked up the smart door lock from a pin
genie and speaking of security I do want
to take a moment and thank LastPass for
sponsoring this video
LastPass is the easiest most secure way
to store all your accounts from banking
to email and even a smart tech apps that
you use on a daily basis I've been using
LastPass on my desktop for years way
before they reached out to sponsor this
episode and I just love not having to
remember over 20 different passwords or
dealing with locked up accounts another
cool feature of LastPass is the vault it
securely stores all of my important of
information like bank accounts credit
cards and other sensitive information so
whenever I need to check out online I
can refer to the vault or I can even
have LastPass autofill the payments
section it saves me a lot of time and
most importantly it's extremely secure
LastPass is free to use and is available
on iOS and Android as well as your
desktop PC I'll drop a link below if you
guys want to check it out
alright so back to the front door lock I
was talking about one of the things I
love about this lock is that you can
control it using your smart phone it is
connected via bluetooth so you do have
to be within a certain distance
unfortunately I don't know what b-max
this
I looked everywhere online but I was
able to connect to it from anywhere in
my home I was upstairs in my office
which is about 50 feet away from the
door and had no connection issues
obviously does come with a touchscreen
PIN pad so you can enter in the code
manually if you like or you can use the
keyhole for backup scenarios when the
lock runs out of battery speaking of
battery you can check out the current
percentage within the app and I've been
using this since the beginning of
February and it's already at 80 percent
one thing I do recommend with this lock
are rechargeable batteries like I'm
using with mine that way when it runs
out of juice you can just recharge them
and put them back inside without having
to buy new ones so one of the things
that really attracted me to this door
lock instead of the other ones that
looked on Amazon is how their app was
designed it's very user friendly and it
comes with a load of features my
favorite one is that you can send an
extra code to a friend and family member
it's awesome because you can set a
specific time for the code to expire or
you can even just give them a single
entry door code instead once they use it
it automatically expires finally let's
take a look into my bedroom where all
the action happens so I have two smart
home devices in here and they were both
featured in my favorite tech of 2017 in
case you guys missed it I'll drop a link
below but the first item is the smart
ring the lamp from GE called Sol and it
pretty much acts as a desk lamp that you
can control using your smart phone you
can set the color temperature of the
light as well as the brightness what's
really cool about this is that you can
enable clock mode which will tell you
what time it is by lighting up certain
parts of the Ring kind of like an analog
clock but the best feature of course is
the built-in Alexa I can ask what the
weather is like what movies are playing
right now and things like that but to be
honest the only thing I use it for is to
set an alarm clock every single day for
some reason I really like the tone it
sounds very relaxing compared to the
annoying ones on my smart phone
last but not least we have my smart bed
so this is the 8 sleep and it comes with
a built-in tracker and heater the app is
nice because it shows you all of your
stats from your sleep it shows you the
sleep score the time slept how many
times you've tossed and turned heart
rate and a bunch of other stats all of
that is cool and all but the one feature
I use every single day is the built-in
heater I can control both sides of the
bed and set the intensity of the heater
as well as set a timer for it to turn
off currently I do have a schedule set
up so that the bed starts warming up
every night at 12 a.m. and shuts off at
3 a.m. so that way it's nice and toasty
before I get into bed and that pretty
much wraps up this episode if you guys
enjoy the series and I'm going to
continue doing them on the channel
leaving a like would be awesome and if
you guys didn't like the video please
leave a dislike as well everything
mention the video will be linked below
and make sure you guys check out
LastPass I'll also drop a link to that
below thanks so much for watching I'll
see you guys in the next one
