click on the link in the description

it's completely free so starting off the
show is Brian and his impressive
custom-made water-cooled PC desk that's
running on a 60 70 K and an EVGA GTX
1080 he also custom-built some shelves
on the sides and a monitor riser that's
holding up as a surprise e35 gaming
ultrawide monitor what's interesting
about the setup is that brian is rocking
two sets of speakers because one is too
mainstream we got two tiny seungu bamboo
speakers up top and two massive floor
speakers from Surman Vega on the bottom
of his setup I mean you really need
speakers that big for a gaming setup it
kind of seems overkilled
he's also using the Royal kludge Pro 104
keyboard and the EVGA Toro x5 Mouse fun
fact that's actually the same keyboard I
use for my Wolverine setup video
although I did use a white one and
painted it yellow instead he does have a
pair of DT 770's as well when he's not
using the speakers and he's got that
hooked up to the pile amplifier
he definitely has some taste in audio
gear I'll give him that it's a bit
overkill but he's got taste cable
management is pretty good for the most
part although there is one loose cable
under the PC that kind of bothers me
along with the cables running down from
the headset and monitors but overall
it's a very organized and impressive
gaming setup thank you Brian for
entering this next one kind of reminds
me of emails gaming setup in the sense
that Justin also mounted his monitor and
PC against the wall by the way for those
of you that aren't following my
Instagram accounts email recently got
his ultrawide monitor and here is what
his setup looks like now with the lg
monitor installed so when you look at
this setup from a distance you can see
that it's actually a floating desk that
he designed and built himself the
monitor and PC aren't exactly mounted
against the wall directly
he's also got two different setups the
right side is using a 34 inch ultra
light from Samsung that's hooked up to
his custom PC and on the left side is an
MSI laptop
he didn't list what CPU he is using but
he is running on the x99 chipset with 32
gigs of ram and the galaxy allah fame
gtx 1080
I'm loving that white and black color
scheme but I feel like that black color
from the PSU on the bottom doesn't
really belong there this is definitely a
strange recommendation but a custom PSU
cover and white would look a lot better
in my opinion for audio he's using a
pair of bose companion 5 speakers so the
main setup and then we got these
Skullcandy crusher wireless headphones
for the laptop setup he does have a 12
South MacBook stand on the far left but
I don't see a MacBook and he didn't
mention in the notes so I'm confused why
that's there for peripherals he's using
two logitech g502 mice for both setups
and a Corsair Vengeance k70 keyboard
cable management is very clean
especially for a setup like this
excellent worth bundling the wires
together and keeping it hidden under the
desk even above the desk the cables are
hidden very well thanks to the holes
that Justin drilled for each piece of
tech a lot of thought and planning has
gone into this setup and it definitely
shows I just feel like it's missing
something there's a lot of extra space
above your monitor and PC and I feel
like if you fill that up with some
posters or even some shelves with some
products on top it would look complete
regardless excellent job on all the
custom work this is a gorgeous setup
indeed
Thank You Justin for entering a number
three we have NEMA what a razor themed
music production setup featuring the 29
inch asus monitor and a 50 inch samsung
plasma TV up top below that he's using
the eraser or braver keypad and the
Ouroboros gaming mouse so instead of
going with a razor keyboard to match the
rest of the gear he picked up the
Microsoft designer keyboard and mouse
which I'm guessing is used for mixing
and editing music while the Razer mice
are used for gaming for audio he's
walking to giant Yamaha hs7 monitor
speakers on its sides and a pair of m50
X's the PC powering the setup has an all
black color scheme featuring the 59:30
k-6 core processor we got 32 gigs of ram
and 2 asus strix 970 s in sli this is
also the first time that I've seen the
BitFenix pandora case in action I can't
really see the cable management because
the backboard is blocking off everything
but from what I can tell by looking
inside the drawers is that he keeps
everything very tidy and organized it's
a very symmetrical and clean setup with
purpose Thank You Nima for entering
speaking of symmetry check out Peters
battle station it's got three 27-inch
Dell monitors a Logitech G 29 driving
wheel for racing games and an Xbox one
for console games for PC gaming he's
using the Philco magic touch keyboard
and the logitech g930 Watty devices
hooked up to the pc like the sound
blaster ex katana sound bar and we got
the Prasanna studio monitor speakers but
he's also got the cursor h 2100 headset
and he's sennheiser HD 800 headphones
there's definitely a lot of stuff on his
desk but I think he did a great job
organizing it and almost everything has
its purpose
there isn't anything extra like action
figures or IKEA plans to take up the
space he even did a great job with the
cable management we got lots of cable
sleeves channel raceways and boxes were
used to hide the wires nicely done the
PC pushing all these pixels is running
on the 50 20 K and 2 gigabyte GTX 1080s
in sli so the things I like about this
set up are the posters on the wall the
symmetry and the cable management the
only thing I don't like about the setup
are the stickers you put on the walls
what's worse is that some of them are
Razer stickers really
regardless it's a
pretty sick battle station thank you
Peter for entering last but not least we
got the return of Stan lured with an
upgraded setup I don't remember what
setup he was featured on before but it
looks like he added a fourth monitor if
I'm not mistaken so now he's got three
27-inch del gaming monitors and a 27
inch 4k monitor up top oh I don't like
the fact that is blocking the posters
behind it looks like he kept the black
and red dead space theme from before as
well I think the snowball ice microphone
is also new because I don't remember it
from his old setup however he does still
have the cursor k95 RGB keyboard with
the ROG spatha and that badass custom
dead space mouse pad from Inked gaming
that's definitely something I won't
forget for audio he's still rocking me
both companion 5 speakers and the
wireless Boyd headset from Corsair K
Weismann was perfect before and it's
still perfect there's a crap ton of
cables behind the monitors but none of
it is visible from the front and
everything is kept off the ground with
some zip ties and cable clips and
finally the PC is also the same it's
still rocking the 5820k and 3 GTX 970 s
in SLI in that custom loop very minor
improvements from before but regardless
it's still an updated setup so thank you
