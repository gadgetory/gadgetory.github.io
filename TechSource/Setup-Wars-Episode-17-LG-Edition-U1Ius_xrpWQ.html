I might add I got a goddamn pimple on my
forehead I can never win what's up guys
it's ed back again from tech stores and
welcome to setup wars episode 17 where
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel and a chance to
win a prize this episode is actually the
final LG sponsored episode of setup Wars
where the winner will receive a brand
new 34 inch curved monitor so I'm
extremely sorry to the hundreds of
people that entered and did not get
selected I did my best to feature as
many as I can within these four episodes
so I'm really sorry guys it did whatever
I can but with that said let the setup
Wars begin
this video is brought to you by GTA
where you can buy super cheap CD keys
for any game on any platform this is
where I get all my games from as well as
Windows Keys for my monthly PC builds
but I'll leave a link down below so you
can see for yourself
so this episode is going to be slightly
different than my previous 3 I've been
reading your guys emails and tweets and
I read you loud and clear
I've been featuring a lot of high end
setups in the past and usually they end
up winning the ultrawide monitor which
kind of doesn't seem fair to a lot of
you guys and doesn't seem fair to me so
which is why I decided to actually
feature non high-end set ups for this
last episode and give those guys a
chance to win a 34-inch ultrawide
monitor so I hope you guys are cool with
that for everyone else I didn't get a
chance to get featured on the episode LG
is still having their ultra-wide
festival in fact I think there's less
than a week left for you guys to send in
your submission for a chance to win one
of 30 ultra wide monitors and also a
$10,000 prize towards your ultimate
setup but you guys can check out the
video somewhere up here for more
information so with all that said here
are your 10 contestants for this week
Abraham Adrian a lot Ashish Anthony
Balki Ming Nick Tim and yo laughs
congrats for making it to this week's
episode by the way all the gear featured
and every one set up will be linked down
below in the description section like
always for anyone that is interested so
starting the show we have Abraham's set
up right next to his bed and I'll give
you a point already for having your bed
made unlike some people
so we have an LG 27-inch monitor hooked
up to your Lenovo y50 laptop and a desk
we have the courser k95 keyboard and
Corsair m95 mouse we also have a blue
Yeti Mike and a SteelSeries mouse pad so
the desk looks super tiny especially
with that laptop on there but I get it
you don't actually have a PC and your
monitor is being powered by the laptop
so what are the desk you have your
logitech g27 wheel and pedals and a pair
of Audio Technica m50 s on the bottom
right cable management is pretty good as
well I see that you zip side the cables
together so there is some coordination
there and I like that not team Apple
post you have on the time capsule but
yeah overall you have a compact and
clean setup not much else to say thank
you for entering Adrian is next up with
his 25 inch Dell monitor on his
custom-made monitor stand on the desk we
have an apple wired keyboard and a Razer
DeathAdder Mouse definitely one of the
more interesting combinations I have
seen so far also on the monitor stand we
have a pair of Mackie mr5 speakers and
yet another pair of eight ehm 50s on the
just mobile head stand we also have a
rode nt1-a microphone on an extension
boom arm and we can't forget little
Stuart the minion stain guard up on top
I think it's safe to say that this is a
Productivity setup a great job on cable
management I can see that you placed all
your wires and power outlets on there
and even managed to route the bottom
cable under the carpet job well done
somebody also modifications I would like
to point out are the LED strips under
the stand and you're dedicated mount for
the Focusrite audio interface right
under your desk very clever indeed and
to be frank it looks like you have a lot
of extra space on your desk the monitor
stand is extremely long and I think a 34
inch display would fit nicely in there
setup but yeah overall very clean and
organized thank you for entering and
number three we have all tohis music
production setup first off I want to say
that I love the presentation the awesome
table top along with the vikas thick
panels really spice up the atmosphere of
this room so on the desk we have a
27-inch Apple Cinema Display with yet
another custom-made stand what is it
with you guys in custom-made furniture
like everyone is a professional welder
here on setup Wars
I can't even assemble IKEA furniture
together and you guys are building
stands and desks and stuff now but
honestly I'm peanut butter and jelly
that you are able to make awesome stuff
like that it looks amazing on your desk
so kudos to you man
also the desk we have a pair of Newman
studio monitors analysis v49 keyboard
with another wireless keyboard right
below that and the popular Logitech MX
anywhere Mouse I don't even know what
half the stuff on your desk are used for
it looks like a command center from NASA
or something but I do like that little
toy car you have on the stand out for
some reason it doesn't look out of place
not sure why under this idea go pioneer
turntables monitors and headphones and
ever pretty beast Mac Pro as well
there's an Intel six core Xeon and this
thing with a Radeon HD 5770 graphics
card Kay Landrum is very clean and I'm
loving the white LEDs you
honestly a fantastic beautiful setup the
only concern I have is with the keyboard
being so close to the edge of the desk I
mean there's really no room to rest your
palms or wrists so I find that layout a
little uncomfortable other than that you
have a really awesome and clean
symmetrical setup thank you Alto for
entering and good luck with everything
holy mother of all setups Batman this
next setup is out of the world Wow
I think is the appropriate word to
describe this so this is a completely
custom made desk by him and his brother
and it took them 48 days to make it
consists of their favorite logos which
are Republic of gamers biohazard Andrew
authority and of course Batman and
doesn't even stop there they even added
LEDs to each of their logos seriously
though I don't even care about the stuff
on the desk I'm more interested in the
actual desk itself they also have
built-in speakers near the top I mean
everything looks extremely clean and the
cable management is on another level
there are even drawers with their own
dedicated power outlets I can really
tell that they spend lots of time
perfecting this but on the desk itself
there is a 22 inch LG monitors Ebron a
keyboard and a mouse and also a Lenovo G
500 s laptop even the monitor casing is
custom made and honestly it pains me to
see that you have a decent set up with a
brilliant desk I think I'm gonna have to
do it ladies and gentlemen the first
ever 10 out of 10 seal of approval goes
to ashish and manish congratulations you
guys a phenomenal set up indeed I
haven't really explained what the seal
offers you see whoever gets this very
rare award receives a prize so whoever
receives the seal of approval on their
setup gets the following prizes first up
they get 10 stickers at the official set
up Wars seal of approval that they can
basically stick anywhere they want they
also get two limited one-of-a-kind
unique setup wars shirts when a black
and one and white with a customized
message written on the back and they are
also signed personally by me
congratulating them for winning the
so last for at least they will receive
$100 in their PayPal account or an
Amazon gift card so they can buy their
next purchase or upgrade and whatnot but
since you and your brother worked on the
set up I'm gonna give both of you guys
100 bucks so total $200 either in an
Amazon gift card or a PayPal account so
if you guys are watching this toss me an
email and set up wars and claim your
prize' because you guys definitely
deserve it the seal of approval is
rewarded to someone who not only has a
clean set up but also something that's
one-of-a-kind something that can't be
replicated easily and most importantly
impresses me greatly but yeah those are
the three criterias that I'm looking for
in these setups to reward the seal of
approval in case anyone was curious
alright so moving out with the show with
Anthony's setup so it looks like
somewhat of a green themed setup despite
that huge red NZXT phantom case so on
the desk we have a nice huge 27-inch
frameless monitor a Razer BlackWidow
Ultimate keyboard and a DeathAdder
chroma Mouse on top of the Goliath this
extended mouse pad also on the desk we
have the Logitech Z 200 speakers blue
snowball mic and the Xbox 360 on the
left side we have a shelf which he keeps
some of the boxes for the gear and the
PC parts and to the left that says Razer
backpack and hanging from the right as
the Razer Kraken gaming headset okay I
get it you're a huge Razer fan kill
management is great no complaints there
my only question to you is why not go
with the Razer H 440 case from NZXT or
even the s 340 case from Razer as well
it will definitely match your set up
even more but yeah overall a very dope
Razer team setup thank you for entering
at number 6 we have Bucky with a
simplistic white-and-red setup on the
desk we have the 24-inch BenQ monitor a
black widow keyboard anywhere Tactics
mouse and a bose companion 5 audio
system cable management is really great
and I'll give you a couple points for
sticking your xbox one to the roof of
your desk and I've actually never seen
that before but it definitely frees up
lots of space on your desk great job
really loving the LEDs and I can't help
but notice that you are rocking my
personal favorite PC case of all time
the NZXT s340 case let's go and take a
look inside so we have a 4770k paired
with an msi r9 390x
and I find it interesting that you went
with an AMD GPU with an Intel processor
we had how much else to say very clean
and beautiful set up Pocky thank you for
entering next up is mainly with a modest
a single AOC 23 inch monitor set up on
the desk we have the stocky only aware
keyboard that came with the PC and a
Razer DeathAdder Mouse we also have a
pair of Sonia gear speakers and then
Andy J headphones off to the side and I
really like how you use your phone stand
to hold up your Nintendo 3ds I think
that's pretty cool and the key
management is good enough I guess I
can't really see them so it works for me
we overall a very modest and simple
setup the huming for entering at number
eight we have NICs setup a 27-inch BenQ
monitor black widow tournament keyboard
DeathAdder chroma mouse on the
SteelSeries qck gaming mouse also
hanging from the monitors is the HyperX
cloud 2 gaming headset and we also have
a Samson go mic off to the side of the
desk plus one for the gaming headset
choice and LEDs in the back and really
great job on cable management I also
love the PC case that you went with the
s340 case is so damn awesome and I'll
never get over it
you should do what I did and pick up a
Thermaltake headphone hangar for those
headphones but other than that pretty
straightforward and clean setup Thank
You Nick for entering tim is next up
with somewhat of a Razer theme setup so
we have an asus 24 inch monitor and
below that we have yet another Razer
BlackWidow Ultimate keyboard Death Adder
Mouse and hanging from the wall on a
custom hanger is the razer kraken pro
headphones there are so many Razer
products in these episodes it's driving
me crazy in fact the next set up that
has it Razer product I'm gonna smack
myself with this tablet so also on the
desk we have a Hama headset stand and on
top of that is the turtlebeach ear for
stealth headphones that's actually a
really nice looking mousepad and I love
how it doesn't have any letters or logos
on it it's very clean with a dope red
outline I mean it doesn't go well with
your setup but nonetheless it still
looks cool kill a bunch of it a spot-on
and I love how you group them up
together near the roof of your desk but
yeah I mean I don't have anything bad to
say here great setup overall thank you
Tim for entering last but not least we
have you have with a
alright now that I got that off my chest
let's go ahead and resume so we have a
23 inch mag monitor a Razer BlackWidow
chroma keyboard DeathAdder chroma mouse
razer kraken chrome i headset and the
Razer Goliath extended mousepad not sure
what model those speakers are since you
didn't tell me but overall a decent
setup with decent cable management

some work but yeah thank you you lab for
