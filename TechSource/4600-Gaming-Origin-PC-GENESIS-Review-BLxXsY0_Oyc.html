wants the best origin PC has to offer
it's a full Tower chassis and sits at
the top of the price list when looking
at the company's other offerings the
model I have here is specs out with an
ASUS Maximus motherboard I 750 700 K CPU
and 2 GTX 1080s in sli as you'd expect
with hardware like this performance is
insane so instead of just talking about
how fast this computer is I set up to
see if it was worth what Origin PC was
charging making a very comparable PC on
Newegg was very easy as most of the
components were brand named besides the
Origin PC CPU cooler and chassis which
are exclusively there's total with
shipping and tax in California came out
to around $3,500 on new egg give or take
that puts the premium origin charges at
about a thousand dollars and yeah that
is a lot so let's see what we get in
return the sheer size of this computer
is massive calling it a full Tower does
that no justice the added height comes
from the expansion Bay located at the
bottom and it is basically its own
separate area that can house either two
three sixty millimeter radiators for a
ridiculous water cooling setup or you
can even fit 24 2.5 inch hard drives yes
I did say 24 the case is very robust its
steel construction gives it a strong
rigidity but of course the overall
weight of a PC is pretty hefty so if you
guys are looking for a more mobile or
compact solution this probably isn't for
you there's plenty of connectivity at
the front which for USB 3s a reset and
power switch you got the fan mode and
speed controls as well as individual
audio jacks the side panel of course has
a clear window to show off what you've
got inside and taking it off is very
easy with the switch located near the
back the paint job on the inside is new
and you can actually opt for red or
white paint you can even have Origin PC
give your computer a custom paint job to
any color or even design which is pretty
damn awesome just like every new product
coming out this too has RGB which
honestly I feel like is the new standard
aside from being able to control the
lights from either the software or
included control you can also download
an app on either Android or iOS I have
no idea why anyone would want to use
this especially if they're away from
that
but I guess it's still nice to have so
Before we jump into this video I want to
give huge thanks to graphic stocks for
making this video possible graphic stock
of course has the largest unlimited
download library for graphics photos
vectors and images on the internet but
over 300,000 of them to choose from
whether you are creating a website for
your business a banner for your YouTube
channel or you are simply a content
creator and you can definitely take
advantage of what they have to offer
right now you can sign up for a 7-day
free trial which also gives you access
to 140 pieces of content for free and
you can also sign up for their annual
plan which is only $99 for the entire
year guys most websites charge as much
as $30 per image which is ridiculous but
with graphics talk you get unlimited
downloads with your membership also
everything comes with a hundred percent
royalty free agreement which means that
you won't have to deal with copyright
claims seriously guys this is an awesome
deal and it's only available to my
subscribers so make sure you guys visit
gr√•vik's dot-com slash YouTube or click
on the link down below so we got the
standard set up inside the case but you
do have the option of mounting the
motherboard in four different
orientations you got the standard 90
degrees inverted or even 90 degrees
inverted that's definitely nice of
origin PC to include this option in case
some people want their PC is located on
the left side of their desk one of my
favorite parts of this case is the 5
hot-swap Bay located behind the front
door you definitely can appreciate this
if you're a content creator like me and
use ridiculous amounts of drives I
didn't mention previously that aside
from the hard drive and SSD in here I
also got an M that to drive which I'm
sure lotta guys know offers some insane
transfer speeds I was also surprised by
the lack of software that comes
pre-installed in these which is awesome
by the way all you get aside from the
RGB software is a subsonic suite and the
EVGA precision X software which I would
have installed anyways I personally hate
it when a bunch of pcs come with a
necessary software and a bunch of bloat
where would you end up uninstalling
anyway so I'm gonna give a huge props to
origin PC for knowing their market very
well so I believe the magenta serves as
my main computer for the past two weeks
now and it's been handling everything I
throw at it and let me remind you guys
that I'm a very heavy user so with that
said let's get into the benchmarks
this is one of the few machines that
I've tested that can run Metro last
light at 4k resolution with an average
above 60 fps and that speaks for itself
I mean let's be real to 1080 s is a bit
overkill and it will practically handle
anything you throw at it in 4k
resolution but what about people who
need a computer for work like editing
videos well for the editing portion of
the test I put a single 4k video on my
timeline in premiere and it was rendered
in h.264 with max deft and render
quality selected also include the
original clip used down below so you
guys can compare these numbers to your
machines if you guys want to see the
differences as expected with the
horrendous optimizations done by Adobe
Premiere it pretty much runs about the
same when compared to another machine
with dual 10 70s it's a shame that
Premiere and other editing programs
can't take advantage of the full power
of this machine the 6700 K does just
fine but if you need more juice for
multi-threaded applications I would
obviously go for more cores thankfully
origin PC has options to upgrade the CPU
to even a 69 50 X which is a 10 core
processor the chassis has no sound
dampening materials views and because of
this the PC gets loud during full load
in fact here they listen
so what are the advantages of buying
from origin PC versus another company or
completely building your very own custom
PC
well besides getting the exclusive case
only available from origin PC you also
get access to the different warranties
the basic warranty that comes with all
their PCs includes a lifetime of 24/7
us-based tech phone support you get also
lifetime free labor and a one-year part
replacement the lifetime free labor
covers any upgrades you want to make to
the PC in the near future
let's say for example three years down
the line you want to upgrade your
motherboard or CPU or really go with a
completely different chipset then all
you have to do is send your PC to them
and they'll go and do the work for you
just for the cost of the parts you can
also extend the one-year warranty to
three years and with this you get access
to their evolved program for just $50
this allows you to return your computer
components for credit equal to the
current market value and that goes
towards the new part then they would of
course install the parts do the rigorous
stress test and it will send the PC back
to you without charging any labor if you
don't mind spending the extra money you
really do get some great services
included with your purchase the PC world
is definitely a scary place I've had my
fair share of problems you might build a
custom PC yourself and it runs fine but
after a few months down the line it
starts breaking down
there's only had those experiences
myself
so what origin PC is offering over here
is peace of mind and I feel like you
can't really put a price tag on that but
that will do it for my review of the
