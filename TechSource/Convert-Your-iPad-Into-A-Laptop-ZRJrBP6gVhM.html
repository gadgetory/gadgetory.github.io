multiple times a day with variety of
tech products so if you guys live in the
US UK and Canada and want to save money
on your next purchase consider
bookmarking dual source tech and
checking back at least once a day
so guys I've been taking my Surface
three tablet with me wherever I go
and although it's an awesome two-in-one
tablet the battery life just isn't that
great it's nothing compared to the iPad
which lasts me several days of light use
the only problem was that I hated typing
using a touchscreen keyboard on the iPad
which is why I kept to my surface 3 well
all of that changes today I was looking
around on Amazon for a solid keyboard
accessory for my new iPad pro that I
recently bought and I came across the IE
grille case which is the number one new
release product currently on Amazon it
does come in three different colors and
goes for around 55 bucks and they do
have versions available for most iPad
models but I'll drop a link down below
if you guys want to check it out now
although there are a few things I don't
like about this case it's actually
currently one of the best ones out there
starting with the build quality the
entire case is built out of aluminum and
it doesn't look like they cut any
corners here the hinge is also
constructed very well and it's able to
hold up the tablet at any angle without
any problems the cutouts are also very
precise for the power button lightning
port volume controls and even speakers
surprisingly the case doesn't affect the
sound quality at all and here's a quick
sample with and without the case on all
right let's dive right in and see what
makes this the perfect desk setup
starting with the MVP and the PC does
pairing this entire set up gala Dex the
$6,000 ultimate gaming and productivity
PC that I built for July I did do a
video on this and I strongly recommend
you guys to check it out when the only
problem I came across with the ports was
charging it will work with some
third-party charging dogs but
unfortunately it won't work with others
in order for it to work the Lightning
tip on the charging dock has to be long
enough in order for it to be fully
seated inside the tablet now let's talk
about the keyboard in short is very
comfortable to type on with great
feedback I also don't experience any lag
or stutter from my time of use the
battery life is also very impressive I
haven't charged it out of the box and
it's lasted me two days so far with
plenty of juice left in fact this case
will last you 150 hours after a full
charge I was also surprised to find out
that the keyboard had seven different
LED backlit colors with three brightness
options to choose from one negative
thing I found while typing was the right
shift key it's a bit too small for my
taste and far from my reach
I wish the page up and the Shift key
buttons were switched together because
then it would have been much more
comfortable reaching another negative
thing about the case is that it does not
have any rubber feet on the bottom so
typing on flat surfaces will cause the
entire tablet to move which is pretty
annoying it's especially noticeable on
slippery surfaces one of the things I
really love about the keyboard is all of
the shortcuts near the top that make
things very convenient and I'll go over
a few of them
the first key simply takes you straight
to the home screen and you can press it
while you're in an app or press it to
turn the tablet on if it's locked on the
opposite side is the lock button
pressing it once will lock the iPad
regardless of what you are doing the
second and third buttons control the
brightness on the screen and the fourth
button brings up a touchpad keyboard on
the screen if you don't want to use the
attached keyboard hitting the magnifying
button will bring up the search bar
which I find very useful and then the
next two buttons are copy and paste and
then you have your media controls off to
the right side I wish there was a
dedicated button for swapping between
background apps but using the command +
tab buttons work just fine
so in conclusion
you guys have been wanting to convert
your iPad into a portable laptop then
this product is definitely worth
checking out I highly recommend it
I'll drop a link to it down below as
always dropping in like helps me out a
ton guys thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
