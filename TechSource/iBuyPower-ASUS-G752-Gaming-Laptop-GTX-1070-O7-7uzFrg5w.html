source and in this video we're going to
be taking a look at the Asus g7 5 2
gaming laptop from iBUYPOWER
now for the purpose of this video I'm
going to be referring to the laptop as
the g7 with a gtx 1070 desktop graphics
card coupled with an intel i7 CPU the g7
looks to be a promising desktop
replacement but will its performance
match its specs and a hefty price tag of
$2,500 let's start off with the design
and in a way it accentuates the
performance to be found inside and no
matter which angle you're looking at the
g7 from you won't find any bland
designing with its aluminum top copper
themed polycarbonate accents and red
exhaust this thing's going to stand out
and stand out it does with its massive
footprints you're definitely going to
need a large desk to use this one around
the device we get individual audio jacks
a Thunderbolt 3 display port for USB 3s
an Ethernet port and of course an SD
card slot the screen hinge is
well-constructed and there's very little
flex in the display itself however I do
wish that Asus repositioned the speakers
when you're opening up the laptop the
display gets in the way and muffles the
audio a bit and they're not the best
sounding speakers either the sound is
pretty dull and you'll have a much
better experience with some headphones
on here's a quick sample
both the keyboard and trackpad are
decent travel on the keys are good and
you also get macro keys that you can
program the backlighting is red which
I'm fine with but I do wish at this
price they would have implemented RGB
lighting the trackpad has smooth
tracking it is very responsive with
quality buttons so no complaints here
the display has a resolution of 1080p
and a refresh rate of 75 Hertz but
honestly that's a bit of a letdown
considering just how much power is
inside here I would have loved to see a
quad HD display I mean after all there
is a gtx 1070 in here and that is plenty
of power to push those pixels besides
that it does have accurate colors and
great contrast and viewing angles it
also has a matte coating so glare is not
a problem
alright so with all that spec talk out
of the way let's go ahead and take a
look at the gaming benchmarks
they weren't lying when they set desktop
great performance out of these new
Pascal GPUs and this translated into
editing as well in fact this whole video
was edited in Premiere on the g7 and I
had no hiccups of any kind
it's definitely earned its place in my
travel bagg for conventions like CES as
I don't have to lug around a desk top to
get the work done in fact I'll be taking
this to CES 2017 to get some editing
done removing the screw and pulling the
tab on the back gets you through to the
internals through here you get access to
the RAM and dot two connectors as well
as the hard drive as you can see I have
room here to upgrade both my m2 storage
and RAM in the near future if I want to
at full load the fans do get loud and
make the already subpar speakers sound
worse so obviously you're gonna need
some headphones with this then again I
don't know anybody including myself that
don't use headphones with laptops
anyways the good news is thanks to its
cooling technology the computer doesn't
get throttled at all giving a smooth
gaming experience even after hours of
play but the bad news is even with
lights tasks you're going to only get
about three hours of use and this is
what pascal's improved battery
efficiency it is a gaming laptop after
all and believe me these are not known
for excellent battery performance so to
sum things up I definitely wouldn't
classify this as a mobile solution as
carrying it around proved to be a burden
but a desktop replacement seems to be
more fitting if you're planning on
picking this up I would recommend a
solid gaming mouse as well as some
headphones to get the best experience
possible I'll jump a link to this gaming
laptop down below in case you guys are
interested I want to give you huge
things to iBUYPOWER for setting this out
for review and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
