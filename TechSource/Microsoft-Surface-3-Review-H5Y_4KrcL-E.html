and in this video we're gonna take a
look at the new surface 3 from Microsoft
this is the ten point eight inch 64
gigabyte version with two gigs of RAM
that starts at $400 but you do have
three other options to choose from that
include 4G LTE and double the RAM and
hard drive space the surface 3 is
basically the little brother of the
surface pro 3 which has better specs and
a larger 12 inch screen I actually did a
review on the i7 surface pro 3 on my
channel and if you guys want to check
that out I will leave a link below
but anyway sliding the cover aside you
will see that the surface 3 is laying
there and right below that you can find
the QuickStart guide and warranty
information on the right side is where
the charging cable is located and they
went with a standard micro USB
connection this time around instead of
the usual magnetic connection so all I'm
unboxing stuff I might as well go ahead
and unbox the type cover as well it does
come in a variety of colors and will
cost you an extra $130 the keys are
mechanical and the cover is made out of
this soft plush material that doubles as
protection when you close it
buy more on the keyboard later so the
amount of positions have been limited to
only 3 angles from the surface pro 3 but
that should still be in more than enough
for a lot of people for a comfortable
viewing experience the surface 3 also
comes with Windows 8.1 with a free
upgrade to Windows 10 as well as a year
of Microsoft Office 365 for free
on the front of the surface 3 you get a
3.5 megapixel front facing camera
capable of shooting in 1080p and an 8
megapixel rear facing camera also
capable of shooting in 1080p here are a
few samples of the rear facing camera
that I took a few days ago and I'm
actually pretty impressed with the
quality it has great color reproduction
a nicely balanced exposure and a decent
dynamic range the video on the other
hand isn't so great focusing takes a
while and footage is just not as sharp
enough then again it is a tablet camera
also on the front of the surface 3 are
where these stereo speakers are located
one on each side of the device they do
feature Dolby audio which is supposed to
enhance the overall sound quality and
give you a clearer and somewhat Emer
of experience compared to the standard
stereo speakers on the top is where the
power button and volume controls are
located and on the right side is where
the rest of the ports are starting from
the top you have the mini display USB
3.0 micro USB for charging and the audio
input also hidden under the kickstand is
the micro SD card reader which you can
use to expand up to 128 gigabytes of
additional space all the way on the
bottom of the surface 3 is the magnetic
strip where you will be able to connect
the top cover to installing it has never
been easier just simply bring the
surface pro over it and it will snap in
place and you are ready to go you can
either have the keyboard lying flat or
fold it so it's at an angle depending on
how your preference is the keys are also
illuminated which is awesome for night
use and they do slowly fade away in 10
seconds if you don't use the keyboard as
I mentioned before the keys are
mechanical and are very easy to type on
and it's very responsive with no lag I'm
personally not used to typing on flat
keyboards like these so it will take
some getting used to especially if
you're coming from a full-size
mechanical keyboard if you're coming
from another laptop however you
shouldn't have any problems learning
quickly if you are used to on screen
typing then you would be pleased to find
that the surface 3 has a really great
touch keyboard the keys are nice and big
and you have a few options for the
layout one of which splits the keyboard
in half making it much easier to type on
if you're forced to hold the surface 3
with both hands however reaching the
numbers in the middle will take some
getting used to you can also adjust the
size of the keys to whatever works for
you and you can also change the layout
to a traditional writing style which is
a lot easier if you purchase the
optional stylus pen although I'm not
really sure who would use this feature
since writing a sentence will take a lot
more time but regardless the option is
there if you want to use it the trackpad
is also very responsive and easy to
press it is separated into two sides if
you click on the lower right it acts as
a right click and on the left side as a
left click alternatively you can tap the
trackpad with both of your fingers
gently to act as a right click as well
under the hood the surface 3 packs a
quad-core Intel Atom CPU clocked at 1.6
gigahertz with 2 gigabytes of RAM and an
Intel HD graphics GPU it's also supposed
to last up to 10 hours of video playback
so it will get you
days of use if you do other things on it
like browsing the web or typing up Word
documents it also sports a 10-point two
inch LCD screen with a resolution of
1920 by 1080 which will give you a 214
pixels per inch count it does have a
glossy display making it super
reflective as you can probably tell in
the video but because of that coating
you get more vivid color and contrast
and also deeper blacks compared to a
traditional matte coating these types of
displays are basically unusable outdoors
because of the reflection of the Sun
which is why I'm actually surprised how
visible the display is outside it's
still very reflective that much is true
however it's still a lot better than
other glossy screens that I've used
outside the surface 3 is actually doable
in sunlight performance wise this is a
very snappy tablet not once has it
started or even lagged I'm just really
impressed at how smooth everything runs
for a multitasking to swapping between
applications and even using the dual
window mode I was able to get a smooth
enjoyable experience gaming on the
surface 3 is also very smooth I
downloaded and played several games one
of which was faster than Furious 6 and I
was very pleased with the performance if
you like to game on your laptop or
tablet then you won't be disappointed by
switching to the surface 3 if you enjoy
watching videos in 1080p you can do just
that with the surface 3 also actually
you can even watch up to 2k videos
without any lag however a bobbing all
the way to 4k resolution is where you
run into problems if you're looking for
an alternative to the MacBook or
essentially any expensive laptop or
tablet then you should honestly give the
surface 3 a try it is priced
exceptionally well for what it offers
and you get the best of both worlds a
compact snappy laptop or a beautiful
touchscreen tablet this is something I'm
definitely going to keep any of you guys
are interested in checking one out I
will leave links for pricing and
availability down below anyways that's
it for the video I hope you guys enjoyed
it if you did please leave a like as it
does help me out a lot and if you didn't
feel free to dislike and make sure you
guys are subscribed to the channel for
more content like this this is that from
tech stores I will see you guys in the
next video
