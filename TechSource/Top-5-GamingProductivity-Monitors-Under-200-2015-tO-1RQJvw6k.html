Texas and welcome to another top-five
tag video if you guys remember a few
months back I did a top-five gaming
monitors under 150 bucks and if you guys
somehow missed that video I'll drop a
link to it down below or guys can click
on the card up there but this time
around I decided to raise the cap to 200
bucks and go over the best gaming and
productivity monitors that you can
currently buy so with that said let's
begin so all the monitors I mentioned in
this video will be linked down below in
the order that you see them so it's
easier for you guys to find them
starting off with number one is the BenQ
24 inch LED monitor with a 1ms response
time and a 75 Hertz refresh rate I'm
gonna go on record now and say that this
is the most affordable gaming monitor
that you can currently buy that's under
200 bucks this has a TN panel and also
features a VESA mount and built-in
speakers it doesn't have any height
adjustability but you can tilt it for
better viewing angles for ports we have
one DVI VGA and two HDMI along with your
usual 3.5 millimeter audio jacks
number two we have a wide monitor for
those who prefer single display setups
not quite in the realm of ultra wide but
wide enough this is a 25 inch LED
monitor from LG that has a 5 ms response
time and a 60 Hertz refresh rate not
quite hard core for gamers but if you
are not playing competitively and want
an awesome affordable monitor for
productivity and the 25 um 57 should be
on your list to check out it has a 2560
by 1080p IPS display with srgb over 99%
to give you the most accurate colors the
monitor also comes with a VESA mount
option and two HDMI and a single
DisplayPort next up is the 24 inch
monitor by Ben Q this monitor has a 2 ms
response time with a 60 Hertz refresh
rate TN panel you can't adjust the
height but you can tilt the monitor and
it features a VESA mount option in the
back along with one HDMI IN one DVI port
this is the most affordable display on
the list and the closest you will find
to
Gaming monitor and number four we have
yet another Bank you monitor they are
killing it in the budget gaming
department
this one is a 21.5 inch LED monitor with
a TN panel as well
it features 1ms response time and a
sixty to seventy five Hertz refresh rate
depending on your graphics settings if
you hook up your console to this monitor
you will only get sixty Hertz which is
plenty just like most monitors on this
list you can't adjust the height only
the tilt angle four ports you get one
HDMI one DVI and a single VGA port but
unfortunately it doesn't come with a
VESA mount option so you're forced to
use the stand I also don't like the ugly
looking yellow frame I don't know what
binky was thinking going with this
design choice but if you have a black
and yellow set up then I suppose this
would fit right in
next up is the Acer 27 inch IPS monitor
with super thin bezels this one is more
for productivity due to the IPS panel
instead of TN it also has a 5 ms
response time with a 60 Hertz refresh
rate so not really aimed at gaming per
se the water does come with built-in
speakers which are said to be pretty bad
and it's not very compatible as well if
you choose a VGA DVI and a single HDMI
port but what makes this monitor awesome
is the super thin bezels and IPS display
which will give you the best viewing
angles and bolder more vivid colors so
if you're planning on going with a multi
monitor productivity setup you should
definitely give this a try
I do have two more bonus gaming
modernness to go over and this is for
anyone with a slightly larger budget at
number 6 we have the asus 24-inch TN
display monitor with a 1ms response time
and a 144 Hertz were fresh rate this is
it guys if you want the best specs for a
gaming monitor you can't get better than
this unless you want a higher resolution
the monitor has built-in speakers as
VESA compatible and comes with a DVI
HDMI and DisplayPort the monitors height
can also be adjusted and you can even
rotate the entire display in vertical
mode if you like that sort of setup last
but not least we have the big daddy of
all gaming monitors if a 24 inch display
is too small for you then this is the
next step up this is the 27-inch BenQ
monitor with a 1ms response time and 144
Hertz were fresh rate it features a TN
panel and you can adjust
we hide and pivot the display into a
vertical mode just like the previous
asus model and you can also swivel the
display 45 degrees to the left or right
this monitor is also basic compatible
and features two HDMI ports one DVI one
VGA and one DisplayPort and a few USB
ports so here's a quick recap of the
monitors I went over if you guys need
help on deciding which one to go with
feel free to pause the video if you need
more time
so those are my top picks for the best
gaming and productivity matters under
200 bucks if you guys enjoy these types
