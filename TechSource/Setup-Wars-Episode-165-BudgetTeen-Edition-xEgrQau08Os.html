edition of setup Juarez will have an
actual budget let's say around $1,500
which isn't too much considering it
includes the price of the PC as well
this way there isn't any arguments in
the description section and everyone is
on the same page of what budget actually
means but yeah what that said ladies
gentlemen welcome to set of pours
episode 165 budget Edition where you
submit your desk setup if you guys want
to put this up 8 make sure watch the
video link down below oh yeah with that
said let the setup war is begin huge
thanks to dashlane for sponsoring
today's video - Lane is the password
manager that keeps track of all your
passwords in one place I have over a
hundred different accounts that I use
and - Lane removes the stress of having
to remember the passwords of each one of
them i used to use other password
manager services before but I like using
- Lane more because there's a lot more
user friendly and I like the password
generator feature I'm able to seamlessly
autofill all of my credentials safely as
well as valuable information making
shopping so much easier online and just
my subscribers you can get - Lane
premium free for 30 days by using my
link below and if you end up keeping it
make sure to use my code tech source to
get 10% off kicking off the episode is a
15 year old from London and his setup
for video editing and gaming he did
manage to fit to 24 inches monitors
under his budget alongside a cooler
master master keys light keyboard and
mouse combo
it looks like the desk is from ikea and
it's the popular car bleak countertop
being supported by - alex yours for
audio he's using a pair of logitech z3
33 speakers and that's pretty much it
for the surface I do like that he tied
the cables together using some velcro
although I'm kind of concerned about the
amount of slack he has left for his
mouse the cables are managed well
underneath the desk using cable clips
and a few cable sleeves to hide the
wires not a bad job I also see that he
hooked up an SD card reader and a USB
hub for easy access the pc powering the
setup is located on the ground
unfortunately and it's got the Rison 7
1708 core processor we got 16 gigs of
ram and the asus strix 1050 Ti there's
definitely some bottlenecking with this
configuration but I simply
GPU upgrade later on can fix that so
it's not a big deal
I just wish the PC wasn't on the ground
because it's such a clean build I feel
like if he pushed everything slightly to
the left you would have plenty of space
on the right for the PC it's interesting
to see that he would rather have his
setup centered than having the PC on the
desk in total this setup cost been a
little over $1,500 but excellent we're
keeping everything clean and organized
up next is Brandon from Indiana and a
super clean setup that he uses for
gaming and video editing so this setup
actually has a lot of small
modifications done to it which I'll go
over in a bit but let's take a quick
look at his gear so he's got a 23 inch
Acer monitor and below that we got the
cursor strafe read the keyboard and the
logitech g502 proteus spectrum mouse
it's obvious at this point that is going
with a black and red color scheme so
this is pretty cool check this out the
monitor riser is made out of Legos and
he left some space in the middle to
route the keyboard and mouse wire
through very very clever so if you guys
are on a budget as well consider using
Legos to build some parts of your setup
like Brandon did radhiya was using the
Dell a 2 to 5 USB powered speakers and
the HyperX cloud 2 gaming headset the
speakers are painted or I guess in his
case colored using a red sharpie and the
hanger for the headset as some
miscellaneous part from his dad's work
that he had an abusing to hold his head
set the custom pcs God is a little
outdated with the FX 6300 12 gigs of ram
and the msi gtx 1050 Ti but I loved what
he did with the desk he actually made a
cutout in the back not only for the pc
to help exhaust the hot air but also for
the rest of the cables doing this he
actually avoided drilling holes in his
desk for cable management while keeping
a very clean appearance from the front
it's quite genius actually he hooked up
the power strip on the back board and
tied all the cables together job well
done
he even went as far as to sharpie some
parts of his PC including the white
parts on the GPU the white gigabyte logo
on the motherboard and the stickers on
the PSU to keep the black and red a
theme consistent you know what Brandon
I'm really impressed with your setup you
did such a great job with all the mods
and you made this setup work with what
you got and I want to help you out so
you're watching this video I want to
give you $100 in cash and I know it's
not a lot but maybe it can go towards
your next upgrade for your setup so if
you're watching this video toss me an
email at setup words at gmail to claim
your prize congratulations maybe I
should call this episode the teenager
edition at number three we have jake
from the UK and another super clean
black and red themed set up for gaming
school work and sometimes editing we got
a 22 inch monitor the courser k55 RGB
keyboard and the her LEF 300 which i
recommended in my roundup of the best
gaming mice under $20 great choices on
the gear and also a great job tying the
cables together I love seeing that it
really does clean up the surface of the
desk sticking with his budget he went
with the G 9000 gaming headset and a
toner microphone hooked up to the newer
boom arm he's also able to keep his PC
on the desk although it's a little
outdated he is planning on upgrading in
the near future however I do recommend
moving your GPU to the top x16 slot we
do get the chance just to make sure
you're getting the most performance
possible ok linesman he did attach the
power strip underneath his desk using
some 3m tape and he held up the cables
using a cable clip so I don't have any
complaints here there's actually been
quite the improvement over his last
setup
he waited 7 months until his birthday to
buy his PC parts and then he had to wait
for Christmas to order the rest of the
gear for his setup a very nice upgrade
for a very clean setup Thank You Jake
for entering and number four is another
budget setup at this time we got an
ultra-wide this is Julian from Germany
and his setup for productivity he's
walking a 34 inch ultra wide from LG and
wireless peripherals
we got the anchor wireless keyboard and
the MX master 2 s Mouse it's a very
simple setup not much to it really we
got some bose companion 2 speakers and a
pair of JBL charged headphones and since
Macs are expensive julian built a custom
PC with an i5 6500 and a gtx 750ti I'm
concerned the PC would interfere with
legroom so I would recommend maybe
placing it sideways to give you some
extra space we do have a Signum holding
up all the cables and a channel raceway
to route the PC wires like I said a very
simple yet productive setup from Julian
thank you for entering wrapping up the
episode is a laptop setup from dn and
purpose of this is for schoolwork photo
editing and light gaming we do have a
Lenovo IdeaPad 520 with an i7
8550 you a BIG's of RAM and the MX 154
gigabyte graphics card which is playable
in low or medium settings what I like
about the setup is that he installed a
wall shelf so that the laptop is eye
level also giving him extra space to
keep some of his stuff up here it also
looks like he's sticking with MSI we
have the Interceptor keyboard and the
mouse and even an msi headset that's
hanging underneath the desk he did cut
some space behind the wall shelf
throughout the cables down and he
installed a USB hub so that he can
connect this keyboard and mouse and the
rest of the wires are grouped up nicely
and routed through a channel raceway I
do love the extra effort he put into
this setup you can really tell he cares
about it it's simple but it works thank
you Dan for entering and now does the
first episode of setup wars if you guys
enjoyed it please feel free to drop a
like it does help out the channel a ton
and make sure you guys vote in the
comment section and who has the best
budget setup thanks again so much for
watching as always I will see your
beautiful faces in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
