along with anything I recommend in this
episode so with that said here are your
5 lucky contestants awesome dude
Brad Falco Jake and Jason
congratulations for making it to setup
wars episode 27 first up we have a 13
year old person that goes by the name of
awesome dude I'm not really sure why you
didn't give me your name so we have to
Samsung 24 inch monitors logitech g502
speakers on top of the Alex drawer Adam
unit very nice to see that in setup wars
again on the desk we had Logitech MK 360
keyboard and mouse combo and a Razer
vascular mousepad
what is that sticker still doing on that
keyboard oh pretty good job with cable
management I noticed the IKEA Signum
rack underneath the table where you keep
all the cables on top of and I'll give
you a point for the zip ties but yeah
you're pretty simple and straightforward
setup I love the symmetry and how clean
the overall desk looks job well done
awesome dude and thank you for entering
Brad Pitt is next up with our second
dual display setup to Asus 24 inch
monitor is an apple wireless keyboard
and Magic Mouse with a pair of sony MDR
headphones hidden in the drawer
underneath we also have an iPad 3 under
the monitors cable management is pretty
good I noticed that you use some velcro
strips to tie the wires against the
table but if you really want to hide
that ugly power strip you can pick up an
e box cable organizer and put your
entire power strip inside that way you
don't see any plugs I think this will
definitely clean up the overall look
underneath your desk oh let's not forget
about the LEDs which are practically
everywhere inside your room a little too
much for my taste but overall a very
simple and clean setup Thank You mr.
Pitts for entering captain Falco is next
up with an all-white setup we have two
dell 27 inch ultra slim bezel monitors
god damn you know how i feel about those
thin bezels
no but seriously sexy monitor choice and
I love how you mounted them on the wall
we also have another Apple wireless
keyboard and Magic Trackpad combo and a
pair of Logitech Z 333 speakers which
are spray-painted and white to match the
theme job well done
to the right we have a MacBook Pro duct
inside the hinge dock station and a USB
3.0 hub mounted in the center of your
custom-made monitor riser so basically
he picked up a large thin table and used
the IKEA capita legs to secure them on
top of the desk it seems like you really
put in a lot of thought into your setup
and it turned out beautiful cable
management is pretty good once again we
have the IKEA Signum rack holding all
the wires but as long as they're off the
ground it works for me under the side of
the room you have a 60-inch Sony TV with
a ps4 and ps3 console underneath came so
any baby
honestly I'd love to recommend
everything is symmetrical organized and
you have yourself a very clean and
gorgeous setup thank you for entering
setup words Jake Gyllenhaal is next up
with somewhat of a black and red setup
we have two asus 23 inch monitors a
razer Deathstalker keyboard and a Death
Adder mouse on a courser extended
mousepad we also have a pair of ath m50x
headphones on top of the Thermaltake
headphone anger and a pair of Logitech
z4 speakers we also have a road NT mic
hooked up with a boom arm for recording
audio excellent work with cable
management I see that you have a cable
tube against the wall to wrap your wires
through and it goes all the way up
against your wall to the power outlet
which brings me to a question why the
hell is there a power outlet up there in
the first place some countries are just
weird
pretty dope EC as well we have a 4790k
and a GTX 970 inside the NZXT phantom
looking case the setup seems a bit
cramped mainly due to that huge PC case
of yours I also feel like the red case
throws off the color balance of your
setup I mean we have some greens some
silver and the rest of your setup is
black and then we have this giant red
case next to it by judging from that
extra space near your mouse I'd say you
have plenty of room to work with it's a
little cramped but it works nonetheless
Thank You Jake for entering last but not
least we have Jason and his gaming room
setup so on the main desk we have three
Acer 23 inch monitors which are
mounted a Razer BlackWidow chroma
keyboard and naga chroma mouse on top of
the cursor extended mousepad which I
will never get tired of seeing we also
have some recording equipment a blue
snowball mic off to the side and audio
technica 2035 mic on a boom arm and an M
audio mix amp underneath in front of the
bed we have a 50 inch Samsung Smart TV
with a ps4 Xbox one and another 32 inch
Smart TV near the setup do you really
need all those displays cables are not
visible so I can't really complain or
recommend things but overall you've a
really cool gaming room thank you Jason
