am here to give you my review of
Corsairs void surround gaming headset so
I've been using this the past week or so
playing the new Tom Clancy's division
game and here's what I have to say about
this all right so the void surround
gaming headsets are available in
wireless USB analog stereo and hybrid
stereo however the gaming headset I'm
reviewing in this video features a Dolby
7.1 USB adapter and universal
compatibility that's right guys this
headset doesn't just work on PCs it's
compatible with smartphones tablets ps4
and even Xbox one given that you have
this stereo adapter for it let's start
with the price this headset will cost
you around 80 bucks MSRP but you can
pick them up for a few bucks cheaper on
Amazon which I'll have linked below the
construction is made out of plastic
which helps keep the weight and cost
down and the cushions have this
breathable cloth material which helps
keep my ears nice and cozy a little too
cozy if you ask me my ears did get
pretty warm with these on for about an
hour which honestly I don't think I'll
be able to wear these in summer here in
California which gets over triple digits
as far as comfort level I gotta say
these are pretty damn good
I played the division for a good three
hours and my ears did not feel fatigued
at all the advanced with a good amount
of padding and the ear cups are large
enough to fit around my ear for a really
nice snug fit now because they are made
out of plastic it felt like I can easily
break the headset but to my surprise
these are actually pretty sturdy and
flexible for the most part you get
aluminum sliders which extend quite a
bit and the ear cups swivel about 90
degrees to get you that perfect fit the
ear cups have this matte red finish that
surrounds a glossy black surface with a
courser logo needless to say I was
immediately attracted to the color
scheme on the left ear cup you will find
a mute button and right behind the
earpiece is a volume wheel which is
actually pretty convenient to reach
during gaming the answer also comes with
a built-in mic which can be adjusted
from top to bottom and bending the mic
allows you to shape it into any desired
angle you prefer as far as sound quality
is concerned well you can be the judge
all right so this is the microphone test
I'm wearing the Corsair void surround
gaming headset and I'm talking directly
inside the microphone and this is
without editing
so yeah I definitely wouldn't recommend
doing voice-overs with this thing if
it's just for gaming it will get the job
done now let's talk about the sound is
this whole surround sound thing a
gimmick well no it's not I can
definitely hear the difference coming
from regular headphones like my m50x is
for example the sound is more immersive
and the best way I can explain this is
that I can hear explosions and gunshots
behind me that actually come from behind
me with the voice around I can pinpoint
where the action is happening and that
goes for vocals explosions footsteps and
other sounds as well it's pretty cool it
kind of gives the game a 3d feel combine
that with an ultra wide monitor and you
truly get a fully immersive experience
using the voice to listen to music has
also been really positive for me the
lows are definitely in the deep end you
get a really nice base the mids are
well-defined however I did find the
highs to be lacking in clarity using my
own 50 X's I can clearly hear background
music in my youtube videos but switching
to these the background music becomes
very faint and quiet that's something I
definitely wanted to mention you also
get no noise isolation even though these
have a closed back design it honestly
feels like open-back headphones I can
hear all the ambient noises around
especially when I'm typing on my
mechanical keyboard I mean don't get me
wrong this isn't a bad thing it just
depends on personal preference I'm
pretty sure the cloth ear cup material
is the reason why you don't get a nice
tight seal finally the last thing I want
to talk about is the Corsair utility
engine which is a program that allows
you to adjust the mic levels and create
up to five EQ profiles to get the sound
you desire or you can just simply select
from a pre-configured list you can use
this software to make the bass deeper or
get those crystal-clear hives you're
basically in control all I can say is I
definitely had lots of fun messing
around with this to get the sound I was
going for so in conclusion I think for
its price this is a solid gaming headset
other than having a pretty crappy mic
flimsy build and no noise isolation
which is a personal preference this is
something I would pay 80 bucks for if it
were to go anything above 100 I would
say no the Dolby 7.1 surround sound
really makes my game play much more
enjoyable and the comfort level is as
good as my HyperX
cloud two's yeah it's that comfortable
so that pretty much wraps the review
I'll drop links below if anyone's
interested in checking these out if you
guys enjoy the video and want to see
more reviews on the channel make sure to
leave a like as it does help me out a
ton then you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
