and I am back today to look at the newly
released Galaxy s5 we got ourselves the
white model here as you can tell from
the coloring at the center of the box
taking a look at the back here we can
see that Samsung has highlighted some of
the s5s features and specs the phone
does come walking a 1080p display which
is being powered by a 2.5 gigahertz
quad-core processor the box is almost
identical to that of recent Samsung
products in both design and the way soy
based ink was used for the printing
however the addition of the number 5 is
new lifting up the first half of the box
we see that the s5 is the first thing
presented setting the phone aside we can
get back into the contents of the box we
get a sim card from t-mobile and right
below this flap like the rest of the
contents we get the usual bundled
paperwork from Samsung which most likely
contains warranty information and other
stuff but we're too excited to give to
apples under all that nonsense we get
some earbuds to compliment all ear sizes
which is nice to see and along with
those Samsung has included some of their
generic white earphones they're not bad
I've had some past experience with these
earbuds from other Samsung products and
I can definitely say that they are
usable we also get our standard power
brick in the packaging it's white it
charges not much else to say really
moving on we do get a USB 3.0 urging
wire which should provide for faster
data transfer and charging speeds of
course you can charge your phone without
the battery and so we can find that
twenty eight hundred million battery
right here on the bottom installation of
the battery shouldn't be something new
if you're coming from a Samsung device
stopping off the back will allow you to
install the battery and one thing to be
careful here is when snapping back on
the plastic cover make sure that there
aren't any gaps in between the phone and
cover as the phone will lose its ability
to be waterproof the new TouchWiz UI
does look a little better and more
conservative however there is still lack
present across the UI at times which can
take away from the experience although
Samsung seems to be trying to improve
its overall footprint on top of stock
Android they just haven't seemed to get
the job done right we will have a
separate video going through the s5s new
software which will enable us to give
you guys a closer look but so far my
initial impressions
from the new TouchWiz is good definitely
improvement but more on this later
taking a closer look at the phone we can
see that we've got our speaker and
sensors at the top of the phone and we
have our home button at the bottom which
now doubles as a fingerprint scanner on
both sides of the home button we've got
our recent apps and back capacitive
buttons and on the right side of the
phone we've got our sleep wake button
there is a plastic band here that runs
along the whole phone that's I guess
trying to look like metal but it really
just looks like plastic and it feels
like it too at the bottom of the device
we got our USB 3.0 port that is hidden
behind this plastic cover and this cover
is here to make sure your phone remains
waterproof one emerged some people might
find a slap annoying but I think it's a
worthy trade off at the left side we've
got our volume rocker and moving up
towards the top you've got a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack our IR blaster
and noise cancellation Mike taking a
look at the back we can see that Samsung
has ditched the fake leather design here
to go with something a little different
it still feels soft to the touch but
it's now riddled with dots all across
honestly doesn't look that bad I thought
it was gonna look at rochas when I was
watching the keynote but I'm happy that
I was wrong at the top we have our LED
flash as well as our heart rate sensor
which I could call a gimmick but I mean
it could be useful to someone like Bruce
Banner
right above that is our 16 megapixel
camera that is capable of shooting 4k as
well as what Samsung's claiming as one
of the fastest focusing phone cameras
which will be sure to test in an
upcoming video at the bottom left we
have our speakers which is sad to see I
mean come on has an HTC not proven that
there is a demand for front-facing
speakers they sound about average
nothing really to get excited about I
just wish Samsung and other
manufacturers would realize that their
so-called media consumption devices
should come with decent audio the
backplate has a rubber gasket which
allows for the components on the inside
to stay dry other than this it's still
the same bendable cover we have come to
know we can see what the rubber gasket
seals with to make the water tight bond
and the benefit of having a removable
back is that the user can have access to
their battery for an easy swap right
above the battery we do have a micro SD
card slot and our SIM slot and to the
left of the battery there are some pins
which can be utilized for wireless
charging when Samsung releases a
compatible backplate my honest first
impressions are it's more of the same it
does have an improved design to that of
the s4 and thus feel better in the hand
I've been using the new HTC One m8 for
the past few days and maybe i'm just
spoiled by the unibody metal design but
the s5 just feels supplier to me the s5
might win me over with its better camera
waterproof design and user replaceable
battery but i guess you guys will have
to wait and see i will use this phone as
my daily driver for a couple of days and
give it as fair run can it hold its own
against the other android kinds of 2014
we are definitely going to find out
until next time this is it with texas
