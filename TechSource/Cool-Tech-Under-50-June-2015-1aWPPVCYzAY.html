welcome to cool tech on their 50 bucks
where I basically scoured through Amazon
and find some really cool tech products
and share them with you guys now
actually done some in the past and it's
actually very popular series that you
guys enjoy watching and in case you
missed some of the episodes I'll go
ahead and link the playlist down below
in the description section
you'd be surprised in the kind of stuff
you guys see in these episodes so if you
guys have some time definitely go check
them out
but anyways with that said let's go
ahead and start the video all right so
the first three products on a list are
from kuch ear and first up we have a
portable water resistant power bank with
a 7500 million per hour battery capacity
its compact with aluminum plates for the
front and back wrapped in silicone it is
essentially a waterproof dustproof
and shockproof power bank made for the
outside it features two high speed USB
charging ports with different outputs
depending on the device you are charging
one port is used for smart phones
wireless headphones or smaller items
whereas the other port is used for
larger devices like tablets and you can
even charge both at the same time you
can also activate its built-in
flashlight by holding down the power
button and by pressing a button once it
will activate the LED which will then
display how much juice is left on the
power bank the next item from kuch ear
doesn't have one or two or three four
five six seven eight or even nine but 10
USB ports got-damn the first seven are
USB 3.0 ports whereas the last three i
specifically made for charging with two
one amp
outputs and a single 2.1 amp output for
larger devices like tablets so if you
are ever in need of 10 USB ports then
this product has your name written all
over it one side connects to your PC via
USB 3 and the other connects to the
power outlet this is a perfect
alternative to USB hubs and chargers in
one the next product which is my
personal favorite from all the products
mentioned in this video is this led desk
lamp with a touch sensitive control
panel this is from Kuchar as well and
it's no order
desk lamp it's the most flexible lamp
that I have ever seen and you can rotate
the entire lamp 180 degrees raise the
head up 240 degrees rotate the light
head 180 degrees and even tilt the
entire neck up to 40 degrees I mean this
thing is qualified for the Olympics but
that's not even my favorite part the
reason why I love this lamp so much is
the fact that I can control the light
all on this touch-sensitive panel it has
four different modes and a 60-minute
option which automatically turns off the
lamp after well 60 minutes this thing
even has a built-in USB port on the side
I mean how much more awesome can this
lab get you can also adjust the
brightness level by tapping the arrows
so this is in a pitch-black room with
maximum brightness and you can dim it
down four notches for the modes we have
reading studying relaxing and sleeping
which are all pre-configured already
inside the lamp the lamp is also
energy-saving it costs eighty percent
less energy than traditional
incandescent lamps but offering the same
level of brightness but yeah overall a
very solid LED lamp and it doesn't even
take up much space on my desk since I
can fold it when not in use next up on
the list is the aluminum bluetooth
selfie stick from Levin now once again
this is no ordinary selfie stick and you
will see soon enough what I'm talking
about
so the stick is super compact and you
can extend it up to 2.72 feet it's also
really durable and sturdy as you can see
it features a really simple locking
mechanism twisting it counterclockwise
will unlock it and once you extend it as
much as you want just simply twist the
pole clockwise to lock it in place the
phone mount can fit most smartphones
even ones with bulky cases since you can
stretch it out and the stick also comes
with this button which you can pair via
bluetooth to your smartphone and take
pictures remotely it also comes with a
strap that you can attach to the pole
for convenience now I'm not really a
selfie kind of guy but I did have fun
using a stick for other things
you
now if you're not into selfies then you
can turn this into a really nice tripod
for shooting videos just screw in the
included tripod accessory and you are
good to go now because you can extend
the neck piece up to two point seven two
feet you can really get some nice
footage of places you never could before
next up we have a multi angle stand for
tablets or smartphones from Ankur I
personally prefer the black one instead
of the silver and I do have a few of
these to hold my smartphones up and I
think it really adds an overall nice
look to this setup it can old tablets as
well and you can adjust the angle to any
degree you desire by pressing down the
button on the side another cool product
that can help you guys out with cable
management are these cable drops I
picked up from blue lounge I stuck them
behind the table and routed the microUSB
cables through them to clean up the
overall look of the desk when they are
not in use if you guys are wondering
where I got those awesome carbon fiber
skins then I'll leave it a link in the
description section on where you can
pick up some D brand skins for
yourselves I also use cable drops to
route cables underneath the desk for
this setup I attached the battery
charger for my gh4 underneath the desk
using 3m tape and routed the cable using
cable drops I'll also link the 3m tape I
use down below for those of you that are
interested next up we have a waterproof
case for the iPhone 6 plus and the
iPhone 6 from easy life rated ip68 this
case will keep your iPhone dry up to 6.6
feet underwater
so with this case you get a lanyard a
microfiber cloth and a headphone
extension cable along with the
installation guide the design of the
case is very similar to other waterproof
cases but a fraction of the price the
buttons are easy to press which is a
huge plus however the vibrate switch may
take some getting used to as it does
require a little more force to use the
port's I've just big enough for regional
accessories unfortunately they won't be
compatible with most third-party cables
however they did offer an extension
cable for the headphone jack
here's a quick waterproof test of the
case now I did submerge it for about
five minutes in cold water and as you
can see the phone is still on you can't
really use the phone under water which
is expected but once you pull it out you
shouldn't have any problems once you dry
the screen also here is a sound test for
those of you wondering how the speakers
sound with the case on and with
out little surprise for you son no no no
no oh you got it King yeah I am you're
not getting a Porsche let me tell you
sometime a driver don't pick the cars
hmm cause the driver some mystical bond
between man and machine
speaking of waterproof the last product
is waterproof earphones from jab ease it
comes in a bunch of colors and a full
charge will get you up to six hours of
music you have the charging port and
power button on one side of the
earphones and on the other you will find
the media controls along with a button
to accept and end calls the earphones do
have a built-in microphone so you can
make calls with it if you choose to
now the comfort level is a 7 out of 10
if I had to rate it since I'm not really
used to these types of earbuds it's not
as soft as I would have liked the sound
quality on the other hand is not bad at
all you get really crispy sound with
decent bass now I didn't go swimming in
a pool with these on but I did take a
shower with them and no water got into
my ears and I was able to enjoy the
music without any problems it also comes
in this neat little carrying case
anyways that's it for the video I will
leave links to the products I mentioned
in the video down below in the
description section if you guys enjoy
watching these types of videos and let
me know by leaving a like on the video
so I know to keep doing them I also done
some in the past like I said if you
somehow missed it then I'll leave a
playlist to those videos down below for
my other cool tech videos chances are
you guys will find something that you're
interested in so if you guys have a
chance that for me check them out but
anyways thanks again for watching this
is that from tech source I will see you
guys in the next video
