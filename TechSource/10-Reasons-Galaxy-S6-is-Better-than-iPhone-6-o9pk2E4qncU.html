One m9 that's sponsored by cell cashier
com they compare iPhone prices on the
internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iPhone what is up
you guys is that back again from Texas
and in this video I'm going to be giving
you ten solid reasons why the galaxy s6
is better than the iPhone 6 or 6 plus
I'm also going to be doing 10 reasons
why the iPhone 6 is better than a galaxy
s6 so make sure you guys stick around
for that video but with that said let's
go ahead and start the video alright so
the first reason is the charging speeds
samsung uses the same adaptive fast
charging technology they used on their
note 4 and you can get 4 hours of use in
just 10 minutes of charging against the
note 4 from 0 to 50% in just 30 minutes
on a 30 to 20 milliamp battery so it
would take much less time on the s6 is
25 50 milliamp battery I think that this
is definitely a really great feature and
since I'm talking about charging you can
also wirelessly charge your s6 as well
without plugging it in although it's not
as fast it's certainly a convenient
feature to have since I'm on the topic
of battery reason number two has to be
its battery performance according to
phone arena you get around 7 hours and
40 minutes of typical real life usage
compared to the iPhone 6 plus is 5 hours
and 22 minutes even though the galaxy s6
has a smaller battery you get much
better performance reason number 3 has
to do with its storage capacity I love
the fact that Samsung has made the base
model 32 gigabyte with optional 64 and
128 gigabyte models compared to the 16
64 and 128 gigs for the iPhone 6 and
6-plus Apple basically did this to force
people to pay more and upgrade to the 64
gigabyte version since 16 gigabytes
isn't enough for a lot of people so if
you go with the galaxy s6 you definitely
don't have to pay extra for the storage
size you desire reason number 4 is
because of its display you get a
beautiful 1440 by 2560 Super AMOLED
display compared to the iPhone 6 plus is
1080p you get to see higher resolution
content on your phone which enhances
your viewing experience the 577 pixel
per inch screen makes a huge difference
then the iPhone 6 plus is 401 pixel per
inch count so if you enjoy watching
videos in HD then you can definitely
appreciate this feature from the Galaxy
s6 the next reason is its specs no doubt
the galaxy s6 is a more powerful device
with its octa-core processor and 3 gigs
of ram and what that gets you is really
smooth user experience in my speed test
and benchmark test against the iPhone 6
plus the galaxy s6 dominated in
benchmark scores and it proved to be the
faster phone by opening up spacer and
multitasking much quicker if you want to
watch the full video I will link it in
the description section down below
gamers will also appreciate the power
behind the s6 so if you play graphic
intensive games like asphalt 8 then the
s6 will handle those with no problems
reason number 6 is because not only are
the speakers on the s6 much louder but
it has overall better quality audio the
microphone is also really loud and crisp
compared to the iPhone 6 plus and I did
demonstrate this in my camera comparison
video and I will leave a link to that
down below as well if you want to check
that out but it is a quick sample of the
speakers between both phones I saw
something that day something I'll not
forget
it stands 12 feet tall
with razor-sharp claws as I eat alleged
were the weapons of fallen warriors this
face a short sharp dad's leg was cleaner
oh that's my favorite part next reason
is because of the notification light I'm
not sure what's taking apples so long to
come up with some sort of a notification
feature on their iPhones but no matter
who you are you will always find these
very useful if you phone is locked there
is no way of knowing that you received a
message if you somehow miss the
vibration or ring so having a
notification light definitely helps a
lot
reason number eight is that the Galaxy
s6 has a better camera I have confirmed
this in my camera comparison and I will
give credit where credit is due
Samsung has finally outdone themselves
and made a smart phone that has an
amazing camera and I think that the
camera is a very important aspect in
deciding on a phone and if you're
looking for a smart phone that takes
stunning pictures and video then the
galaxy s6 would be a damn good choice
the 16 megapixel 1.9 aperture lens on
the s6 delivers beautiful sharp and
realistic images and it's 5 megapixel
front facing camera works wonders for
selfie lovers since I'm on the topic of
cameras I have to give reason number 9
to its 4k video capability I think this
alone deserves a separate reason because
the s6 takes phenomenal 4k video
something we have not seen yet from the
iPhone lineup last but not least the
10th and final reason why the galaxy s6
is better than the iPhone 6 is because
of its customized ability the options
are limitless
you can add themes widgets and change
the sizes of your icons you can even add
tweaks to your interface and perhaps one
of the best features on the s6 is the
multitasking feature where you can open
up two apps at the same time you
definitely don't see things like that on
the iPhone unless you jailbreak which as
time passes by you deal with bugs
crashes and incompatibility issues
anyways that is it for the video thank
