today we're going to be taking a look at
MSI's aigis gaming PC now I do have the
a STI at the headquarters as well so if
you guys are excited for that video be
sure to hit that like button but the
model I'm checking out today has a 6700
be 150 motherboard 16 gigs of ram rated
at 21 33 megahertz and an msi gtx 1070
for storage there is a single 256
gigabyte SSD and a 2 terabyte hard drive
that's just one of the many
configurations that come with the aigis
but there are more affordable options
available and I'll drop a link to them
down below if you guys want to check
them out aesthetically it's not a bad
looking PC I guess it depends on who you
ask but I think it looks pretty dope the
first thing I noticed is that the side
panel that shows up the GPU is on the
right side if you're looking at it
directly which means that the people who
keep their PCs on the right side of
their desk won't be able to see that
other than that there's not much else on
the left side other than a small cutout
with a red transparent window in the
front is where the CD tray is located
for those that still use CDs or DVDs and
below that on the right side is the
power button and the audio jacks for
both the headphone and microphone on the
opposite side you will find two USB 3.0
ports and one USB type-c additionally
the USB ports feature MSI's supercharger
2 which provides 10 times more power to
the USB devices compared to traditional
USB ports essentially this is similar to
quick charge 2.0 allowing certain
devices to charge at a faster rate the
power n is located near the bottom and
on the back of this unique-looking stand
and believe it or not it actually uses
only a 350 watt power supply one of the
things I really like about the design is
the handle up top which makes it
extremely easy to grab and carry around
the aigis does come with some pre-loaded
software which by the way can be
uninstalled if you don't end up using
any of them but the ones that I found
useful are the DVD burner gaming center
dragon eye and the now hemic audio
program the gaming center gives you
access to mystic light which lets you
change the LEDs in the front of the PC
unfortunately you can't set a single
static color and instead you can only
select
a pair of colors together you can
however give it some special effects
like the gradient which will cycle
through all the colors and the breathing
effect that slowly pulsates in and out
dragon eye is also pretty cool it
basically lets you watch movies or
stream while you are playing your
favorite games this is ideal for gamers
that only have one monitor and finally
the nahee make audio enhanced program
essentially gives you a ton of options
to modify the sound that goes through
your headphones or speakers for both
gaming or multimedia some of the
settings you can adjust are the bass
treble voice clarity or even given a
virtual surround effect so Before we
jump into the benchmarks this is how
quiet it is even under full load
so there you have it some pretty solid
numbers all around in fact if you guys
want a game in 4k resolution well above
60fps then I would recommend dropping
down the settings a bit because the
games I tested in the benchmark were
actually fully maxed out so yeah 4k
gaming is definitely doable with the MSI
I guess but I'll do for this video as
always theme guys so much for watching
if you guys are interested in checking
out the MSI acres gaming PC I'll drop a
link to it down below as always thank
you guys so much for watching and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
