cheap CD keys for any game on any
platform this is where I get all my
games from as well as Windows Keys for
my monthly PC builds but I'll leave a
link down below so you can see for
yourself so I just finished posting over
the how to build guide for Zeon and I
lost my voice which is why I kind of
sound like this so bear with me on this
episode so the five lucky contestants
for this week are Alex Alex Alex Alex
and lastly Alex congratulations for
making it to setup wars episode 22
as always the gear for everyone setup
will be listed down below as well as any
recommendations that I give during this
episode so first up we have Alex number
one with a triple display setup we have
three a three twenty three inch monitors
hooked up to the Ergo tech monitor arm
and on the desk we have a corsair k70
keyboard m65 RGB mouse on top of the
glorious extended mousepad on the left
we have a 2011 macbook pro on the
popular am stand and a razer extended
mouse pad right below also let us give a
pair of pro media 2.1 speakers and an 8
ehm 50x headphones hanging from a hanger
which is mounted on a shelf
excellent work with cable management and
I see that you have a Razer Carcharias
gaming headset mounted on the roof of
your desk job well done
pretty dope PC as well we have a 4770k
paired with a GTX 780
inside the NZXT h 440 case overall I
really like the presentation it's clean
its symmetrical and you don't have that
many things on your desk I also like the
26 inch insignia TV you have mounted on
the wall you do have the perfect setup
though to install a drawer underneath to
keep some of your extra stuff off of the
desk like smartphones or remote controls
but other than that I say you have a
pretty organized and sweet setup thank
you Alex for entering Alex number 2 is
next up with a look at his gaming room
so for this setup we have three a three
monitors again on the Ergo tech monitor
arm on the desk we have the Black Widow
ultimate chroma keyboard razer naga
chroma mouse on top of the course our
extended mousepad and also on the desk
we have some speakers from Logitech and
a few other miscellaneous items
alongside the edge of the desk on the
right side we have a pair of 88 and 50
X's hanging from the Audio Technica
headphones stand and on the desk is the
really awesome looking bladeless fan
from Dyson it's really fascinating how
that actually blows cold air without any
blades but hey it works and it looks
dope right next to the PC setup we have
a 40 inch TCL TV which is hooked up to
some gaming consoles a ps4 Xbox 360 I'm
kidding it's an Xbox one
relax with the comments we also have a
Wii U and attend ODS and a PSP well it
seems like you got the console part
covered that's for sure excellent work
with cable management using zip ties to
organize the wires and kudos to
attaching the power strip on the roof of
your desk
definitely a badass gaming room set up
no doubt thank you Alex for entering
Alex number three is next up with a
pretty interesting setup so not only do
we have two AOC 23 inch monitors but we
also have an Optima projector which
looks like it's duplicating one of the
screens not a bad way to watch movies or
even game on so on a desk itself we have
a
finally someone else with an x4
Sidewinder keyboard I knew I wasn't the
only one on this planet that has won ten
out of ten sealed approval just for that
Alex congratulations I'm just kidding
you don't get the seal because you are
using your server as a modern Arizer I
mean who does that
but anyways moving on with the show so
we also have a mad catz rad7 mouse on
the mad cat glide 5 mouse mat we also
have a blue snowball mic in the front
for recording audio I'm guessing and a
pair of sign Heiser HT 5:18 headphones
on top of the mounting arm pretty good
job with cable management considering
you have an entire server in your setup
and I also like the vertical power strip
looking thing you have I haven't
actually seen anything like that before
obviously I'm going to recommend moving
the server from that desk but I'm sure
there's a reason why it's there probably
because you don't have extra space
anywhere else but consider buying a
server rack so you don't end up damaging
it or even the table its resting on
I also recommend a headphone hanger that
will give you a dedicated place for your
headphones but other than that you have
a pretty sweet setup thank you Alex for
entering next up is Alex with our
first-ever demonic themed setup it's
almost as if we're in the basement of a
leader of a cult with those candles on
the side and these skull and strange
pictures on the wall not to mention the
two lava lamps I'm just kidding all
jokes aside this is a pretty unique
setup so on a desk we have a wide 29
inch Acer monitor a dell ultrasharp a 19
inch monitor in vertical mode and a 2013
MacBook Pro which is powering everything
it seems like you're into mixing music
which is pretty dope but if you do make
some hip-hop style beats definitely hit
me up because I would like to use some
in my videos also know that's we have an
AKG K 702 headphones on top of the
popular ikea Rizla desk pad k manager
can definitely be improved so I would
recommend some cable jobs and raps to
clean that up a bit but yeah you
definitely created a unique setup that
adds to your personality thank you Alex
for entering last but not least we have
Alex number five with another triple
display setup we have three Samsung
24-inch monitors a Razer BlackWidow
chroma keyboard Razer Mamba wireless
mouse on top of the G 440 mouse pad from
Logitech also no desk we have the Harman
Kardon sound sticks which I personally
think goes well with the set up cable
management is pretty good and I
especially love your PC build it's
rocking a 4790k
and a GTX 750 I really like when the PCs
match the setup and it does just that
with the white custom cables and the
purple LEDs job well done there's also a
logitech g27 wheel set for racing games
which she can easily swap in and out for
by next to the desk setup you have a
tiny table with a MacBook Pro and a
really cute Iron Man bobblehead which
would go great with any setup but yeah
overall a very clean setup I really dig
the matching color scheme you have going
on there thank you Alex for entering so
