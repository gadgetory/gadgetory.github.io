and i'm making this quick video to go
over the winners from the msi gaming
monitor tester program don't be upset if
you didn't win because there's another
opportunity for you guys to win an
awesome gaming monitor
I hope you guys heard the news but LG
just announced the world's first nano
IPS one millisecond response time gaming
monitors on 144 Hertz refresh rate four
of the 27 inch models will be given out
to four winners and 50 runner-up
contestants will receive a $25 online
game gift card make sure to stick around
to the end of the video for more info on
that
so the first winner of the msi tester
program was nigel gary he made it very
detailed and boxing video going over the
contents of the box as well as
installation of the monitor he also does
a pretty good job talking about the
specs and doing a quick walkthrough of
the monitor pretty straightforward video
I really like your setup to you by the
way your anathan Revis was the second
winner and you also did an unboxing
video going over all the components with
the addition of some background music
the biggest advice I can give you for
all future videos is picking up a tripod
that way you have steady footage because
unboxing something and filming it with
one hand
never is a good idea they're just too
much shaking the video that's what I'm
trying to say here he then goes on
talking about how the curve is subtle
and not that noticeable coming from his
previous flat monitor Alex Savage did an
unboxing video with his son with no
voice over just some chill background
music and they set it up and enjoyed
some good old tech source content it's
always weird seeing myself in other
people's videos one thing I would have
loved to see here is maybe some gaming
on the monitor instead of just watching
content but other than that I think your
son did a really good job putting
together this video especially if this
was his first video great job this next
video from Barrett Grayson starts off
with a little skit of him playing rocket
League on a flat monitor and then
shortly after he gets a delivery of the
MSI monitor he then proceeds to unbox it
while going over specs and finally
wrapping up the video talking about his
experience gaming on the monitor at his
last video from Darian is the weirdest
out of the five but it's also my
favorite because it's so unique and kind
of Quincy at the same time I'm not gonna
lie maybe laughs pretty hard watching it
but I want one if you guys are Japanese
videos below if you guys want to check
them out the congratulations again to
all the contestants who won like I said
earlier don't be upset if you didn't win
because there's not a chance for you
guys to win another badass gaming
monitor LG announced two monitors with a
1 millisecond response time IPS panel we
had a 38 inch ultra ride with a
resolution of 3840 by 1600 which can be
overclocked to 175 Hertz and we also got
a 27-inch 1440p model with 844
fresh-made also with the 1 millisecond
IPS panel to enter is very simple all
you guys have to do is make a meme
related to the 1 millisecond response
time on the IPS panel and post it on
your social media account with the
following hashtags the contest ends July
31st with the winners announced on
August 9th more information will be
linked down below good luck - ever
enters those whiners are actually pretty
sick I do want to grab one as soon as
possible and review it on the channel so
make sure you guys stick around for that
thanks again so much for watching this
quick video I love you faces I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
