this awesome deal on the office 2016 CD
key right now you can pick it up for
only $35 but if you guys use the code
TSS 2 you get an extra 10% off I'll drop
a link below if you want to check it out
what's happening guys Apotex horas
welcome to the highly requested follow
up video of the intel budget PC that I
built a few weeks back on the channel a
lot of us were and myself included was
very shocked at how much performance we
were able to squeeze out from a sub $500
budget PC over 60 fps across most
triple-a titles in high settings no
stutter no lag fluid gameplay all while
the PC remained dead silent and if you
guys don't believe me make sure to check
out the benchmark video where you can
see the actual gameplay and all the
stats and numbers I will link that below
so the reason why I'm here making this
video is because a lot of you requested
to see an AMD version of this exact same
PC maybe they have something against
Intel or maybe they just want to see if
a similar price AMD system would perform
better but yeah that is why I'm here
this is exact same PC that I used in
that video I haven't touched it just yet
but I'm gonna be swapping out some parts
to convert it into an AMD build like the
motherboard a CPU and some RAM so the
cpu we're going with is the Athlon 200
and GE this is also a dual-core
processor with 4 threads and it cost
about the same as the G 45 60 but add
you could have gamma performance if you
want with the 2200 g or if you went with
the risin 1200 zip it in the comment
section do you guys please I know how it
works obviously you spend more money you
get more performance the point of this
video is to compare apples and oranges I
have to compare apples with apples
that's what I meant to say the point of
this video is to compare two similar
price pcs to see which one would perform
better
thus giving you more bang for your buck
so the motherboard we are using is the
MSI B 450m Pro m2 it supports
overclocking and it's compatible with
all rising ships from first gen all the
way to second
which makes the AMD system more
attractable because of expandability
let's say later on the line you want to
upgrade your CPU to a risin chip and you
want to overclock that well this board
has you covered you don't have to go out
there and buy a new board just for that
it also supports higher RAM speeds which
is why I picked up twenty eight hundred
megahertz rated Ram sticks and it cost
only seven dollars more than the RAM
from the Intel build so not a huge
difference in price actually as I'm
making this video today both systems
cost the same however prices do
fluctuate everyday and I know you're
probably thinking IDI that's not really
fair dude you're using 2200 megahertz
RAM in the AMD system while the Intel
build only had twenty four hundred
megahertz and here's my response to that
so the Intel system unfortunately the
maximum RAM supported was only 2400
megahertz and that's because of the G
4560 I couldn't go anything higher than
that if I did it would have been a waste
of money and the RAM would have under
clocked itself so there was no point in
doing that I'm also aware of the fact
that the 200 GE supports up to 26 66
megahertz but the price difference
between that and the 2800 megahertz was
the same so it just made sense to pick
this up instead it's also great for
future proofing because let's say we do
swap the CPU to a risin chip later down
the line it's gonna support all twenty
eight hundred megahertz on these so yeah
that's why I picked it up but ya guys
everything else is pretty much the same
inside the PC we're still using the same
case the same power supply and the same
graphics card so it's going to put these
in here and see if the ME system
performs better than the Intel and if it
does by how much
all right so the results are in and it's
actually surprising it appears that the
Intel build performs noticeably better
than the AMD build despite it using
lower frequency Ram the total frames
from the Intel build came out to be 600
over AMD's 5:29 which means the Intel
build is 12% faster I think the biggest
difference between these two systems
aside from the performance is
expandability with the AMD system you
can upgrade the CPU up to a risin 7 and
you get faster RAM support up to 34 66
megahertz because the motherboard
supports it now on the Intel build
you're pretty much stuck with locked
processors because the B 250m board that
we used in that PC doesn't support
overclocking and it doesn't support any
Ram over 2400 megahertz so you pretty
much stuck to that so let's say later
down the line even if you do upgrade
your CPU to an i7
7700 you can't really pair that with
fast Ram you're pretty much stuck with
2400 megahertz or less so the real
question you got to ask yourself if
you're deciding between these two budget
pcs is what's more important to you the
extra 12 percent performance in games
while losing out on expandability or
going with slightly less performance but
with expandability however there is an
alternate option for those of you that
want the best of both worlds if you guys
are using the Intel system all you have
to do is swap out this motherboard with
a z2 70 board which will cost you only
$30 more but it will give you tons of
room for expandability I would
personally go with the gigabyte gaz 270
XP which supports overclocking you get
faster RAM support as well and it goes
for around $80 if you want something
more compact for an ITX build go with
the azrog z2 70 m for just $50 more
which has built-in wireless AC I mean
all these are really great options but
honestly it just comes down to what your
budget is and what your preference is I
looking to build a cheap budget PC to
game over 60 fps and then now alright
looking for something more long-term
what
future upgrades later down the line but
let me know what you guys think about
both of these pcs and if you were to
pick one which one would you go with the
intel or the AMD with future upgrades or
maybe the intel with the z 270 board
that way it's more future proof but
anyways let me know what your choice is
in the comment section because I might
just randomly pick a comments and give
him or her that PC it is gonna be a
global giveaway I'll announce the
winners on Black Friday on my Twitter
account to make sure you guys are
following me or check back on that day
to see who won the PC it's kind of a
secret giveaway only the people who
stuck around to the end of this video
with know about it do not mention
anything about the giveaway in the
comment section otherwise you will be
excluded do not mention giveaway anyways
but guys things again so much for
watching I hope you guys enjoy these
types of videos if you did dropping a
like would mean the world to me
and I will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
