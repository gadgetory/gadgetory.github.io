during CES and I'm gonna be checking out
the recently announced ascent made to 4G
trying to build off at success in China
Hawaii is trying to bring it to a new
level the main focus of this phone is
LTE connectivity for carriers such as
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile this phone is also
running Android 4.3 under its emotion UI
2.0 the custom skin brings some
enhancements to stock I enjoy like the
dongle here now I'll let you do a host
of things like open up window
application settings and even make your
phone one at optimal settings another
feature we can see here is a one-hand
mode that puts the keyboard to either
the left or right side for easy
one-handed use on this massive 6.1 inch
display this feature will be present
wherever the keyboard can be accessed
holding down the home screen will allow
the user to select from various options
like changing the wallpaper adding
widgets altering transitions and
accessing the simple home UI
which we will go into later sliding down
from the top we can see the Notification
Center does have quick toggles as well
as an easy way to dismiss multiple
notifications at once
this phone will also come running
Android 4.3 when released and its specs
are not what you would expect to see
from a flagship with a 1.6 gigahertz
Snapdragon 400 CPU two gigs of RAM and a
720p display it is dwarfed by the
competition that are running much faster
chipsets and 1080p displays taking a
look at the recently used apps menu we
can see that it is fairly similar to
stock Android with the exception of the
cleanup button at the bottom that will
exit all running applications which is a
welcome addition even though the
animation is fairly slow to execute the
device on the other hand feels plasticky
in hand and reminds us of a pre node3
Samsung device with an all plastic body
and unsparing design there isn't much to
talk about here the phone is also on the
thicker side but this is needed to
accompany the massive 4050 millions per
hour battery which can also recharge
other devices when plugged into micro
USB port on the bottom we have a five
megapixel front facing camera and on the
back we have our 13 megapixel sensor the
device is very glitchy when we were
using it but that can be because it
wasn't a final sale unit
taking a look at the camera reveals all
K results but nothing to rave about we
will get more into the detail but the
camera once we get ourselves a unit to
review and finally let's take a look at
simple home and easy to use home screen
I will place the stock one with big
icons and not much going on this would
be perfect for anyone that would rather
prefer a simple to use interface and now
will conclude a quick look at the ascend
