and this is ice cube the $600 gaming PC
for the month of June I've been doing
full-size bills on a channel for a while
so I thought I would change things up
and go with a smaller more compact route
by the way there will be a build guide
on this PC next week for those of you
that are interested in picking up the
same parts and making one for yourself
so make sure you're subscribed to the
channel if you don't want to miss out so
this time around I went to the Intel i5
4460 locked processor and the asrock v8
e5m ITX motherboard since I didn't plan
on overclocking this PC I decided not to
pick up a CPU cooler I also picked up
eight gigabytes of RAM from crucial and
a one terabyte hard drive from Seagate I
was going to go with a GTX 960 but I
went with the r9 380 instead because
this card outperformed the GTX 960 in my
top 5 GPU comparison using up all these
parts is none other than the EVGA 500
watt power supply which is more than
enough and I want to have impact
everything inside the super tiny and
sexy thermal take v1 Core Mini ITX case
a few things that attracted me to this
case where the price design space for
cable management and the 2 USB 3.0 ports
off to the side from Mini ITX Tower this
case offers a lot of features for temps
Ice Cube hovered around the constant 33
degrees Celsius during idle and light
usage while capping at 66 degrees during
full load also it's pretty damn quiet
this is by far the most quietest PC that
I have ever built
put the fire strike benchmark the PC
scored a 71 31 and here is where it
ranks compared to my other budget builds
on the channel as you can see it
completely beat out Z on the $650 build
from last October in terms of rendering
these are the times for a full export on
a 60 second 4k file comparing the speeds
to my previous budget builds it appears
that Ice Cube is noticeably better in
terms of rendering times I also noticed
that even though it's 50 dollars cheaper
than Z on the render times are almost
the same so now that all those
benchmarks are out of the way let's go
and take a look at the 1080p gaming
benchmarks I hope you guys enjoy
so that is it for the video as always if
you enjoy watching my monthly PC builds
and never want me to stop doing them
make sure to back-end that like button
to show your support also make sure to
follow me on Twitter and Instagram
because there's going to be a lot of
sneak peeks on my next two ultimate
builds as well as a sneak peek for the
perfect desk setup episode two there's
going to be a lot of gtx 1080 and 1070
bills in the channel so be sure you guys
are subscribed as always thank you guys
so much for watching and I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
