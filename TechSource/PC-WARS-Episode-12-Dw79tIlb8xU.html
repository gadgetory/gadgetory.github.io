and welcome to PC wars episode 12 we're
used to major custom PC to get featured
on the channel so if you guys have a
badass custom rig and want to get
featured on my show make sure to watch
the video link below let the PC wars
begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always you guys can find the parts list
and specs linked below if anyone is
interested but here are your 5 lucky
contestants you have Antwon Bryan
Freddie Joey and Steven Congrats for
making it on the show starting off the
episode we have an interesting
water-cooled build inside the in win 904
case with a sticker still on there I
think you're supposed to peel that off
bro it's rocking a 4690k overclock to
4.2 paired with a GTX 970 which is also
overclocked to 1416 megahertz
it's featuring the MSI z97 motherboard a
gigabytes of Crucial RAM and EK fittings
and radiators I think the most
interesting thing about this build is
the fact that he went with the most
cheapest RAM sticks in a water-cooled
build for benchmarks the IC PC which is
what he named it got a 95 36 on fire
strike I like how you went with custom
sleeves for the 24 pin but why not get
custom sleeping for the 4 pin ATX and
GPU cables too I feel like there were a
lot of corners cut in this build but
nonetheless if it gets the job done then
it's all good brian is next up with
another water-cooled build inside a
glass case so this case is the
Thermaltake core p5 and it's currently
holding a gtx titan X and a 6700 K
processor which isn't overclocked we
kind of have a Christmas theme going
over here with the red LED fans and
Greensleeves cables and liquid
definitely something different and
unique compared to all the other
mainstream color schemes for benchmarks
toxic got a 16,000 111 putting it in
first place for this episode my only
concern about this build is the amount
of dirt and dust that gets inside the
case since it appears that all four
corners are actually open but
nonetheless a very awesome build thank
you Brian for entering 40 is next up
with titanate er it's rocking an intel
xeon e7 10 core processor with eight
Titan X's what in Neptune's moon is this
I'm also curious about the benchmark
score my lord
forty 2428 I don't have any words cable
management is ridiculously perfect my
only question is what in God's name do
you use this PC for vr porn ladies and
gentlemen we finally have a PC that can
run Crysis over 30 fps a Titan ater
alright so back to reality we have
Joey's PC called env which is running on
a 59 60 X that's overclocked to 4.5
gigahertz and to Titan X's again I've
seen more Titan X's in this episode of
PC Wars and I have in all of my setup
wars and PC wars combined
so the case is actually custom built
from parvum and it kind of looks like a
much cooler version of the air 240 case
from Corsair I especially like how you
rather the GPU cables straight down
covering the cards and for match marks
Envy scored a whopping 27,000 748 taking
second place for this episode I'm pretty
sure there's no PC on this planet that
can beat the Titan ater last but not
least we have Steven with project
redefine get it because the cases name
is define R 5 original we got a gorgeous
black and blue build running on a 3770k
at 4.5 and a gtx 980 can we please take
a moment and appreciate the quality of
the pictures that steven has sent us I
just want to thank you for actually
spending some time and taking your PC
outside to get these beautiful shots we
do have some custom mods the PSU cover
has carbon fiber wraps as well as the
interior of the case the only thing that
kind of threw out the beautiful color
scheme were the ugly Noctua fans on top
of the radiator but honestly you can't
really see those with a side panel on so
it's all good for benchmarks has scored
a 13,000 663 putting redefine and 4th
place for this episode but such an
awesome black and blue bill - Thank You
Steven for entering that's basically
first episode of PC Wars as always drop
your comments down below and vote on who
you think has the best custom PC and
I'll ask the winners on the 15th of May
on my Twitter and Instagram so make sure
