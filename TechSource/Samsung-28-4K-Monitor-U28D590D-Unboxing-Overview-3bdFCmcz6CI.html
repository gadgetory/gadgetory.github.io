follow anything associated with 4k
overpriced overkill or underdeveloped
and usually I would agree but Samsung is
looking to fix that with their new
affordable 28 inch 4k monitor this is a
from tech source and let's take a closer
look before I continue I would like to
give a huge shout out the UPS for the
fantastic shipping job here as they made
sure to bring this to me in pristine
condition
so this monitor costs only 700 bucks and
it's currently one of the cheapest 4k
monitors you can buy with 4 times the
resolution of 1080p 4k is surely the
next step in media consumption but does
the price tag have any influence on its
actual quality let's unbox this and find
out so the monitor does come with a few
things first off you get the neck piece
for the base stand a DC power adapter
which is needed to connect to the power
cable to power your monitor and here is
the base stand itself which looks really
really nice but we'll go ahead and take
a closer look at that later the monitor
is actually very stylish the thin bezels
are very nice and will help with a
multi-monitor setup if you choose to go
that route you do get three additional
cables along with the monitor the first
being the required power cable needed to
power the screen they also threw in an
HDMI cable for those of you that don't
have a display port on your video card
and lastly they threw in the DisplayPort
cable so you can take advantage of the
full 4k experience so one of the things
I don't like about the stand is the fact
that you can't rotate or lower your
monitor the stand makes it impossible
however you can tilt it if you choose so
it's not all that bad the installation
is also quite simple all you have to do
is insert the neck piece in the slot and
tighten the two screws in the back it
isn't exactly the most solid setup but
it works just fine I have been
interested in 4k for quite a while now
but there has always been factors that
have held me back from pulling the
trigger one of which is the refresh rate
at 60 Hertz this isn't the fastest
monitor on the planet but it will do for
most gamers another important thing to
factor into your decision is that this
monitors response time
is only one ms which is great for games
although it's not the thinnest 4k
monitor it certainly comes close
measuring at 1.25 inches at its smallest
point and 1.75 inches for its largest
just for fun we brought in the HTC One
m8 just so you guys can compare the
differences one thing I absolutely love
about this monitor is the fact that
there are no buttons on the bezels or
even around the frame they included one
analog controller in the back for
accessing the menu in settings and
despite it being in the back it's
actually really simple to access and
very easy to use for navigation Samsung
has also added a clip in the back for
cable management purposes which is a
really nice addition also in the back is
where you will find all the ports two
HDMI is one DisplayPort audio out and
your power in one negative thing I see
here which can be a deal-breaker for
most people is the fact that it does not
have any holes in the back which means
that it's not compatible with VESA
mounts also on the bottom of the monitor
you will find a Kingston lock port so if
you live in a bad area this can be
useful now the screen does have a matte
texture over it but it is done right in
my opinion and does not take away from
the picture or video not only do you
still get amazing and vibrant colors but
there are also no reflections like you
would normally get from a glossy screen
here is my other monitor playing the
same video side-by-side just to give you
a better idea on the color differences
it isn't exactly the best comparison but
it's better than nothing the quality on
this thing is amazing I have never seen
anything quite like it although it's
fair to say that I have never owned a 4k
monitor till now here's what it looks
like on a regular 1080p monitor it's
crazy to see huge difference between the
two needless to say that I have made a
great decision buying this monitor I
thought for the price of $700 I will be
getting a very cheap 4k monitor but man
was I wrong if you guys are looking to
purchase a 4k monitor but think they're
overpriced then now's your chance I'll
leave a link in the description down
below if you guys are interested and if
you want us to do a specific video like
gaming or just show you more sample
pictures of the 4k content on this
monitor then let me know in the comment
section down below this is at from tech
source and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
