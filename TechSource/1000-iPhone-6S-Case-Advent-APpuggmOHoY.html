iPhone 6's case now before you guys
start trolling and hating on the case
mainly because of the price you have to
understand that these types of cases are
for a small group of individuals a case
like this is crafted to perfection with
premium materials what it lacks in
protection it makes up for in the
aesthetics Department no doubt even the
unboxing experience itself is
exhilarating the packaging box is
precision machined and is made out of
aerospace grade aluminum the case is
called Advent and this is the
mechanically textured addition which
means that it is limited to only 100
units worldwide the case also comes with
custom laser engraving which can be
added to the packaging box and the case
itself unlike most bumper cases this one
is split into two pieces and requires no
tools for installation
each rail is paired with rubber housing
which serves as shock absorbent between
the bumper and the phone since the
actual bumper doesn't come in contact
with the phone you won't experience any
signal us the rubber housing currently
is available in black yellow and red but
of course I had to go with the red
option to match my color scheme
installation is simple just attach the
rubber housing of your choice to each
rail and slide it on one at a time the
friction between the rubber housing and
the bumper keep the pieces together
tightly that price tag Doe one thousand
dollars for a case that's worth more
than the phone itself is pretty crazy so
what makes the bumper cost that much
well if I didn't mention that before the
case is made out of aerospace grade five
titanium which is two and a half times
stronger than stainless steel and only
half its weight the rails also have
chamfered edges which gives a case a
luxurious and futuristic look and
because of the flat sides you get a much
better grip than before so the phone is
much less prone to drops but let's be
real for a second if you want a case
like this in the first place you should
be more worried about damaging the case
than the actual phone the cutouts are
also precise leaving enough room for the
speaker grilles and third party
accessories the cutouts on the sides are
also done really well the case does not
interfere with the functionality of the
phone whatsoever I can easily access the
volume buttons and even hit the vibrate
switch with just one finger the power
button is also really easy to press
combined the exotic bumper case
some dban skins and you have yourself a
device that will surely turn heads if
you're interested in checking out some
skins for your devices I'll go and drop
a link down below for you
so yeah the case is obviously not for
everyone but if you're a baller and have
an iPhone 6 or success and are looking
to separate yourself from the crowd
the advant case is the one for you I'll
leave a link down below if anyone is
brave enough to check it out feel free
