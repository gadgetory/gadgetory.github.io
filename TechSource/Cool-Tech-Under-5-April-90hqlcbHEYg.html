and welcome back to another cool tag
video this time I'm going to be looking
at tech under five dollars
and as always most of the products you
see in this video will be available to
try for free on the app called
nice I'm also happy to announce that all
the products from the nice app are now
available to over 49 countries with free
shipping so hopefully that will cover my
international audience as well I know
you guys I've already talked about it a
few times in my previous videos but nice
is more than just an app where you can
try products out before you buy them you
see it's kind of an extension of my
YouTube channel where you guys can find
products that are featured on my channel
on the app as well there's even a
special category just for products I
featured in my videos so if you haven't
already downloaded the app I'll drop a
link down below so you guys can check
out without wasting any more time let's
begin so starting up the video is this
2.4 gigahertz Wireless Gaming Mouse from
fan tech it features two red buttons on
the side for back and forward along with
a dedicated dpi button up top to adjust
the sensitivity on the fly it's
extremely tiny making it perfect for
travel but people with really large
hands may find it uncomfortable to use
otherwise for regular or even small
hands this mouse is perfect and because
it has asymmetrical design both left and
right-handed people can use it no
problem I do love the fact that it comes
with a slot under the mouse to store the
receiver and it does take to triple-a
batteries it's not too bad for gaming to
be honest I'm actually pretty surprised
how accurate it is considering its a
four-dollar wireless mouse you won't get
the same level of precision compared to
be more expensive Mouse that's for sure
but for casual gaming it really didn't
bother me as much as I thought it would
now if you're hardcore FPS gamer I
probably wouldn't buy this mouse as you
can definitely notice the difference in
real time but for laptop use or people
that travel constantly this is a nice
little mouse that will get the job done
next up we have a USB 2.0 SD card reader
so you guys record video or audio on an
SD card and want a super affordable way
of transferring files to your PC then
this is something you should definitely
check out and as a slot for regular full
sized SD card and microSD card on the
bottom the only downside
that it is the USB 2.0 so if you have
large files to transfer it will
definitely take a while compared to USB
3.0 this next item is pretty cool it's a
lightning cable disguised as a bracelet
snap it open and start charging or
syncing your iPhone in style I guess the
purpose of it is to be portable and easy
to access since it's always wrapped
around your wrist it doesn't work with
iPhone 6s or 6s Plus unfortunately I
think it's only compatible with older
versions of the iPhone there's also a
microUSB version as well which I'll link
below we can approaching this next item
is a power bank that you can hook up to
your keys so you always have a backup in
case of emergencies this gives you
twenty six hundred billion hours of
juice and it's compatible with
practically anything that has a USB port
you do need to carry the cable around
with you though since it doesn't come
with one but for only four bucks this is
a pretty cool tech to have next up is a
pretty simple item but since it's under
five dollars I had to include it in this
video so this is a four port USB 2.0 hub
so if you guys need extra USB ports on
your PC or laptop and picking up
something like this will definitely do
the job finishing off the episode are
these headphones I picked up from cos at
first glance they look like headphones
used to wear back in the day with
cassette and CD players but looking at
it closely you will find that it's
pretty much the same type of headphones
actually super light super flimsy the
sound is pretty bad and tinny you get no
noise isolation and the sound leak is
terrible I mean your neighbor can
practically hear what you're listening
to then I mentioned it's flimsy but for
the price of $4.99 I really can't
complain I mean it produces sound what
more can you ask for so that will do it
for the video if you guys enjoy my
monthly cool tech series make sure to
smack the crap out of that like button
and everything I mention in this video
will be linked below along with the app
I was mentioning earlier in the video
for my international viewers out there
you guys get free shipping on all the
products from the app so be sure to
check that out thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll see you in the
next video
