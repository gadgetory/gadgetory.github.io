in this video we'll be taking a closer
look at a lien where's 15 inch gaming
laptop specifically the r3 model with
the gtx 1070 the unit that dell has sent
us has a price tag of $2,700 which is a
pretty steep jump from the $1,700 base
model with the increased cost however we
get a beefier processor the i7 7820 HK
as well as an improved display it's
still 1080p but as a refresh rate of 120
Hertz instead of the standard 60 we also
get 32 gigs of ram running at 2400
megahertz and lastly 2 terabytes of
storage one terabyte coming from a more
traditional 7200 rpm Drive and the other
terabyte is from the m2 the read and
write speeds are fast and the storage is
easily upgradeable removing the aluminum
back panel and you get access to your
two RAM slots as well as a room to add
four hard drives here's a mechanical
drive and the existing m2 and over here
are the two extra m dot two slots the
build quality is nice the top panel is
aluminum which adds a bit of weight when
compared to its plastic competition and
when you're handling a laptop this big
it's nice having very little flex a lot
of the weight actually comes from the 99
watt hour battery which gave me some
pretty impressive numbers around 6 hours
of use which is really good coming from
a gaming laptop however that was from
just everyday usage for watching YouTube
videos writing scripts and browsing the
web the PC mark workstation benchmark
that I run on all my laptop tests showed
a different result
so the laptop is also thinner when
compared to last year's model by 25% a
lot of gaming laptops have light-up
logos and keyboards but this laptop is
on another level it has 12 different
lighting zones all of which are user
customizable the life strips on the
sides are the first I've seen on any
laptop I reviewed on the channel and
they give the laptop a futuristic Tron
look which I like
of course if RGB lighting is in your
thing you can always turn them off
through the alien FX app but personally
I like them especially when combined
with the D brand skins we have on here I
even added some carbon fiber around the
keyboard it's actually improved
performance by 10% believe it or not but
seriously if you're looking to spice up
your laptop check them out because they
offer skins for a variety of laptops as
well it's not just for Alienware I'll
drop a link down below if you guys want
to check it out
above the lights we get some ports we
got audio jacks 2 USB 3.0 we also get a
type C and on the back we have an
Ethernet some display ports Thunderbolt
3 and the graphics amplifier port it's
very inconvenient that they didn't
include an SD card slot considering I
use that a lot while transferring video
and audio files when editing a lot of
gaming laptops in this price range
include one so it's kind of
disappointing to see that the art 3
doesn't come with one the display is
great for gaming it's 1080p and it has
the refresh rate of 120 Hertz with
g-sync
unfortunately it's a TN panel so there
are gonna be some trade-offs first off
the viewing angles are bad not so much
from the sides but from higher or lower
angles you can see drastic color
shifting and secondly it's not that
color accurate either don't get me wrong
it's ok when playing games or consuming
media but I would stay away from this
panel if you plan on doing any color
sensitive work the blacks on the screen
lack depth and the colors are somewhat
washed out they do have 1080p and 4k IPS
panels however if you do want a better
image and accurate colors but if you
don't care about the color accuracy then
the 120 Hertz panel is the ideal choice
for gamers especially if you play
competitively so this is the
fund-raising camera test on the
Alienware r3 it's shot at 720p and is
the highest resolution the final you
just kicked it out of you guys can hear
that and the video quality and the
microphone is actually not the best
that's when you've seen a lot better in
other gaming laptops it's also ready to
use with Windows hello an alternative
way of logging in using the front-facing
camera which is great but I hope to see
Elian we're implementing Turpin readers
in the future the triple zone backlight
keyboard is solid keys
over two millimeter travel distance
without feeling mushy on the left side
we can find macro keys that can be
programmed through the Alienware FX and
overall I've had no complaints using it
to game and it didn't take me too long
to become efficient with it when writing
scripts below that will find the
trackpad which is unreasonably small I
mean look at all this room Alienware had
to work with I mean at least it has RGB
backlighting my guess it is accurate and
works good with multi gestures and the
physical buttons have a nice mechanism
even though well anywhere skimped out on
the size of the trackpad fortunately
they have increased the size of their
speakers the base is strong but not
overpowering they do distort a little
near max volume but they're still very
good the highs and mids are also very
pronounced and it gets loud enough to
fill an average-sized room however I
would recommend some surround sound
headphones for serious gaming so you
guys can hear footsteps and games like
pop G for everything else especially for
media consumption you won't be
disappointed by the speakers so with our
configuration we were easily breaking
through the 60 frame press hold and with
some graphical tuning we were even able
to utilize the full hundred twenty Hertz
refresh rate in most games while still
keeping most settings that high this
wasn't really a surprise when keeping
our configuration in mind what was
surprising to me were the thermals when
the CPU and GPU was pushed with
synthetic benchmarks had managed to stay
cool with no danger of throttling not
only that but we were blown away with
just how quiet it manages to stay even
while under full load coming from the
jet engine like a razor blade Pro I just
recently reviewed it is night and day
overall I would say that the Alienware
15 is a decent buy it has powerful specs
great build quality a solid keyboard and
a 120 Hertz panel which you don't see
too often on laptops thanks to its solid
and great cooling it's bigger and
heavier than a lot of laptops out there
you can also build a really nice desktop
gaming PC with that budget so the
question always comes down to is how
much power do you really need while on
the go because if you're buying a gaming
laptop in the first place you're
obviously gonna use it away from home
however I wouldn't recommend this laptop
for any
looking for maximum portability my
personal top two picks right now are the
Acer Helios 300 or the new dell 75077
which has a gtx 1060 max-q design which
is going for under $1000 right now
doubling to both of the laptops down
below as well as the Alienware r3 think
as much watching as always if you enjoy
the video toss they like to show your
support if you didn't like it it'll fit
a dislike as well and I will see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
