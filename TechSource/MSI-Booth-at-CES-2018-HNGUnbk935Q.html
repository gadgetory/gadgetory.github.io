possible by deep cool and MSI right now
there's an awesome giveaway on the new
msi optics curved gaming monitor and all
you have to do to enter is drop a like
and leave a comment down below on what
you enjoyed about today's video you can
increase your chances of winning by
leaving a like and comment on every
single CES video throughout this week on
tech source so there weren't that many
new products showcased at the msi booth
is here however we do have some exciting
stuff like their mystic light sync which
is a software that allows you to not
only change the colors of the
motherboard but also gives you the
ability to change the colors of the
peripherals connected to the motherboard
it could be anything from the case to
the RAM CPU cooler keyboard and even
Mouse they are working with several
partners to increase their compatibility
list however at this demo we have
Corsair gear connected and with a simple
touch of a button all the colors can be
changed you can even add special effects
to the lighting but I really like what
msi is doing for gamers out there making
it a lot easier to sync everything up
together instead of having to download
extra applications for each separate
component msi was also showcasing their
z 370 god-like gaming motherboard which
was a winner of the CES Innovation
Awards as well so this is their
enthusiast level Z 370 board that
features triple turbo and two slots we
got built-in Wi-Fi with a wireless
extender four dimm slots and support for
Quad SLI or 3-way crossfire as far as
aesthetics I think is a really good
looking motherboard with neutral colors
and those giant heat sinks covered and
RGB lighting
I'll leave links below if you want to
check that out and they're also
showcasing their X 299 X power gaming AC
motherboard that's equipped with a 79 80
X II which is an 18 core processor and
what they wanted to demonstrate here was
the overclocking features of this board
well this motherboard actually makes it
very easy to overclock with a press of a
button once you access the BIOS all you
have to do is click on the game boost
and select a number based on how
aggressive you want the overclock set to
and the system will automatically
overclock the CPU now we're trying to
get the most out of the processor while
maintaining a stable frequency as you
guys can see in this video the 79 80 X C
is actually overclocked to 4
point nine gigahertz this is definitely
a nice tool for beginners and is for
people that don't have the time to spend
or just don't care enough to learn how
to overclock I will be checking out
their new monitor in the next video so
make sure you guys stick around thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
