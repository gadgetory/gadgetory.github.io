official announcement of season two of
setup makeover if you guys want to
participate make sure to click on the
application link down below
so if you're living under Iraq or if
you're brand new to the channel welcome
by the way I launched a series only er
this year called set up makeover where
we basically open the applications to
anyone who can submit and then we picked
the one person that's deserving the most
I know whose term and that person will
essentially get a brand new set up for
me so I go over to the house and I
completely redo their set up brand new
desk monitor keyboard mouse PC I mean
everything the whole nine yards
so yeah the application is currently
open now for season two season one did
really good I would say based on the
engagement despite what happened I think
it's a successful season so now I'm
ready for season two so this time we're
opening it up for everyone in the US
we're not quite ready to go global just
yet guys if season two does really well
we might consider going global for
season three yeah that depends on your
guys's engagement with the entire season
another thing we changed was the age
requirement we lowered it down to 13
instead of I think we had an eighteen or
twenty-one for last season which
eliminated a lot of people now I thought
you guys were actually complaining in
the comments section and I'm 16 I'm 15
I'm 17 I can't participate because of
the age requirement well now you can the
final requirement is you have to be a US
citizen or you have to be a permanent
residence within the US those are the
brand-new requirements and there's a
bunch of more new questions added to the
application process and there's going to
be a lot more interviews to make sure
that the person who gets chosen
definitely deserves a new setup guys the
purpose of this season of the series is
to give somebody who needs a new setup
not who needs money to sell it and pay
bills but someone who's gonna use that
set up and to game or to do schoolwork
programming music production whatever it
is we need this set up to help someone
with their lives so that's the purpose
of setup makeover we do have
coolermaster sponsoring the series once
again so
huge huge thanks to Coolermaster which
honestly is like the backbone of this
entire series without them this would
not be possible and also I think LG is
on board as well so huge thanks to LG
for jumping on board also helping out
there is a deadline to submit your
application guys which will be linked
below in the description section so make
sure to check that out I don't want you
guys to watch this application process
please make sure you read the questions
carefully and you answer them and you
submit the photos and videos correctly
don't it's not about who submits first
that's about the right person and it's
about the right application if that
makes any sense one more thing I do want
to say before I end is the person who
does when the said I makeover has to
allow us to be at your house and record
the entire process between May and I
think July those are the months were
planning on the production so if you're
gonna be on vacation or you're not gonna
be at home during those times
unfortunately I don't think it's gonna
work out so yeah those are the main
points I wanted to get across thank you
guys again for the amazing amazing
support for season one honestly I was
just I was impressed and I'm happy that
I did so well
but anyways other season two on to
bigger better things
thank you guys so much for watching
thank you so much for your support I
love your faces and I can't wait to
start season two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
