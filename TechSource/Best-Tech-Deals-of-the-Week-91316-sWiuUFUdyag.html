welcome to best tech deals of the week
and before you guys get excited and say
hey edits back doing these videos no I
am just here doing this one episode
Julian will still be the person taking
over as tech deals of the week but I hit
the hundred thousand subscribers today
which is actually yesterday if you're
watching this video and I'm kind of
excited I just want to thank you guys in
person and I figured why not do an
episode just like old times so yeah I
hear you cries in the comments section
and I am here to host this show so
ladies and gentlemen without wasting any
more time let's begin alright so
starting up the show we have the ever so
popular 6,700 k back at it again with
the white vans it's currently at its
lowest price ever coming in at just
three hundred dollars so if you guys
have been waiting for the price to drop
on this then now is the time to snag it
before it goes back up to 350 bucks if
that's a bit too steep for you the 6600
k is also discounted to 210 dollars
which is honestly just twenty dollars
off the original price of 230 but
nonetheless a deal is a deal slapping
over to Amazon we have a bunch of cool
tech that's discounted like the cyber
acoustic booming speaker system with
subwoofer that's going for 61 dollars
you can hook these up to your PC laptop
or TV and it comes with this tiny pod
that gives you convenient access to the
headphone jack and auxiliary input
behold my pc masterrace the gtx 1070
super clock from EVGA is currently at
its lowest price right now coming in at
just four hundred and thirty dollars
compared to 450 on newegg I mean sure
you're only saving twenty dollars but
every little bit helps I would
personally go with this superclocked
version instead of the FTW because the
performance difference is very marginal
and spending an extra thirty dollars
just doesn't make any sense the only
thing you get if you go with the FTW is
RGB lighting if you're looking for
something a bit more affordable than the
msi gtx 1063 gigabyte variant may be a
better option for you with this bad boy
you can achieve frames well over 60 FPS
and max settings while gaming in 1080p
full you raise our fan boys out there
the diamondback chroma gaming mouse is
on sale for only fifty dollars at least
this time you won't be
overpaying for razor products halo 5
guardians limited edition for the Xbox
one has officially dipped down in price
all the way down to $25 probably because
nobody plays halo anymore and they're
just trying to get rid of the copies and
finally on Amazon we have a very solid
bluetooth speaker going for only thirty
dollars and it's currently the number
one best seller on amazon if base is
what you guys are looking for in
Bluetooth speaker then this is the holy
grail of all speakers on their 50 bucks
if you're interested in getting into the
porn industry or maybe just want to
shoot quality pictures and video then
you will need a solid DSLR that won't
break the bank the Canon Rebel t5 bundle
comes with an 18 to 55 millimeter zoom
lens and it's currently thirty six
percent off this thing shoots amazing
1080p video and if you guys want to take
a look at some video samples check out
the link below the camera in the
description section below be quite as
efficiently discounted all of their new
dark base nine hundred cases on newegg
flash so if you guys are looking for
your next full tower chassis then this
has to be on your list I did do a full
review on this on the channel and once
again I'll drop a link to it down below
if you want to check it out finally on
newegg flash we have a pair of all
around solid earphones coming in at just
23 bucks it will surely satisfy your ear
holes with crispy sound and decent bass
I love the fact that it comes with a
remote to control the volume and accept
calls something you don't see often on
earbuds around twenty dollars wallets
out for Harambee guys fifty dollars for
a 20-inch widescreen monitor are you
serious who cares if it's refurbished I
even buy the same motor with a hole
inside for fifty dollars this is a
really great deal this next one is for
all of my good guys out there that don't
pirate software first I want to thank
you guys so much for supporting the
developers second there's a really solid
discount on microsoft office home and
business 2016 normally this costs around
two hundred thirty dollars but right now
it's only 200 so you would be saving
about 30 bucks for all my pirate errs
out there what up if ultra-wide is your
thing and you never had enough money to
pull the trigger will allows your chance
LG has their 25 um 56 p for only one
hundred and fifty dollars quite possibly
the lowest price I've seen on these any
and finally wrapping this episode up you
have an asus gtx 950 Strix that's going
for only one hundred and ten dollars but
it isn't a form of a 30-dollar mail and
rebate so that'll do for this episode of
best tech deals of the week as always if
you guys enjoy series make sure to leave
a like and I want to thank you guys so
much again for the 900,000 subscriber
milestone Jesus Christ that is insane
I'm only a hundred thousand away from
the big million and hopefully I can get
that to replace my silver play button
thanks so much I love you and also thank
you guys so much for giving Julian a
chance he's improved so much from the
first episode and I want to give you
guys I want to thank you guys so much
for giving them a chance and going with
the flow I don't even know as always
