I'm just curious if so you skip to the
intro animation or do you skip straight
to the setups because sometimes I feel
like I'm just talking to myself in the
beginning of my setup for show but
anyways let me know what you guys do in
the comment section anyways welcome to
setup wars episode 113 where you
submitted ESSEC setup to get featured on
the channel let's just let's let the
setup wars begin kicking off the episode
we got Chris and his sick customs
superhero PC desk setup featuring a 55
inch Samsung TV up top be popular 34
inch ultra wide gaming monitor from Asus
this is the PG 3 for 8 q which by the
way I featured in the Wolverines setup
excellent choice on the surface it looks
pretty straightforward we got the cursor
k95 keyboard with a Razer Ouroboros
mouse and some Altec Lansing speakers
obviously I don't agree with the
placement of the speakers since it's
right in front of the monitor but
everything else is looking good the desk
is also custom made and built from
scratch so check this out guys it's got
programmable RGB lighting we got leather
interior for the drawers and a slip
underneath the monitor to hide the
keyboard and mouse cable now what I like
most about it is the glass encasing on
the right side showing off as B's PC
it's got a 6700 K and an Asus GTX 1080
the colors are all over the place so I'm
going to assume that this has an RGB
color scheme with a hint of a superhero
team the organization inside the drawers
and the cable management under the desk
is excellent and I like that he added a
USB hub on the side for easy access
a very nice custom build setup thank you
Chris for entering Joseph minute to set
up words because he has my face on one
of his monitors looks like he figure out
the secret on how to get accepted I'm
just kidding eyes whatever you do don't
put a video still of my face on your
monitors nobody wants to see that ugly
mug we would much prefer to see a
dope-ass wallpaper just like your Power
Rangers wallpapers on your monitors
although kind of matches your setups
color scheme now that I look at it a bit
more with my black and red foams in the
back
found and my blue shirt matching the
blue shoeboxes you got on the right side
maybe this was done on purpose
I don't know but anyways you got to 24
inch Samsung monitors hooked up to the
wall-e mount and above that we got a 40
inch 4k TV from Samsung the surface of
the desk is very clean and symmetrical
good work on the cables for the k70
keyboard and the g502 Mouse
he's also rocking a D brand skin the ps4
on the left side and a few Power Ranger
figurines to contribute to the
personality aspect of the set up for
audio he's rocking a Logitech z2 13
speakers and the Astro a40 s that are
hanging from the bottom of the desk
superb work with the cable management
this is what I love to see all the wires
are off the ground and notice how we
even attach this subwoofer underneath
the table a lot of 3m tables definitely
used to make this happen here except is
RGB remote a power strip a USB hub and
even an SD card reader if you want to
keep the surface of your desk as clean
as josephÂ´s you got to mount those
small things on the side or even
underneath your desk setup tips 101
that's what the show is about and
finally we've got the PCs powering
everything it's got a 60 70 K and an msi
gtx 1070 with exquisite cable management
personally i think that a red ranger
figuring would have been a better option
instead of Deadpool since you kind of
have a Power Rangers theme going out
already but it's not as the way it is
anyways thank you Joseph for entering
this next set up for Mark is put
together very well it's got function and
I really like the way he organized the
stuff on his desk so he's got two
27-inch ause monitors hooked up on a
desk mount and the k70 keyboard with
Scimitar RGB Mouse below the desk was
custom made and it's 2 inches thick with
a length of 75 inches he also built it
with his grandfather so he doesn't want
to drill any holes for the keyboard and
mouse which I can understand I also like
how you ran the keyboard wired through a
pyramid of cinder blocks that he built
on his desk I think that's pretty cool
for audio he's got the Mackie CR 3
limited edition gold trim monitor
speakers we also got the bose soundtrue
2 headphones and an mxr l microphone
that's been custom skinned and black
with beer and if you guys have your
speaker's on its sides like Mark does
please use some sort of foam underneath
them like he did
believe it or not it does make a
difference in the sound output depending
on the surface of your desk speaking of
making a difference I like the placement
of the microphone it's way back there in
the corner not taking up any extra space
when it's not being used and also the
placement of the audio interface as well
it's right under his desk and closer to
him so that he can plug his headphones
in whenever he does end up using it
beautiful work with the cable management
under his desk as well as inside his old
black PC mark is definitely one of the
very few people who use stock PSU cables
and make it look so good a beautiful
setup with symmetry and purpose although
the monitors aren't exactly symmetrical
with the blinds but that's my OCD
talking thank you mark for entering
speaking of symmetry this setup from
Scott doesn't have any the main monitor
is the 34 inch ultra light from LG and
the vertical one on the side is a 27
inch from Asus he's got both of them
mounted against the wall which looks
very clean and below that we got the
vortex Poker keyboard and the logitech
g930 setup for your smart phone so it's
got a Qi charger that's hooked up to a
microUSB cable which he tucked in very
close to his keyboard and then he routed
those cables through the hole right next
to his keyboard that's definitely one
way to do it
he's also got quite a few audio sources
we can tell why you three speakers up
top and also a pair of em 50s astro a40
s and a high five man he3 50s hanging
from the right side
and speaking of audio he's also got a
sony sound bar that's hooked up to a
60-inch sharp tv for console gaming and
he doesn't discriminate because he's
rocking both ps4 and Xbox one which by
the way our skin by D brands cable visor
is surprisingly isn't bad considering
he's got a lot of text I see some cable
raceways velcro straps that are wrapped
around the legs of the desk great work
my duty and to top it off he's even got
a badass PC to complement his entire
gaming room setup it's equipped with a
67 hundred k 32 gigs of ram and a GTX
can eighty founders Edition but I'm kind
of curious as to why you have a quad
core processor with that much RAM I mean
if you need 32 gigs of RAM chances are
you are doing CPU heavy tasks whether
it's graphic design 3d modeling or just
editing vid
but if that's the case I would
definitely up the core count in your CPU
as well it will definitely help but I'm
pretty sure you know what you're doing
after all you are subscribed to tech
source but this is definitely a badass
gaming room slash battle station
thank you Scott for entering finishing
up the episode we have a clean and
minimalistic setup from sea bass not a
single while you're in sight the cable
management game up here is on point
although under the desk is a different
story
I mean sure all the wires are off the
ground but it's kind of a mess up here I
feel like you took the hard way and
manually nailed some cable hooks up
there with some velcro straps to hold up
the wires honestly a much easier way to
contain all of that nonsense up there is
a Signum rack from Ikea or if you want a
much cleaner look a channel Raceway will
do the job it also looks like the setup
is being powered by a 2014 MacBook Air
and it's interesting to see that a
MacBook is stored underneath the desk
instead of above by the way that's one
cool detail on your MacBook finally
someone who doesn't use mainstream
overused fake IKEA plants nope this dude
got himself two dragon trees instead I
also love how almost everything is in
white we got the Kanto yu2 speaker's LED
lamp the headphone hangar and even those
pots that are holding the plants not to
mention the Apple wireless keyboard and
mouse but there's really not much else
to say it's a very clean and
minimalistic setup Thank You sea bass
for entering before I head out and give
huge thanks to the sponsor of this
episode Skullcandy and they sent out
their new crusher wireless headphone the
long story short guys I love these
things
so the catchphrase for these headphones
is bass you can feel and let me tell you
guys that's no joke you can literally
feel the vibrations of the ear cups it
feels like you're in your friend's car
and he's blasting and music to max
they're calling it stereo haptic face
you know when the bass is so loud that
you can actually feel the vibrations
around your body and even in your ears
that's what it feels like using these
headphones if you feel like the bass is
too overpowering which it definitely
might be for some then you can adjust it
by using a slider near the back to find
a level that you're happy with
personally half way down is a sweet spot
for me and anything higher is too
hardcore these are definitely premium
headphones you get extremely comfortable
memory foam cushions that go fully
around the ears
it also provides excellent news
isolation and like most wireless
headphones it comes with a built-in mic
and a spare aux cable in case you run
out of battery and speaking of battery
life you get up to 40 hours of it that's
crazy if you guys really want that
immersive experience and love EDM or
hip-hop or just bass heavy music and
movies that honestly you have to check
out these headphones I mean even though
they sponsor this episode of setup ors i
am legit going to be using these as my
main pair of wireless headphones they
are that good and just my subscribers
out there you guys can get 20% off these
headphones if you use the code crusher
20 - - i'm pretty confident you guys are
going to love the quality of your set
phones and if you don't well you can
always send them back for a full refund
deputy my traps of the video as always

think has the best that setup and allows
the winners on twitter and instagram
