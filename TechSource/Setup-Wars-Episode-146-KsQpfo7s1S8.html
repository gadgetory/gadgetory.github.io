I'm all about that budget life and it
actually got 357 upvotes
it's not an interesting comment so I'm
just gonna read the one on there Nats
the one under that says I was quoting my
quoting when I said in the video just
look at how beautiful she looks from the
back that's what she said
and actually the comment that's
responding to that I've never seen
anything so beautiful on all fours I've
also said that in the video when I was
talking about the cable management from
the back I purposely made it sound
sexual and I'm surprised not a lot of
people got that for some reason maybe
I've got underage audience I don't know
but yeah that was purposely set in a
sexual way so I'm glad somebody actually
noticed it so yeah and oddly enough that
their comment just says boobies okay
yeah Edwards guys welcome to setup wars
episode 146 where you submit your desk
setup to get featured on the channel if
you guys want to participate you know
what to do watch the video link down
below but with that said let the set up
wars begin
this video was sponsored by world of
warships who reached out and asked me to
try out their awesome game it's a
tactical game where you team up with
other players and go head to head online
against enemy warships you can command a
massive naval fleet featuring some of
the history's most iconic war vessels
and you get to unlock new ships as you
progress through the game they've spent
a lot of time making the game look
awesome and realistic each ship is very
accurate to the real thing and since
launch they've added over 200 ships
across 8 definitions and racked up over
7 million players it's free to play but
if you guys download using my link in
the description section you can get some
awesome goodies like a million credits 3
days of premium access 250 dublin's and
more is however only available to new
users and you have to use the code
listed on the screen kicking off the
show is adam from canada and is insane
Zelda theme setup which actually takes
some inspiration from the channel
judging by the custom-made risers that's
holding up the countertop I gotta say
right off the bat I'm a fan of the white
on white color scheme as well I mean
there are other colors in there that add
some contrast like the blue risers the
mousepad and even the colorful black ops
zombies soda perks on the top so not
everything is white but I do appreciate
the overall consistency so the purpose
of the setup is for console gaming which
is interesting considering he has two
monitors and no TV he's also using a
MacBook Pro so I'm pretty confident he
uses the setup for productivity as well
otherwise this is definitely overkill
just for console gaming I mean he has
four different headsets hanging from the
top we got four astro a 50s to the ps4
and two for the Xbox one s that is some
serious brand dedication right there I
do have to say that the setup has a lot
of personality that's for sure the
consoles on the left all have Zelo skins
and even a five-piece mural painting on
the wall is Zelda themed well
specifically link themed one of the
things I really love about the setup is
the lighting and under a fine job
balancing it be now leaf panels on the
top not only represent the Triforce from
the Zelda series but it also contributes
to the color scheme that is going with
and the icing on the cake
has to be the individually lit sodas in
the center
he basically hooked up an LED strip
behind each one of them to give it that
extra glow I've seen as many times on
the show before so it's not really
unique but it's definitely a great idea
some of the other tech that Adam has on
his setup are the ps4 VR set on the
right side which has it's very own
charging dock for the controllers as
well and I'm set up is very OCD friendly
I mean everything is nicely organized
it's symmetrical and a cable management
is just beautiful to Signum racks
holding up everything and a bunch of zip
ties to group the wires together I mean
this guy is so organized even the cables
inside the drawers are wrapped up nicely
a beautiful and organized setup with
lots of personality I think Adam did a
great job overall putting everything
together thank you for entering next up
is Antoine from France and his multi
setup so the first one features the
ultra wide is actually used for gaming
while the second one is used for music
production and overall productivity the
setup on the left side of his gaming one
is actually his roommates and you can
tell it's pretty lame compared to his I
mean even the cable management is like
10 times worse you know I think it's
time you introduce your roommate to
setup wars it might change his life or
very least his setup all right back to
the gaming setup so he's rocking the
ducky one keyboard and the logitech
mx518 Mouse I actually like those custom
key caps it looks like it's
transitioning from white to black and I
think it looks pretty cool per audio is
using the Edifier are 1700 bt bookshelf
speakers and he's also got the knob
sound amplifier which is hooked up to
his audio technica m50x is next to those
are the SteelSeries Siberia gaming
headset and finally a blue snowball ice
as his microphone it's an interesting
location sitting on top of the speakers
but I'm guessing he brings it closer to
him when he needs to use it the PC
powering the setup actually has
workstation parts which I found odd
seeing as the first set up is used only
for gaming I don't think I've actually
ever seen anyone use a cooler for their
RAM sticks but I guess it looks a lot
cooler than showing up that ugly green
PCB it looks like
a total of four setups in this room
three of them are powered by PCs and
then there is a media set up in the
middle of the room that has Kodi
installed and two massive floor speakers
another thing that caught my attention
is this shelf dedicated to Assassin's
Creed collectables and some keyboards
and mice you know I've always wanted a
place asin's creed and I've been reading
so many bad reviews about the entire
game franchise and at this point I don't
even know which one's good or which ones
worth playing so any fans out there
that's played entire series let me know
which one is good to play that's that's
worth my time that I might enjoy in the
comment section because I think it's
ready to dust off my ps4 Pro some
interesting choices on the hardware and
placement of certain items but overall a
solid setup with purpose Thank You
Antoine for entering a number 3 is
Daniel from Canada and his dual monitor
setup that he uses for video production
and school work but mostly for gaming
he's rocking two different monitors that
are hooked up to a desk mount and
actually surprised that he was able to
fit two displays and his PC on the desk
it's very compact but everything is
organized and spaced out very well the
keyboard and mouse are both home courser
and so is the headset chilling on a
stand he actually has three other
headphones the HD 598 SR and the m50 X's
which are hanging underneath the desk we
also got these Sony headphones which are
stored in one of the drawers
other than the headphones the other
source of audio are the largest xz6 23
speakers it's obvious the color scheme
of the setup is black and white and
daniel did a fine job keeping with it
the skins on the m50x is the Omni mount
cable sleeve even the phone case and
pretty much the entire PC is all in the
same color scheme it's pimped out with
an i7 6700k 32 gigs of ram and the msi
1080 TI with a sexy backplate from v1
tech he also painted a few parts like
the side radiator and the PCIe brackets
nicely done
this is a really clean setup all the
wires are managed very well and I'd like
you to use a couple cable sleeves to
help them out with the PC wires and
pretty much everything else underneath
the desk it's a really balanced and
organized set up Thank You Danielle for
entering at number 4 is Henry and is
insane a triple monitor gaming setup
between three different monitors that
are hooked up to the karlby countertop I
really like seeing super wide tables
like these because it gives you so much
room to work with and be creative and a
tabletop some ikea are built really well
that you won't get any bowing in the
middle even if you have three monitors
mounted without any support in the
center it's just like Henry you know the
monitors he's got the Corsair k70 Lux
keyboard with the Zowie white edition
mouse and the HyperX mousepad for audio
he's rocking the m50 X's with some D
brand skins once again there's a lot of
em 50 X's in this episode apparently we
also got the blue Yeti blackout
microphone that's hooked up to a boom
arm behind the monitor it's very nice
placement with the mic the PC providing
all the juice is packing and overclocked
6700 K we got 16 gigs of ram and the EGA
1070 superclocked GPU I think your top
fan isn't working though you might want
to check that out but I do like the
consistency of the color scheme
throughout your entire setup great work
with the cables underneath the desk it
looks like the Signum is holding up most
of the wires and you even attached a
parish trip using some 3m tape no
complaints here other than your
headphones just laying on a desk but
overall it's a solid badass and clean
gaming setup Thank You Henry for
entering wrapping up the episode is will
and has very clean and sophisticated
productivity and music production setup
tell me the shot of a setup doesn't give
you guys an eye gasm so damn clean all
right so the setup is being powered by
late 2013 Mac Pro and a single 27-inch
LG 4k monitor one of the benefits of
having an off-the-wall setup like this
is that you're able to put stuff behind
your desk without having to worry about
taking space off your desk or not having
any space at all to work with in Welles
example he took full advantage of this
type of setup placing two massive JBL
speakers and a Yamaha subwoofer on the
ground obviously there are some
drawbacks going with this style for
example the main one is cable management
you don't have that support of the wall
to hide the cables in between the desk
but will actually did a great job with
his he basically tied all the wires
together and ran it down the center of
the leg underneath the sub woofer and
straight back into the curtains the rest
of the wires and the power strips are
hidden behind the Alex drawer and the
traffic
it looks like I would say this was
executed perfectly I'm even impressed
that he was able to mount that focus
right AI underneath the desk it actually
looks like he drilled it into the desk
am I really sure because I was gonna say
there's no way he used velcro or 3m tape
to keep that beast up there it's way too
heavy
the setup is obviously for music
production which means he must have a
few headphones laying around I'm always
curious to see what headphones people
use for music related setups so looks
like he's got the bose qc25 s which are
actually really comfortable and sound
great I actually have a pair he's also
got the beats of solo Wireless to the
Sennheiser HD 380 pros and of course the
Apple earpods I really like the
selection here because he pretty much
has audio for every occasion some of the
stuff he's got on the desk are his Apple
keyboard and trackpad the MX master 2's
Mouse and of course the skin iPad pro I
would say this has to be my favorite
setup from this episode I'm getting that
calm relaxing productive vibe it's very
clean and I think that will did an
awesome job putting it all together
excellent work and thank you will for
entering and that pretty much wraps up
this episode I've set up boards I hope
you guys enjoy the show let me know by
leaving a comment down below on which of
these setups you thought was the best
and I lost the winners on my social
media platform and specifically on
Instagram make sure to follow me there
if you guys want to but anyways that
does it dropping a leg would be awesome
if you want to show your support for the
series I love your Chin's and I will see
you in the next one
