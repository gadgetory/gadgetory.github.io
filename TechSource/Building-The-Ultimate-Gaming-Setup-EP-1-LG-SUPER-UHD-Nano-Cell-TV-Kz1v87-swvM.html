is the loft at my new home it's a bit
empty as you can see but I'm going to be
putting together the ultimate gaming and
entertainment center right here and I
want to share the progress with you guys
and maybe even give you some ideas in
the process okay so the centerpiece of
it all is LG's new LCD super UHD TV with
nano cell technology now what separates
this TV from the other TVs I reviewed on
a channel is the Nano cell display there
are a few different ways that LCD
displays are made so first up we got the
traditional LED backlight then we got
the quantum dot display and finally LG's
new nano cell display basically this
technology offers a much wider color
gamut so you get which and accurate
colors but the most appealing difference
is the viewing angles no matter which
angle you look at the TV the color does
not get distorted LG is claiming that
100% of the color gamut is preserved
no matter the angle you are looking from
this means you are getting the same
experience watching from the side
compared to sitting directly in front of
the TV obviously the image is a bit
skewed because of the angle but you
don't see any distortion in color and
just to prove this claim LG actually
held a pretty cool contest between two
football stars where they basically had
to shoot the ball from a 60 degree angle
to try and hit one of the numbers on a
grid on one side is a conventional LCD
screen and on the other side is LG's new
nano cell display it's a pretty cool
video I think you guys will like it I'll
drop a link below so make sure you guys
check it out when you have some time so
the Nano cell display TV is perfect for
large groups whether you watch TV with
your family or constantly have friends
over gaming on your xbox ps4 or even
attendance which they can sit anywhere
in the room and enjoy the same content
without any color Distortion another
pretty cool feature is active HDR with
Dolby vision so basically it delivers
intense highlights vivid colors and deep
blacks on the screen and depending on
the content that you're watching or even
playing in my case it will automatically
activate the speaker is on the SJ 85 are
integrated with Harman Kardon
and they are really nice and loud with
clarity and the highs and a pretty solid
bass here is a quick audio sample
their OS has also been improved it comes
equipped with their Web OS 3.5 which is
a lot cleaner and snappier in my opinion
I'm not a fan of the remote to be honest
it's a bit too small and has an odd
shape to it more of a straight
rectangular remote person myself I
actually prefer their OLED TV remote
over these but everyone has their own
taste however I do like the Amazon video
and Netflix buttons on it but I would
have preferred the YouTube app over the
Amazon video since a lot of people use
YouTube over Amazon video but that's
just my two cents the accuracy of the
magic remote sensor is spot-on I've
actually never had any issues with their
point-and-click remotes before so it's
nice to see that they kept it consistent
and they also kept that feature I really
like how thin the bezels are and
although it's not as thin as their oled
tvs it still looks amazing right now I
have it sitting on my TV stand that I
picked up from Italy mm but I might end
up mounting it on the wall later on
since it does have mounting holes in the
back and speaking of the back it does
have three HDMI and three USB ports of
course it can't be a gaming setup
without gaming so I picked up the ps4
slim to keep me occupied in the meantime
until I pick up the HTC vive and also a
racing simulators set up I might even
pick up a few extra displays to spice
things up so the ps4 slim sets on a
vertical stand that I picked up on
Amazon and it comes with two built-in
charging docks for the controllers
we got three USB ports and also a
cooling fan to keep the ps4 temps down
it even has a storage unit on the side
that can hold up to 14 games which is a
pretty cool add-on the speakers on a TV
are nice but I gotta have my privacy and
I'm actually walking two pairs of
headphones first up is my all-time
personal favorite that I have been using
for the past three years now the popular
a THM 50 X's with the brand skins and
custom ear cups that I picked up from
brain waves the original cushions on the
m50 X's are not comfortable at all for
me after wearing them for about two
hours they start to hurt my ears so that
is why I replace them with the
brainwaves ear cups if I feel like going
Wireless I pick up these skull candy
crushers instead which is clearly my
favorite pair of Y
headphones out there the sound on these
are incredible and the bass is
ridiculous if you guys remember I did an
ad spot with these and one of my setup
words episodes and since then I kept it
and I've been using this as my main pair
of wireless headphones these are amazing
and in fact there's even a slider in the
back over here which lets you adjust the
amount of bass you can feel maximum is
way too much for me you can literally
feel the ear cups shaking and vibrating
in your ear that is crazy
so I usually keep mine like half way
down which is these are perfect for bass
heads by the way but yeah absolutely
love them
I'll double into below along with
anything I mentioned in this video
gaining on the meadow cell TV is awesome
especially if you're playing with a
group of people I say that because it
doesn't matter where they sit in the
room because they won't experience any
color Distortion
I've even tested this myself just for
fun as you guys can see I literally set
at the edge of the TV and I played an
entire level of fury without even losing
I can literally see everything on the
screen as if I was sitting directly at
front of it obviously the image is
skewed depending on an angle you're
sitting at but there is zero color
Distortion
the final piece to this gaming setup are
the LED lights behind the TV so I hooked
up to philips hue Blum RGB lamps in the
back and synched it with my phone so
that I can change the colors easily RGB
lights is an easy way to spice up any
setup but it's still missing a bunch of
things I'm going to be picking up some
wall shelves soundbar some more gaming
gear and a bunch of other cool tech so
make sure you guys are subscribed that
way you don't miss out on episode 2 but
that is it for the ultimate gaming loft
setup I hope you guys enjoy the video if
you did and are excited for episode 2
make sure to leave a like to show your
support if you guys didn't like the
series filthy to dislike as well that is
cool too also huge things to LG for
sending out their nano cell TV for me to
check out and also making this video
possible I'll drop a link to it below if
you guys want to check it out along with
everything I mentioned in this video
thank you guys so much for watching
again I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
