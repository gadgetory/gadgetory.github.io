welcome to another installment of
overpriced tech you guys seem to love
the first one so I'll continue to do
these videos so you guys a huge fan of
the series make sure to leave a like so
starting off the episode is this blu-ray
player from Goldman called the idols
reference blue you might be wondering
why there is no price listed on the
website well it's so that they don't
scare people off the actual retail price
on this thing is a hundred and
thirty-five thousand dollars for a
blu-ray player I mean just buy a ps4
Xbox one and you not only get a blu-ray
player but you can play games too the
blu-ray player is not even made out of
gold so how the hell do you justify the
price well according to this article its
hand-built in Geneva and it's limited to
50 units I don't give a rat's ass if
this was hand-built by Morgan Freeman
himself if I was a millionaire I can
think of a hundred thirty-five thousand
other things to spend that money on this
next item is something I came across
while looking for keyboards for my next
top five keyboards video let me first
start off by saying that this isn't a
fake listing this is a legit keyboard
that's worth 1000 bucks
it's called a sojourner and it's made
out of beautiful aged brass construction
hand crafted from premium materials long
lasting typewriter style keys with
Cherry MX switches the fine long-lasting
how long are we talking about it has a
four star rating so let's take a look at
some reviews
absolutely magnanimous the keyboard
itself with its gold lace is a flawless
match to my diamond-encrusted computer
case I know it seems expensive but it's
got all the letters just being in the
same room with this object actually
grants a type of spiritual clarity I
used to sometimes ask myself such
questions as what is the meaning of life
then after having the sojourner keyboard
in my presence for only a few seconds
all of the answers came to me now I'm
sure a lot of you guys have heard of
overpriced HDMI cables in fact I was
shopping on Fry's the other day and
posted a pic on my Twitter of $130 HDMI
cable that I came across but this this
is another level fifteen hundred bucks
for a freaking HDMI cable I mean this
better give me a thousand FPS but you
know what guys all your quest is kind
enough to let it go for twenty-five
cents cheaper and free shipping so why
the hell not it features bi-directional
Ethernet communication and audio return
channel enabled what the hell does that
even mean I feel like the add all these
complicated words to justify spending
this much on a freaking cable it was
either this or pay the rent this month
you can guess which one I chose now my
landlord comes over to watch TV and
caress this cable and I charge him rent
my cats just love to chew on it in fact
they've chewed on it so much that the
diamond layer has been encrusted to
their teeth now they each have their own
tiny cat grills unfortunately some of
them have died in gang-related accidents
ladies and gentlemen I have to warn my
younger audience for this next item for
your eyes and ears may not be ready for
this introducing the first-ever vaginal
beer imagine the essence of a woman in
one bottle of beer impossible nothing is
impossible I think in order for you guys
to really understand what the hell this
product is you need to watch the video
imagine a woman of your dreams your
object of desire her charm her
sensuality her passion try her taste
feel her smell
her voice now free your fantasies and
imagine that with a magic wand you can
close it in one bottle of beer the
golden drink brewed with her lure and
grace and flavored with instincts which
sauce we have identified we have
discovered a process of transmission of
her essence of her femininity her
instincts by isolation of lactic acid
bacteria from her vagina a laboratory
isolates and multiplies the bacteria in
a safe way so let me get this straight
we are taking vaginal bacteria putting
it in beer and then drinking it I think
I've had enough of this by using yani
bacteria in the process the beers
contain femininity and women's instincts
we have selected beautiful Czech model
Alexandra Brent lava to be our source of
the yani that is a kind of female whose
pheromones will stay with you after the
meeting for the following week long it's
total insanity and excitement reminding
you of the best time of your youth this
insanity if this is excitement and
reminds me of the best time of my youth
I need to go crawl into a hole and die
you know what I'm sold how much is this
thing thirty nine euros that is
overpriced but Edgar this is in
technology it's a drink what the hell is
it doing in this video well I'm glad you
asked well you see on their crowdfunding
page it specifically states this the
technology enabling materializing her
loveliness gracefulness and character so
therefore it's tech related and finally
we arrived at the final overpriced tech
of this video on the last video a lot of
you guys were surprised that I didn't
include any beats or any Apple products
which means in this video I will be
including the most overpriced the
computer
the Mac Pro whether you agree or
disagree with me there is no denying
that the Mac Pro considering its specs
is an overpriced trashcan if you justify
spending over 3000 for this because of
the way it looks and how quiet it is or
how great these software optimization is
then that's fine but it's not going to
change the fact that it's overpriced
a 6 core base model starts at $4,000
it comes with a 3.5 gigahertz six core
xeon e5 processor 16 gigs of ram 2 5
Prodi 500 s and 256 kilobytes of
pcie-based storage in just five minutes
I put together a list that can
outperform the Mac Pro and it costs only
28 60 whether you are buying the Mac Pro
because you're a nice sheep or maybe
because of the software optimization or
hell maybe you just think it looks cool
on your desk whatever the reason is it's
overpriced
but that will do it for this video as
always if you guys enjoy the series make
sure to hit that like button to show
your support I already know that the
Apple fanboys have already disliked the
video which is fine by the way if you
guys run across any overpriced tech make
sure to tweet at me using the hashtag
Opie tech and I'll feature your tweet
and the item in my next episode thank
you guys so much for watching as always
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
