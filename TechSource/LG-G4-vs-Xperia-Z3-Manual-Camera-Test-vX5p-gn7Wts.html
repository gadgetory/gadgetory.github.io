and welcome to another camera comparison
test video this video is actually highly
requested by you guys which is why I'm
actually doing it and it's no secret
that the Xperia z3 sucks taking photos
and video in auto mode so I wouldn't be
fair
comparing this to the g4 which is why
I'm actually doing a manual camera
comparison test both photos and video
will be done on manual mode on both of
these smartphones so because I'm
shooting in manual mode there's a lot of
different possibilities there are just
so many settings you can go through to
achieve the perfect shot and that varies
from person to person
some people prefer cooler colors and
some people prefer warmer colors but for
the sake of this video I'm actually
going to aim slightly towards the warmer
side and my goal is to achieve the most
accurate color and the sharpest picture
but in order to achieve that I took lots
and lots of photos and videos on each
phone and many different settings and
basically pick the best one to represent
each phone and I put it up against each
other but yeah let's go ahead and see
how well the z3 does in manual mode
compared to the g4 also being shot in
manual mode let's start the video
the twenty two thousand four hundred
million power bank from ICI technology
is the most affordable charger you can
buy in its class you can charge up to
three devices at the same time using the
fastest charging speeds for your device
and it even comes with a built in
flashlight it has an awesome compact
design and comes in several colors click
on the link in the description for more
info alright real quickly before we jump
into the samples here are the camera
specs on both phones the z3 has a twenty
point seven megapixel rear facing camera
with an aperture of 2.0 that can shoot
up to 4k resolution and the g4 has a 16
megapixel camera with an aperture of 1.8
that can also shoot up to 4k resolution
for front-facing cameras the z3 has a
two point two megapixel camera capable
of shooting up to 1080p and the g4 has
an 8 megapixel camera also capable of
shooting up to 1080p so that's it for
the specs let's sit back relax and check
out some samples
so when it comes to auto focusing in
manual mode the g4 has a difficult time
picking up objects
I tried filming in numerous locations
with the same outcome I also notice that
it focuses on the background instead of
the object no matter how close I get to
it so I'm not sure if this is normal on
old g4 or just my model the z3 does a
much better job for the most part at
least it can detect the object most of
the time and focus accurately however
after some time it does give up and keep
the background in focus just like the g4
so the auto focusing feature is
definitely different in manual mode on
both of the phones compared to the auto
mode if this is the same case with your
phone then let me know by dropping a
comment down below to confirm for
daylight 4k video both deliver super
sharp footage the g4 seems to have a lot
more contrast but the colors are more
vibrant with a slightly higher
saturation than the z3 the g4 has a lot
more options when it comes to light
balance you can control it with a dial
whereas the z3 has only four
pre-configured options that you can
select from so I'm gonna give the point
to the g4 for overall better 4k video
quality for low-light video the obvious
point goes to the g4 since the z3 has
trouble focusing at night which results
in blurry footage there's also a lot
more noise on the z3 than the g4 the
clarity just isn't there which is why
the g4 takes the point for low-light
video for the stabilization test both
phones are being filmed in 1080p to
ensure optical image stabilization
remains enabled and they are both
strapped on to a device for a very
accurate stabilization rating from the
footage it's apparent that the z3 has
far better stabilization than the g4 so
the point goes to the z3 for
stabilization what's up guys this is the
front-facing video camera test between
the LG g4 and the Xperia Z
we both of the phones are basically
strapped onto a single device so the
stabilization is very accurate and also
they're both being shot in 1080p
there will be an audio icon somewhere on
the screen and it'll basically tell you
which phone's audio is being used and
also be listening to this on your
headphones you guys can hear the actual
background noise so I'm going to stay
quiet for a bit
for front-facing video the g4 has a much
better dynamic range even though the z3
has HDR enabled the background is still
overexposed whereas the g4 has a nice
balance for microphone audio both sound
loud and crisp the z3 has noticeably
louder background noise but overall both
great microphones they point to the g4
for front-facing video and a point to
both for microphone quality for daylight
pics I was able to get more true-to-life
pictures on the g4 than the z3
the flowers are as red as they appear in
this picture and I couldn't achieve this
using the z3 on manual mode the pictures
are also a lot sharper on the g4 even
though the z3 has more megapixels even
indoors the g4 has more sharper and
clearer images than the z3 yes the g4
does have slightly more saturation but
I'll gladly accept that if it means I
get sharp vibrant and clear pictures one
of the advantages that the g4 has over
the z3 and essentially any smartphone is
complete control of shutter speed with
it you can lower the shutter speed to
allow more light in which means you can
also lower the ISO or sharper and less
noisy pictures the z3 doesn't stand a
chance against the low-light performance
of the g4 I mean look how clear the
images are in the g4 shot compared to
the z3 there's just no competition so
there you have it the g4 is the clear
winner and still remains the champion of
all smartphone cameras you put it into
manual mode and you have yourself a
device that can even compete against
DSLRs honestly though the z3 was pretty
much handicapped from the beginning I
mean even in manual mode the selections
are very limited to configure to get the
shot that you want compared to the g4
just so many more options you can choose
from including the adjustability of the
shutter speed which will get you some
really nice crispy low-light footage
anyways that's it for the video I hope
you guys enjoyed it if you want to see
more manual camera comparisons like this
then definitely hit that like button so
I know to keep doing them I also took
some photos and video in manual mode on
the galaxy s6 and if you want to see
this compared to the g4 in manual mode
as well let me know by dropping a
comment down below but anyways let me
know what you guys think about the
camera comparison thanks again for
watching
this is that and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
