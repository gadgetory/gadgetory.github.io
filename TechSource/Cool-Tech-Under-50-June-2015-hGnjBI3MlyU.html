and welcome to another tech deals video
I basically do these every month on my
channel and I go through Amazon and try
and find the best tech deals and share
with you guys but in this video I'm
actually specifically going to stay on
the topic of PC accessories so with that
said let's go ahead and start the video
first up we have not one but two gaming
mouses from a tech city first up we have
these scroll alpha laser mouse that
features 8 programmable buttons and
comes in a symmetrical form factor which
can be used for both left and right
handed people it has a really cool
ergonomic design and you can configure
it up to 8200 dpi and 1000 Hertz polling
rate the other Gaming Mouse is called
this 6e and it's an optical gaming mouse
that's designed for right-handed users
it features six programmable buttons and
you can also adjust the DPI up to 4000
and the polling rate up to 1000 Hertz so
the Alpha Gaming Mouse has a very
stealthy look to it and it's really
comfortable to use I'm happy to report
that all buttons are in a convenient
location and are really easy to press
you can download its dedicated software
and program any of the eight buttons to
whatever you decide and you can also
change the color of the LED to better
match your theme which is a huge plus so
I spent a few hours gaming on the mouse
and after some quick adjustments on the
sensitivity I started to really enjoy
playing the mouse is pretty large
compared to other gaming mouses so I'm
not sure if this would suit someone with
smaller hands but for my giant hands it
definitely feels natural the 60 also has
its own dedicated software that you can
use to customize the buttons and
sensitivity as well as the LED color
choice but the main difference between
the 6e and the Alpha is that the 60 has
a narrower front side than the Alpha and
two less programmable buttons it also
has a dedicated dpi button which lets
you cycle through the pre-configured
settings while gaming I definitely
noticed a big difference coming from a
Productivity Mouse like the MX master
these masters are designed specifically
for gaming and they will give you a very
accurate response time with no lag at
all for a very low price in fact I will
leave some discount codes in the
description section
if you
are interested in picking one up for
number two we have a microUSB cable but
not just a regular microUSB cable
this one has a built-in lightning cable
for Apple products which makes this an
awesome choice for people that have both
Apple products and devices that use
micro USBs simply snap it together to
create a lightning cable and snap off
the top portion to use it as a micro USB
I also didn't notice any changes in
charging speeds while using this cable
instead of the original cables for
number three we have a USB 3.0 card
reader from transcend I use this
practically every day on the channel for
transferring files for my camera and
recording equipment it's perfect for
those that don't have a built-in SD card
reader in their laptop or PC it has a
slot for both regular SD card and
microSD card as well and simply plug it
into your USB port and slide in the SD
card and you are ready to go because
it's USB 3.0 you get the fastest
transfer speeds which is perfect if you
have lots of large files to transfer at
once at number four we have the Audio
Technica headphone hanger this is a
pretty cool accessory to clean up your
overall desk look and it works on any
headphones there is a notch on the
hanger that you can adjust depending on
a thickness of your desk and a knob
where you can tighten up after
installation it's really sturdy and can
support up to 1,000 grams of weight so
it should hold even the most heavy
headphones out there the best part about
this hanger is that you can rotate it to
a full 360 degrees and keep it from
sticking out from the side of your desk
last but not least we have a foldable
wireless keyboard from ICI technology
it's a bluetooth pocket-sized keyboard
that's compatible with iOS Android and
Windows operating systems it's made out
of aluminum which contributes to its
super light point four pounds weight and
it also features a built-in rechargeable
battery which will provide more than 60
hours of effective usage time on a
single charge
the fact that it can be folded makes it
the ideal keyboard for traveling as you
can see it fits inside my shorts without
any problems the keys on the other hand
are very comfortable and the distance
between each key press is short and
responsive it's also really easy to pair
up with your device just simply open up
the keyboard and press the FN key and
then
the C key which will then begin the
pairing setup then get your Bluetooth
capable device and connect to the
keyboard via these settings typing on
the keyboard is easy and I didn't notice
any lag at all
however the keys are a lot closer to
each other than I prefer it was a bit
inconvenient to type on because I have
such large hands but after a few minutes
I did get used to it although I wouldn't
recommend anyone with large hands typing
an essay on it as you can get pretty
annoying anyways that's it for the video
I hope you guys enjoyed it if you want
me to continue doing these series then
definitely let me know by leaving a like
on the video but anyways thanks again
for watching this is that from tech
Soares I will see you guys in the next
video
