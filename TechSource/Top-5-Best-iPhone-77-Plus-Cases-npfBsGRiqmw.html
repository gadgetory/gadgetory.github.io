iPhone 7 plus and now you're looking for
a case to protect it well you came to
the right place so I looked through
Amazon the past few days and handpicked
five of the best cases that got my
attention all of these cases are
compatible with both the iPhone 7 and 7
plus and as always you guys can find
them link below for anyone that's
interested but let's say you're not a
case guy and prefer to keep the phone as
thin as possible
well then skins might be your best
answer the one I have on my note 7 is
from the brands and this is the new
concrete material but they do have a
bunch of different materials available
especially for the iPhone 7 and 7 plus
so make sure to check them out by
visiting the first link below if you're
interested alright so first up we have
the ex Toria which is the most expensive
case in this video coming in at $35 and
that's because the bumper is made out of
anodized aluminum this is actually a
two-part case there's a tiny latch on
the lower left that needs to be removed
in order to slide out the polycarbonate
shell the volume buttons are made out of
metal which is nice however it does
require some extra force to press down
the cutouts are also nice and large near
the vibrate switch as well as the bottom
for the Lightning port and speakers I
didn't find any issues docking the
iPhone on my charging stand so safe to
say that it's compatible with most
third-party accessories I do like the
tactile material near the back of the
case and it actually has a carbon fiber
version as well I also appreciate the
fact that it comes with a raised lip on
the front to protect the face of the
camera on flat surfaces overall it's a
very solid case and it's actually my
favorite out of the five in this video I
just wish the buttons were just a little
bit easier to press moving to my second
favorite case in this video the spigen
slim Armour series with a card holder in
the back this case is perfect for anyone
that hates carrying around a wallet most
of you guys know that I've been rocking
my damn de Vera's case for the past year
on my 6s plus and I absolutely love it
this case is also very similar in terms
of the card storage if you choose a
slidable door which has enough space for
up to two cards comfortably however if
you don't mind the extra bulk adding a
third card is definitely possible it
does add a bit of bulk to the overall
phone but that's to be expected the
aeroshell is made out of flexible TPU
and it kind of contours the shape of the
phone with round
the cadets are also large enough that it
doesn't interfere with most third party
charging dogs and the buttons are very
easy to press however reaching the
vibrates which may require some extra
work since it's kind of recessed in
there
my third favorite case from this video
is from silk and it's also a card holder
but without a slidable door however with
this you can fit up to four cards
instead I do like the material of this
case it's very grippy especially on both
sides of the phone so I accidentally
order the seven plus version without
owning a 7 plus so I'm going to use my
6s plus for the demonstration one thing
I noticed is that it doesn't really
offer a raised lip so I would be extra
cautious laying it face first on a flat
surface other than that the buns are
very easy to press and once again the
cutouts are large enough even for most
third party accessories next up we have
the Zizou bolt that comes in a bunch of
different colors in this case is made
for people that want the most protection
for their iPhone for only $18 you get a
screen shield lanyard a holster belt
clip and a kickstand it's also the
bulkiest case in this video it has a
fairly noticeable raised lip to protect
the front of the phone and although it
does feel somewhat unnatural in the hand
due to the design in the back it
definitely offers a good grip combined
now with the optional lanyard and
keyring and this phone won't be leaving
your hands that easily the buttons are
also fairly easy to press and the
cutouts are large enough for most third
party accessories the kickstand is a
nice feature to prop up the phone and
either vertical or landscape mode when
watching movies and the added the
holster clip is perfect for people that
don't like carrying their phones in
their pockets for having a bunch of
accessories included and rated 5 stars
on Amazon it's hard to believe that this
case is only 18 bucks last but not least
we have a very simple case for my
minimalistic users out there this is
pretty much a clear TPU case that offers
protection without covering the
beautiful design of the iPhone 7 it also
features a magnetic kickstand if you
guys really want to show off a skin on
your phone and want protection at the
same time then picking up this case will
be your best bet who says you can't have
the best of both worlds but other than
that there's really nothing special
about this case the buttons are
extremely easy to press cutouts are nice
and large and it will get the job done
protecting your
but if you guys want a clear case
without the kickstand then I'll drop a
link to that as well if you guys enjoyed
this video and are feeling super nice
dropping a like wouldn't mean the world
to me as always thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
