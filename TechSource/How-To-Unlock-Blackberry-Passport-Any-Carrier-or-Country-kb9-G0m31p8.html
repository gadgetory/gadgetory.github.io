to show you the process of unlocking
your BlackBerry passport so you can use
it with any carrier or country for this
demonstration I will be using my locked
AT&amp;amp;T blackberry passport and unlock it
so I can use it on my t-mobile network
but you can use this video as a guide
for any carrier so first off we need to
get the unlock code to start the
unlocking process one of the best and
most trusting websites that I used to
get my lock codes is the unlocking
company comm because the prices are
unbeatable and their customer service is
the best in the market so head on over
to the unlocking company comm and select
your phone manufacturer and the phone
model from the drop-down list and on the
next page go ahead and select the
country the phone was originally
purchased from and the carrier of the
phone in my case I purchased it in the
United States and the original carrier
is 80 MT so before we continue we do
need the IMEI number of the phone and
the way you look that up on your phone
is to open up the dial pad and enter in
star pound zero six pounds once the
phone displays the IMEI number you have
to go back on the website and enter that
in once everything is filled out so
let's get unlocking code and that will
take you to the final screen where you
have to check out after checking out
they will email you the unlock code the
price and delivery time of your code
varies by phone but don't worry because
the prices are the cheapest in the
market than any other unlocking website
once you receive your unlock code from
the locking company com it's time to
unlock your phone all you have to do is
swipe down from the main screen and
click on mobile network once you're in
that menu select SIM card settings which
will then give you the option to unlock
your network so from here all you have
to do is enter in the hola code that you
received from the locking company and
after submitting the code a prompt will
show up stating that the code was
successful that means that your phone is
permanently unlocked and ready to go
as you can see here I'm using my AT&amp;amp;T
blackberry Passport
on my t-mobile network so that's how you
unlock your BlackBerry passport if this
video helped you out please hit that
like button and if you have any
questions at all feel free to leave them
in the comment section and I will
respond as soon as possible this is that
from tech source and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
