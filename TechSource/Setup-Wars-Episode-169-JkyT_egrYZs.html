haven't submitted your setups for setup
wars what are you doing with your life
in case you guys haven't noticed I've
been doing setup wars every single
Monday which means I've been catching up
on the submissions I'm currently doing
the month of March which is only like
two months behind so once I catch up
there's not gonna be a setup wars
episodes because there's no more
submissions to go through so if you're
watching this video and you haven't
already submitted photos for your setup
please watch the video linked below to
find out how to enter it's very simple
all I'm looking for are just very high
quality pictures that made no sense I'm
looking for high quality pictures so
make sure there's plenty of light all
that stuff is in the description section
many ways what that said welcome to
setup wars episode 169 a lot of you guys
I've been waiting for that episode I'm
sure in the comments section you guys
are gonna go crazy anyways welcome to
setup 169 let the setup wars begin
the coarser iron claw RGB wireless
gaming mouse features a powerfully
precise optical gaming sensor with
18,000 dpi and 10 fully programmable
buttons allowing you to customize the
way you play with powerful macros and
kiri maps the ergonomic contoured shape
is sculpted specifically for palm grips
and large hands and with corsair sub 1
millisecond wireless technology you can
ditch the cable without any compromises
check the link below for more info
kicking off the episode is Brandon from
Kansas and this white beam setup
featuring two 27-inch monitors from Asus
that he hooked up on the wall and that
piece of string running down the wall is
actually hooked up to his VR headset
which is hanging on a pulley system this
way he doesn't trip on the wires when
he's moving around while using the VR
system very clever
I've actually only seen this one other
time in a previous episode keeping with
the white on black color scheme you got
the corsair k70 se keyboard which is the
one I'm using currently and he's got the
Razer
Mamba tournament Edition Mouse which is
being supported by the Zowie Mouse
bungee for audio he's got the HyperX
cloud flight headsets and a set of
speakers from Ariane I think as I've
said now since the speakers are tall he
didn't have any extra space on the desk
for them so he placed them on the
shelves which isn't the best place to
put them but I guess he wanted to
squeeze his giant PC on the desk he also
has a blue snowball microphone mounted
to a boom arm but I feel like it gets in
the way I would try and mount the boom
arm on the actual monitor mount if
possible to give you a better angle this
is his first ever water-cooled build so
don't judge him on the bends I think
actually came out really nice with that
sexy distribution block and the chrome
fittings not to mention the specs this
thing is packing some serious heat or a
coolness
I guess it's got the 9900 K 32 gigs of
ram and the r-tx 20 80 TI founders
edition beautiful PC and a pretty good
setup for gaming streaming and
schoolwork Thank You Brandon for
entering next up is Mufasa from Canada
and his RGB gaming setup every time I
see three monitors I'm hoping the user
for more than just gaming it doesn't
matter how nice it looks in any setup
because it's always overkill thankfully
in most office case
uses it for video editing as well since
the desk is made out of glass he's not
able to drill a hole for the keyboard
and mouse and he didn't want to run the
cables straight across so instead he ran
them towards the right side I would have
least tied the cables together using zip
tie or velcro there wasn't much else on
the desk other than some Funko pops and
has blue Yeti microphone that's mounted
on the edge of the desk there are no
speakers for the setup so he relies on
his G 933 headset that's chilling on the
bench next to his PC which is kind of
tucked away in the corner over there
it's not the best looking PC with all
those cables hanging out so I don't mind
it being tucked away but it does pack a
nice punch with a 77 decay and the gtx
1060 the cables inside the pc may not be
attractive to look at but thankfully the
rest of the cables from the setup our
hidden using the Signum rack i do want
to know one thing though and that is
where on earth did you get that dope RGB
lighting for the wall if anyone knows
what that is please hit me up in the
comment section that thing looks sick
but yeah it's a decent gaming and
productivity setup Thank You Mostafa for
sharing it with us coming out number
three from Switzerland is Patrick Starr
and his creative and super overkill
gaming setup between three a lien where
thirty four inch ultra wide monitors and
we also got a 35 inch ultra light up top
now what's creative about this desk is
the backboard that he built to mount the
monitors onto and you actually built
that wall onto the sit and stand ask
meaning he can move the entire thing up
or down he did it this way because he
didn't want to keep the monitors on the
desk and I think it came out really nice
the only suggestion I have is painting
the backboard and white or maybe adding
some skins or a wallpaper so that it
matches your desk because the would look
kind of ruined the aesthetic of your
setup keyboard and mouse are both in
Logitech and I gotta say I'm surprised
that you didn't drill a hole for the
wires since everything else is pretty
much modded where audio is rocking a
pair of Logitech G 560 speakers and the
two full cage headphones on even how you
say that which are stored in an
interesting location underneath a desk
it just seems like it's a little out of
reach however I do like how he mounted
the rest of the stuff under the desk
like the Nintendo switch with a docking
station and in the middle he hooked up
his audio jacks for his headset so that
he can connect them easily without
having to reach for his PC
very nice the boom arm holding his world
empty microphone is tucked away behind
one of the monitors and unfortunately so
is the PC it's got a 7700 with 32 gigs
of RAM and B gigabyte r-tx 20 80 TI
cables are managed beautifully behind
the back board and he even made some
cutouts in the desk to route the cables
for the speaker's everything else is
pretty much flawless it's just missing a
paint job or some skins on that back
board but other than that a beautifully
executed setup Thank You Patrick
for entering also say hi to spongebob
for me Ryan from Philly makes a comeback
from episode 1 49 with a slightly
improved setup my inner geek always
comes out every time I see Final Fantasy
related stuff but anyways back to the
setup so he's still rocking three of his
monitors that are hooked up on the walls
and above that we got a wall shelf of
pokemon collectibles I'm kidding guys
relaxed I feel like I have to always say
I'm joking when I say stuff like that
because there are a lot of people
triggered in the comments section always
obviously these are Gundam Wing models
still using the same keyboard and mouse
with the corsair RGB mouse pad one thing
that is new however are the nano leaf
panels above his setup he also replaced
the storage container underneath the
desk with a refrigerator and swapped out
a few other miscellaneous tech in fact
here is a picture of his old set up some
things removed around new posters and
skins on the consoles over there on the
right side with the addition of the wall
mount for the controller's kayo
management also looks improved with the
addition of a USB hub and looks like we
have the same PC from before only it's a
lot cleaner I think it's great you went
with a unique color scheme because I
don't see many black and orange setups
on the show I mean after all it isn't an
attractive color but regardless Thank
You Brandon for coming back on the show
wrapping up the episode as will from
Australia and a super clean triple
monitor setup so he's 16 years old and
he uses the setup for gaming graphic
design schoolwork and sometimes he does
bring in his racing gear we had a single
ultra light in the middle being
sandwiched by two 27-inch BenQ monitors
great choice mounting the ultra white on
the wall because this way he has extra
space underneath it for the speakers and
other gear I don't know if the wall
shelves were necessary for the other two
speakers since they could have easily
fit underneath the monitors but I guess
that's nice to have
I do love that to drill two separate
holes for the keyboard and the mouse
with a mousepad even the rest of the
cables are managed well with the cable
clips and zip ties it looks like on the
right side we got the PC powering the
setup and it's got some pretty good
specs you got these 6,700 with the gtx
1070 I personally would have gone with
the 67 GK to take advantage of that
cooler you have but if you're not gonna
overclock it then it makes sense to go
with the non K CPU but that's pretty
much it here very clean and organized
for a 60 year old this is actually a
pretty badass setup think you will for
entering and as I put this episode up
setup or is as always make sure you guys
vote in the comments section on who has
the best desk setup as always you guys
enjoy the show make sure to toss a like
or dislike
I'll have your beautiful faces and I
will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
