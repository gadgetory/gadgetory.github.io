and today we're gonna be taking a look
at the radio on our x4a this is one of
the three new graphics cards from AMD
using the Polaris architecture which is
built on a 14 nanometer FinFET
technology this basically gives the GPU
nearly double the transistors to play
with in the same area as 28 nanometer
technology resulting in higher clock
speeds more power efficiency and more
performance per watt AMD is claiming
that their new radio rx series will
deliver on the promises of gaming and VR
for everyone
in terms of specs the R X 480 comes in 4
and 8 gigabyte variants with gddr5
memory the model I have in this video is
the API variant with a memory speed of 8
gigabits per second it also comes out of
the box with a bass and boost clock of
1120 and 12 66 megahertz respectively as
mentioned before this is one of the
three new cards from AMD with the
aurochs 470 and the RX 460 being
released at a later time
in terms of aesthetics there really
isn't anything attractive about the card
I mean it's essentially a black
rectangular block with a blower design
no additional backplate sexy curves or
even fancy LEDs I mean after all the
starting price is only $1.99 I'm
actually more interested to see what the
board partners would do with the overall
design when you compare a card like the
GT X 1080 you can really see how small
the RX 480 is the height is practically
the same however it's much shorter and
with measuring about 9.5 inches in terms
of Io you get one HDMI 2.0 B and three
display ports which are 1.3 HP are three
and one point four HD are ready the RX
480 also features AMD freesync so if you
have a free sync monitor or are planning
to get one then you will be able to
enjoy your games free of tearing and
stuttering another new software being
introduced as AMD's new overclocking
utility called the Radeon Whatman that
gives you control of the GPUs voltage
clock speeds temperature and fan speeds
you can either fine-tune your GPU for
each specific game through the utility
or set a global overclock regardless of
the game you're playing for the
benchmark test I am using my primo chill
test bench that has a 59 30 K that's
overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz 16 gigs of
Jesus
and a be quiet dark rock pro3 cooler all
packed on the asus strix
x99 gaming motherboard for temps the RX
480 would hover around 38 degrees
Celsius whereas it would max out at 85
degrees during full load to power to GPU
you would only need a single 6 pin PCI
connector and for power consumption the
entire system would peak at 3 or 5 watts
on some benchmarks or as it would
constantly hit 280 watts on average at
full load and finally during idle the
system would use up only 130 watts the
card is also fairly quiet even during
full load I could barely hear the fans
spinning
all right so moving on to the benchmarks
which I'm sure is the reason why a lot
of you guys are here unfortunately I
didn't have a gtx 960 or 970 on hand so
instead i compared the RX 4 80 against
the gtx 1080 1070 and the r9 380 which
is currently the same price as the RX
480 so let's go ahead and do this
so there you have it very impressive
numbers from the RX 480
although it won't bring you 4k content
that's playable it will surely keep you
satisfied for 1080p and even quad HD
given that you tweak the settings a bit
the RX 480 outright destroyed the r9 380
seeing an average of 20 to 30 percent
increase in fps performance this means
that we will most likely see price drops
on some of AMD's budget and mid-range
graphics cards based on the quad HD
benchmarks the RX 4 80 has the best bang
for your buck with a score of 5.21
without a doubt the RX 480 is the GPU to
buy if you have a budget of around 200
bucks
I'm not done playing with the RX 4 80
just yet I have a bunch of comparisons
coming up as well as an RX 480 crossfire
build in July so make sure you guys are
subscribed if you don't want to miss out
as always if you guys enjoy these types
of videos make sure to leave a like and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
