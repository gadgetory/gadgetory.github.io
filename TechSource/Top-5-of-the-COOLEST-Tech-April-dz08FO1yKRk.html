click on the screen or the link below
for more info what's up you guys that
said from tech source and I'm kind of
taking a break from all the smart phone
videos I've been doing recently and in
this video I'm just gonna share with you
the five coolest tech products that I
found with the past few weeks so I'm
gonna start from the bottom number five
and move my way up to the number one
coolest product that I found if you guys
enjoy the series definitely let me know
by leaving a like and a comment down
below but other than that let's go ahead
and start the video okay so starting off
with number five we have chordbuddy and
this is basically a cable holder with a
motion sensor nightlight it comes in
four different colors and has a pretty
cool design that also costs only 20
bucks so basically the lights will light
up when it detects motion near the
device which basically helps you find
your smartphone or even help with
grabbing the right cable it does have
only three spots unfortunately so if you
have more cables than this then it
probably won't work out for you another
downside to this product is that it
requires two double-a batteries which
isn't even included with the package
although I'm pretty sure they did this
to eliminate the device from having
extra cables sticking out of it by the
way I will leave links to all the
products in the description section if
you want to check them out number four
we have the you board monitor standby
you talked SIA and this is a really cool
fancy looking glass monitor stand that
can easily clean up the look of your
desk it cost around 40 bucks depending
on the color and it comes with either
black or white stands with the option of
having a black tinted glass instead of
the usual clear glass not only is it a
stand but it also comes with three
built-in USB 2.0 ports on the side with
an optional cup holder and a smartphone
holder now those do come with a stand
however it is optional and you can
decide not to install them if you don't
want to as far as clearance is concerned
you get twenty one point six inches of
length eight point two inches of width
and three point three inches in height
it can also support up to 20 pounds of
weights which should be enough for large
monitors and full size laptops now if
glass isn't
thing there's a slightly cheaper version
from citta she called the f1 stand and
this one comes in either black or white
and has four USB ports along with an
audio microphone port as well and can
hold up to 22 pounds so slightly more
than the you board the dimensions are
also similar with the option of
adjusting its height by an inch if you
want more clearance underneath for the
third spot we have the cell yuan epic
key word here is epic ultra portable
full-size virtual keyboard that doubles
as a multi-touch Mouse now we'll see a
bunch of concepts of virtual keyboards
but this is the real thing surprisingly
with very positive reviews so it is a
bit pricey but what you get is
essentially a portable keyboard that you
can take anywhere with you it's
compatible with iOS Android Mac OS X 10
and above along with Windows and
BlackBerry 10 devices it is connected
with bluetooth and features a 660
million lithium battery that's
rechargeable and I also gave you three
full days of use the only downside to
this product is that you need a flat
solid surface to type on it doesn't work
on glass or other surfaces also there's
a learning curve you don't get the same
response when hitting a key like you do
on a keyboard so you have to rely on the
sound effects from the device to
acknowledge that you have pressed the
key another thing is the response time
it will never be as fast and efficient
as an actual keyboard because the sensor
has to pick up what key you are pressing
and process it so using it for gaming or
editing would be a disaster however if
you want a keyboard just for typing that
you can fit in your pocket and I think
you will enjoy this product for number
two we have the arm one levitating
Bluetooth speaker this has actually been
successfully crowdfunded and it's
basically the world's first levitating
bluetooth speaker it cost around 200
bucks which is kind of pricey and it
comes in either black or white and
pre-orders start shipping in May or June
of this year
actually order this last year in August
when it was still fresh and I'm still
waiting for my device to arrive and I'll
definitely be doing an unboxing and
review of it once I get my hands on it
but nonetheless it deserves to be number
2 on my list because of its innovative
design I mean it's a floating speaker
what else do you see this the m1 gets
you 12 hours of continuous play and up
to 33 feet of wireless range the speaker
even has a built-in microphone so you
can accept calls and talk on it but one
of the coolest features I think on
speaker is the fact that you can steal
your pair another arm one speaker
together and have a little surround
sound set up for your videos which i
think is cool as far as the sound
quality of the audio I can't really tell
because I don't have the unit on hand
but make sure you guys stick around for
a video on that once I get it all right
so the number one most interesting tech
product goes to the ring doorbell it is
the world's first and only
battery-operated Wi-Fi enabled HD video
doorbell system that you can control
with your smartphone or tablet
regardless of where you are in the world
you can choose to power the doorbell
using a built in rechargeable battery
that's rated to last up to a year or you
can power it using your existing
doorbell wires and you won't have to
worry about recharging it so the ring
doorbell features a 720p HD wide-angle
lens and it captures every activity
detected by its motion sensors which
makes this an amazing video surveillance
product as well you can adjust the zones
and range of the motion detector as well
as the frequency at which the app
notifies you when it detects motion when
someone presses the doorbell or if the
ring detects movement you will receive a
notification and you will be given an
option for a live video feed so you can
check out and communicate with anyone on
the other end it also has night vision
so you're covered when the Sun Goes Down
but I think that the best feature about
the ring is the fact that it records and
stores the footage on a cloud so you can
view them whenever you want through the
app on your smartphone or tablet so the
ring has a few faceplate color options
and it goes for 200 bucks but if you use
the code in the description section you
can get $20 off the total price if you
