right now they're taking requests on
their new 35 inch curved gaming monitor
that features a 2 millisecond response
time 100 Hertz refresh rate and a 34 40
by 1440p VA panel with free sync the
monitor is rocking a VA panel which is
known for their high contrast ratio
deeper blacks and virtually zero light
bleed it's also great for productivity
with srgb coverage of a hundred percent
I'm surprised they're able to pack in
all these awesome features in an ultra
wide gaming monitor for only five
hundred and fifty dollars so if you guys
want to grab one at this price make sure
to visit the link below to reserve one
because if it comes back in the future
it's gonna cost a bit more so okay guys
we have another problem so the H 110 I
by the way I've never put that radiator
in this case in an NZXT s340 before it's
a 2 80 millimeter radiator it is too
long it does not fit in this case it
doesn't align with the fans or the holes
so we're going back to the original H
100 IV - we're gonna put that in there
and then have to reapply the thermal
paste the third time so how's your
experience so far building with building
with TechStars ok so this one has
thermal paste we're gonna have to wipe
this off again it's for CPU that's
really clean I'm sorry I'm sorry the
real the real thing is if the PC will
boot if that doesn't happen that's a
different issue right there I have
confidence that I've confidence so even
despite all the things going on going
wrong we're gonna get a post it's the
last thing I do if not I might throw
this red camera out the window and you
guys you guys he'll see that all right
let's mount this babe
sneaked it alright you ready to go okay
stop okay say I think you're in keep
going yeah that's it okay good good
yeah to drink the isopropyl losing my
mind you know what it is I haven't had a
proper breakfast at a freakin Smuckers I
think I can fish Elysees we're halfway
done what the PC build I don't know how
long this video is gonna be and I
apologize it's like if it's like a
50-minute video but I will try and edit
it and make it as short as possible
maybe 30 minutes 30 minutes you said it
not me
and with that said would you do the
honors of applying that thermal paste at
third time it right here right we did
just pre play throw facex oh there is oh
my god all right put throw this thing
away so we don't like touch it ever
again so I know we're in zst is like to
make sure you line it with the holes so
everything's good what is the next step
unlock the next step is to screw in the
stuff screwing the motherboard by the
way if you guys are wondering why
there's more lighting now the sun's kind
of setting down so we brought in studio
lighting some of that is wise image is
different so now we're gonna hook up his
964 m dot - this is a 512 gigabyte and
that to SSD inside the motherboard and I
think I'm gonna hook up the rest of the
storage yep next and then pop on the
cooler and move on to the other stuff so
here we go you can do the honors your
assumption is correct
there we go very delicate operation
right here you gotta lower this down
make sure you have the angle correct
however you want to position it
technically if you really want you can
twist it more and make it right side up
but it's up to you you can keep it that
way yeah solid perfect
okay now actually let's do this let's
connect the fans first so do you know
what he's connect to right here so let's
let's take a look at the connectors
there's two of these what is perfect but
which fans are we connecting are you
sure because this is this is from
because it's coming from the cooler
right yeah that's right here two fans on
it perfect so let's grab those now
here's another one that's coming
straight from the pump all right over
the bracket so where does this one
connect to this is gonna make Unit two
like right here on the motherboard okay
what is it labeled usually I'll give you
some options there is the CPU fan
chassis spam or the pump CPU fan CPU fan
but it's just a fan know it's nice to be
your fan there it's gonna be the pump
because this is what's gonna wear this
was running the radiator this is gonna
be a CPU fan because these are the fans
that's technically holiness CPU some
motherboards don't have a label pump so
we can just technically plug it into the
the CP now what is the next step
alright the next step is to install the
hard drives and the SSDs beautiful
that's exactly what I was thinking
so grab yes is deep we have two hard
drives over here you know what's funny
guys look the two terabyte hard drive is
thicker than the four terabyte hard
drives well this was the Barracuda Pro
technically so I'm guessing because of
the brand line that's interesting
leave that thickness of it
before we slide in actually let's
connect the connectors because it's
gonna be hard to reach oh did you put in
the front we're nearing the end guys I'm
hoping you enjoying the video so far
this is a hell of an experience for me
too
this is the first time all right this is
never been open so edit since you're the
master of like a box things I think you
should unbox it I'm the master of
unboxings alright I'll take it up take
it let's do it yeah love that feeling
get out of here alright first thing you
want to do is pop open that and you're
gonna smell it it's sweet smell of PSU
we have also three power supplies so
what tables do we need for that I mean
three power supplies okay we have three
hard drives oh I can't I can't even
I'm losing my mind we have two hard
drives and one SSD so what cables do we
need for that okay so we need some SATA
cables and we need okay so for the power
how many what do we need for the power
to power the two drives and the ones
data so one SSD oh we just need like
three so so beating this is enough yeah
that's enough but I don't think this is
not gonna reach it like it's an
overreach right there so this will reach
both the hard drives but that says these
not gonna make you right yep so we'll
need we need sadly we're gonna have to
use two of these which is gonna be a lot
of cables to work with so which ones
that for
VGA what does that mean like what is
that for that's for the work try again
what is the V stand for video beautiful
good job actually you can always tell by
just plugging it in if it doesn't fit in
it doesn't belong there so what is that
for that is for like the molex okay like
what is that plug-in you can always use
another tip you can always read what's
located what's written on the actual
connector what does it say / if this is
/ if on here and it says / if on the
connector so that's one of the easy ways
to figure out where to connect it so
we're having an issue with the red
scarlet they'll believe you keep getting
this message pop up on the screen where
it says that it cannot mount the media
in the SSD and it's annoying the crap
out of me
I've literally started this thing like
three times and I pop this in and out
like 20 times already and it's driving
me crazy
I've never ran into so many problems on
a camera before so here it is attempt
well of course of course we just start
recording it it works out I'm like what
the hell all right so now we're gonna be
installing we're gonna hook up the SSD
I'm gonna hook up all the cables and I'm
gonna pop in the power supply but before
that actually I have a little surprise
for you which is gonna make this build
pop a little bit more so I was looking
upstairs and I got a few extra tubes for
the cables leaving because I feel like
there's a little too much black in here
and we need some read some green accents
to really pop the build
yeah just 200 black yeah so I think
that's gonna look really sick and it's
gonna make it pop unless you want a golf
build a cop build yeah so let's put
those just put those on first before you
move on
that looks that looks clean let's get
that on the cat right there
very nice super clean super nice and
everything so I'm gonna feed the feet of
power supply through just hold onto the
cables all right I'll pull the cables
from inside
oh my gosh my cables pull them out
slowly its lightest and all right
beautiful
now comes the fun part connecting all
the cables together and then the final
thing is the GPU but before you put that
interview got to make sure all the
cables are connected to the right spot
what do you think it will cabl this is
this is admit for the HDMI I believe so
HDMI and then this is meant for like the
USBs USB what hubs actually you must be
number on three three there it is that's
the magic number alright let's do this
ladies and gentlemen we are finally at
the last step we are gonna be plugging
in the EVGA GTX 1080 into the PC and the
big climax of the build will it turn on
has the question here all our hard work
literally we've been building this thing
for like three four hours I think so it
better freakin turn on otherwise I told
you guys I'm putting the red camera out
the window so do the honor please and
open up the 1080 just don't rip the box
all right
remove the foam there it is ooh very
nice the seal is still on this GPU it's
been sitting in his room for a month
guys waiting to be opens Wow let's let's
do the honors of peeling the plastic
music to my ears the best one goes in
the back a backplate
beautiful all right okay now for the
moment of truth yeah nice I heard a snap
in
okay now let's pop it in the screws yeah
laughs screw you guys
there it is
nice
so it has given me this oh well he was
gone upstairs so thank you so much ed
for everything
this really means so much to me and the
final piece is the back plate I think
this is I think this is like your big is
it yeah that yeah that was for the Titan
X yeah because res ox is using to you oh
well okay they ask you how you say that
you're fine you're not really so moment
of truth guys everything's finally
hooked up
Slytherin which is the name of the PC is
calling it is looking beautiful than
ever
the only thing left to do is turn it on
and see if it works so we were praying
to the PC gods after all the trouble you
went through applying federal page three
damn time swap in the cooler three damn
times I think it's time to pop it in do
the honors count down one two three
count up Oh does it post take a look at
the monogram pray
oh my god motherboard baby yeah oh no
I'm dying I'm just kidding that's some
crumpled screen very nice dude where
congratulations with you that's the shot
again there we go there we go there you
nicely beautiful
very quiet come closer is you can hear
this we're gonna change those colors to
green obviously right yeah I'm gonna
change the courser logo we're gonna get
those static green and it's gonna look
like a beast PC wait oh so this is like
our TV right here
yeah that's RGB I didn't know that until
I had to deal with that forever no no aw
I think don't quote me you can change
the colors I better video on it
all right on the stick we have Windows
10 we're gonna be hooking this up cuz
doesn't have a CD drive we're gonna
install Windows do we have the windows
CD key yes Oh even comes with the USB
stick on here so we don't even need this
this is awesome so yeah it's gonna load
up guys we're gonna fast-forward through
the setup process we're gonna get to
Windows desktop and then from there
we're gonna install drivers and all that
good stuff but am I gonna show you guys
all that stuff anyways fast forwarding
to the end I'll see you guys soon so I
found an RGB strip upstairs and I
noticed that has an RGB header on the
motherboard so I'm gonna plug this in
and see if it actually works because
I'll be the icing on the cake so I'll
plug this thing oh this thing is also
magnetic so it's perfect doesn't have
any Dehesa if it doesn't have any you
won't have any residue when you peel it
off so it was perfect someone plug this
in up oh we got a baby I'm gonna pop
this in the top that is gorgeous right
there that's beautiful they don't work
on the cable of course but that looks
really nice so I think that pretty much
wraps up the bill guys all my rather the
