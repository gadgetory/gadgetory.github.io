Twitter and I stated that I wanted to do
a collab with smaller channels anywhere
between five thousand subscribers and a
hundred thousand and I got over 50
submissions so basically I wanted to
pick nine of the first people that sent
me an email and here we are so yes this
is gonna be a new series I will try and
aim and do it at least once a month
we'll see how this goes but the point of
this is to basically help out smaller
tech channels to get some exposure I did
something like this months ago with
keyboards but I'm trying to make this a
series on the channel I for one know how
difficult it is to grow a channel
especially a tech channel when I started
out it was just it was really difficult
I can only imagine how difficult it is
now just just I think YouTube is just
oversaturated with tech channels and I
feel like this this series is definitely
gonna help those smaller channels get
some exposure maybe get some momentum
going that's one of the reasons I
actually started set up or is youtuber
edition to kind of get some exposure on
those small YouTube channels but
eventually the series died because I
wasn't getting any more submissions so
here's the new series in order to help
smaller channels succeed so for this
first episode we'll be focusing on the
mice that we use whether it's for gaming
or productivity now guys it's really
easy to make a 1 minute long video on a
product there's so much you can do with
60 seconds but if you cut that in half
to 30 seconds that in itself is a
challenge so this entire new series is
basically gonna be 30 seconds for each
person that basically collabs with me
guys I will have a link to everyone's
channels linked down below in the order
that you see them so if you like what
you see consider checking their channel
out and maybe even consider subscribing
if you guys like the content I produce
that's basically let's let's not waste
any more time and start the show I hope
you guys enjoy what's up guys Matthew
mon is here and this is the SteelSeries
rival 100 gaming mouse it retails for
about 30 bucks it's an ambidextrous
mouse so it works with your right or
left hand and it comes in a pretty small
form-factor so it's not too small it's
not too big it's just the right size it
caters to all three grip styles palm
claw and fingertips so it's not a racist
mouse it doesn't discriminate but the
main reason I bought it is for traveling
it's a good size I can edit video with
it and when I have some downtime
I can own some noobs and overwatch so if
you're looking for a portable
comfortable non-racist gaming mouse that
check this one out you really can't go
wrong for 30 bucks thanks edy for having
me on and I'll see you guys in another
video
yeah I'm Brian p from bad seat tech and
what's really good my daily driver
gaming mouse is the razer deathadder
chroma it's got a crazy responsive
sensor really snappy Omron switches on
the buttons but the star of this show
is the shape where those sessions get
long and the action gets hard I just
grip this big black mother I mean it's a
really comfortable gaming mouse that's
why it's my daily driver
what thanks so much for let me be a part
of the video and everybody else come
check out the channel my daily driver
Mouse is an rog spatha it's a very big
mouse and at the same time it's also
very expensive it's a wireless RGB mouse
with a bunch of buttons and features so
what about ergonomics well at first it
seemed too big to even be comfortable
but I gotta say after a couple of days
it feels great that is my daily driver
mouse please go ahead and click that
link in the video description and
hopefully subscribe what's going on
everyone is capping your f---ing
ultimate egg Thank You ed for having me
on your show my mouse of choice is a lot
of Czech MX master
I was this mouse for productivity and
for editing as I find it extremely
comfortable to use over an extended
period of time and I also really love
the horizontal scrolling wheel as it
really speeds up my workflow to quickly
go through my timeline that's it for me
though I hope to catch you guys on my
channel and I'll hopefully see you guys
in the next video bye hey guys
tuck him here so for the mouth I use
daily I use the Razer Ouroboros because
it is a fantastic mast particularly for
gamers it's one of the high-end gaming
mouses costing 150 US dollars but what
you get is a great design and the
buttons are very satisfying to clipping
it also comes with a charging dock for
your mouse when using the wireless
feature and customization is key on the
Ouroboros as there are interchangeable
side panels and the mouse can also
adjust to suit your hand perfectly
overall our voice is a great mouse to
have and I hope to see some of you guys
over on my channel peace the Logitech m5
10 is my mouse of choice for surfing
editing and why
it's a no-frills wireless mouse that has
your classing layout with forward and
back buttons or makes it a winner though
is how comfortable it is even over
extended usage but it's also small
enough to throw and store into my bag
the rubber-coated sides feel great to
hold and really help with maneuvering
but the comp has a glossy finish that
easily catches breeze when you're eating
or doing whatever else you'd like to do
at night along with the two year rated
battery life it's an overall budget
friendly comfortable and reliable Mouse
on the go hey guys my name is Anton and
the mouse I use for all my everyday
tasks video editing and gaming is the
logitech g502 organ omix is great on the
502 it's mostly good for a claw or
hybrid grip it has six macro buttons
that you can easily program in
Logitech's well-developed gaming
software all the buttons are Omron
switches with a 20 million click rating
the scroll wheel also has a super-nice
mode that allows you to scroll almost
forever with a click of a button
finally underneath is a Pixar pmw 3366
which gives fast and accurate tracking
with no acceleration all those dope
features pretty much come together to
make the best all-around Mouse in my
opinion hey what's up everyone
danny here from budgeted the mouse that
I use is the red dragon central forest I
read you about it to use as a temporary
mouse while waiting for a bigger
brand-name going to go on sale and ended
up exceeding my expectations so almost
two years later it's still my daily
driver in terms of features it has 6
buttons of braided cable adjustable
weights and it's a Mexico - the side
buttons my time on the computer is
mostly spent browsing creating content
and playing casual games for which it
works perfectly
thanks for putting together this
collaboration man and thank you all for
watching hope to see some of you on my
channel what is going on guys Alex here
and the mouse loads on a daily basis is
the row cat covert the lighting on it is
absolutely awesome with the one around
the scroll wheel and the little base of
it as well this is just so comfortable
to use in general and that's why I've
actually stayed with this one it doesn't
stick to any surfaces it's like nice and
smooth it does have some significant
weight to it which is also an added
bonus and that's about all I have to say
about my daily driver Mouse so thank you
