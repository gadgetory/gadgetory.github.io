welcome to this month's episode of cool
tech this time we're going to be looking
at tech on their 50 bucks and everything
I mentioned in this video will be listed
down below in the description section so
without wasting our time let's begin so
starting up the list is an awesome phone
stand that I came across a few days ago
there are literally thousands of phone
stands out there but the reason why I
picked this one up is because not only
does it have a cool design we can also
sync your phone at the same time you can
connect the USB portion into a wall
charger or power bank to juice up your
phone or plug it straight into your PC
and sync your iPhone it's also
compatible with older iPhone models
because the dock can be swapped out to
accommodate the older 30-pin connectors
I also like the fact that it can still
support my iPhone 6s plus even with a
bulky case on and what's even crazier is
that it can hold up an iPad air 2 as
well although I wouldn't recommend it
since it can be easily tipped over let's
just say that this is my newest addition
to my set up also I'm not sure why it
states that the cable is not included
when mine actually came with one but I
thought I'd mention this to you guys
next up we have a pretty sweet headphone
hangar from brain waves now this is a
really affordable way of cleaning up
your desk setup if you have a pair of
headphones lying around simply hook it
up to the edge of your desk and tighten
it up and you are good to go I'm
seriously wondering why this goes for so
cheap considering it's made out of metal
the best part about the sanger is that
you can rotate it vertically instead if
you want to hook it up on a shelf or
something similar the only downside to
this is that it won't fit IKEA linman
desks
since the clamps on these don't extend
as much for those of you out there with
more than one pair of headphones you
should check out the brainwaves trust
hanger which can not only hold up two
pairs of headphones but also goes under
your desk and away from sight next time
I'm on my list are these skins that I
have on my 80 hm 50 X's these skins are
from the brand and believe it or not
they do have other skin colors than
black and red as well as different
materials for consoles and smartphones
as well but the reason why featuring the
m50x skins in this video is because they
are new so if you guys want to pimp out
your devices or looking for a great gift
for someone then be sure to check out
the brands by clicking on the first link
below I don't know how many times I've
been asked to feature a set of LED
strips on the channel so after looking
around for now
I found a quality set of four pre-cut
RGB LED strips for around 20 bucks so it
took me about two minutes to set
everything up just simply hook up the
strip's together and connect one end of
the power adapter and you are done you
can control the color of the lights
using the remote and even give them some
effects like flashing pulsating and even
fading the downside is that you actually
need to point the remote to the receiver
it does need to be in line of sight for
it to work the total length of the
strip's equal 48 inches and as you can
see it didn't quite cover the entire
back side of my table so I had to order
one more set but if your table is around
48 inches wide or smaller then you will
be fine I also like how it comes with
cable clips making the wire management a
breeze I simply attach the clips on the
roof of my desk so they are not visible
these next set of items are iPhone 6s
and 6s plus cases we have the eraser
series and shielded series which both
come with a screen protector as well as
a wide variety of colors the razor
series have a tri layer design with the
outer shell being constructed of
polycarbonate with a soft TPU bumper
inside the case for better shock
absorption in the event that it drops
you do get a much better grip of the
phone due to the texture on both sides
and you also don't have to worry about
scratching the front of your phone if
you laid face down since the case does
have a two point five millimeter raised
bezel in terms of functionality all of
the buttons are really easy to press
without much effort
however the vibrate switch may require a
little extra work to reach the cutouts
on the bottom are also precise yet large
enough for even third-party accessories
the shielder series are also very
similar but have a different design
overall I'm really diggin the quality
protection and design from both of these
cases and as you can see here I have
quite a few extra ones left here in fact
I have about ten of these which I will
be giving away on my Twitter account
within this week so be sure to follow me
there if you guys want a chance to win
one of these this next item is extremely
under priced now these are the earbuds
inspire 100 earphones and they go for a
little under 20 bucks they don't come
with built-in mic or remote control but
what you do get for around 20 dollars is
a pair of really comfortable and good
sounding earphone
the cover has made out of rubber which
provides a really snug fit and seriously
guys you can do a thousand jumping jacks
and these will not slide out they are so
comfortable that you can even fall
asleep with them on sound wise these are
actually a little on the base side
however it's not overpowering the highs
and lows are clearer than I've ever
experienced with in-ear headphones
around this price tag and it does a
pretty good job jamming out noise be
warned though these do not have any
noise isolation in fact these were
created so that the user can hear
ambient noises so that they are aware of
their surroundings so if you're looking
for noise isolation earbuds then these
aren't it aside from that the sound
actually doesn't leak as much as I
expected even at high volumes for my
pair of affordable earbuds but overall
these are awesome and only for 20 bucks
you can't go wrong this next item is
pretty self-explanatory it's a six
outlet surge protector that can pivot
hence the name pivot power it's great
for anyone that has a lot of large plugs
since you can practically make room for
them by pivoting the outlets but that's
basically all I got for this last but
not least we have the assault G Crusader
gaming keyboard now this is a membrane
keyboard but with special half
mechanical switches aka dome switches
they don't give the tactile feedback you
would expect from Cherry Blue MX
switches but it will feel more like
cherry reds instead typing on this
keyboard definitely feels a lot nicer
than regular membrane switches in fact
it was a quick typing sample the top
frame cover is old metal and the entire
keyboard feels pretty heavy in fact it
feels a little heavier than my Corsair
strafe RGB keyboard the key caps have
nice curvature and the space bar is long
and wide the top portion of the keyboard
has this orange plastic piece that leads
through the back of the keyboard where
you will find two rubber pads near the
bottom which do a great job preventing
slipping old I'm really curious at who
would give the okay to design this
keyboard aesthetically it doesn't look
appealing with that orange and teal
color combination at least for me isn't
other than that the keyboard does come
with a detachable wrist rest which is
nice and a volume wheel on the top right
with a windows lock key for gaming as
far as LEDs are concerned you get
only three colors red blue and purple
which you can cycle through by tapping
on the LED button on the keyboard you
can also control the brightness if you
wish if you can't quite afford a
mechanical gaming keyboard but want to
get a similar experience and these are
definitely worth taking a look at so
