today we're going to be unlocking the
iPhone 7 plus so you can use it with any
GSM carrier in the world and this
process is exactly the same for the
iPhone 7 as well and it doesn't matter
which country purchased the phone from
now there are a bunch of unlocking
websites out there and it doesn't really
matter which one you use but if you're
looking for the cheapest prices and the
fastest delivery times then you should
check out the unlocking company comm and
that's actually where I get all my
unlock codes from so the first step is
to find the IMEI number of the phone and
you can do that by opening up the dial
pad and typing in star pound zero six
pound once the number pops up you have
to visit the unlocking company comm and
enter in all of the information put in
the manufacturer and the model of the
phone on the first page and then on the
next page you have to select which
country the phone was originally
purchased from and the carrier of the
phone in my case I bought it from the
United States and the original carrier
is AT&amp;amp;T once you hit next you will need
to put in the IMEI number that we just
looked up on the phone and finish
filling out the rest of the boxes once
you finish checking out they will
remotely unlock your iPhone but you will
need to finish the locking process on
your end and here is what you need to do
so before we continue we need to put in
the SIM card that you want to use with
your iPhone so pop up in the SIM tray we
should be located on the side and put in
the SIM card you want to use with the
iPhone once the SIM card is on the tray
go ahead and slide it back inside your
phone and go ahead and reboot the device
once you get the email stating that your
phone is remotely unlocked you'll need
to plug in your iPhone to your computer
and open up iTunes now once you log in
and hit continue a message will pop up
stating that your iPhone is now unlocked
so that's how you unlock your iPhone 7
or 7 plus for any country feel free to
leave a like if this video helped you
guys out and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
