show I'm gonna give you an update on the
submission process currently I'm still
backed up until January here's a
screenshot of the current submissions
I'm working on yeah I'm still working on
submissions from January so if you guys
submitted in the past few months or the
past few weeks and you're wondering why
you haven't been shown well it's either
one the quality of the picture is on
good or - you are in a very very long
queue so please be patient guys I am
still focusing on going through every
single submission in order those
submissions aren't including the ones
that I've weeded out I stuff to go
through those and remove the ones that
have bad quality or a bad setup and all
that stuff but anyways just want to give
you guys an update there was a very
there's a six or seven month wait time
to be on set up for so that is why your
setup or one of the reasons why your
setup hasn't been featured on setup
boards but anyways with that said
welcome to set up words episode 149 if
you guys want to submit and wait they
watched a video linked down below but
with that said let the set up wars begin
hey guys real quickly I want to thank
the sponsor of this video trade coffee
it's actually a funny story they started
off as a sponsor for this video and
announced my favorite place to get
coffee personally I love coffee I need
it to be productive and it helps me
focus on content creation believe it or
not I have 10 to 12 hour days seven days
a week making YouTube videos so coffee
is what keeps me going here's why trade
is awesome
their mission is to churn coffee
drinkers like myself into coffee lovers
so they have this quick sixth question
quiz that matches you with the coffee
you're most likely to love so when I
took the quiz they actually matched me
with the FTO House espresso and one
thing I love about this coffee compared
to the one I'm using right now is it has
so much flavor that it don't need to add
any creamer trade has a diverse offering
of the very best seasonal coffees with
exceptional taste ethically sourced from
respected farmers and producers and
prices start around 15 dollars a bag I
love the convenience of the entire
process having trade matched me with the
perfect coffee for my taste and having
it sent directly to my home is awesome
it's also roasted just after your order
is placed which is why it's always so
fresh currently they ship to the US only
and right now you can buy a really great
bag of coffee yourself suited for your
own taste why now trade is offering the
first 100 subscribers who click on the
link below and use the promo code text
source 50% off whatever coffee is
recommended for them but you got to be
quick because it's not gonna last long
kicking off the episode we have this
super clean setup from Kai he uses it
mainly for gaming and occasionally for
making YouTube videos and other
miscellaneous work we have an ultra-wide
from samsung mounted against the wall
and instead of running the wire straight
down check this out he ran them across
the wall and behind his pc which looks
way cleaner he also has a 23 inch from
Dell and it's sitting on top of a box
for some reason in the notes he did
state that the reason he didn't mount it
on the wall is because his wife
frequently moves it to her desk for when
she needs to work from home he also said
that he spaced the monitor a little bit
from the ultra-right so that it's more
symmetrical with the PC on the other
side and I gotta be honest it doesn't
look bad there's a nice balance here and
the box underneath tomorrow
keeps it almost level with the ultralite
the desk itself was built using the IKEA
egg back in black stone countertop which
is being held up using some capital eggs
this basically gives the tabletop some
spacing between the Alex yours which is
great if you ever needs to store things
in between it also it raises the desk a
bit actually see this method a lot for
people who are tall there's not much on
the desk itself he has a minimalistic
approach we got some IKEA plans maybe an
Xbox one controller and his keyboard and
mouse he's added white key caps and it
appears that the mouse itself is modded
either with paint or vinyl wraps I'm not
really sure it looks really good though
and the black mouse pad with the white
accents really ties the peripherals
together beautifully the only source of
audio he's got are the sennheiser HD 6
xx headphones which are neatly hanging
underneath his desk and I do have to
point out the placement of the snowball
ice microphone it's a very subtle
placement it doesn't stick out nor does
it take up any extra space on the desk
it looks like he hooked it up to a boom
arm and he left it in the corner behind
the monitor so it's not visible nicely
done I actually thought it was hooked up
on the monitor mount itself the cable
management on the setup is exceptional
all the PC wires are tied together and
routed beautifully underneath the desk
and into the j-channel raceway and out
through the other side of the desk I
couldn't be more proud
and finally the PC pairing at all which
is a beauty herself
we got the 7700 K 16 gigs of the RGB
trynna Z RAM sticks and MIT EVGA 1080 Ti
it looks like he's mod at the side of
the case after his YouTube channel using
vinyl stickers and we also got some
custom sleeve cables I also love how the
entire fan itself has lit helping these
up from a go and these are the white LED
fans but they do have our DB versions as
well one of the things I like about this
setup is that it's dynamic a lot of
setups tend to have a specific color
scheme that can't change so they're kind
of stuck with that but this setup has a
neutral color and all he has to do is
change up a few colors and a wallpaper
to give it a new and refreshing look
excellent work on this setup it's
definitely one of the cleanest I've seen
Thank You Kai for entering speaking of a
clean set up Luke is up next with a set
up focused on gaming and
engineering design first thing I noticed
is the interesting layout of the
monitors so instead of sandwiching all
three displays side by side like most
people he mounted the smaller one on top
to make space on the desk for his PC
also who says you need a wall to mount
your monitors you can actually use
Windows too well the wooden portion at
least but at least this gives you the
option to have that levitating monitor
look while having your set up in front
of a window at the same time you just
got to make sure that there are actual
mounting points near the windows
otherwise it won't work the desk itself
has an industrial theme to it
with a wooden countertop from Ikea and
custom-made steel pipe legs for the
support on the screw got the corsair k70
RGB keyboard with the custom white key
caps and the razer deathadder mouse
drilling a hole right behind the mouse
Bungie is actually a really awesome way
of hiding that cable instead of running
it underneath the keyboard or even worse
winning across the desk another thing I
noticed out of bookshelf speakers in the
back
we are both being blocked off which is
gonna affect the sound quality I'm
actually curious as to why you mounted
them on the desk itself instead of
picking up floor stands which will allow
you to lift the speaker's even higher I
didn't recommend these from a Pearl
Smith I think that's how you say which
can be extended up to 45 inches high so
it's gonna give you that extra boost
that you need so it's not being blocked
off alternatively you can also mount
them on the wall although you might have
to move that painting on the right side
to make space for it aside from the
speaker's he does have a wireless
headset from SteelSeries that he also
uses this is actually very similar to
the previous set up Luke also routed his
wires across the wall instead of
straight down it looks so clean because
you can't really see the channel raceway
that he used to route the wires through
since the monitors are blocking it it's
a very clever trick to enhance the
presentation of the set up nicely done
dude the PC parameter setup has a 7700 K
8 gigs of RAM and the AC strakes 1070
with custom black sleeves the setup
itself is nice and organized however I
would change at the placement of the
speakers if possible so that you can
take full advantage of them but
otherwise thank you Luke for entering
and number three as moshae I hope I'm
not butchering that name with dual
setups one strictly for console gaming
and the other four PC gaming and editing
so the console setup has a dedicated
desk and two gaming monitors for both
the ps4 and the Xbox one while the PC
has an all red Deadpool team going on
with a single ultra ride there's
definitely a lot of red even for my
tastes but he did try and balance that
by adding black for contrast some great
examples on the speaker stand the Mophie
wireless charging pad the lambo and even
the DAC for peripherals is rocking a
Logitech G 9 10 keyboard he got the g9o
3 Mouse and the power play mouse pad
that doubles as a charging pad for the G
nano3 and the G 703 wireless mouse so
that's really cool you don't have to
plug in a mouse and charge anymore just
leave it on the mouse pad and you're
juiced up sand watching the ultra whites
are a pair of monkey banana speakers and
next to those are Ikea lamps with
Philips RGB bulbs which of course are
set to red lighting aside from the
speakers he does have your Logitech G
6:33 headset hanging underneath the desk
and while we're down here let's take a
look at the cable management
it looks like he's using the good old
Signum rack to hold everything up and a
few will CROs to keep the wires from
hanging down overall a very clean job
personally I think covering the entire
wall with acoustic foams is a bit
overkill if you're doing it mainly for
acoustics then it's fine I guess but if
it's for aesthetic reasons I would have
preferred either wallpaper or even a
paint job if you must use acoustic foams
maybe you should have done like a cool
design with them or something but I
don't know what do you guys think leave
your feedback in the comments section I
do like the two Deadpool posters and the
painted wall shelf with collectibles at
least there's some personality in this
setup I mean the Shelf isn't exactly
centered in the middle but I'll give you
a pass what the hell I feel like if
Deadpool on the gaming PC this is what
it would look like at 6600 K 10 atti
from Oris a couple of Deadpool figurines
and of course plenty of red lining you
know I haven't seen a set up that relies
heavily on a theme like this in a while
but it's always refreshing to see I
think it did a great job over here
keeping with the Deadpool theme thank
you motion for entering and I'm sorry if
I butchered your name this next set up
is from Knauer
again at sorry if I'm butchering your
name is very impressive because it's the
first set up I've seen on the show to
have great cable management using a
glass
this is impressive because you can't
really hide stuff underneath it since
it's all see-through but he found a way
around this by grouping up all the wires
together using a cable sleeve and
compressing them together with zip ties
that's actually a very clever way of
doing it and if you guys have a glass
desk at home you should probably
consider this method if you want a clean
setup the only other drawback from a
glass desk is that you can drill any
holes for the keyboard and mouse because
either way you're gonna see the wire
going across the desk either above it or
underneath it also you might end up
cracking the surface around it all right
so the setup is used for gaming and
programming he's using a 4k monitor up
top with 2 quad HD gaming monitors on
the bottom and he's hooked up all of
that to the VL desk mount the benefits
of having a corner desk is that you can
have your main setup on one side and
keep the rest of your gear including the
PC on the other without having to pick
up extra drawers or shelves there's the
ps4 console docking station with
controllers and the headset off to the
side in the corner is where the custom
water-cooled PC is the courser 460 x
case has appeared twice already in this
episode specs wise he's using ad leaded
8700 k that's overclocked to 5.1
gigahertz very nice and it's also
equipped with 16 gigs of ram and the
EVGA 1080 TI FTW 3 a beautiful custom
loop with hard line tubing this is a
very compact case because of the PSU
shroud so I'm impressed that you're able
to fit an entire loop in here despite
going with a single radiator splitting
the pump and the res was actually a
great idea however I do recommend
picking up some custom sleeve cables at
one point to complete this awesome
awesome build it's very refreshing to
see a badass set up on a glass desk and
I think he did an awesome job putting it
all together and keeping it very very
clean thank you now our foreign trade
wrapping up the episode is Ryan and his
final fantasy obsessed setup we got two
separate setups actually you want for PC
gaming and the other for console gaming
the PC side is rocking three asus
monitors that are actually hooked up to
a monitor mount you can't tell because
he cleverly hid the base behind his
surface 3 on the desk he's got the K 95
Platinum keyboard got the SteelSeries
mouse and the cursor RGB mouse pad
one thing you can do with those wires is
by drilling a small hole right above the
mousepad where you can wrap both mouse
and mousepad wired through if you ever
want to clean a look alternatively you
can rotate the mousepad sideways so that
the cable isn't as noticeable since
it'll be closer to the keyboard but
those are some options of cleaning up
the wires a bit I do love the charging
hub that you installed on the left side
of your desk it's a very convenient way
of just plugging stuff in and juicing it
up however there is another way of doing
this without drilling holes in your desk
and it's by picking up this charging hub
or something similar and hooking it up
on there to desk very similar to what
you did with your router on the right
side of your desk but either way works
at all matters and what's more
convenient for you
speaking of convenience the speaker is
mounted on the wall was a great idea
considering you have no space on the
desk for them and speaking of no space
sadly the PC had to go on the ground I
would have personally put an alux drawer
where the chair is right now in this
picture and put the PC on top of that
because it looks too good to be on the
floor but maybe you're using that space
in the corner for other things I don't
know that's just what I would do the
cables are managed very well he's using
a channel Raceway near the back and some
wall raceways in the front to route the
wires through I guess that works to the
console gaming setup is pretty
straightforward he's got the 46 inch
Sony TV and underneath that more
consoles than any single person should
own ps4 we got the Vita xbox one 360 and
Nintendo switch but where the hell is
the VR stuff I think the only thing
you're missing is maybe like an HTC vive
headset or even a PlayStation VR I do
like the overall theme of the room he
said is going for an orange and black
theme and me being a huge final fantasy
fan as well I'm really digging it it's
not my preferred color choice but I like
how you decorated everything with the
collectibles the posters and other
miscellaneous stuff there's definitely a
lot of personality in the setup Thank
You Ryan for entering so that's it for
this episode what I've set up for is as
always make sure you guys drop your
comments down below and vote on who you
think has the best desk set up out of
the five and as always I'll announce the
winners on my ieg account make sure you
guys are following me there for some
sneak peeks as well some pretty cool
stuffs happening on the channel all of
your faces and I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
