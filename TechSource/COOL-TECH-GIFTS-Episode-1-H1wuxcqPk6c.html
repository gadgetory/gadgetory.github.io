holidays or even just a birthday present
then these items on my list are
definitely worth checking out what's up
guys it's ed from tech source and this
is cool tech gift Edition let's begin
not too long ago I featured Wally the
smart wallet and today I have the actual
wallet in my hands and I gotta say it's
pretty damn nice while he is a smart
wallet that connects to your phone and
will notify you if you leave it behind
what's even better than that is that
Wally has a pocket sensor that is smart
enough to detect if you're missing a
card from a specific pocket using the
Wally app which is available on iOS and
Android you can adjust the settings to
send yourself a notification if your
card is out of your wallet pocket for
too long the wallet itself is made out
of genuine leather and it's by far the
coolest looking wallet I have ever used
you can even find your phone if it's
missing by double tapping on it twice
the phone will play a melody which you
can use to find it even if it's on
silent you can pre-order Wally on
IndieGoGo right now and for those of you
that are interested I'll go and drop a
link down below for you next up we have
the signal game clutch which is a
smartphone grip great for playing motion
sensitive games
it fits perfectly on any smartphone even
giant ones like my iPhone 6s plus with a
case on this provides console great
ergonomics and quality when playing
racing or other gyroscopic based games
on your smartphone and number three we
have the native Union jump cable which
is a super compact and portable power
bank that you can wrap up and take with
you anywhere it comes equipped with a
USB and lightning cable which means that
you never need to bring extra cables
with you just pull out the cable
whenever you need a quick charge and
wrap it up when you are done it doesn't
reveal how many milliamps the charger
has but it's expected to give you a 30%
boost for your smartphone there's even a
micro USB cable version available which
I will link below you know what else
makes a great gift skins but not just
any skins the best quality out there
from carbon fiber to match and even
leather style skins with the most
precise fit in the world they cover a
wide range of devices so be sure to
check out the brands by clicking on the
first link below next up on the list is
this microphone from Road this is the
videomic me and it's a directional
microphone for the iPhone and iPad the
mic reduces surrounding noises to focus
on
what you are filming which greatly
increases the quality of your mobile
videos whether you are vlogging shooting
a video for youtube or even filming for
a special event it sports an all-metal
body and comes with a headphone jack for
audio play through you just simply snap
the mic into the audio jack of your
iPhone or iPad lock it in place using
the included adjustable mount and you
are ready to go you also get a
windscreen for shooting outside which
greatly reduces wind noise all right so
I have the microphone hooked up to the
iPhone 6s plus and I am recording with
the front-facing camera alright so I
removed the microphone and this is how
the iPhone 6s sounds like without the
videomic me attached to the iPhone next
up on the list we have an iPhone 6s plus
case and there are versions available
for the regular 6 and 6s as well this is
the vessel wood series frozen titanium
gray and walnut bumper case made out of
high quality aluminum and wood the
bumper case provides protection from
drops and gives your phone a stunning
look with a perfect blend of wood and
aluminum the bumper doesn't interfere
with the signal which means you won't
get any drop calls and each case comes
with a certificate and serial number
once it's hand finished in Slovenia you
also get a small hex screw to install
the bumper a branded microfiber cloth
and some spare screws the cutouts are
precise and the volume buttons have an
aluminum finish which are extremely easy
to press the vibrates which however is
extremely easy to use and I can switch
it on and off by using just one finger
what I like most about this case is that
it provides an alternate solution to the
camera protruding problem on the iPhones
which means that you can actually rest
it flat on any surface without worrying
about scratching the lens overall this
is a really good looking case and an
excellent gift to anyone that has an
iphone the last item on my list is this
the jacket I'm pointing at the jacket
yes indeed what a better gift for this
cold season than a warm vest or clothes
but this is a tech channel so why the
hell am i featuring this in my cool tech
episode well I'm glad you asked Timmy

vest is from Scottie vest and they are a

everything from jackets and vests
two hoodies pants and even shorts I'm
wearing the quest vest that has 42
pockets which means that I can
practically take my entire house with me
yes that is an iPad air 2 that I just
pulled out of the vest some pockets are
even made for specific items like this
one here is made for sunglasses because
it comes with a microfiber cloth
attached inside in case you ever need to
clean the lens there are also slots for
pens and larger pockets to store your
water bottle with scraps inside to make
sure that it's always upright when you
