sand today we're gonna be looking at the
LG G flex smartphone this is basically
LG's response to the galaxy round from
Samsung it is just as huge with a 6 inch
720 display and the phone feels really
interesting in the hand because of its
curved nature and I'm sure this also has
to do with LG's rear key where the
volume can be controlled as well as a
sleep and a wake button one of the
things that jumps out to us right away
is the UI that LG has put on top of the
Android this phone is very customizable
almost every aspect of this phone can be
changed without having to install
third-party launchers or routing of the
phone even with an option to change the
theme of the phone right from the menu
the similarities however don't stop at
the size as running through the UI we
were presented with a handful of
software features that kind of felt
stolen from samsung's interface one was
the ability to have two applications
open at the same time you can also
resize windows to allow for more
workspace in one application and pulling
down a notification panel we can see
that half of the panel is already taken
out by LG's interface but you know all
the applications few are frequently used
and convenient to the user
like toggles to Wi-Fi and Windows
applications quick memo is another
feature that is also present on Samsung
phones which gives the user an easy way
to screenshot the phone's display and
also write a quick note on top of the
screenshot jumping into the settings we
see a different section at the top with
all settings pertaining to that specific
tab and there are also a lot of settings
here including several different ways to
change the look and feel of your phone
the camera UI at first glance is
simplistic but what a click of a button
offers a variety of options that can be
tweaked and played around with the
camera however is definitely not the
best and pictures are captured really
slowly so if you're looking for a good
camera in a smartphone you might want to
look elsewhere in the end we're really
not impressed about this phone it you
know it has a horrible display gimmicky
UI and software inconsistency makes for
a bad experience where LG needs to
improve on is we're finding it's
software and now looking to other
manufacturers for features to copy but
then again that's our opinion so what do
you guys think about the G flex
smartphone is this something you might
consider getting or are you guys not
impressed like we are definitely let me
know in the comment section down below
and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
