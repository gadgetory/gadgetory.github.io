and if you're watching this video then
that means you are looking for a case to
protect your investment unless you're
watching this video because you are
bored but nonetheless
here are five really awesome cases for
the iPhone 6s and 6s plus that you can
pick up for under $25 so let's begin so
starting off the list is this clear case
from oblique now comes in at just $14
and it's available in black clear orange
in mint it has a simple clear
polycarbonate back with a TPU bumper
that protects the iPhone from scratches
and helps absorb impact when dropped the
buttons are easy to press thanks to the
TPU material however the vibrate button
may need some additional work to access
since it's deeper inside the cutouts are
precise with some extra room for third
party accessories which is always nice
and offers great protection all around
the oblique case does have a very slight
lip which will protect the screen of the
phone if you happen to place it facedown
but what makes this case different than
the others is the fact that it comes
with a magnetic metal kickstand in the
back just simply pop it open and place
it on any flat surface you can then
enjoy videos without having to hold it
with your hands for only $14 you get a
good looking case that offers good
protection and what's great about the
clear back is they can get creative and
add skins to it you'd really change up
the overall look of your phone at number
2 we have the virus high pro shelled
case that comes in at 18 dollars and
it's available in rose gold red and a
bunch of other colors it's a two-piece
case that features a hard polycarbonate
bumper and a soft thermal plastic cover
the back of the case has this really
cool brushed metal look which feels
really great in the hand and the buttons
are really easy to press with the
exception of the vibrate button being
inconvenient to access with one hand out
of all the cases the virus hi-pro shield
has the biggest edge raised to protect
the front of the screen from scratches
or touching the ground in the event it
drops the case has a really snug fit
with precise cutouts for even
third-party accessories as well but
overall a really solid and good looking
case for protection this next case is
also from virus but has a different
purpose altogether this is the dam de
and it comes in at 17 dollars with a
variety of colors to choose from it
choose a hardcover back in a softcover
made out of TPU to protect the phone
from impact this is essentially a
protective case that offers some space
for your cars now if you guys are like
me and hate carrying a wallet or cash
then this is perfect for you the slider
opens up easily and fits up to two cards
comfortably it can technically fit up to
three cards however there will be a
slight bulge so if that doesn't mess
with your OCD and you should be able to
get away with it the buttons on the dam
the case are extremely soft and all I
have to do is just tap it slightly in
order to press it by far the most
responsive buttons out of all the cases
featured in this video the cutouts on
the bottom are also big enough for third
party accessories now like the previous
Varys case this one too has a noticeably
big lip to protect the front of the
phone when laying it face down if you
guys have been looking for a case that
doubles as a wallet and don't mind
picking up something a little more on
the bulkier side then the damn the case
is worth taking a look at this next case
is from a brand called poetic and this
is the affinity series case it comes in
at $15 and offers a black and clear
option the case is made out of clear
polycarbonate material integrated with
soft shockproof TPU the pattern on the
side offers a solid grip to the phone
and the buttons are pretty soft to press
however the vibrate switch does require
some extra effort to reach although the
cutouts don't exactly line up with the
speaker grille the audio isn't really
affected and there's plenty of room for
pretty much any accessory one thing to
also take note is that all of these
cases solve the camera protruding
problems so that you can easily rest the
phone on the back without worrying about
scratching the camera lens only $15 you
not only get a good looking case but you
also get a more grippy ER case that will
protect your iPhone 6's from drops last
but not least we have the spigen Neo
Hybrid carbon case it comes in at a
little under $24 and has several other
color options this case is my favorite
one out of the other four because I
think it has the coolest design and
doesn't add much bulk to the phone the
case features shock absorbing TPU with
an outer glossy PC frame that's kind of
slippery if your hands are moist the
back however has a really nice design
with glossy chamfered areas along with a
carbon fiber feel for the top and bottom
of the case definitely one of the more
good-looking cases featured in this
video the buttons have a silver glossy
finish as well and are extremely tactile
and easy to press and the cutouts are
large enough for most accessories like
the rest of the cases in is
video the Neo Hybrid also offers a
raised lip to protect the front of the
phone I just wish that the bumper didn't
have a glossy finish making it somewhat
slippery to hold on to I do want to give
an honorable mention to the leather
wallet case for those out there that use
one this case is an extremely affordable
one coming in at just thirteen dollars
and has a few other color options as
well it has three card slots and a money
pocket on the side which is perfect for
anyone that doesn't like carrying their
wallet with them the phone easily snaps
in and out of place and you can even use
this as a kickstand to watch videos in
landscape mode not much else to say
other than you get a really solid
leather wallet case for only $13 this
last item isn't will the case but a
Hollister to hold your phone regardless
if it has a case or not so I thought I'd
mention this in this video in case
anyone is interested so that's it for
the video if you guys enjoyed it and
want me to continue doing these top five
series then definitely be sure to hit
that like button so I know and also let
me know what I should feature in my next
top 5 video by dropping a comment down
below thanks again for watching and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
