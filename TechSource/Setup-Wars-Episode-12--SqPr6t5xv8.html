setup to get featured on a channel and a
chance to win a prize I hope some every
Monday and you guys get to vote on the
best desk setup if you guys are new to

with all that said let the set up wars
begin
this episode of Star Wars is brought to

on the link below to see for yourself so
in case you guys missed my announcement
over the weekend LG has officially
sponsored setup wars and they're gonna
be giving the winner a brand new 34 inch
ultra wide curved monitor and for more
information you guys can watch the video
linked over here or down below so with
that said the five chosen for this
week's episode are Connor Morgan Freeman
Noelle Shane and sky or sky congrats for
making it to this week of set upwards so
starting off the episode is Connor and
it looks like a pretty straightforward
single display setup we have a 27-inch
BenQ monitor on the desk and we have the
corsair k95 RGB keyboard with the rat
tournament Edition Mouse I see that you
have an extended mouse pad from Corsair
as well so I'll award you a point there
it kind of looks like you have a blue
and black setup which I don't see a lot
of you do have the blue LED strips in
the back and they've actually become
very common in these setup or videos and
you have some Sony hi-fi speakers on the
table along with the Xbox 360 I'm
guessing you hooked up the Xbox to your
monitor so your setup is both for PC
gaming and console gaming let's take a
look at cable management so a pretty
good job it seems like the table has
it's very own dedicated place for a
power strip which keeps all the cables
off the ground I personally think that
every single table needs to have one of
these things not only is it a lot less
work managing cables but you don't end
up having a bunch of cables on the floor
and just really cleans up your setup now
for the recommendation part I was going
to recommend a monitor riser so that
your controller is an amplifier have a
dedicated place which will also clean up
your desk but I'm afraid that your
monitor will come in contact with the
top shelf so that doesn't really work
out unless you move the entire desk to
the right a little bit in that case it
will I also don't see a pair of
headphones anywhere on your desk so I
looked around and I found a pair of
really awesome black and blue headsets
that you can use with your Xbox and your
PC as well and I went to link that down
below
but other than that if a pretty cool
setup Thank You Connor for entering
setup Wars next up is Morgan Freeman we
have a simple and clean single 25 inch
monitor from Dell with a 40 inch Samsung
TV mounted on top as an overhead on the
table we have the Corsair K 30 keyboard
with the m-40 Mouse and the philips SP a
5300 speakers
I like how organized and precise you are
the fact that you have the mousepad and
tablet spaced evenly from the edge of
the table makes me really happy to see
and I do pay attention to these things
and fortunately I'm not so sure why you
have a red background for your monitor I
don't think that's actually good for
your eyes so I hope you change it to
something else I also see that you have
the ps4 and a blue Yeti my con the desk
as well with the v-moda crossfade
headphones hanging from the wall not too
much stuff on the desk which is good
great use of cable drops by the way to
keep the cables nearby and off the desk
any phenomenal job on the cable
management excellent use on the zip ties
and I see that you routed them alongside
the wall I'm pretty sure this table is
from Ikea but I had no idea that they
offered the legs in red unless you
painted them yourself but I think that
really matches your setup I mean I would
have personally gone with a white or a
black table instead of the wood that you
have there but that's just a personal
preference I'm also really diggin the
Shelf you have on the right side that
holds up your games and other stuff as
well as the red LEDs you have behind the
desk and TV that's pretty much it I mean
I have nothing to recommend you have
yourself a very clean setup Thank You
Morgan for entering Sarah Poor's Noel is
next up with his triple monitor setup
starting from the left we have a 24 inch
asus monitor in 25 inch LG monitor and
finally a 24 inch asus monitor but in a
different model so basically you have
three different monitors but at least
you'll line them nicely so I'll give you
a one time pass you have a pullout tray
with your Wireless Magic Mouse and Apple
keyboard so I'm guessing this is a
Productivity type setup since you have
three displays I guess it's okay to set
that far back using a tray but
personally for me I would move those on
the desk and sit closer there's not much
else going on other than those ps4
controllers and the igneous speakers I
see that you have two pairs of
headphones as well hanging underneath
Kable an audio technica ath m50x and a
pair of astro a40 s kale management is
pretty bad actually I'm sure you can
clean them up using the Omni mount
system or even some zip ties you can
most likely stick that power outlet
behind your desk with some 3m tape so
stop visible and I would also recommend
sticking the amplifier underneath your
desk and running that long cable
underneath the middle monitor it will
definitely look a lot cleaner other than
that it's a pretty decent setup Thank
You Noel for entering setup words next
up is Shane with his game room setup I'm
not sure what's up with the red LEDs
recently but I see a bunch of them now
on setup Wars so on the desk we have the
MacBook Pro Retina hooked up to the
Toshiba 24-inch TV with a pair of teak
speakers that is a really small TV so
this is your productivity set up I'm
guessing and over here on the other side
is your console gaming setup we have a
ps4 which is currently invisible hooked
up to the Samsung 27 inch curved monitor
excellent job on wire management I
couldn't have done it better myself and
on the side here we have a shelf full of
goodies on the top shelf is some of your
games and all that there's your ps4
right there that's actually a really
cool place to put it in there's also an
unloaded gun with binoculars why do you
need binoculars I mean it's really
nothing I can recommend here you have a
pretty sweet game room so thank you
Shane for entering set up boards last
but not least we have sky or sky I don't
know how many times I butchered names
and set up oars so we have a single Dell
monitor gaming setup on the table we
have the Razer Deathstalker keyboard mat
cat rat 9 wireless mouse on the awesome
extended mousepad from Corsair gaming
solid choice my friend
I also see a pair of Beats Studio
Headphones hanging from the side so this
is the third time I'm actually seeing a
colored wall and I gotta say that the
orange or even red walls really makes
this setup stand out especially with a
white table I'm really diggin this setup
great job on wire management and I'm
really liking the coca-cola trashcan you
have under there as well there's a
really nice red and white contrast you
have going on there and it's nicely
balanced really great choice on the PC
case as well I see that you went with
the NZXT and 450 case inside this bad
boy we have the 4790k cpu and the GT
X 980 graphics card from EVGA now
normally I would recommend parts for pcs
because this is setup Wars but in this
case I strongly recommend you to pick up
an aftermarket cooler so that you can
overclock that bad boy the stock cooler
just doesn't cut it
I would also recommend putting one of
those figurines on the other side just
so you know it's symmetrical
another thing I'll recommend is a much
smaller and more compact LED lamp from
kuch ear that I did a video on about a
month ago because I feel like that lap
is taking up too much space on your desk
but it's just a recommendation
the last thing I'll recommend is an
actual gaming headset I mean have a
pretty sweet gaming rig but are using
solo headphones so I listed a few
awesome red and white gaming headphones
that have great price down below as well
other than that you have a really
awesome weather wise setup Thank You sky
or scary for entering set upwards so
that's it for this week's episode of
setup wars voting begins now so make
sure you guys drop and comment down
below and vote on who has the best desk
setup as always voting will end Saturday
and I'll announce the winner on Sunday
on my Twitter and Instagram accounts
I'll real quickly for those of you been
asking me to you straw poll for the
voting system I hear you loud and clear
I've been thinking about doing that but
I like the comment system a lot better
because you guys can write comments
about the setups and a reason why you
are voting for a particular setup and it
keeps the engagement going down below
that's kind of why I want to stick with
the comments section believe it or not
it's actually really easy for me to
count the number of votes I use the ctrl
F and I type in the person's name and it
tells me how many times that person's
name comes up and that's kind of little
reasons why I'm gonna stick with the
comment section but thank you guys for
recommending that as always if you guys
enjoy watching setup wars let me know by
hitting that like button to show your
support that way I can continue doing
them every week it's basically it thank
you so much for watching I will see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
