I've officially built my very own test
bench it's rockin the new Intel i7 69 50
x10 Core processor which I will be
overclocking to its maximum potential I
also have 16 gigabytes of ddr4 ram from
g.skill a 512 gigabyte SSD from
transcend and the new asus strix x99
gaming motherboard with RGB LED accents
I did pick up an EVGA GTX 1080 founders
Edition as a reference to all my
benchmarking tests and powering this
entire set up is the courser ax 1500 I
power supply with red sleeving to
complement the black and red theme and
finally the test bed itself which is
quite simply the coolest test bed I've
ever seen so this is the wet bench from
primo chill that features an all
aluminum build with acrylic coloured
accents and it does come in two main
colors either black and white with a
variety of accent colors to match your
theme so the wet bench supports
motherboards from an ITX form factor all
the way to an e ATX with one twenty two
three sixty millimeter radiator support
internally and up to 420 millimeter
support outside the bracket
unfortunately it won't work with a i/o
cooler so you have to either have a
custom loop for the CPU or go with an
air cooler like I have it also supports
power supplies in any size and a
combination of up to four SSDs and hard
drives it does come with plenty of PCI
brackets to support four-way SLI but the
coolest feature this entire bench is the
fact that it's modular you can remove
the motherboard tray and the radiator
bracket very easily there are basically
four screws in each corner that allow me
to hook the tray to and then I can also
carry it around easily since both sides
have cutouts that contours my fingers a
well-thought-out and badass looking test
bench that gets the job done but I'll
doubling down below if you guys want to
check it out for yourselves the other
main piece of this build is the
motherboard picking out a solid high-end
motherboard is extremely important if
you're going to be pushing the system to
the extreme which is why I went with the
Asus Strix x99 gaming board there are
plenty of attractive features that I
will go over any more in-depth look at
this motherboard in the near future but
instead I'm going to be going over
several of my favorites first up let's
take a look at specs so for ram it
supports up to eight dims for a total of
128 gigabyte of stock 21 33 megahertz
and up to 33 33 if overclock of course
you get all the bells and whistles as
well m dot 2 u dot 2 and 8 SATA 6
gigabytes per second ports and 1 SATA
Express in terms of i/o you get 4 USB
3.0 and 2.0 ports and 2 USB 3.1 type-a
which is in red and a type C right below
that you also get the Wi-Fi go module
and 5 audio jacks as well the first main
feature is the RGB lighting the orange
Strix and ROG logos are replaceable with
three other colors that are provided
with each Trix x99 if neither color
tickles your fancy you can peel it off
to showcase the standard black logo
which blends in with the motherboard
additionally the board comes with RGB
lighting which is controlled with the RO
software not only can you change the
colors to anything your heart desires
but you have the option to add an effect
as well the spots that light up are the
i/o armor ROG text and the PCIe latches
speaking of PCIe the Strix x99 features
three PCI 3.0 slots that supports up to
3-way SLI or crossfire depending on how
many lanes you get with the CPU you
either get a 516 configuration for a
two-way SLI or an 816 eight config for
three-way with GPUs increasing in size
and weight over the past few years the
PCI slots tend to weaken and break off
due to the stress that's applied to them
one thing I really like that Asus did
was strengthen the top PCIe slot they're
calling it a safe slot which is
essentially redesigned and reinforced to
improve resilience over all three axes
furthermore all of the PCI slots have
been anchored to the motherboard more
effectively by a new hook design which
is capable of withstanding more force
than conventional designs the Strix x99
is also armed with supreme FX audio
which features japan made audiophile
grade capacitors that provides a warm
natural and immersive sound with
exceptional clarity overall this is one
kick-ass motherboard that any enthusiast
would enjoy but be sure to be on the
lookout for a more detailed video in the
future now even though the bench can
support up to four drives I only have a
single 512 gigabyte SSD from transcend
that holds all of my games and programs
which is plenty for me starting up
window
loading games and programs fast as
essential for benchmarking it's the most
tedious task I have to do for the
channel and having a blazing fast SSD
from chanson helps shorten the overall
time and finally the software that I'm
going to use to monitor all of this as
the NZXT cam which is a free all-in-one
program that allows you to monitor your
PC from anywhere as well as overclock
your GPU so on the main page you get
access to a bunch of information from
your temps to storage space and it will
even show a list of programs that
currently are running in the background
also hitting the maximize button will
expand the software showing a lot more
information the build tab shows your
system specs the game tab shows the most
recent games that you've played along
with some useful information like
duration played and average FPS which I
think is very helpful when benchmarking
games and finally the tuning tab which
is my personal favorite over here you
guys can overclock your GPU you get
access to the voltage core clock and
memory clock all on one screen another
awesome feature is the overlay option
which displays certain info while you
are in game so let's say you want to
know how many FPS you are getting and
what your GPU temps are while playing a
game or running a benchmark well you get
the option to enable any of the
following info which I find very useful
you can also position the overlay in any
corner you like while setting up a
toggle key to enable and disable it
whenever you want since you can monitor
your PC in real time from practically
anywhere by using the app you can also
set up notifications to alert you if
your PC exceeds a certain limit that you
have set in the settings also you can
view the current FPS of the game in real
time on the app which i think is a
pretty cool feature overall this is an
awesome software for PC enthusiasts or
for anyone that wants to get to know
their system a little bit more and also
venture into GPU overclocking if you
guys are interested in checking this out
for yourself I'll drop a link to it down
below along with all the parts used for
my test bench but that basically wraps
up this video let me know what you guys
think about my test bench by leaving
your comments down below and also leave
your like if you guys enjoy the video
thank you guys so much for watching as
always and I will see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
