what's up guys it's that from Texas and
today we're going to be looking at the
ROG Strix GT X 1080 overclocked edition
starting at 679 so about twenty dollars
less than the founders edition the card
features a custom PCB and eight plus two
para phase and a dope looking back plate
with Aurra RGB lighting which can be
controlled with the RS software but more
on that later the Strix 1080 is using a
Seuss's patented wing blade design that
provides more air pressure resulting in
cooler temps however upon testing the
card I actually found that the temps
were on the warmer side now do keep in
mind that I'm using an open-air testbed
the card will hover around 46 degrees
during idle and shoot up to 76 degrees
during full load
additionally the card comes with two
four pin GPU controlled headers that can
be connected to system fans for targeted
cooling the fans would also stop
spinning once the card has cooled off
and use a quick sound comparison between
idle and full load
so the Strix ten-eighty comes out of the
box with a 1936 megahertz boost clock
and overclocking mode and 1898 in gaming
mode in terms of power you will need a
six and eight pin PCI connector to juice
up this bad boy and a 500 watt power
supply because even during full load the
whole system managed to peak at only 350
watts however I would recommend going
with a 600 or 650 watt power supply to
future-proof your build in case you do
decide to add or upgrade parts later on
now let's take a look at the design
first off this is a very large GPU it's
both wider and longer than the founders
Edition measuring almost 12 inches in
length and 5.2 8 inches in width this
may be an issue in smaller form factor
cases that include hard drive cages so
that's something to keep in mind I am
however happy to see a neutral black
color scheme on the card which will make
it a great choice in any build the
backplate especially is something I
really like on the GPU with those subtle
gray markings across the surface and ROG
logo which by the way lights up as
mentioned before the card features RGB
lighting which can be controlled with
the RS software through here you can
give the GPU a static color or choose
from one of the few effects they have
listed now although I do like RGB
lighting on GPU since it helps keep the
overall color scheme inside a PC
consistent I would I'd love to see it
perfected oftentimes the brightness
level is not consistent across the card
if you pay attention to the lights you
can see that the right side of the card
is a lot brighter than the left
obviously this isn't a big deal since
most of the time the card is facing down
inside a case anyways in the end the
backplate is what's visible most of the
time and having a logo the lights up is
pretty badass
another minor thing I noticed was the
side of the GPU now first off I want to
say that I love the small ROG text
that's not all up in your face like some
of the other cards I reviewed on the
channel however I would have loved to
see more of the heatsink covered with a
plastic cover I'm not sure of Asus did
this on purpose to allow the heat to
escape from the sides but it's something
worth noting again I'm just nitpicking
here based on my personal preference I'm
sure most people don't care about these
minor things anyways and finally for the
port's we have two HDMI 2.0 to display
port 1.4 and 1/2
TVI but enough about that let's take a
look at how it performs and gaming now
since the Strix GT X 1080 comes in two
modes I'm going to run the benchmarks
and overclock mode for the best
performance
all right so pretty interesting numbers
the Strix 1080 did produce better
results compared to the 1080 founders
edition across most of the titles but
fell slightly behind at 1080 for the win
however the defense was marginal and
shouldn't be a deal-breaker when it came
to overclocking I managed to squeeze out
an additional 75 megahertz for a total
boost clock of two thousand thirty eight
and an extra five hundred megahertz for
a total of eleven thousand not bad when
it comes to gaming I did see some
healthy numbers some games got a nice
FPS boost while others not so much to be
honest the difference was so marginal
between the manual overclock and the
actual overclock mode in the software
that it's better to just go off by the
overclock mode within the software
instead of wasting time messing with the
settings unless of course you are water
cooling so in conclusion for twenty
dollars less than the founders edition
you get a better performing card and
some pretty cool features like RGB
lighting and a dope looking back plates
Asus is also giving a one year free
xsplit premium license valued at $100
with a purchase of the Strix GTX 10 a
GPU in the end the performance
difference between the Strix and the FTW
are marginal and it really comes down to
personal preference basically which car
design and features you like best but
that will do for my video if you guys
are interested in picking up the ROG
Strix 1080 overclocked edition then I'll
drop a link to it down below for you but
if you guys enjoyed the video and want
to see coverage on the Strix 1070 then
be sure to leave a like thanks again for
watching and I will see you in the next
