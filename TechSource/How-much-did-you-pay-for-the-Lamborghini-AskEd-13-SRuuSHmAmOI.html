question let's find out about seven
inches before I begin this video there's
a cool giveaway on the 1950 X thread
Ripper processor on the nice app and for
those of you that still don't know what
that is it's basically a platform where
you can watch videos to shop for
products and enter bunch of giveaways
it's completely free I'll drop a link to
it below the best thing about the app is
that it's actually very fair it doesn't
randomly give away something to some
random stranger who just participated
there's actually an algorithm in place
which basically keeps track of
everyone's activity within the app and
those people have a higher chance of
winning compared to somebody who just
recently joined it is completely free to
download it's available on both iOS and
Android once again drop a link below if
you want to check it out you got nothing
to lose so yeah it's been a while since
I've done and asked me video and I see
you guys constantly bugging me in the
comment section so once again I reached
out on Twitter and asked you guys to
send in your questions tech related or
not so yeah let's just dive in I'm
looking for a gaming PC for like $500
thanks for sharing what do you do during
your free time
so other than manly things I actually
been gaming a lot recently I've been
playing pub G but I've been playing a
lot of the new game recently called
fortnight and I've been asking I didn't
want to ask you guys this actually if
you want to see me stream the game on my
twitch account let me know in the
comment section or better yet I'm gonna
drop a poll so please click on it and
vote I'm like spitting everywhere if you
guys want to see me screen because I
used to screen videos back in the day on
my twitch account I think I like like
5,000 followers or something but if
that's something guys interested in let
me know by voting in the poll
oh and also been playing a lot of guns
of boom if I'm away from my computer a
lot of you guys for some reason didn't
believe me when I said that this game is
addicting and I've been playing it
constantly I'll even show you my account
as you guys can see I'm level 25 I
created my own clan tech over 17 hours
played and actually have a bunch of
subscribers who are in my clan so search
me up guys if you want to play with me
that also brings me to my next point
where I briefly want to just go over
some things and that sponsors on the
you guys won't see sponsors on tech
source that having to do with tech first
of all I only take sponsors that I
personally see myself using or that I
find interesting enough for my viewers
out there that's one of the reasons I
don't do GT way anymore that's also one
of the reasons why I don't do the
unlocking videos anymore those are
really big chunks of income for myself
and for the channel and I just simply
don't do them anymore so I'm sure you
guys don't even notice that but if you
looked at my past videos I think it's
been six months since I took those out
from the channel is it okay if you don't
use those anti-static wristband things
I'm building a PC and I would like to
know Ben yes it is completely okay 100%
fine I think I build over 50 pcs and
I've been used a single anti-static
wristband if you're building on carpet
especially that's fine but just make
sure you're constantly touching the top
of the case or the side of the case
where the metal portion is or the
aluminum portion is that way you stay
grounded but honestly for the most part
you should run into any problems can you
lick Ram
I've actually licked a Titan X before so
if I can look at GPU I can certainly
lick around
tastes like tears what is your dream
tech that doesn't exist that you would
really like to see become a reality that
is a good question for my good buddy
Sergio the detect that I've been always
fantasizing about is an all-in-one robot
I know it's far-fetched and I know it's
probably not gonna happen in my lifetime
but I want to robot that does everything
for me basically a personal waiter a
cleaner a cook an assistant all-in-one a
three-in-one robot I tell them what to
do tell them what to cook it basically
handles everything and I think that way
I can just focus on my life focus on
living in focus on making YouTube videos
building pcs and stuff like that that is
the dream tech that I been dreaming
about
can you speak Russian if you can say I
love technology and Russian or anything
that you can say I know I told you guys
I was born in Russia but unfortunately I
don't speak Russian because when I moved
here with my family I dropped a lot of
Russian language and my family started
speaking to me in Armenian so I picked
up Armenian and now I know English so
those are only two languages I know
celebrity crush oh my god shailene
woodley I would do so many nasty things
to you if you're watching if you're
watching please slide in my DMS I mean I
just been I love you I love you so much
when did you build your first PC it was
right out of high school 2016 is when I
graduated so I would say August or
September of 2016 is when I built my
very first PC what is your favorite
movie that is such a very difficult
question if I had to pick a selection of
movies that have to be from director
chan-wook park that dude is insane its
of its foreign films he creates it's
nothing us us guys us has nothing
against this guy over here man
thirst all boys sympathy for mr.
vengeance I mean all those movies are
freakin incredible if you guys haven't
seen him honestly I strongly recommend
it one of the best films you've ever
seen in your life when you build a PC
what's the first component that you
choose when I build a PC the first thing
I choose is the processor once you get
the processor then I build everything
around it that we all know what cooler
to use which motherboard what socket
stuff like that so for me personally
it's the C
you can you even do five push-ups all
right
easy how do you manage your time for a
YouTube channel how do you manage your
stress that is a very good question and
I've been struggling with this for since
I started YouTube to be honest and I'm
still struggling with it I haven't
perfected it and I don't think I'll ever
perfect it YouTube just sucks so much
time out of my life that it's impossible
if I take one day off I'm gonna be two
days behind so that's the dusta issue
right now I'm dealing with so the way I
manage my stress is vacations I just got
back from a six-day cruise in the
Caribbean it was amazing as far as
managing my time if I have any extra
time later at night I'm talking like 1
a.m. 2 a.m. I get on Steam and I play
play fortnight pop gi5 any time to
socialize my friends I do it on the
weekend but Monday through Friday Monday
through Saturday it's all YouTube even
sometimes Sunday so yeah what are the
best monitors on the $350 I get asked
this a lot for a certain budget amount
one of the best monitors under 500 bucks
400 bucks so I dropped my top three
favorite ones down below in case you
guys want to check it out these are the
ones I keep recommending to everyone
when is the next episode of PC Wars and
ultimate set up coming out PC Wars I'm
actually working on a video this week
for it it's gonna be the worst to set up
Edition and as far as the ultimate desk
setup that's gonna be that's on a shelf
for a while guys I'm still working on
setup makeover so that's currently the
priority right now once I'm done with
that once I wrap up the production I can
work on building another ultimate desk
setup because I know you guys enjoy
those what do you do with the pcs you
build every month I get asked this so
many times you guys and I show you every
time as well these are probably the new
people are doing the channel by the way
welcome so I have a shelf somewhere in
my garage I store all of my parts on
there I take them apart and I put them
on the shelf and I reuse those parts for
my other builds for my next builds so
yeah if I'm not giving away the parts
they sit on the shelf collecting dust
until I need them again for a future
build if they get very outdated I sell
them that's what I do and how you can be
so much rich if your only source of
income is YouTube first of all I'm not
rich I wish I was rich I would have a
look at Bugatti and I would
in a mansion so I'm not rich please I
don't like people calling me that I'm
not rich at all and no YouTube is not my
only source of income fortunately I have
other sources outside of YouTube i have
investments in two companies i have some
mutual funds i also have dual source
tech which is also out of youtube that's
doing really well it's kicking ass your
tech check it out guys the best tech
deals you can find every single day
we're literally saving thousands of
dollars for my subscribers out there
whoever is following that website so if
you haven't even heard of it yet check
it out deal sorta tech book market it's
awesome have you ever gotten laid have
you seen what's in my garage I'm just
I'm just I'm just saying you know I'll
be a virgin for the rest of my life of
all the challenges that came your way
what's the one that made you almost quit
tech source that is a good question
Carlo I would have to say the
ever-changing platform of YouTube the
constant struggle to adapt to the new
audience I would say you can't
constantly do the same thing over and
over again and expect your channel to
grow you're not gonna find new audiences
like that and the old audience is gonna
get tired and move on so the struggle is
bringing in new content it's trying new
things maybe it's a different way of
shooting your videos maybe it's a
different background or maybe different
voice music I don't know whatever it is
you just have to constantly adapt and
that's very difficult especially for me
I'm like a one-man team here the stress
got too much and to a point where I just
wanted to just honestly give up so yeah
to answer your question
definitely the ability to adapt to the
new audience that is one of the hardest
things of doing YouTube bro how was your
cruise show us some pics reply to my
earlier question also love from India
I'm sorry Robert they did not see you a
question I was bombarded with a bunch of
questions by the way I got over 300
questions for this video so I'm sorry by
the way if I didn't answer your question

sharing my stories on there as well so

outside of YouTube

your next bill do you plan on doing it

overpowered overkill build using the 79
80 XE I think it's an 18 core processor

water-cooled as well so you don't want

Lamborghini

$240,000

say this he gave me a pretty good deal

best one of the best purchases I've ever
made and since then I'd never regret it
