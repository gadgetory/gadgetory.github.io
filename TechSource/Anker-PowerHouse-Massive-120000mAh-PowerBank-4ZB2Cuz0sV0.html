source and let me start this video off
by saying that this product is
definitely not for everyone coming in at
a massive 120 thousand milliamp hour but
if you often find yourself in situations
with no power then this is probably the
best alternative to loud and gas power
generators for such things like mini
fridges phones laptops and even gaming
consoles let's go and get the one
negative that I found while using this
product out of the way and that's the
weather sealing or lack thereof I didn't
find any IP certification for the power
house and if you were to take this
outdoors you would have to be careful
not to get it wet the aluminum body
feels really sturdy and well put
together there doesn't seem to be any
signs of corners being cut anywhere the
interface is simple we have a DC input
to charge the unit itself a 12-volt car
socket an AC outlet and for fast
charging USB ports the ports are all
divided into their own sections and to
activate one set of ports to charge you
have to click on its own corresponding
buttons all active force will be
displayed on the LCD display as well as
an hour indicator when I first saw this
I was a bit confused but basically
instead of giving you a percentage the
power house reads the current output and
calculates for how many hours it can
keep that up which in a product like
this definitely makes sense on the top
of the device we get a sturdy aluminum
handle that makes lugging this almost 10
pound beast around more convenient with
such a powerful battery anchor wanted to
make sure it included safety features to
protect both the user and the device
itself the battery management system
undertakes voltage control temperature
control and other advanced safety
operations anchors also included their
worryfree 18-month warranty to further
ensure your purchase you can charge a
phone up to 40 times laptops for about
15 times keep the mini fridge up for
seven hours or a 15 volt light on for a
crazy 100 plus hours the unit itself
however does have a maximum output of
one hundred and sixty watts overall this
product does exactly what it says it
does it's a giant battery for whenever
those just in case moments happen as
always thinking guys so much for
watching I'll leave links down below if
you guys want to check this out and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
