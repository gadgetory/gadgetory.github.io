thanks to 23andme for sponsoring this
episode more about it later in the video
what's up guys it's a from tech source
and welcome to an interesting type of
video so a lot of you guys know I
recently upgraded to the iPhone 10 or
iPhone X whatever you guys want to call
it and the only thing missing right now
is a nice solid case
so naturally I spent hours on Amazon and
I came across some cases now everything
on this table is actually purchased by
me with my own money I think I spent
over $300 on the cases and the
accessories additionally I'm going to be
testing the cases with wireless charging
to see if it still charges wirelessly
and of course a third-party charging
dock so now I know there's a lot of
people out there that don't even use
cases on their phone they prefer to go
naked on their phone of course so in
that case you guys still have to protect
your device obviously and the next best
thing aside from the case is obviously a
skin and right now the only brand out
there that knows what the hell they're
doing when it comes to wraps or skins is
deep brand I have a few selections on
here of course ranging from carbon fiber
to marble and even their new Dragon Skin
they're rocking in fact I'm even using a
skin for my phone right now underneath
the case this is the black leather and
they do have a bunch of other colors and
materials to choose from and they have
it for laptops and a bunch of other
devices check it out down below if you
guys are interested alright so let's
take a look at the first case that's
already on the phone this is actually
the first case that arrived and I
decided to slap it on to protect my
phone until the rest of the items
arrived actually don't know the name of
this so let me look it up real quick
so it's called the anti scratch
shockproof from VIN V I don't even know
how you call it it's six dollars
actually and I think they have a few
other colors to choose from they got
blue and black I'm in love with this
case it's very light very clean
minimalistic and one of the things I
love about it is that has a clear back
panel a few things I noticed it actually
has a really nice grip to it because of
the rubber material the buttons are very
easy to press no issues there
and it has a very small lip on if you
guys can tell so if you want to put your
phone flat on the surface or even on the
back you're not gonna scratch the camera
lens or the front of the device it does
work with wireless charging because I've
tested it for the past two weeks let's
see if it works with a charging dock
though okay very nice so yeah I mean
overall a very solid case for six
dollars this thing is six dollars guys
it's hard to believe this is definitely
one of my favorites but again I have to
go through the rest of the cases and
rate my top three so yeah let's move on
to the next one let's go ahead and take
a look at this one has an interesting
packaging so this one cost $13 and it
has obviously several colors to choose
from I think the cool thing about this
is it comes with a car mount which
usually costs at least five to ten
dollars if you're looking at the
cheapest one so oh so there's not one of
those event car mounts you have to
basically push down this button and
stick it between the vents for your AC
or heater
alright this pops right in that was very
easy definitely add some heft to it the
phone is noticeably heavier with this
the buns are very easy to press not much
force is needed the lip on this case is
more raised so you can easily leave this
flat on any surface you have to worry
about it scratching the volume buttons
and the power button have this pretty
cool texture on there the silence which
is a little hard to get into you might
have to actually dig a little deep in
there to flip the switch which isn't
really a big deal the design looks
pretty interesting I wouldn't say I'm a
huge fan of it maybe it will look better
in a different color
but yeah I'm actually curious if this
would even wirelessly charge because
it's it is a bit bulky so let's check
that out
so no wireless charging on this case
unfortunately and for the charging dock
it actually works just fine as long as
you have a tip that sticks out just
enough and I think the best part about
this charging dock is actually there are
a few adapters you can go with that
extends the tip of the lightning cable
as you guys can see you get a total of
four adapters which lets you adjust the
length of the tip depending on the case
you're using so that's pretty cool
alright so the next case
is 25 bucks and it's from fate 10 at the
ants where you call it it's basically a
full protection armored case it covers
both the front and back of the phone
comes in a few different colors you got
golden black golden red black on black
and even camouflage but first impression
is this is my type of phone not because
of the black and red color scheme but
because of how it looks and the premium
feel in the hand it's definitely a
little bulky obviously that's kind of
the trade-off when you want a full
protection case I love the black carbon
fiber in the back I think it adds a
really nice touch to the overall
aesthetic and comfort level honestly it
feels really nice in the hand
there isn't any sharp edges that kind of
poke you there's a nice little grip on
the side here because the rubber insert
actually kind of sticks out a little bit
and it gives a nice grip to the phone
unfortunately the case isn't waterproof
aside from the usual water resistance
you would get on the iPhone 10 it is
shockproof and the spoof however it does
come with a rubber insert for the
charging dock as well as the volume keys
and even the power button and of course
the vibrate switch in order to put your
phone on vibrate all you have to do is
push down on this button and in vice
versa if you want to take it off vibrate
it's honestly a very smart mod on this
case and it's actually done very well
how do you can charge it wirelessly but
check it out wait what well you can
charge a wirelessly okay I did not even
know that okay so here's where it gets
kind of annoying you're gonna have to
pull down on the flap and you're gonna
have to hold it in place as you slide it
in yeah this is not as convenient as I
would have liked when it comes to
mounting it on a charging dock but it is
still possible but the cool thing about
that is you can actually remove the
cover for the charging port if you don't
want it there so you basically just peel
this off once you take apart the case
and then well now you won't have any
protection obviously but at least it
won't bother you when charging the final
verdict for twenty-five dollars this is
a really nice case offers full
protection buttons are very easy to
press it feels really nice in the hand
very premium look and feel pretty solid
case for 25 bucks
moving on alright next case is gong
extreme protection looks like it's water
resistant dirt proof snow proof and
shockproof let's check this out
packaging is pretty nice okay comes with
a lanyard comes with a tiny screwdriver
and the case itself okay this is
definitely gonna be a pain in the ass to
install you got 12 screws on each side
guys 12 screws here 12 screws here it is
a pain in the ass to take apart and then
put back together so alright so does it
look cool okay looks cool I guess
depending on who you ask
to me personally I think it looks
different I don't know if I would say
aesthetically pleasing but it looks
different it looks interesting way
heavier than before I would say probably
twice the weight it's easy to grip
thanks to the textures on the side the
buttons are harder to press than the
previous cases I've tested the power
button especially you get no feedback
whatsoever so you don't even know if you
pressed it until you look at the phone
for the charging port looks like there
is a seal or a covers of some sort not
that easy to peel off you're gonna have
to try a few times until you get a hold
of the tip there and then peel it off
okay that port is very deep in there I'm
pretty sure it's not gonna be compatible
with most charging docks unless you have
one like mine where you can adjust the
tip $26.00 and there's two colors Oh
black or the silver and blue I don't
think you can even charge wirelessly
with this yeah it's it's way too thick
there is a vibrate switch just like the
previous case however this one doesn't
even work at all yeah just I think
poorly executed poorly designed case
whoever made this you need to rethink
some things for twenty-five dollars I
say do not buy this case it is not worth
it what a piece of junk that was so this
was an interesting case this is pretty
much it this is what it looks like it's
an aluminum frame and it has a key ring
in the back ring I don't know what you
guys call it so basically just snaps on
so just snaps on your phone just like
that very easy to install and that is
it's all right so this is the she rocks
aluminum metal bumper case and it's
going for it's around $15 I don't know
if I would pay $15 for this to be honest
comes in silver rose gold and black
basically the colors of the iPhone
obviously it's not meant for full
protection it may maybe protect your
phone if you drop it on the side or hits
one of the corners or something but the
main purpose of this case is for a
better grip so I guess you put your
middle finger or whatever finger you
want and I guess it's just easier to
hold on to your phone additionally I
guess you can use it as a kickstand so
that's also pretty cool other than that
I don't really see another use for this
type of case to be honest other than the
kickstand and a better grip on your
phone whether you're taking selfies or
whatever it is you're doing with your
smartphone it definitely doesn't sit
flush with your hand in fact it's a
little uncomfortable because of the
keyring in the back but yeah if you're
looking for a type of case like this
then also because of the keyring
obviously it's not going to be
compatible with wireless charging can't
even can't even fit on the stand because
it's pushing it off however for the
third-party dock I don't see an issue
with it at all so yeah it is charging
that's completely fine charging docks
are fine while this charging is not fine
with this case oh it also comes with a
screen shield so for fifteen dollars
might be worth it if you're gonna use
the case for what it's intended for I
think this will be a nice case to have
on the side because it's so easy to take
out and put back on so in case you are
gonna use it for those special occasions
let's say if you're going somewhere and
you need a kickstand to watch movies or
something on your phone this would be
pretty cool accessory to have on the
side but as a main case I cannot
recommend it I'm sorry alright next up
we have a case from ghost tech looks
like it is a wallet case there's a place
for your cards even some cash maybe
let's go ahead and pop this and okay
goes in fairly easily
first impressions it's actually a good
looking case it's very light kind of
slippery on the sides there isn't
grip to be honest it doesn't sit flush
with your hand because obviously if the
cardholder
but the material on the back is really
nice it has some texture on it it kind
of feels like one of those laptop bags
feels really nice the card holder itself
is very smooth it kind of feels like
fake leather it does have a lip in the
front so you can easily put it face down
it won't damage your screen there is
plenty of protection for the camera in
the back the buttons are very easy to
press no problem swiping up from the
bottom
the vibrate switch is again kind of hard
to reach you have to poke deep in there
and use your nails not very convenient
can i wirelessly charge no obviously it
cannot I was kind of hoping it would to
be honest but I'm sure with third-party
charging docks yep no issue there
alright so I got four cards with me
let's see if they can hold up to four
cards okay so yeah I can fit four cards
but I don't recommend that it's a very
tight fit
pulling out the cards is how are very
difficult actually so this case is
called the ghost tech x''k two-hybrid
tough armored case it goes for twenty
dollars does have six colors you get red
silver purple pink brown and the black
yeah not a bad case at all let's move on
to the next one
alright this next case is an interesting
one two pieces of aluminum it is a
bumper case so it's going to put this on
a little quick alright bumper is
installed my first impressions is this
is a pretty cool looking bumper the
first thing I noticed it was actually
the color of the aluminum frame in the
back this is supposed to be the black
and red version but this has a pinkish
tint to it I don't know if you can tell
through the camera definitely not happy
with that now I notice that the back is
completely exposed there is no cover and
even what they slightly raised the lip
the protruding camera is still kind of
sticking out a bit so yeah the camera is
definitely protruding out a few
millimeters it is not flush against the
bumper I don't recommend putting this
flat on any surface you can down
the lens on the camera unfortunately
actually I think that the brand even
offers skins for the camera so if you
are gonna be going this route adding a
skin around the camera cutout can help
you protect it from scratches the power
and volume buttons have this silver kind
of aluminum texture to it which is
pretty cool
the vibrates which is kind of in there
but it's not as hard to get to like the
previous cases that I looked at let's
see if it is well it should be able to
charge wirelessly because there is no
yep looks fine let's check the dock no
issues with that either so $20 for a
black and red aluminum bumper it
actually comes in 10 different colors
black on black yeah there's definitely a
quite a selection there so yeah other
than not getting a backplate like I was
supposed to or a screen shield for the
back it's a really nice bumper case the
only complaints I had with it was the
color is completely often what I saw on
the Amazon page is supposed to be red
not pink and - I'm really paranoid of
scratching the camera lens on the back
placing it face up so yeah than that I
mean it's a really nice solid bumper
case I don't know about spending 20
bucks on it though last but not least we
have this tank of a case this is a full
protection heavy duty case waterproof
shockproof and dustproof gonna cost you
around $17 and it actually comes in
several different colors obviously this
adds a lot of bulk to your phone
probably double the weight of an iPhone
X cuz it you can pretty much kill
someone with this thing the buttons are
very easy to press I don't have any
issues swiping up from the bottom it
definitely feels a little unnatural in
the hand because of its sheer size
luckily I do have large hands so it's
not bad bad for me but if you have tiny
hands then this is definitely not for
you this case is definitely for people
who are more outdoorsy whether you're
hiking whether you're construction
worker if you go diving whatever the
hell you do outside if you need full
protection case this is definitely it
especially considering the price that's
only 15 dollars compared to let's say on
a heavy duty case from OtterBox which is
around 50 bucks then you're definitely
getting a lot more for the money going
with a case like
yes obviously you cannot charge
wirelessly on its and as far as the
charging dock I think the flap is
actually gonna get in the way we can try
it out though yeah now that the flap is
in the way so unfortunately you're stuck
to the usual charging via cable one of
the things I really like about the case
is the vibrate switch mechanism it's
actually done really well on this case
compared to the other one that I was
having problems with it's very accurate
and there's a button over here on the
side I would push it up and it would
take it on vibrate push it down it would
put it on silent so very nice job there
no complaints there's definitely some
distortion when listening to music and
especially taking calls because it is a
waterproof case so there's a small seal
on the top speaker portion but that's
kind of the trade-off you get when
you're going for a full protection heavy
duty case like this alright so out of
these cases my favorite one has to be as
to give this one like I mentioned before
the overall feel and it's compatible
with wireless charging that's one of the
things that got me sold on this I love
the feel the build quality of this case
definitely my favorite one out of the
rest some of the cases in here actually
have its own purpose for example if you
want the ultimate protection dustproof
shockproof water cooling water cooling
oh my god what the hell am i smoking on
shockproof dustproof and waterproof then
obviously this is the best case out
there that'll give you more bang for
your buck compared to other heavy-duty
cases out there that are overcharging
the crap out of you guys this tiny
little case here is actually pretty cool
if you want to slap something on for a
quick kickstand or maybe you want to
hold your phone more securely that's
pretty cool side case to have I don't
know if I reckon if I can recommend this
as a main case the case from ghost tech
is really nice if you only carry cards
around with you it's built really well
it's light I love the material on here
definitely one of the really good cases
out there for card holders the most
affordable case on here which also gives
you the most value I would say
personally is this one I still can't
believe it's six dollars I don't know
how on earth this company is making
money for around five bucks you get a
clear back cover and you get pretty
decent protections really light doesn't
add much bulk to your phone or
all this is a very solid buy I'm very
very impressed with that one but I
pretty much wraps up this video I've
been here for literally over an hour
making this video for you guys so I hope
you enjoyed it and if you did tossing a
like would be awesome if you guys didn't
like it feel free to dislike that is
fine too
you can find all the cases mentioned
below as well as these awesome
accessories in the comments section
thank you so much for watching I will
see you in the next one guys the results
are finally back I'm gonna be sharing
with you my DNA story and if you guys
recall a few months ago I partnered with
23andme and I sent over a saliva sample
to their lab for them to test out and
well results came in 23andme is an
ancestry service that can help you
understand your DNA better you'll be
able to see which regions around the
world your ancestors came from and learn
how your DNA influences your facial
features hair taste preferences and more
right now they are having a special
holiday offer through December 26th so
go check them out at 23andme comm slash
text source I'll also drop a link below
also guys I want to point out that I
have not looked at my results just yet
this is actually the first time I'm
gonna check them out right in front of
you so I'm pretty excited alright so it
looks like I have five ancestry reports
let's check this out
96.9% Middle Eastern it even gives me a
breakdown so 97.5% Middle Eastern and
North African 0.8% European 0.7% South
Asian okay those of you that don't know
I'm actually Armenian but I was born in
Russia so it's interesting to see this
breakdown let's take a look at my traits
so asparagus odor detection likely can
smell bitter taste likely can taste back
here likely little upper back hair very
little bald spot no bald spot so that is
hundred percent accurate well it's got a
bunch of other traits in here light or
dark hair likely dark that's also true
let's check wellness genetic weight
predisposed to weight less than average
caffeine consumption likely to consume
more yep very true more likely to be a
deep sleeper that's also true alright so
I think that's enough about me that was
pretty interesting and some pretty scary
stuff a lot of that stuff is out
to be very accurate because when I try
it out for yourself make sure to visit
the lean 23andme comm slash tech source
