Texas and welcome to deep budget bills
for the month of February this is Bud
Tron the $350 gaming PC that can run GTA
5 in ultra settings like on my budget
build on the channel there will be a
build guide showing you step-by-step on
how to build this exact same PC and how
to install a fresh copy of windows also
for the first time ever I will now show
you guys how to overclock the pcs and
all of my build guides so definitely
leave a like if you're excited to see
that you guys can also find the links to
all of the parts I use for this build
down below in the description section
so this PC is running on an Intel G
32:58 which I overclocked to 4.3
gigahertz and I paired it with the ZOTAC
GeForce GTX 750 Ti and eight gigabytes
of RAM for the motherboard I went with
the Asus H 81 M a micro ATX and for
storage I chose one terabyte of hard
drive space from Seagate as usual I
could have gone with 430 watts from EVGA
but for five dollars more I decided to
upgrade to 500 watts instead because why
not and I packed everything inside the
rolls will F be M 0 1 mini tower case
which is quite possibly the ugliest case
known to mankind but for only 30 bucks
it was an easy choice I did leave links
down below for optional parts like an
SSD and aftermarket cooler and even
options for beefier graphics cards for
those of you that want a little more
power for temperatures the core is hover
around 54 degrees on idle and jump to a
stable 60 degrees during gaming which is
actually pretty good considering it's on
a stock cooler where benchmarks are
scored eight thirty eight thirty nine
and five strike you guys can see where
it stacks up against my other budget
built on the channel it's exactly where
it should be for editing it managed to
render out a 60 second 4k video file in
a little over 10 minutes which isn't
that great to be honest I mean it does
have two cores after all so I would only
recommend this PC for editing it's more
aimed towards gaming alright so what can
$350 get you in terms of gaming
well let's take a look
so that's what the benchmarks thank you
guys so much for watching the video I
love doing these monthly PC builds and
if you guys enjoy watching them to make
sure leave a like as it does help me out
a ton i've already gathered parts for my
next pc build which is going to be
inside of an ITX case a mini ITX case I
should say and you guys can follow me on
Twitter and Instagram if you want sneak
peeks but that's it thank you guys so
much again for watching and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
