many subscribers hit that button since
day one
that is insane thank you guys so much I
swear I feel like I make these videos
like every two months every time I had a
hundred thousand subscribers the
channels growth rate is phenomenal it is
out of control I'm still trying to get
used to it and it's all possible because
of you guys hitting that button and
leaving your feedback thank you guys so
much for this I sound very redundant
there's really nothing new to say other
than just thanking you guys so much for
your support so as always every time I
get a hundred thousand more subscribers
I do a special giveaway on the channel
but this time it's gonna be a little
different I'm gonna be hosting this
giveaway on my twitch account and it's
gonna be a live giveaway I have a
storage room full of a bunch of tech
items that I have accumulated over the
past year and they're just sitting there
kind of collecting dust I don't have
time to sell it and I don't want to
throw it away so might as well just give
it to you guys there's a bunch of stuff
there ranging from speakers to
headphones earphones gaming gear like
keyboards mice monitors and stuff like
that
and I will be giving away minimum 20 of
that stuff to you guys and it's gonna be
on the 30th of April 6 p.m. Pacific
Standard Time so make sure you guys
bookmark that I'll write that on your
calendar once again that is the 30th of
April 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time so
whatever time zone you guys are in make
sure to write that down there will be
some of the stuff in there for
international viewers but most of it
will be us only just because shipping
costs will probably kill me so as I
mentioned before this is a live giveaway
meaning that I'm actually gonna be
asking you guys questions and the first
person to answer it will receive that
prize and these are questions that only
my subscribers would know for example
like what's name my dog or what kind of
car do I Drive or and what episode of
setup or is this happen or that
basically some questions like that so
will be hard some will be easy just
depends on how expensive the product
how big the product is so there's
definitely chances for everyone to win I
also want to officially announce that
I've launched my t-shirt store in
cooperation with my network BB TV and
guys couldn't find the link to that down
below in case you guys are interested in
buying t-shirts or other apparel I know
I've been getting a bunch of questions
on what am I gonna be launching t-shirts
so there you go it's Kurt it's
officially live you guys can check it
out these are a little different in
terms of design in terms of design these
aren't the ones that you've seen before
on the channel you know the ones with
the tech source actually a little bit
these designs are what I'm talking about
these are currently still in progress
they are not ready yet I'm looking with
a different store to launch these but
the ones I'm actually launching with BB
TV are more professional and a lot
cleaner
I think but anyways if you guys are
interested check it out and before I in
this episode I want to ask you guys
something
would you guys like to see a video
dedicated on how to run a successful
YouTube channel if so let me know in the
comment section down below I've been
doing YouTube for almost three years now
and I can safely say that I know what
works and I know what doesn't work and
if you guys don't believe me I'll leave
a link to my social blade stats and you
can compare that to other channels with
over a million subscribers and you guys
can see that my growth rate is on par
with those channels even though I only
have 600,000 subscribers but anyways if
you guys are interested in that type of
video let me know in the comments
section down below but that's basically
for this video stay tuned for the
giveaway if you guys are interested in
t-shirts check out the links below let's
aim for that 700,000 subscribers my goal
is to hit a million by the end of this
year so hopefully by December 31st and I
look and I know that kind of seems
far-fetched but I think I can do it as
long as I keep on this consistency and
this dedication
thank you guys so much for your
continued support I love you and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
