always any time and chitchat so let's go
ahead and unbox some of these oh let's
go to stop with some fan mail as always

was holding this the wrong way so I
think this is the correct way of holding
it correct me if I'm wrong again but I'm
new to this whole 'quran bit knife
uneven Heisey Currumbin type anyways
let's start with some letters so this
one is from froome's ik and he's also

me a list of parts and he wants me to
comment on it and tell them what the
parts are good so I will take a look at
this and email you back this one is from
iDEN Lyndell and he wants some
information and some advice on starting
a tech channel I see your email on here

I think we have a few more fan mail and
then we can proceed to the other boxes I
think we have one from here and another
one here so let's go and open these up I
don't even open this one up let's see
have a poster of something of some sort
smiling Asian teenage boy should I even
dare open this what what it's a smiling
teenage boy but he doesn't look like
he's smiling to be honest
there we go dude you spent $9.97 on this
that is a lot Thank You Hasan for
sending this and
at least this would be something to
distract you guys what dude this is a
mousepad of my face I don't even know
what the hell I was looking at I think
this was from one of my ask me videos
the stuff you guys sent me honestly it
doesn't even stop there we have a legit
t-shirt with the same face there's
something on there the best tech
youtuber ever made in you guys are gonna
grill me out even what flag that is deaf
friends you're an idiot I don't know who
sent this to me there is no name on
there but seriously you guys you made my
day this is hilarious I wish a mouse pad
was a bit bigger but opening a fan mail
honestly is one of the best things of
doing this episode and I'll jump IPO box
if you guys want to send me stuff I'll
open it up in these videos oh so this is
a mount for my H 5 zoom and with my
order this is because I'm going to be
doing a vlog where I'm going to be
moving around outside is a very special
thing I purchased if you on my Twitter
account or Instagram you know what's
happening I made a very big purchase and
I'm excited to bring you guys a vlog I
can't tell you anything else about it
looks like they send me a pack of Axe
body spray this is not sponsored I
bought this myself I thought I ordered
one but I guess this is a six pack I
can't obviously can't read but yeah so
this is another loot gaming unboxing as
I'm sure you've seen is a bunch on the
channel already but the loot gaming is a
subscription a monthly subscription
service where they send you a box of
loot they have a different types of loot
crate's this one is specifically for
gaming let's pop this open and see
what's inside oh these are pretty cool
I'm not a huge fan of overwatch but I'm
sure this is something you overwatch
fans would really appreciate looks like
there are video figurines that they're
sending and it is a and it is part of AI
collectible so you can collect up to six
on here this is pretty cool
looks like we got a little Reaper
years missing an arm I don't know if the
actual character is missing an arm but
this dude is missing an arm they ask you
how you're you say that you're fine
you're not really fun well I'll say yeah
it looks like we have a titanfall
t-shirt this looks pretty sweet you know
I'll tell you something though making a
video every single day I run out of
shirts to wear so I'm glad that they're
sending me always a shirt in these boxes
so I can definitely change things up a
bit
looks like they also sent some socks I
guess this is from Legend of Zelda
I think that's Ganondorf again don't
kill me guys got some gloves from Sonic
the Hedgehog fingerless gloves I should
say oh this is pretty neat
pac-man adhesive bandages that's it you
only get like eight Super Mario Bros 2
magnets for your refrigerator or
whatever is metal I guess a rumble bobby
pin I don't know what this is from and
last but not least we have a poster like
always what is this Oh looks like this
is just a theme of loot crate and I
guess the theme is Rumble that kind of
makes sense now there goes the Asian boy
so that is all the items in the loot
crate added up as always if you guys
want to sign up or when I check these
guys out there is a link down below if
you do sign up use my code you will get
a discount on your first subscription

to the other boxes so we got a pair of
so drop two headphones I did do a video
on the first pair of these or first
version of these on the channel so
expect the video on these in a few weeks
so very psyched to give this psyched can
speak very psyched to do a video on
these I really love the first one so I'm
assuming the second one's going to be
better or at least I hope so
mmm
ladies and gentlemen we have the ps4 pro
in house there's going to be a
comparison between this and the ps4 slim
so make sure you guys stick around in
fact the video should be up before you
even watch this so if it is I'll leave a
link to it down below
very Stokes to give this a shot sach tri

GPU in this box let me know in the
comments section if there is a GPU let
me know which GPU you think it is if you
guess right I will send you the GPU
