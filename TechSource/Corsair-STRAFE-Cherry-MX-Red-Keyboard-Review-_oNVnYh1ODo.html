tech source and in this video I'm going
to be unboxing and reviewing the new
Corsair strafe gaming keyboard it's a
mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX
switches and each key is separately
backlit which means that you can select
and choose which key you want to
customize and I'll get more into that
later in this video for those of you
that are unfamiliar to MX switches there
are basically three common colors red
brown and blue switches each color
represents how clicky the key press is
as well as the feedback you receive
after hitting each key the Cherry MX red
switches delivers smooth linear key
response and are less clicky than the
blue switches a lot of you note that I
have been using the x4 Sidewinder
keyboard for the longest time and I've
been wanting to switch over to a solid
mechanical keyboard that's great for
gaming and productivity which is why I
was excited to test this out for a whole
week and see if this can be my new
keyboard so popping open the box we can
see a plastic bag that contains the
manual and warranty information and then
the keyboard itself we have a full
plastic frame for the keyboard with a
matte finish for the keys which is great
because the glossy or polished finish
attracts fingerprints or as matt doesn't
the spacebar has a textured surface to
help distinguish it from the other keys
plus it adds a nice overall look to the
keyboard I also really like the red
outline behind the keys it definitely
makes the entire keyboard pop out and
black and red just looks so damn good
together but I'm sure you guys already
know that as I mentioned before you get
very smooth and linear response with
each key press and they are less clicky
than the blue MX switches and not as
loud but you can still hear it so if
you're a live streamer on Twitch or
record yourself gaming it's definitely
noticeable here's a quick demo of how it
sounds while typing there is one thing I
don't like about the keyboard and it's
the missing wrist rest which is really
crucial to me since I type up my scripts
for my videos and I need wrist support
so that my hands are at a comfortable
angle and that I can reach every key
easily without it it's very
uncomfortable to type for long periods
of time on the top right you will find a
three setting brightness control along
with a dedicated key for the Microsoft
Store
it seems and the back you will find a
single USB pass-through which I would
have preferred to be on the side for a
more convenient access but I'm sure that
they put that there for esthetic reasons
the keyboard not only looks a lot better
with no holes on the sides but you can
also run the cable outward and straight
into the back of your PC which looks
more natural I also really like the fact
that the keyboard isn't extended with
extra macro keys on the sides that I
never end up using anyways there also
isn't any dedicated multimedia buttons
anywhere on the keyboard and instead
they added them alongside the F keys
which is brilliant
they only kept the important keys which
contributes to a smaller more compact
form factor on the bottom of the
keyboard you can find the four rubber
feet on the corners and they work really
well you also get two tiny legs if you
want the keyboard to be at a slight
angle now I'm sure most of you know that
I have a black and red theme so this
keyboard fits beautifully in my setup
you don't need an RGB keyboard if you
have a similar setup like mine there's
really no need to pay extra if the only
colour you're after is red so as I
mentioned before the keyboard comes with
a three setting brightness control we
have low medium and high and for some
reason the light radiates from top to
bottom in the video but it's not like
that in person instead you get a solid
static color I also like the
backlighting being exposed from both
sides I think it really makes the
keyboard stand out especially when
you're using it at night
productivity why is the thing that the
keyboard will be a lot more comfortable
with a wrist rest if you are planning on
typing for a long period of time
now for gaming I experienced no problems
at all since majority of the time my
fingers are in the same exact location
so a wrist rest is not needed I really
do like the feedback I get from the
Cherry MX switches each key press is
quick and smooth but most importantly
they are not as loud and clicky as the
blue switches lastly let's take a quick
look at the software and what you can
customize on the keyboard under the
actions tab is where you assign keys
with specific tasks you can set up
macros a specific text to quickly fill
out forms or chat and you can also
program a repeated keystroke for auto
fire and FPS games show cuts to your
favorite applications and media controls
as well along with a few other options
that also involve your mouse on the
profile page you can customize which
keys you want to light up by simply
dragging a box over them or
by clicking on each one of them
individually by holding down the control
key you can also control the brightness
manually here for each key using this
option down below and additionally you
can add an effect like the visor which
shifts colors from one side of the
keyboard to the other a rain effect or
even a pulse effect that slowly fades in
and out there are also two typing modes
that activate a certain effect as you
type the first one just lights up the
key that you press and slowly fades away
after a few seconds and the second
effect which is my personal favorite
causes a ripple effect around the key
that you press those are just the basic
options however if you really want to
get creative you can customize each
effect to your liking in the lighting
tab whether that's adjusting the
intensity adding a timer or even the
brightness level by the way you guys can
find the full manual on their site if
you're interested so that's basically my
review on the core search rave keyboard
my final verdict would be thumbs up on
gaming and somewhere in the middle for
productivity
if courser added the wrist rest on the
keyboard it would have been a definite
yes for me and I would easily switch
over from my x4 Sidewinder for those of
you that are not into the black and red
kind of theme keyboards then the k70 RGB
addition is definitely a nice option for
you guys I'm going to leave a link to
that as well as this keyboard down below
if you guys want to check that out
if you guys enjoy the video and want me
to continue doing keyboard reviews like
these then let me know by leaving a like
on the video and if there's a specific
keyboard you guys want me to pick up and
do a review on next let me know by
dropping a comment down below but that's
basically it thank you guys so much for
watching this is Ed and I'll see you in
the next video
