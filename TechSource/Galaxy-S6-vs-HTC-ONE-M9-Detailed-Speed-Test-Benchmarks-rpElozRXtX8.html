what's up guys it's at from Texas and in
this video I will be conducting a very
detailed speed test as well as benchmark
tests between the galaxy s6 and the HTC
One m9 here are the specs of both phones
they are both winning an octa-core
processor with three gigs of ram so it
should be an interesting test
considering both phones were released
within a week from each other both bones
are running the latest android software
5.0 point2 lollipop and also both of
them are connected to the same wireless
network with maximum brightness and no
background apps running so that's it I'm
going to go ahead and start off with a
fresh reboot and let you guys enjoy the
show
you

the listings for McDonald's within seven
miles what's the weather gonna be like
tomorrow tomorrow's harvest or glasses
on Amanda lady lady great ingredients
sunny will movies are playing tomorrow

tomorrow what time is it in England
well there you have it a clear winner of
the speed test and benchmarks as well
the galaxy s6 is by far the faster and
better performing phone than the HTC One
m9 in fact it's been creaming all the
phones I've been putting it up against
and you guys can find a list of those
speed tests in the description section
down below but anyways as it for the
video if you enjoyed it please hit that
like button if you didn't feel free to
dislike and let me know what you guys

specific test or comparison you want to
