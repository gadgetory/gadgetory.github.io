guys have 2 to 3 weeks to send in your
potato setups but anyways with that said
welcome to setup wars episode 115 budget
Edition let the setup wars begin as
always let me clarify the budget Edition
is not broke edition it's basically
people who build setups based on a
budget instead of going with the 1080
they go to 1060 instead of going with 3
monitors they only go with a single
monitor so basically these setups were
built with a budget in mind
so with that said let's begin the show
starting up the show we got Ian with a
pretty simple black-and-white setup he's
rocking a 24 inch monitor from Ben Q and
the logitech Atlas keyboard and g502
mouse which by the way is custom painted
it's interesting that he doesn't have a
mousepad though I love how he hit his
boom arm in the back of the monitor
which is holding the BM 800 microphone
very nice choice on his placement there
and there's also symmetry in this setup
notice how we added those three banners
on each side of the acoustic foams also
the Megaman pixel and the Samsung
wireless charger contribute to the
symmetry of the setup very nice for
audio is rocking a pair of Logitech V
200 speakers the snow-white Edition and
the popular and 50 X's that are hanging
from the side of the desk oh and
speaking of the desk it's actually
custom made I just love the wiring job
of the keyboard and mouse and the cables
behind this PC the rest of the wires are
not visible but I'm going to assume that
he did a great job and speaking of the
PC it's got an i-5 3330
GTX 1050 this is definitely a clean
budget setup thingie we enforced under
not to show it Samaras next up with his
kylo Ren theme setup I love that kylo
Ren mural you got up there but it kind
of looks a bit crooked and I feel like
it's a bit too high up there there's
definitely a lot of empty space between
the monitor and the painting but that's
just my two cents
he's rocking a 28 inch Samsung monitor
and the genesis CX 55 keyboard and mouse
combo the symmetry is kind of ruined
from that trust GXT speaker that's
sitting on top of the ps4 but it's not
really a big deal in fact what you can
do to fix that is to put the ps4 under
your monitors just pick up a cheap
monitor stand like this one for example
and put your monitor on top of it and
your ps4 on the right so I will give you
some extra space on the right side and
you don't have to place your speaker on
the ps4 aside from the truss speakers he
does have the Logitech G 230 gaming
headset off to the right side resting on
the acrylic stand cable management is
really good but I'm kind of curious as
to why you picked up a signal rack if
it's not holding up anything significant
it's literally holding up a few wires
which i think is over killed a child
raceway would have been a better option
for you
and finally the PC is using is equipped
with a 6500 and a gtx 1016 overall not
bad it's organized for the most part but
does need a few tweaks to improve
regardless thank you with Lamar for
entering sometimes it's good being on a
budget it forces you to be creative and
build things yourself if you don't have
the money in the first place like Casper
for example and is interesting custom PC
that he built from steel and laser cut
acrylic I'm sure it's got outdated specs
but it looks pretty damn cool it's also
interesting to see fans outside of a
case the setup on the other hand is
pretty basic and straightforward we got
the 22 inch yama monitor which he
happened to overclock to 75 Hertz would
you look at that
and a wireless keyboard and mouse from
Logitech the only audio sources got are
those creative t20 speakers and the
cable management is under control thanks
to the cable box and some zip ties it
may be a basic setup but it's clean and
it works
Thank You Casper for entering I don't
think there's another set up out there
that truly belongs on this budget
episode of setup wars when you look up
the definition of budget this is the
picture that you are presented with so
apparently max Lewis entire budget on
his PC and had only $10 left in his
pocket which he ended up spending on
three CRT monitors from Craigslist I'm
pretty sure the custom-made monitor
stands came with a purchase that's
looking marvelous so aside from the
beautiful displays he's using the
Corsair k70 keyboard and the m65 mouse
that's sitting on top of a crappy ass
mousepad that he bought some fries you
seriously are on a budget for audio he's
rocking the polaroid audio tower which
is quite possibly the ugliest speaker's
I have ever seen he also has the
SteelSeries Octus v gaming headset
seriously though I can't believe you got
all those three monitors for just $10
talk about a spiel suprisingly as cable
management isn't bad considering he is
using a glass desk but it kind of looks
like there's a lot of stuff going on
back there and I feel like you took
pictures at a perfect angle not to show
any of that clutter sneaky bastard and
finally the PC that somehow magically
powering this setup is a custom loop
inside eternal take p5k it's rockin a
7500 K that's overclocked to 4.9
gigahertz and not one but two GTX 1080p
is in sli because we all know that one
isn't enough to power those three very
demanding monitors a very
budget-friendly setup Thank You max for
entering and also for teaching us has to
spend our money on gear last but not
least as Paul and his ultra clean white
and black set up between a 27-inch a2
smarter we also got the CM quickfire
rapid keyboard with custom key caps and
the m65 pearl mouse this is actually the
first time that I've seen a black
extended mousepad with white edges and I
think you made a great choice here with
the white on black contrast it's very
beautiful
there was a bungee holding up the wire
for the m65 and we also got a basic
stereoscopic mic on the left side for
audio inputs four outputs we got a pair
of MX 30s hanging from the wall I'm not
sure what's going on with that wired oh
well let's work on the cable management
underneath the desk this is actually a
great example of someone not using a
Signum rack or a channel raceway for
cable management all he used were velcro
straps to keep the cables together and
hit it nicely done the white on black
contrast is very nice and kept it
consistent throughout the setup the PC
is no exception would be black and
whites leaving and the fans I also like
how you match the color of the logo on
the GPU to his LED lights it's very
subtle but it looks nice I don't know if
I agree with your poster above your
setup though I mean I get that it's Star
Wars related but it's kind of messing
with your color scheme I feel like the
popular stormtrooper wall art with it
perfectly but other than that if they
very clean setup Thank You Paula and
crane so that is it for this episode
