and welcome to another cool tech episode
this time we are looking at tech under
$50 and actually you guys can try out a
few the products mentioned in this video
by using the app called nice not only
can you browse through your favorite
youtubers and watch video straight from
the app but you also get to try the
products featured in the videos for free
so if you guys want to check out the app
make sure to download it by using the
link down below it's also available for
both iOS and Android so I talked a lot
about headphone stands on the channel
especially on set up Wars so I think
it's time to give earphone some love
this here is an earbud stand or holder
that's compatible with most earphones if
you constantly use earbuds and don't
have a dedicated place for them then
this might be something you'll be
interested in now obviously it's not as
convenient to hang your earbuds compared
to actual headphones but it will really
clean up your desk or set up if you
decide to use them simply wrap the cable
around three of your fingers until they
are nice and compact and then you can
toss them inside the compartment in the
back and slide over the door then you
can bring them up and rest them on the
holders tell me that doesn't look clean
next up we have a simple yet cool
charging cable for both Apple and micro
USB devices now let's set this cable
apart from the rest is that they have
magnetic tips there's a microUSB and
lightning version you simply connect one
of the tips to your devices and then
bring the cable over close enough until
they snap together the purpose of this
is to charge your devices a lot easier
so instead of plugging them in you can
now just snap them in I guess well
technically the lightning cable goes in
either side so it's pretty easy to plug
that in it's actually the microUSB cable
that sometimes frustrating to plug in
since there's only one correct way but
with the magnetic tip you don't have to
worry about which way you are connecting
the devices also the cable allows for
faster charging with an input of 2 point
4 amps maximum so doesn't matter which
tip you use because you will get filled
up faster
actually this is the product you can try
out for free by using the app nice that
I talked about earlier so if you guys
are interested in trying this out for
free be sure to download the app by
visiting the link below now this next
item is something you guys might enjoy
this is the Doberman security hanging
alarm you stick it between your door and
once someone opens it up they hear this
it's seriously the coolest little
security device I have in my home it's
simple cheap but very effective the way
it works is this it's actually very
simple once the two aluminium pieces
separate from each other the alarm
activates and you hear this extremely
loud and annoying alarm my entire
apartment complex can hear this thing go
off which is great because if a thief
tries to break in while we're not home
he's gonna bolt out of there as soon as
possible not because he's afraid of
getting cut because this thing is very
loud and annoying it doesn't even have
to be a door you can be creative and
hide this in between objects let's say
you have a stack of GPUs that you want
to protect from thieves well simply
slide the alarm between one of the boxes
and when someone tries to take one boom
Boston so yeah this thing pretty much
works in any crevice or crack if you
know what I mean last but not least we
have this pretty dope desk lamp from
taotronics not only is a touchscreen but
it's more flexible than Breann I mean
you can pretty much twist the head raise
the neck bend the entire body down or up
and even rotate the entire thing it's
very very flexible
alright alright I'm done that's that's
the last one on her promise there's also
five different lighting types that you
can set depending on the situation
whether you're reading a book on your PC
or getting in the mood for a little
something something in all seriousness
though this is a very good-looking and
high tech desk lamp perfect for pretty
much any bedroom office or a desk set up
oh and it also has a USB charging port
in the back as always you guys can find
all the products linked down below in
case you want to check them out and we
should leave a like if you enjoy
