to setup or it's episode 170 laptop
Edition that's right guys we'll be
looking at some dope setups featuring
only a laptop no desktop PCs over here
but if you guys want to put this fate
you know what to do make sure to watch
the video link down below and with that
said let the set up or is begin you guys
might be asking ed what is this gorgeous
laptop that's right in front of you
nobody just me well I'm gonna tell you
anyways this sexy laptop is the envy by
HP starting at just seven ninety-nine
that sports intel's 8th gen core i7
processor up to 16 gigs of ram and an
nvidia geforce MX 150 this particular
model has a 17.3 inch 4k IPS display
however there are 1080p with touchscreen
models available with the envy you can
do it all you can use it for
productivity or light gaming tons of
connectivity including Thunderbolt 3
support an SD card reader and even an
optical drive who still uses that with a
full sized backlit keyboard integrated
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen speakers and up to 10
hours and 45 minutes of battery life you
can enjoy the HP Envy just about
anywhere to learn more click the link
below at first glance you might think
this setup is powered by an actual
custom PC but it's actually hooked up to
a 13-inch MacBook Pro the purpose of the
setup is for console gaming and
productivity he's got two 34 inch curved
monitors from Samsung sitting on a 98
inch counter top of my Kia and that's
being supported by a few 3d printed
risers and Alex drawers now since this
is a MacBook based setup he did stick
with the Apple keyboard and mouse and I
gotta appreciate the dedication to the
old white color scheme I mean apart from
the color of the mousepad
the wall painting and the soda perks
from black ops zombies which kind of
give the setup a nice pop I feel like
too much white in any setup is a bit too
bland I love that Adam has for Astro a
50s hanging from the wall shelves two of
them are for his ps4 and two for his
xbox 1s cables are managed nicely
underneath the desk with a couple of
Signum racks and it looks like the
cables from both the Natalie
are routed through the wall I'm not
really sure if that's accurate because I
can't seem to find the cables
maybe it's Photoshop but either way it
looks very clean this setup is
definitely there I say it overkill for
console gaming I think we need to get
Adam over to the PC master-race
immediately but fantastic job either way
putting all this together I love the
presentation and the personality thank
you for entering this next setup from
Chris is a little more straightforward
nothing fancy or over-the-top it has its
purpose and nothing more however it is a
bit cluttered it's used for gaming and
programming and is being powered by an
Acer predator 17 or the GTX 1070 he's
using a single monitor with the Logitech
G 9 10 keyboard and the G 9 or 3 Mouse
with a set of speakers from creative
there's actually a few things you can do
to improve this setup for one if you
need a more convenient way of using your
laptop I recommend buying a single
monitor arm and attaching a notebook
mount to it allows you to move the
laptop around anywhere on your desk you
can also get a monitor riser to lift up
the display because it looks too close
to the desk
and this way you can store things
underneath it to free up some of the
clutter for example those books you have
or the router behind a monitor it will
also help alleviate any neck strain from
looking down adding a pencil drawer like
this underneath the desk will give you
some extra storage space for smaller
items like the RGB remote and also
notice you use a giant cable sleeve for
the wires on the ground and a cable box
to hide the power strip however I would
recommend a wall raceway to hide the
cables running down the wall with all
these tweaks I really think this setup
would look a lot cleaner the icing on
the cake would be some personality
however you want to implement that maybe
some posters on the wall collectibles or
simply adding acoustic foams for that
extra spice but either way thank you
Chris for entering this next setup from
danwon has to be one of my favorite
laptop setups featured on the show
because of the creativity and the
attention to detail starting off with
the dual monitors mounted against the
beautiful hallstatt countertop with the
aluminum borders both monitors are
hooked up to is pluggable docking
station which is then hooked up to his
dell inspiron laptop on a
Stan it looks like he installed the same
borders he put on the side of the
countertop on the actual wall shelves to
stick with the white black and silver
theme apparently he wanted to stay
consistent with his drumming set one of
the things that caught my eye originally
was the placement of his speakers so he
mounted them underneath the wall shelves
and he ran the cable straight down using
a wall race wave this way he's able to
use the top of the shelves to store
extra stuff plus I think that looks
cooler this way aside from the speakers
he also uses the audio technica and 40
X's and has a blue snowball microphone
hooked up to his monitor arm a hole is
drilled in the desk for his peripherals
and those wires are routed towards the
back into a channel raceway the extra
space between the table and the drawers
from the Capitol legs allowed him to
store extra items like his external hard
drive from WD a beautifully executed
setup with lots of personality and
attention to detail Thank You Devon for
blessing our eyes at number four is
Rohan with a simple slightly modern
gaming setup that he also uses for
schoolwork and drying he's using a 32
inch curved monitor from Samsung with
the red dragon RGB keyboard and a razer
naga hex gaming mouse for audio he's
using he beats solo through headphones
which are resting on a custom-made
hanger however he does have a pair of
speakers that he uses as well so we
tucked away the cables inside the desk
and he drowned other wires behind a
monitor towards the bottom where he has
his gaming laptop it's actually a pretty
clever way of hiding your laptop but
doesn't it get kind of annoying having
to reach underneath it every time just
to turn it off or on I love what you did
with the setup you kept it really clean
and simple and still managed to spice it
up using a few Natale panels and RGB
strips great work thank you for entering
wrapping up the episode is Wil from
tennessee and a super clean and
productive setup that he uses for music
production so he's got a 27 inch 4k
monitor from LG that's sandwiched by two
massive JBL speakers one of the
advantages of having an island set up
like this is that you have extra space
behind the desk to work with in this
case we'll took advantage of that space
for his massive speakers the downside
however is cable management because you
no longer have that wall to help hide
the cables behind
and he will need to run the wires to a
wall outlet leaving a trail of cables
however will did an excellent job
organizing all the cables underneath the
desk and plugging everything into a
parish tip so that way he only has one
cable running across the carpet and into
the wall outlet everything else on the
surface has been kept clean and tidy
with the help of the wireless
peripherals and I just noticed he's
using a Mac Pro and not an actual laptop
well this is awkward at first glance I
honestly thought that Apple device on
the desk was a MacBook Pro but turns out
it's an iPad pro anyways it's a super
clean setup I will thank you for
entering nonetheless and that does it
for this episode of setup wars as always
make sure you guys built in the comments
section on who has the best laptop setup
if you guys enjoy the show quickly
tossed a like and if you don't stand you
can leave it this like I guess thank you
so much again for watching and I will
see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
