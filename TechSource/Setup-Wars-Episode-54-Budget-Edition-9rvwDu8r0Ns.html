always everyone's gear for their setups
along with anything I recommend in this
episode will be linked below
so make sure to check that out but here
are your 5 lucky contestants for this
week we have Eric bass or bass Ethan
I've Elaine and Mike Gees butcher the
crap out of those so first up we have
Eric and a pretty clean set up a 24 inch
acer monitor between two sony speakers
and for the gaming gear we have 2
gigabyte a via a so Miam a keyboard and
had a logitech m7 or five mouse to the
left of the speakers are his phillips
headphones and a custom-made headphone
stand and speaking of custom work the
cable drop and phone stand are also
handmade by Eric himself the PC does
powering the setup has a 6600 K skylake
processor and a GTX 970 Strix gravis
card cable management on the other hand
is on point and everything is neatly
organized other than picking up an
extended mousepad this is a really clean
and straightforward setup thank you Eric
for entering next up we have bass and
his shelf set up and I say shelf because
that's not an actual desk so on the
Shelf we have the AOC 22 inch monitor a
Fujitsu keyboard and a Logitech M 100
mouse on top of a razer mousepad we also
have the BM 700 mic hooked up to in
Oxbow marm
and an M Adio interface in near the back
cable management looks pretty good for
the most part I mean the Signum rack is
holding majority of the cable
and I do see that you did your best to
wrap the cables together and finally the
PCG is using has an i-5 45 90 and a GTX
960 so a few things I would change if
this was my setup firstly I would hook
up the boom arm in the back of the desk
instead of having it so close to you the
arm should be long enough to reach
across the desk also picking up a
monitor riser would not only give you
some space underneath to store your
audio interface and receiver but it will
also be in reach of you and lastly
getting a hanger for your headphones
would be the icing on cake lots of
potential to be an even better setup but
this is a great start thank you bass for
entering a number three we have Ethan
with a pretty sweet black and red theme
setup we have a 22 inch Samsung monitor
and the very popular red dragon central
forest keyboard and mouse bundle on top
of the red dragon mouse pad excellent
choices I definitely approve we will
serve a set of Logitech z5o 6 speakers
and a corsair raptor Jas 30 headset on a
black and red chair cable management is
very clean on the ground but it's
extreme chaos up top with some cables
hanging around I think a cable raceway
would help you route the cables through
and conceal most of those wires and I
also like the cable spiral you have used
for the wires running down excellent
choice there the PC that's powering the
setup has a 6600 K and an r7 370 with 16
gigs of RAM overall a pretty sweet
black-and-red setup with little
complaints Thank You Ethan for entering
and here's another budget setup IVA Len
is rocking a 22 inch LG monitor with the
a4tech bloody keyboard and mouse bundle
there's also a set of Logitech x5 30
speakers near the back and it's pretty
much all this setup has the PC has a
6300 that's overclocked to 3.9 and
another r7 370 graphics card I also like
how you use the pullout keyboard drawer
to store a few items the cable
management however most likely needs
some work I think you would just tuck
them away on the side so I won't be able
to see them but I'm sure it's a mess
back there if they are I would advise
using some velcro straps or maybe even a
cable sleeve to wrap them neatly
together also a cable box for your power
strip if you do have one somewhere a
pretty good minimalistic setup Thank You
Ivan friend
last but least we have Mike with our
first dual display set up in the budget
Edition so the monitor on the left is a
19 inch LG and the one on the right is a
24-inch BenQ gaming monitor with a 144
Hertz refresh rate the keyboard he is
using is the arachnid 3 core and we also
have a DeathAdder chroma mouse on top of
the Corsair miles pad a few other things
on the desk are the logitech 2.1
speakers a blue snowball black edition
mic and steel series headset the pc
that's running the setup has an FX 8350
and a gtx 960 inside the in win case I
feel like we're going to see a lot of
AMD builds in the budget edition of
setup Wars cable management is on point
the IKEA mom desk still remains one of
my favorite desks of all times even
until today the cable management rack is
simply amazing and has plenty of surface
area for a multi-monitor setup and even
room for a PC it looks like the
subwoofer is holding up the monitor but
honestly I would recommend putting it
under the desk because subwoofers aren't
meant to be on top of tables also a
headphone hangar would keep your
headphones off of your PC case and maybe
even a boom arm for your mic I would
also use a piece of velcro and wrap
around the PC cables in the back so that
they are organized overall a very sexy
setup no doubt
thank you Mike for entering so it's
basically for the episode I'm kind of
testing the waters with the budget
Edition so if this is something you guys
