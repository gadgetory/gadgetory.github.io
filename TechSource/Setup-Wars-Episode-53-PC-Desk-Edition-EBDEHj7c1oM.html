special episode for you today so not
only do we have an extra episode of
setup boards this week but we have a
special episode as well
welcome to setup wars episode 53 PC desk
edition so these setups are way too good
to be in a regular set of boards episode
and they're overpowered to be in a PC
Wars episode so I thought I'd gather all
the contestants and make a special
dedicated video just for them with the
PC Wars oh Jesus let the set-up wars
begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below if you
guys want to check out the full specs
for these pcs I'll have them linked
below but here are your 5 master
builders we have Corey
giorgos Jeffrey Peter and stands I am so
sorry for butchering your name this
first setup should come as no surprise
since Corey has been featured on PC wars
episode 6 with this very impressive
joker color scheme this monster is
rocking a 59 60 x + 3 EVGA GTX 980 s
super clocked addition it also has 32
gigabytes of RAM and 17 terabytes of
hard drive space 17 terabytes
he's got storage for days of course with
all this power you gotta be rockin a
multi-monitor setup so we have two
27-inch LG monitors sandwiching a
27-inch Asus monitor which are all
hooked up on a monitor arm after all why
would you place those displays on the
desk and block the precious view the
front of the desk houses a car head unit
which the two 4 inch speakers are hooked
up to for listening to radio and also to
receive phone calls by bluetooth through
the desk truly a one-of-a-kind setup
Thank You Corey for starting things off
strong next up we have giorgos that has
a setup which isn't as Extreme as the
first but nonetheless it's still pretty
badass we have a single 27 inch dual
monitor up top a corsair strafe RGB
keyboard and a razer MMO gaming mouse on
top of the awesome red and white build
adding those LED strips around the desk
definitely was a good choice so this
build is rocking a 5820k that's
overclocked to 4.4 and it's paired with
2 sapphire r9 290 s and finally we get
to see some AMD GPUs in these high-end
builds I really like how we use both red
and white tubes and fans to stay
consistent with the theme overall
another awesome PC desk thank you George
for entering jeffrey is next up with
something a little different so instead
of a full glass desk we have a smaller
window showing off his build which
appears to have a red and black theme a
4770k
overclocked 24.0 and a GT
980 paired with the asus rog Maximus 6
motherboard if I'll be honest there's
not much of a presentation on the
outside I mean we have two different
sized monitors and the art on the table
surface really doesn't go well with the
rest of the PC I mean at least it
matches what the speaker stands this
setup definitely has a potential to be
something even better but this is
definitely a start and it's badass
nonetheless now this is what I'm talking
about right off the bat you can see that
the presentation is much better with
Peters setup we have an LG ultra wide in
the middle with two Dell displays in
vertical mode on each side and a pair of
Bose speakers underneath on the desk he
has a Corsair k70 RGB keyboard and the
corsair Sabre mouse on top of the Razer
Firefly mousepad so this is a black and
neon-green theme which is something I've
actually never seen before it's running
a 59 60 X overclock to 4.5 gigahertz and
2 GTX 980 s in SLI even some parts are
painted neon green like the SSDs to give
it that extra spice then you guys might
be wondering where on earth the
radiators are well apparently he put
them on the ground where it's nice and
cool excellent work with cable
management as well just an overall
amazing setup and PC build thank you
Peter for entering last but not least we
have stands and his battle station so we
pretty much have two setups a laptop on
the right and a dual monitor setup to
the left right smack in the middle of
these two you can find two enormous
reservoirs for their water-cooled PC and
below that you can find the build itself
that's running on a 3930k and a gtx 770
I like the front panel that's displaying
the SSDs like it's in some sort of
museum and the red LED strips up top and
the red LED fans near the bottom there's
definitely a lot of planning and work
that got put into the creation of this
and for that I applaud you even though
some parts are outside the desk I still
consider this a PC desk setup Thank You
stands for entering it's gonna be a
tough decision to be honest but which
one of these setups you guys think
deserves to win and move on to the best
desk setups of 2016 make sure you guys
