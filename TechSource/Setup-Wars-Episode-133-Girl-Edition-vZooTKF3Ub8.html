to popular request welcome to setup wars
episode 133 girl edition if you guys
want to participate on the next one
make sure to submit your setup by
watching the video linked below let the
setup wars begin
starting off the episode we got
Elizabeth and her setup that she uses
for gaming and homework she's using a 23
inch monitor from Dell mechanical gaming
keyboard from black web and a wireless
mouse from Logitech for audio she's
using the Turtle Beach px 3s and a pair
of Dell speakers but she also has a
microphone setup as well with a
rebranded BM 800 microphone I gotta say
I like your taste in cars we got the
McLaren p1 on the right side and at
first I thought the left one was an
Aventador but it's actually a veneno
shout out to my Twitter followers for
that super fast response by the way I
also like the custom-made monitor stand
using the house of night series books
that's one way to use them I guess but I
do strongly recommend an actual monitor
stand I know that you're on a tight
budget but you can actually buy one for
as little as 13 dollars from Amazon or
better yet there is one that has space
for extra storage like sheets of paper
and even supplies on the right side for
only four dollars more and since you are
going with a black and blue color scheme
the monitor riser would fit right in
also I'm not sure why you connect with
your headset and keyboard to the front
USB panel of your case your setup would
look a lot cleaner if it's hidden behind
your PC instead and speaking of cables I
don't know if Frankenstein himself was
involved in the management but yeah you
can definitely clean that up a bit first
up I would get rid of all of those nasty
zip ties and electrical tape
I would pick up some cable sleeves
velcro straps and this cable box the
type of desk you have doesn't really
work well with the Tucket in method as I
explained in my cable management guide
your setup actually would benefit from
the let it hang instead wrap the cables
together using the velcro and run them
through the cable sleeve and store the
excess cables along with the parish tip
inside the cable box on the ground the
PC powering the setup has an FX 6300 and
a gtx 10:50 TI and it also looks like
you forgot to plug in the USB cable to
the motherboard header if you're
wondering why one of the front USB ports
don't work well that's why you can even
use some velcro straps to tie the XLR
cable alongside the boom arm
so that way it's not just hanging down
like that next to your desk
I feel like put some minor tweaks you
can improve your setup greatly Thank You
Elizabeth for starting off the episode
and yeah is up next all the way from
Norway and this is her setup for gaming
screaming and editing she didn't include
her twitch account for some reason so
I'm gonna share it with you guys and
I'll leading it below so make sure to
stop by and say what's up she's rocking
to 24 inch monitors that are hooked up
against a mount and the desk she's using
is called the Vika Amman and it's from
Ikea on the desk she's walking Eraser
chroma black widow keyboard and the
SteelSeries rival 700 Mouse she doesn't
use any speakers however she does have
two sets of headsets we got the
SteelSeries Arctic 500 for the PC and
the Turtle Beach elite 800 for the ps4 I
love the black white and red color
scheme you have going on there but I
feel like you can be more consistent
with it picking up some red skins for
the ps4 will definitely contribute and
you should consider wrapping the edge of
the desk in some red skins as well just
to give it that nice contrast against
the black also I'm not sure how invested
you are with that current mousepad but
if this was my setup I would replace it
with any of these three options but I
found on Amazon my personal pick would
be this one from enhanced honestly it
looks sick
but either way I'll leave a link to
everything I mentioned down below the PC
powering setup is a gorgeous very clean
build featuring these 6700 K and the
Asus Trix 1060
I like the custom cables and the a IO
tubing from cable mod and the icing on
the cake was that custom backplate from
v1 tech nicely done by the way the
lights on one of your RAM sticks are off
in case you didn't notice I like that
you mounted the blue snowball ice
microphone behind the monitors and also
notice that there are two lamps mounted
on the desk as well this is a great way
to add some extra light in your setup if
you don't have any space on the desk
itself pretty good job with the cable
management I don't have any major
complaints you did keep all the wires
off the ground and even velcroed some of
them to the legs to keep it from flaring
out the cables on top of the desk cover
can be slightly adjusted I don't know if
you really need a lot cables
for the mouse but if you don't I do
recommend hiding some of that access
underneath the keyboard overall this is
an awesome streaming and editing setup
thank you Anna for entering once again
guys I'll drop a link to a twitch
account if you want to check it out
number three we have Melanie and her
setup that she uses for productivity and
gaming she also has a YouTube channel
called easy tech and I'll drop a link
below if you guys want to check it out
she's using two ASA monitors that she
hooked up on a desk mount and above that
is a 24 inch Samsung monitor that she
uses for console gaming the desk she
built consists of the wooden coral D
countertop and to Alex Shores I
definitely approve of that combination
for peripherals she's walking the e
element mechanical RGB keyboard and the
Roccat Kone gaming mouse I love that you
combine both of the cables together like
this it looks very clean for audio she's
using these super luxe HD 681 semi-open
headphones and the Insignia speaker set
with the subwoofer underneath the desk
for voiceover she's using the NW 715 and
boom arm combo that also comes with the
included phantom power supply some other
stuff that she's got on a desk include a
league of Legends Funko pop a Day of the
Dead skull thingy and a jar filled with
some lights that actually looks pretty
cool key management underneath the desk
is done very well nice use of the Signum
rack to hold everything up and although
I'm against using tape against the
cables it does get the job done so
that's cool finally we got her PC that's
powering this setup and it's actually
using a case that I haven't seen yet so
this is the appeal X cube or I think
that's how you say I don't even know at
this point it's actually a cool looking
micro ATX cube case I might have to do a
build in this sometime but I'm
definitely gonna be using the pink
version though Melanie you got a very
clean and be set up thank you for
entering and good luck with your channel
if you guys want to check her out and
show her some love I'll drop a link to
the channel below all the way from
England we got Sophie he was going to
school for mental health nursing however
her passion is doing YouTube full-time
and this is her setup that she uses
mainly for gaming editing and even
screaming at times if you guys want to
show some love on our YouTube channel
I'll drop a link below
all right so she was going for an
all-white color scheme and I gotta say
she did a pretty good job overall with
the part selection personally I would
have gone with the eraser and Viktor
instead of the Firefly if you really
wanted an all-white setup I only say
that because it doesn't look like you're
going for any contrast so that black
mouse pad kind of just throws off the
color scheme a bit she does have a dual
monitor setup for screaming featuring
two 24 inch curved monitors from Samsung
that are hooked up against the wall and
powering the setup as the GTX 1060 from
EVGA and a 7700 K a very clean build
inside the S 340 case so if he stated
that she likes to keep her desk clutter
free so when she's not streaming she
sometimes removes the mouse and mouse
math off the desk while she's using her
xbox one same with the blue snowball ice
microphone and the razer kraken pro
headset when I was watching her setup
video it looks like she hooks up the
snowball ice mic to a boom arm and
attaches that to the left side of the
desk if you ask me it's kind of
inconvenient constantly moving around
your mic setup personally I will just
leave it there and if you really are
bothered by it you can actually hook it
up behind the monitor somehow see if you
can hook up the boom arm on the wall
mount itself so that you can hide it
whenever you're done using it hiding the
headset is understandable since that is
smaller and easier to disconnect but the
mic setup is a different story
another thing I would recommend to clean
up your setup a bit is by rotating the
razer mouse pad sideways and routing
both mouse and mousepad wire underneath
the keyboard and out through the top
this will eliminate the number of cables
you have going across your desk for a
much cleaner look
the cables under the desk however are
managed very well it looks like you
spent quite some time organizing
everything if you want to get that Xbox
off the ground I recommend mounting it
either against the wall or underneath
your desk and you can actually do that
by using this popular hide it adjustable
mount it's a bit pricey but it's one of
the best Universal mounts out there you
can use it to mount pretty much anything
underneath your desk whether it's the
Wii U Xbox Playstation 4 or anything
that's rectangular and I know Sophie you
live in the UK so I actually did some
research and I found
one that's a little cheaper and also
closer to you I'll double link to that
one below as well you said in your video
that you hate going to school and that's
not your passion instead you want to
create content for a living I just want
to say that I was in the same boat as
you were I was going to school for three
years studying computer engineering and
I absolutely hated it I had no passion
in that and once I gained enough
traction on YouTube I actually quit I
dropped out of school and I pursued
YouTube full-time and Here I am four
years later I guess what I'm trying to
say here is always follow your passion
whoever you are out there watching this
video just don't make any harsh
decisions unless you're 100% confident
that that is what you want to do for the
rest of your life don't look at what
other people have because it's
unrealistic to achieve their same goals
for the longest time I wanted to be the
next PewDiePie but that is never gonna
happen so instead I focused on my goals
and what I wanted to achieve but anyways
I'm getting sidetracked here I just I
saw that poster or the picture on
Sophie's wall that said do what you love
and it kind of sparked me to say
something about it you've got an awesome
and very clean set up I'm confident with
some minor tweaks that it will look even
better Thank You Sophie for entering and
good luck with your school and YouTube
channel wrapping up the episode as stuff
and her triple display setup featuring
three 27-inch Asus monitors we got the
Logitech G 810 keyboard and the g502
Mouse true story this table is actually
a dining table so there is that karate
oh he's rocking a logitech g930 3
headset and the Logitech z5o 6 speakers
which he installed around her room with
some custom made brackets I guess she
was going for a surround sound setup
excellent work would be cable management
I don't have a single complaint I also
like that you used a cable raceway for
these speaker wires against the wall
most people would actually leave the
cables alone so it's nice to see that
the PC part in the setup is sadly on the
ground and it's rocking the 4790k and a
gtx 980 honestly it's a sick looking
black and red set up inside the coarser
carbide 760 T but if you ask me I think
that you have extra space on the table
for your PC just move everything to the
left side and you
should have extra space to put your PC
on the right I would also move that sub
down to the floor not a bad setup a
little bit overkill for my taste but you
manage to keep it very clean and
organized Thank You staff for entering
and that pretty much wraps up this
episode as always make sure you guys
drop your comments below and vote on who
you think has the best desk set up and
I'll announce the winners on my Twitter
and Instagram accounts thank you guys so
much for watching if you enjoy set up
boards dropping a like would be awesome
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
