and in this video we're gonna be
reviewing the Huawei mate 8 after one
month of using this device as my main
driver so let's begin by getting the
specs out of the way the mate 8 has a
Kirin 953 bytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
storage that's expandable via microSD
card slot and a 1080p display all of
this adds to a smooth experience I
haven't had any real stutter issues on
this phone and throughout the month I'm
using it the phone only hangs on me once
one thing I couldn't stand was this
phone's interface it looks very similar
to iOS and I personally don't like the
aesthetics of it one thing to also
mention here is that it doesn't come
with an app drawer which is also a
negative for me as I like to have only
the apps I actually use on my home
screen now let's talk about the hardware
the device is definitely premium in the
way it feels with its metal body
construction it's 1080p screen is not as
dense as some of his phone's competitors
but in all honesty the trade-offs of
using a lower pixel count display like
better battery life is worth the pixel
sacrifice but besides the pics of the
friends the rest of the display is great
with vibrant colors and great viewing
angles the battery life on this phone
definitely does not disappoint either
with it easily lasting a full day of
heavy usage and if you were to use some
of the power saving options you could
easily get two days from a single charge
on this phone the last aspect of this
phone I want to touch on really quick is
the camera the still images are good
most of the time but the video on this
camera is definitely not the best there
is definitely motion blur when recording
at night and I should also mention that
it caps at 1080p but ophélie Huawei will
update this in the future to 4k
recording after using this phone for a
month I can definitely say I would
recommend it but if I've given a choice
between this and the Nexus 6p I would
definitely pick the Nexus 6p you get
better interface in my opinion and
direct updates from Google alright guys
I pretty much wraps up my review of the
Huawei mate 8 it's a solid Android
device but there are better options out
there on the market for around the same
price as always this is that from tech
stores thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
