Texas and welcome to setup wars episode
18 will you submit your desk setup to
get featured on the channel and a chance
to win 50 bucks that's right I raised
the prize money from 25 to 50 which is
still not a lot but it should still help
you towards your next purchase if you
guys are new to the series and want to
submit your desk setup make sure to
watch the video linked down below but
all that nonsense said let the setup
Wars begin this video is brought to you
by g2a where you can buy super cheap
city keys for any game on any platform
this is where I get all my games from as
well as win those keys for my monthly PC
builds but I'll leave a link down below
so you can see for yourself so now that
the LG sponsored episodes are over I'm
gonna be going back to my usual setup
wars episodes which means that I'm only
going to be featuring 5 setups per
episode and I'm going to be doing my
usual recommendations per setup so this
week we have a very special guest Kyle
from awesomesauce Network and he will be
showing off his desk setup at the end of
this episode like me he also has a tech
channel and he does a bunch of really
cool videos on PC related content from
reviews to comparisons and PC builds and
a bunch of other stuff so if you guys
like my content you're gonna love his
content so I'll go to leave a link to
his channel down below and you guys
should definitely check them out after
this video but anyways here are your 5
chosen for this week so we have Aaron
Abdul Adam Tim
Victor and that's for making the to set
up wars episode 18 as always all of the
gear for each setup will be listed down
below in a description section for
anyone that is interested first up is
Aaron with a triple display setup so we
have three BenQ 24-inch monitors a Razer
BlackWidow tournament chroma keyboard
Razer Naga Mouse all on top of the
Goliath is extended mousepad also on a
desk we have a blue Yeti Mike and a
bunch of consoles to the rights it
appears that the third monitor is used
for console gaming whereas the other two
are hooked up to the PC you do have a
lot of consoles we have an Xbox one a
360 and a white ps4 with a pair of astro
a40 s sitting on top cables are hidden
for the most part and I'm just going to
assume that the random keyboard box down
there isn't hiding any cables and it's
just there for aesthetic reasons but
overall a pretty dope triple monitor
setup I would probably move Spock away
from the center and put them to the side
so it's not a fun of the monitors and
maybe move the Astro control box either
under the desk or somewhere else so it's
just not sitting there now if you really
want a much cleaner setup you can pick
up three separate monitor stands and put
one console and a few controllers and
our each one of them to free up some
space next up is up duel with his game
room setup so looks like we have a lot
going on here and it looks like we have
three separate setups on the main setup
you have a 27-inch Asus monitor aka 95
RGB keyboard m65 RGB Mouse and a rock at
a pure email spongy up top you have a
shelf with some speakers headphones and
above those are some pretty dope looking
posters the only one I recognize is
these other one in the middle the set up
to the right has a 31 inch Samsung TV
hooked up to the wall with more LEDs and
speakers there are literally LEDs
everywhere you basically have enough
lights in here to throw in your own
grave
on the third setup we have a 19 inch
Dale monitor and a sony laptop
underneath that we have a mountain of
CDs and a bunch of headphone boxes and
PC parts
speaking of PC parts I didn't really get
good pictures of your PC but it's
rocking a 59:30 kc pu with 2 XFX r9 295
DP use this is definitely a man cave and
a really good one at that the only thing
is missing is a couch but Thank You
Abdul for entering and number three we
have Adam's all-white set up so we have
two 24-inch Saiki TVs and Apple keyboard
and Magic Mouse I like how the desk has
a shelf inside which is great for
storage points for having mostly white
consoles we have a white n64 a white ps3
slim a white whatever that is also an
Atari 2600 and a Sega Genesis and we're
still not done so there's more on this
side we have an original Xbox console
and a white Xbox one right below you
definitely win the console war I don't
think I've ever seen a set up with more
consoles than you have that's for sure
cable management is pretty bad and did
you realize that you have an extra power
outlet just sitting there but I mean
cable management aside I think that you
have a pretty sweet white setup now if
you haven't watched my desk setup video
I did last week I strongly recommend you
doing so because I did go over some
really awesome cable management tips Tim
is next with his triple display setup we
have three LG 23 inch monitors and right
below that we have a razer blackwidow
keyboard naga mouse and a Logitech MX
master mouse for productivity also on
the desk we have a pair of bose
companion speakers and below the desk is
the astro a40 gaming headset that's
hooked up on the side great work with
cable management very clean and
organized if you want a place for your
tablet and extra Mouse then your desk
would be perfect for one of the sliding
drawers that I personally use it does
look like you have enough space under
the desk and that's a great way to keep
this stuff off of your desk when you are
not using them but yeah overall a very
clean triple monitor setup thank you Tim
for entering last but not least we have
Victor with yet another razor themed
setup so we have two dell 24 inch
monitors and below that we have the
black widow keyboard DeathAdder mouse
and the logitech z nano six speakers man
those bezels are super sexy I mean look
how thin they are also a huge plus one
for showing off Breaking Bad in your
wall
paper that's actually one of my favorite
shows of all time right under Game of
Thrones
excellent choice going with the green
aged 440 PC case I think it works really
well with your setup and another point
for the green fans cables and painted
CPU bracket really great job on cable
management - I noticed that you hooked
up the power outlet to the roof of your
desk but yeah overall it really clean
and nicely done color-coordinated setup
Thank You Victor for entering setup
words that does it for this week's

desk setup as always voting will end
Saturday and allows the winner on Sunday
on my Twitter and Instagram accounts so
make sure you guys are following me
there if you guys want to know who wins
all right so it's now time to show off
Kyle's desk setup Kyle show us what you
got so starting off with the desks
themselves my primary desk that holds
all my peripherals is this room
essential storage desk that I picked up
at Target a few years ago for a measly
eighty-five dollars it's not the
fanciest but it's well sized for my room
looks halfway decent and gets the job
done
my other desk is this Parsons model that
I recently got it Big Lots for a hundred
bucks for years I have been using this
cheap folding table to hold up my
desktop that is until I built a new
thousand-pound computer named hotline
atop my primary desk are two 27-inch
monitors at qx2 710 2560 by 1440 IPS
panel from Q nich√©'s and an asus v g2 7
880 144 hertz TN display at 1920 by 1080
when it comes to gaming and video
editing both of these displays have
served me quite well for the last few
years but I'll admit my new Nvidia
powered gaming PC has me itching for
some g-sync panels so badly that I've
begun applying copious amounts of
hydrocortisone rectally above my asus
monitor is the tried-and-true Logitech
c920 webcam for streaming and video
chatting my weapons of choice are the
logitech g502 mouse which has been going
strong since 2011 and Corsairs k70 RGB
with cherry MX red switches naturally
for any good setup you also need a
hardcore oversized mousepad after all
where computer geeks not bros and mouse
pads are the second best thing to pick
up trucks when it comes to
overcompensating so here we have my Oris
Thunder p3 which as you can see boasts
quite an impressive length
compensated for sound I use a pair of dt
880 pros from beyerdynamic that i hang
on a hook behind my desktop
more so for me zone sin in my videos
than actual practicality these
pillow-soft open-back can sound awesome
and are absolutely fantastic for pretty
much everything moving on to the right
side of the desk area is my Wonderwall
of boxes a modern marvel that common
folk refer to as trash this modest
collection of retail packaging serves
the purpose of adding some flair to the
background of my videos and quite
frankly further enabling my box hoarding
obsession and of course what's a good
setup without a fancy-pants tricked-out
computer rocking 259 60 X and 2 gtx
980ti x' in sli my custom water-cooled
gaming pc hotline is as powerful as she
is pretty 4 weeks after its completion
it has finally made its way to my
primary desk space replacing my old but
still very capable 5820k rig when i
began planning the aesthetic blueprint
for hot line back in june it didn't
occur to me that it would later
determine the overall theme of my desk
area but after finding a matching
wallpaper and keyboard effect this RGB
LED kit from ikea was the missing piece
to the puzzle to make my setup truly pop
the kit comes with four rigid LED strips
with the necessary mounting hardware and
a remote control that allows you to fade
between colors or select your own a very
nice accessory that I found through IDI
and his videos on text source so thank
you Ed for exposing the LED accent whore
that I am don't look a bit there's
always some cows awesome sales network
thank you guys for watching subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already and
I'll see you all in the next video so
that's it for the quick look on Kyle's
desk setup you guys can find the full
video on his channel and I'm going to
leave a link to it down below huge

them out and subscribe if you haven't

videos on PC related content like I said
