here to show you the process of
unlocking your LG g3 vigor so you can
use it with any GSM carrier in the world
for this demonstration I will be using
my locked 18 t g3 vigor and unlock it so
I can use it on my t-mobile network but
it's the exact same process for any
carrier so first off we need to get the
unlock codes who start the unlocking
process and the place where I get all my
lock codes is the unlocking company comm
because they have the cheapest prices
online and I get my codes much faster
than other websites so head on over to
the unlocking company comm and select
your phone manufacturer and the Ford
model from the drop down list and on the
next page go ahead and select the
country the phone was originally
purchased from and the carrier of the
phone in my case I've purchased it in
the United States an original carrier is
AT&amp;amp;T
before we continue we do need the IMEI
number of the phone and the way you look
that up on the phone is to open up a
dollar and enter in star pound zero six
pound once the phone displays the IMEI
number you have to go back on the
website and enter that in now once
everything is filled out the select get
unlocking code and that will take you to
the final screen and this is where you
have to check out after checking out
they will email you the unlock code the
price and the delivery time of your code
varies by phone but don't worry because
as I said before you are getting the
cheapest price online with the fastest
and every times once you receive your
unlock code from your locking company
comm it's time to unlock your phone but
before we do that make sure that the
phone is powered off go ahead and remove
the back cover so you can gain access to
the SIM tray then enter in the SIM card
that you want to use with the phone so I
want to use the g3 vigor on my t-mobile
network so I'm putting in my t-mobile
SIM card if your SIM card doesn't fit
then you have to adjust the size in
order for it to work there is a link
below to show you have thats done after
inserting the SIM card in the phone go
ahead and replace the back cover and
boot up the phone once the phone boots
up it will take you straight to the SIM
unlock page and this is where you enter
the unlock code that you received from
the unlocking company after inputting
the code and hitting a lock you will get
a message stating that the unlock was
successful and the phone will
automatically reboot once the restarts
completely and takes you to the home
screen your phone is now permanently
unlocked and you can begin using it
immediately as you can see here I'm
using an eight
and t g3 vigor on a t-mobile network so
that's how you unlock your LG g3 vigor
for any GSM carrier in the world if this
