cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below what's
up guys it's ed from tech source and
welcome to setup wars episode 64 will
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel so if you guys
are interested in being part of the show
make sure to watch the video linked
below but here are your five contestants
for this week we have bruno brian
chandler florian and jonas
congratulations for making it on the
show starting the episode we have Bruno
Mars and his interesting desk what what
is that oh never mind I just read the
notes so apparently it says in here that
this is a custom made desk so he has a
29 inch LG Ultra why that's hooked up on
the wall and below that we have an
assortment of mugs and models for added
personality I guess we also have a
Logitech G 100's keyboard and mouse
combo there's also a Sony Poles headset
hanging from a self-made headphone
hanger and a boom arm that's holding up
a microphone or at least that's what I'm
assuming at least when you built the
desk you didn't forget to make a
dedicated place for cable management
although it's not the prettiest desk
I've seen it's sure as hell it has its
usefulness by the way very good job on
the cable management it definitely looks
like you spent some time to clean up the
wires and finally the PC is powering the
set up has an i5 4440 and a gtx 950
inside the NZXT s340 case I want to be
surprised if I saw more and more as 340
cases magically showing up in the next
few episodes thank you Bruno for
entering next up we have Bryan Cranston
with a very nice black and white setup
rocking 2 23 inch Lenovo monitors that
are hooked up to a triple monitor stand
hence why there are extra arms sticking
out on the desk we have the paradise v60
keyboard logitech g502 proteus core
mouse on top of the glorious mousepad i
do at the whiteboard that you attached
between the desk and the monitors stand
i know you did that to protect the desk
from being scratched and dented but
honestly blends in nicely with your
color scheme also the mic setup you have
is very
I haven't seen anyone bring the mic
underneath the monitors like this before
it actually looks more convenient this
way and it's not blocking the monitors
at all hanging from one of the arms we
have three pairs of headphones a hi-fi
man a chi 400 I which is his primary
headphones then we have a Sennheiser HD
558 and Sony expiate hundreds not a bad
collection and finally below that we
have a ps4 console with a controller
charging dock right next to it honestly
the ps4 looks a little bland compared to
the rest of the setup it feels like the
entire left side of the desk can use
more white I was wrongly recommend
picking up some v-band skins to pump up
that ps4 maybe even go with a black and
white carbon fiber or matte color scheme
I think it would look sick with your
setup but I'll drop links down below in
case anyone is interested in checking
them out they don't only make skins for
consoles guys they have them for
smartphones headphones laptops
any bunch of other devices the other
thing that kind of bothers me is the
text on the wall now I'm all for
motivational quotes but writing on your
wall is never a good idea especially
since it's not even parallel to your set
up I would have gotten a custom-made
poster or even a picture and framed it
with those words on it instead of
writing something like that on the wall
but that's just me
cable management though very very
impressive excellent work keeping
everything contained I absolutely love
the organization that went into creating
this velcro straps cable drops and 3m
tape job well done
and finally the PC that's powering the
set up has a 4790k and an r9 390 inside
another s340 case also great work
keeping the color scheme consistent in
your PC as well honestly this is a very
impressive setup the only thing I would
change is by adding some skins to your
ps4 and maybe adding some posters or
picture frames to cover up the text you
have up there thank you Brian for
entering changing things up we have
Chandler and what appears to be our
second ever black and yellow setup I'm
not so sure why these are so rare on
setup wars but black and yellow were
actually really great colors maybe I'll
do a PC build using these colors really
guys think this is also our second setup
with a custom desk gets made out of
three-tier drawers and various pieces
from bookshelves and other furniture so
on the desk we have a Delgado keyboard
razer deathadder
and a 2012 MacBook and between two
24-inch LG monitors on the left side we
have a rode nt1-a microphone that's kind
of just sitting on the desk and a focus
right audio interface perhaps going with
some v-band skins for your m50x
headphones that looks like a sick combo
although I'm not really sure what's
going on up here it looks like a bunch
of Legos built inside of a shelf that's
holding up a guitar handle I don't know
maybe there's some sentimental thing
going on here but you didn't mention it
in the notes cable entry looks pretty
good from what I can see I didn't notice
that you hit the power strip in one of
the shelves on the right side and
finally his PC which also has a black
and yellow color scheme is rocking a
4790k and a gtx 750ti
you have a pretty beefy CPU so I would
suggest upgrading of graphics card to a
gtx 1060 or even an RX 480 to take
advantage of that extra power that
you're missing out on I would also
recommend picking up a boom on for your
mic since I have no clue how you even
record without one other than those
minor tweaks I think that this is a very
dope black-and-yellow setup Thank You
Chandler for entering next up we have
Lauren with a refreshing setup but what
is it with custom made desks in this
episode so this desk is made out of ten
pallets which has a tabletop mounted
against it and there's also a CD shelf
that's been laid out horizontally which
is using as a monitor riser very clever
the custom work doesn't even stop there
looks like he made his very own
headphone hanger speaker mount and even
controller stands I'm impressed
on the desk we have a 28 inch Samsung TV
that's used as a monitor and below that
we have the Logitech k7 40 keyboard and
a razor model mouse there are a bunch of
other stuff on the desk like the
Logitech z3 33 speakers a printer lamp
empty picture frame and other
miscellaneous stuff there's also a lot
going on up there on the wall but
honestly it doesn't even bother me
I feel like this all blends in well with
the ambience of the room I've honestly
impressed with the cable management -
there's a lot going on but you managed
to have everything on the control we do
have a PC down here it kind of looks
like a prebuilt PC actually but I could
be mistaken it's rocking a 37 70 and an
msi gtx 960 but that will do for this
setup thank you very much Lauren for
entering last but not least we have
Jonas and his very clean
why set up I mean look at the symmetry
just beautiful we have a 29 inch
ultrawide monitor in the center and two
Edifier m22 80 speakers on both sides
the keyboard of choice is the Corsair
Vengeance k70 with MX blue switches and
that's accompanied by the oak at TN
Mouse the mouse pad is also pretty sick
it kind of reminds me of the xqo mouse
pad that I had a while back with a
different design
other than the HyperX cloud 2 sitting on
a headphone hanger any salt lamp on the
right side there's really nothing else
on the desk very simple very clean just
the way I like it I'm not too sure about
the wallpaper though cable management is
also spot-on not a single wire in sight
good job Jonas the PC that's hiding off
to the left side has a 47 70 and a ZOTAC
gtx 980ti extreme edition with the
coarser graphite 780 T case it's a shame
that you have to put this on the floor
and away from sight but I understand why
you did that it would have messed with
the appearance of the setup actually you
know what I think it would look fine
with a PC on the desk just remove the
salt lamp and put the PC over there
but what do you guys think should Jonas
put his PC on the right side of his desk
let me know by droppin a comment
regardless would you decide this is one
fine setup Thank You Jonas for entering
so that will do for this episode of
setup wars as always make sure you guys
drop your comments and vote on who you
think has the best desk setup and as
always I'll announce the winners on
Sunday on my Twitter and Instagram the
guys much watching if you enjoy set up
boards leave a like and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
