I'm here to show you the process of
unlocking your smart phone so you can
use it on any other GSM carrier in the
world for this demonstration I will be
using my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and
unlock it so I can use it on a different
network but again you can use this video
as a guide for absolutely any smartphone
no matter what the manufacturer or model
is so first off we need to get the
unlock code to start the unlocking
process one of the best and most
trusting websites that I use to get all
my lock codes is the unlocking company
comm because the prices are unbeatable
and their customer service is the best
in the market so head on over to the
unlocking company comm and select your
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop down list and on the next
page go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is t-mobile but
again this tutorial works for every
country carrier manufacturer and phone
in the world before we continue we need
the IMEI number of the phone and the way
you look that up on your phone is to
open up the dial pad and enter in star
pound zero six pound once the phone
displays the IMEI number you have to go
back on the website and enter that in
once everything is filled out select get
a locking code and that will take you to
the final screen where you have to check
out after checking out they will email
you your unlock code the price and
delivery time of your code varies by the
phone but don't worry because they
deliver their codes much faster than any
other unlocking website so before we
continue make sure that the phone is
powered up next locate the SIM slot on
your phone and remove the tray then go
ahead and insert in the SIM card that
you wish to use with the phone I do want
to use the galaxy note 4 with my AT&amp;amp;T
network so I am putting in my AT&amp;amp;T SIM
card if the SIM card does not fit
properly then you have to adjust the
size in order for it to fit I've left a
link in a description section to show
you how that's done after you insert the
SIM in the phone put everything back
together if applicable and power on your
phone once the phone boots up go ahead
and leave the lock screen and
immediately a prompt will appear asking
you to enter and your lock code after
entering in your lock code that you
receive from your locking company your
phone will take you straight to the home
screen and your phone will be
permanently unlocked as you can see here
I am using my t-mobile phone on an AMT
Network so that's how you unlock any
smart phone in the world to be used on
another GSM carrier if this video helped
