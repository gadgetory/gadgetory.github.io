and welcome to October's PC builds at
this time we have two different price
points one is a super budget $350 gaming
PC and the other one is a mid-range 1050
or 1060 dollar gaming PC as well as
always any parts that I mentioned in
this video will be linked below but
let's go ahead and jump right into it
actually guys before I begin the video I
want to give you huge thanks to Jays two
cents for sending out his RX 480 last
month to help out with a crossfire build
I did on the channel if you are not
already subscribed to him be sure to go
over and check him out because he makes
some of the best water-cooled pcs on
YouTube and there's an amazing job and
explaining how things work his videos
are very educational and I've learned a
lot from him and I'm sure you guys will
too
but I'll drop a link down to his channel
so make sure to go and subscribe if you
haven't already so starting off the
month we have a very cheap gaming PC
that will cost you only three hundred
and fifty dollars please keep in mind
that this build is only for people that
don't plan on upgrading and it needs
something within the next few months as
AMD Zen is coming out and in your future
with new CPUs and ddr4 support so if you
do decide to upgrade you will need to
buy a completely new motherboard CPU and
RAM but if you guys don't care about
upgrading in the future and only have
350 bucks in your pocket and want to run
games between 30 to 60 FPS then this is
the PC for you for the CPU we are going
with the one and only x4 860 K which is
a solid quad core processor clocked at
3.7 gigahertz which is sufficient for
gaming we are not going with a CPU
cooler to keep the cost down so instead
we are going to use a stock heatsink and
pair that with the asrock fm2
motherboard which is a solid board for
the money that also offers onboard USB
3.0 the motherboard is also built with
100% solid capacitors so don't expect
this to crap out in the near future for
RAM we are going with team Vulcan this
time around simply because of the value
1600 megahertz radio Ram sticks for only
34 bucks is a pretty good deal to pass
up for storage we are starting off with
just 500 gigabytes of hard drive space
from Seagate which can obviously be
upgraded later on and for the
a card we are using the new sapphire rx
460 I did do some research and it turns
out there is very slight bottlenecking
with the 860 K however it is very
marginal and shouldn't affect gameplay
at all we are packing everything inside
the fractal design core 1000 case
because it only cost 25 bucks and it
comes with front panel USB 3.0 which is
very rare to find for that price point
and finally juicing up the entire system
is the ever-so-popular 430 watt power
supply from EVGA simply because it's one
of the best power supplies for budget
builds that cost around $30.00 no other
brand comes close
once again the total is $350 so if you
need a gaming PC now and don't care
about upgrading in the future then this
is the PC you want if you want to play
games between 30 and 60 FPS now let's
take a look at a very solid $1000
mid-range gaming PC actually this will
cost you around 1060 but as plenty of
room for upgrades in the near future
starting off with a solid quad core CPU
the 6600 K clocked at 3.5 gigahertz will
bring you happiness but it doesn't end
there we are going to be overclocking
the CPU to at least 4.0 gigahertz hence
why we picked up the extremely popular
and amazing 212 Evo CPU cooler we
obviously need a solid z board that will
not break the bank and after shuffling
through a bunch of them on Amazon I
ended up with the azrog Z 170 m
motherboard for 100 bucks you get a very
sturdy motherboard with a bunch of
features it has 12 K platinum capacitors
a very sexy-looking i/o armor with a
matte black PCB and orange accents if
you're going to be pushing your CPU to
its maximum this board will get the job
done
sticking with the color scheme I went
with to HyperX fury
black RAM sticks rated at 21 33
megahertz since the motherboard supports
m2 I decided to throw in a 128 gigabyte
m2 SSD from transcend which will hold
the operating system along with a few
programs that need super fast boot times
I also added a one terabyte hard drive
from Seagate and of course there was
always room to add more storage in the
future for the graphics card I went with
the gigabyte g1 gaming not because the
orange accents match with the
motherboard but because the benchmarks
were very impressive compared to other
GTX 10-7
that I reviewed on the channel not to
mention how beast the card is after
overclocking storing all of these parts
as the fantex Eclipse p400 tower because
it's only $65 and has a very clean
design with a large clear side panel
finally powering the build is a 700 watt
power supply from EVGA and the reason
why I went with 700 watts is for
expandability this configuration is
perfect for anyone that wants to add an
extra gtx 1070 in the future or even
upgrade to a more powerful processor but
that will do it for this month's pc
build as always if you guys enjoy these
videos be sure to hit that like button
as it does help me out a ton and also
make sure you subscribe to the channel
because you don't want to miss out on my
next few PC builds coming out in the
next few weeks thing as much watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
