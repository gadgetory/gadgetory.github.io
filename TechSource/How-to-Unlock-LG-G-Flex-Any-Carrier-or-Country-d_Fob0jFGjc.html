and today I'm going to show you how to
unlock your LG G flex smartphone for all
countries regardless of what carrier you
have unlocking your phone allows you to
use your phone with other networks and
the process is completely safe and does
not harm your phone in any way so first
off we need to get unlock code for the
phone before we proceed with the
unlocking procedure I personally use the
unlocking company for all my devices
because not only are they the largest
unlocking company to date but they also
unlock almost every gsm model ever made
and on top of all that they have the
lowest prices available in the market
with 24/7 customer support so to
demonstrate the process I'm going to use
the t-mobile Version and unlock it so I
can use it on my AT&amp;amp;T network like I
said earlier it's the same exact steps
for all countries and carriers worldwide
so head on over to the unlocking company
comm and once you're there you're gonna
select your phone manufacturer and phone
model from the drop-down list
LG is the manufacturer and the model is
the G flex and once you do select that
go ahead and click on get a locking code
which takes you to the next step which
is the select what country purchase the
phone from as well as the carrier of the
phone and this is the carrier that the
phone is originally purchased from in my
case t-mobile you will need the phone's
IMEI number to continue and I'm gonna
show you how to look it up on your phone
that's actually really simple you
basically go to your dial pad and you
enter in star pound zero six pound and
the code will immediately show up and
you will need to enter that on a website
to continue make sure you select the
correct currency for your country before
moving on
once you select get a locking code and
purchases securely with PayPal they will
email you the code the price and time
vary depending on the phone but they do
guarantee that you are getting the
lowest price and the fastest delivery
times currently in the market once you
receive your code via email it's time to
unlock your device okay here is where it
gets kind of tricky for the G flex phone
you are going to have to insert the
original SIM in the phone first and make
sure that it is activated so in my case
the phone is from t-mobile so I will
leave the t-mobile SIM inside for now
next you have to open up the dialpad
once more but this time you're going to
type in two nine four five pound star
nine five nine pound and
will automatically take you to a special
menu and here you will select the
service provider lock and enter in your
unlock code that you received via email
once you finish entering it in the phone
will automatically restart to your home
page and after that you are ready to
remove the original SIM and insert your
own SIM card that you wish to use so
here I remove the t-mobile SIM and
inserted my AT&amp;amp;T SIM card because I want
to use the phone on my AT&amp;amp;T network
after you insert your own SIM card in
the phone you're going to have to
manually restart it and once you do that
you are ready to go your phone is now
unlocked and you can begin using it so
that's how you unlock your LG G flex
smartphone if this helps you guys out
