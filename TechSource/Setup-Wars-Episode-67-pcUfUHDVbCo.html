welcome to setup wars episode 67 where
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on that channel so if you guys
want to participate make sure to watch
the video linked below but here are your
five contestants for this week we have
Andre Julius Nathan Sammy and Zack
congratulations for making it on the
show starting off the show we have
Android and his very clean white and
black Clone Trooper ultra white setup
also on the desk we have a Razer
BlackWidow chroma key board and a Razer
DeathAdder mouse that's sitting on top
of the victims extended mousepad I also
see that you drilled a hole in the desk
to route the wires through very clean
after the left side with the msi ge62
gaming laptop with a gtx 850 m and the
right is a desktop pc that's running on
a 47 70 and a gtx 970 cable management
has done really well i do love seeing
cable clips and velcro's keeping all the
wires together and oh my lord you
actually manage the cables on your
earbuds I just have to apply that's just
I'm gonna be sleeping so well tonight
good job keeping your logitech g930
wireless headset on a hanger but what I
like most about this setup is that you
hung product boxes above your bed
imagine FDS to be 40 bucks drop straight
on your face while you're sleeping
pretty dope setup andre thanks for
entering julius caesar returns with a
new revamped setup it looks like he
finally sent her the massive TV with the
monitors good work so it looks like we
still have the same 24 inch samsung
monitors and corsair strafe RGB keyboard
with custom white key caps from vortex
also the desk we have Logitech G 430
headset and a pair of a th and 50 X's
that are skinned by D brand and I also
noticed that you drilled a hole in the
desk for both the keyboard and mouse
wire a few things I liked about the
setup are the consistency of the color
scheme and symmetry the fact that you
place both of your Xbox one controllers
like that makes me very happy
cable management looks pretty good from
what I can see I wish you could have
sent me picks up on your desk so I can't
really give you props on cable
management on the other side of the desk
we have a 15-inch MacBook Pro with a
pair of Swan m10 speakers and SPC that's
pushing all of those picks
it's currently running at a 4770k at a
GTX 970 super clock as always your setup
is pleasure to my eyeballs Thank You
Julius for entering Nathan Drake is next
up with two 27-inch Dell monitors a
cursor strafe RGB and a Logitech MX
master this is literally the third setup
that has a drilled hole in the desk for
cable management it seems like everyone
is on top of their game we also have a
pair of audio engine 85 Plus speakers a
samsung meteor mic and M 50 X's by the
way amazing picture quality seriously
these are awesome to look at cable
management is flawless there's not a
single wire that's out of place and
finally the PC that's located on the
right side has a 4790k and a gtx 970
I love the cleanliness symmetry and
personality of this setup from the
beautiful family portrait that's
centered up top to the Star Wars
figurines and a wireless setup of the
keyboard and mouse this is a very
well-put-together setup the only minor
thing I recommend is maybe picking up
something to store your headphones but
other than that this is a perfect setup
Thank You Nathan for entering Sam is
next up with a triple monitor
black-and-red setup so we have an Asus
22 inch monitor up top with two
different 24-inch band Q monitors on the
bottom on the desk we have the Razer
BlackWidow chroma key board and a Razer
DeathAdder chroma Mouse on top of the
reflex lab extended mouse pad we also
have a pair of Logitech Z 200 speakers
and a blue Yeti Michael to the new alarm
Sammy did decide to keep the PC on the
floor since there wasn't any space on
the desk which was a good call but it's
rocking a 4790k and another gtx 970
at least you put something underneath
the pc instead of leaving it on the
carpet like some people i see that the
brand is dominating we have another pair
of em 50 x's which are claimed by the
brand skins a very sick black and red
combo by the way cable management is
pretty good I can see that you routed
all the cables behind the back board and
off to the right side and into a single
power strip I would recommend picking up
a cable box to keep the power strip in
for a much cleaner look and also it's
generally not a good idea to keep them
on carpet since they can be a fire
hazard but overall this is a very clean
black and red setup Thank You Sammy for
entering last not least we have Zack and
his interesting dual monitor setup why
you would have a custom PC and an iMac
on the same desk
is beyond me but hey it's your setup not
mine so we have a 22 inch AUC monitor in
the center with the very famous Budd
Tron PC build right next to that it does
have a different case but the rest of
the parts are identical like the g3 258
and the gtx 750ti the keyboard and mouse
of choice are both from TechNet and they
are resting on the VIP hems extended
mouse pad on the left we have a 2006
iMac that's just there for some reason
and under the desk we have the scroll H
g5x gaming headset are you seriously
running a pirated copy of Windows 8.1
pro how dare you I'm just kidding Zack I
pirate movies all the time
hello darkness my old friend I've come
to talk with you again honestly there's
a much better place for the iMac I feel
like if you move it into this location
your setup would look so much better
Thank You Zack for entering so that is
it for this episode of setup wars as
