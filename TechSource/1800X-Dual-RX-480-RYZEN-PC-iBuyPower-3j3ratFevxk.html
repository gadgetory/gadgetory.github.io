what you're looking at here is the first
ever rise in PC on the channel the guys
that I buy power centers over to me to
look at and run some benchmarks it's
rocking the AMD r7 1800 x8 core
processor 16 gigs of ram and 2 msi RX
for ATS and crossfire we also got the
MSI X 370 XPower gaming titanium
motherboard an h-60 CPU cooler from
Corsair and an 800 watt power supply for
storage it as a 240 gigabyte SSD from
Kingston which is the main drive and an
additional 2 terabyte hard drive and
finally everything is packed inside the
beautiful iBUYPOWER elements gaming
tower that features a tempered glass
side panel as well as a see-through
front panel so the risin 7 X Pro which
is what I buy power is calling this PC
is aimed for gamers streamers and
content creators as stated in my rights
and benchmarks video the rising CPUs are
excellent when it comes to
multi-threaded applications and they
currently provide the best bang for your
buck in fact they have more balance to
build for nearly half the cost that
features these 1700 any single rx 480
which I'll drop a link down below for
you guys if you want to check out so how
much will rise in 7x pro cost you well
it's priced at 2192 with this
configuration but I wanted to find out
if it's overpriced and if you can build
one for a lot cheaper so I went over to
PC par picker and put together a neo
identical build that came out to almost
$1,900 which puts the iBUYPOWER PC $300
over but not quite that $3.00 went into
their standard three year warranty which
protects the system and its parts
against defects and materials or
workmanship for three years labor and
one-year parts you also get the
exclusive element case which isn't
available anywhere but most importantly
you are paying for peace of mind you
don't have to stress about building one
or having a breakdown later down the
line so in my opinion an extra two
dollars to protect your expensive
investment is totally worth it before we
get into benchmarks there were a few
gripes I had with the system the first
being appearance I love the black and
red color scheme with the white accents
however the blue PC I connected is from
the GPUs kind of stick out like a sore
thumb I'm not necessarily expecting
customs
we've cables but if they stuck with the
standard black connectors instead it
would have looked a lot better the
second gripe is that it didn't come
equipped with a Wi-Fi adapter so you
have to connect to the internet via
ethernet or purchase an adapter
separately and finally let's take a look
at the gaming benchmarks now obviously
most of these games play well over 60
fps and 1080p at high settings so I
decided to change things up a bit and
test them in 2k and 4k resolutions to
see how well the 1800 X does along with
the dual our X 480
the few games hit over 60fps and 4k
settings while others struggled a bit
for 1080p gaming though and editing this
PC will get the job done however like I
said before if you want a more balanced
gaming PC be sure to check out the links
down below you'll also be saving a lot
more money when I pretty much wraps up
the video if you guys enjoyed it be sure
to leave a like if you didn't feel T or
dislike and huge thanks to I by powers
are sending this in for review this is
that some tech stories and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
