just want to start off by apologizing
for skipping out on last week's best
tech deals I wasn't I 14 copy text and
didn't have the gear on me but I'm here
now so let's get the ball rolling once
again so starting out the video we have
a great deal on a 24 inch LG monitor
that's going for 100 bucks with a
fifty-dollar mail-in rebate and then
switching to Amazon you can find a pair
of 8 gigabyte RAM sticks for only 54
bucks which is a crazy good deal and we
also have the Samson go Mike that's
going for twenty bucks and it's a great
plug and play Mike for anyone that's on
a budget and it's constantly on the go
also on Amazon is the razer deathadder
chroma mouse that's going for only 50
bucks and finally the m50x is which are
discounted to 123 dollars which isn't
the lowest price I've seen on these but
they are much cheaper than the usual 140
dollar price tag shifting gears to
newegg we have a 23 inch LG IPS monitor
going for one hundred and five bucks and
the be quiet dark rock pro 3 cooler
that's twenty dollars off newegg is also
having this amazing cell where you buy a
hard drive and ram sticks and they give
you a discount for going with a bundle
in my case I get 15 bucks off my
purchase of a two terabyte hard drive
and a gigabytes of RAM from g.skill this
does expire on the tenth of June which
is on a Friday so make sure to jump on
it if you're looking to upgrade on you
make flash we have the GTX 970 that's
going for two hundred seventy bucks but
please keep in mind that this is a
refurbished model but in fact if you
guys can hold off on GPU purchases these
next few weeks then you will most likely
see a bunch of sales going on for most
of the high end graphics cards like the
1979-80 and even the 980 TI the Samsung
29 inch curved monitor is going for five
hundred and thirty bucks and the perixx
gaming mouse that's currently sixty
percent off and it's going for only
twenty dollars on ebay you can find a 48
inch 1080p TV going for 379 which is
just in time for father's day the sony
PS Vita is also on sale for 100 bucks
and then I came across this waterproof
credit card wallet holder which isn't
really tech but it's still a great deal
for father's day wrapping up the video
we have some killer deals on mass drop
first up as the freedom arm which I use
for my own setup and I just can't get
enough of it by far one of the best
monitor arms i have ever but now if you
guys own a mac book and want some extra
ports
the five and one display adapter from
juiced is going for only thirty five
dollars we also have a smart LED bulb
that's going for twenty seven dollars
and finally if you guys want to get your
hands on the RX for 80 or GTX 1070 and
1080 cards they be sure to log in and
vote on these cards so that math strap
can get them and since it's going on
mass job you guys do get it for much
cheaper than retail but that will do for
this week's tech deals as always you
