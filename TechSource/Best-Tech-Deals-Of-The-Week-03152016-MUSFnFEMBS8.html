sweet deal at t-mobile we are currently
doing a buy one get one free deal for

recently got a price drop to thirty-six
dollars and thirty-five cents for the
ilive 5.1 home theater system and the
popular jaybird x2 earphones have also
dropped in price 2 128 bucks these are
usually around hundred fifty so that's a
pretty good deal and finally on Amazon
the ever so popular m50 X's are still
reduced in price with a free one day

by the way if you guys aren't a Prime
