and welcome to PC wars episode 21 where
you submit your custom PC to get
featured on a channel so if you guys
wanna participate make sure watch the
video link down below let the PC Wars
begin
if you guys are curious about the full
specs of these pcs I'll have them link
down below but your 5 contestants for
this week are a duffy jeremiah josh josh
number 2 and hewan congratulations for
making it on the show so Duffy is first
up with a really nice white and black
bill that has a 4790k paired with two
Asus GTX 970 s I'm definitely loving the
consistency he even ended up painting
the power supply to match the color
scheme the CPU cooler however is
definitely massive and it's kind of
stealing the show to be honest it's also
blocking the RAM sticks I feel like
something smaller or more subtle what
I've worked just fine after all it's
only a 4790k a custom painted SLI bridge
what I've also looked cooler compared to
the stock Flex bridge that you have
right now even if you painted that white
it would have looked a lot better for
benchmarks it scored a 16,000 387
starting off the episode strong but
overall a very clean white and black
build thank you Duffy for entering
speaking of white and black bills we
have Jeremiah next up with Atlas see now
this is the type of CPU cooler I was
talking about it's small enough not to
block the RAM sticks and it still gets
the job done while keeping with the
theme Atlas is running on a 6700 K and 2
GT X 1080 Founders Edition which kind of
goes against the color scheme with the
green GeForce logo but I do see that you
scrape the most of the paint off and
it's not that noticeable in the dark for
benchmarks we got a score of 26,000 134
beating out Duffy's PC and taking first
place for this episode I would have
personally routed those GPU wires
downwards and through the bottom grommet
for a cleaner look but regardless it's a
beast of a PC Thank You Jeremiah for
entering Josh number one is next up with
a neon green and purple Halloween themed
PC he's calling it alien with a dash of
facehugger
what the field features a 4790k and an
Asus GTX 1070 card I don't really know
when this video will go live on a
channel but I max
recording it on the 29th of October so
right before Halloween there's
definitely a lot of custom work that
went into this build the reservoir base
is made out of carbon fiber there are a
few acrylic cutouts near the bottom for
the PSU and SSD as well as the fan
grills near the top for benchmarks they
scored a fifteen thousand eight sixty
eight picking third-place for this
episode definitely a very interesting
bill - Thank You Josh for entering Josh
number two is next up and it's just a
coincidence that he too has a green and
black build he is calling it green eggs
and ham I swear you guys in your
creative names
that's a 59 30k in two GTX 1080s in sli
and already right off the bat the two
stock flex SLI bridges stick out very
badly and I wonder deep down inside why
you either haven't painted them green or
went with a high-bandwidth SLI bridge
both in video and EVGA make some really
sexy bridges it's just a shame because
you spend all this time and money
perfecting this beautiful PC and then
you have this some custom mods include
painted back plates skinned power supply
and SSD and also a custom painted front
panel although it does look like you
painted the RAM sticks as well because
crucial doesn't have any green versions
like those for benchmarks escorting
26,000 176 barely beating out Jeremiah
by only 42 points and taking first place
for this episode what can I say it's an
excellent build just please do something
with those sli bridges Thank You Josh
number 2 for entering last but not least
we have one with a very interesting
black white and red build featuring the
4790k and two gtx 980 s I can definitely
appreciate the fact that you stuck with
your theme but the green GeForce logo
kind of ruins it to be honest I also
like the carbon fiber skins that you
applied on both of your SSDs and also on
the side of your CPU cooler it looks
like I don't know if you got that idea
from watching my gal Dex build but
that's definitely taking a step forward
and going with more than just one color
very nice so since this is a tri-colored
build I would have made the custom
cables into three different colors as
well just to be more consistent maybe
have the outer cables black and then
fill in the rest with white and red but
that's just my two cents
a very dope build nonetheless thank you
for entering so that is it for this
episode as always drop your comments
down below and vote on who you think has
the best custom PC and last the winners
on my social media platforms thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
