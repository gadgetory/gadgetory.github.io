what's up guys it's ed back again from
Texas and today we're gonna take a look
at an awesome waterproof case from ghost
tech for the iPhone 6
this is the ghost tech atomic case and
it's one of the thinnest waterproof
cases that are currently out there it
comes in three awesome colors to match
your iPhone six color and a cost a
fraction of the price when compared to
the lifeproof case so you will be able
to submerge your iPhone up to one meter
deep and up to ten minutes without
getting any water damage and the case is
made out of very light aluminum alloy
which only adds about three ounces of
total weight the packaging is simple it
comes in this clear box and inside the
actual case you will find a lanyard to
attach to the case when you go swimming
or in the ocean so you don't
accidentally drop your phone and have it
drift away you also get a white
microfiber cloth and a QuickStart guide
to help you with the installation
process although it's really easy and
I'll show you how to put it on in a bit
so the back side of the case has this
clear back screen material which doesn't
cover the back of your phone and I don't
know about you guys but if I'm putting
on a case I don't want the entire phone
hidden so it's definitely a good design
choice taking a look inside the case you
will find rubber grommets alongside on
each of the four sides of the case which
acts as shock absorbers in the case that
the phone drops and it also protects the
phone from scratches when installing or
removing the case as I said before the
case is one of the thinnest waterproof
cases available measuring at only point
47 inches which is smaller than two
iPhones if you want a visual now the
installation part is simple there is a
raised edge along the case and all you
need to do is line it up with a rubber
seal cover once you place the phone
inside the case and make sure it's nice
and snug you can go ahead and continue
installing the cover it's important to
make sure that the seal is fitted
properly and you can do that by running
your finger around the edges firmly
until the gaps close to make sure no
water gets in the aesthetics of the case
is nice definitely one of the coolest
waterproof cases I have seen the
aluminum finish really gives the case a
premium look and feel all without
compromising any of its features on the
bottom of the case you have the cutouts
for the microphone and speakers as well
as two rubber grommet seals to protect
the headphone and charging ports on the
left side of the case you have the
vibration switch and two aluminum
buttons for volume control and on the
other side you have the power button the
camera is also covered with a thin piece
of film which won't affect taking
pictures or video in fact here are a few
samples I took with the iPhone 6 with
and without the case on
so you can tell the difference the ports
on the bottom also have enough clearance
for the original charging cables and
earphones however if you have a special
charging dock or third-party chargers
then you probably need to remove the
case before using it now most waterproof
cases make it really difficult to use
the phone however the ghost tech atomic
doesn't have this problem at all the
aluminum buttons are super easy to press
without the need to press hard and the
home button is also very responsive as
before you might need some time to get
used to the water-resistant film on the
case it's not as smooth as the actual
screen obviously but nonetheless it's
still very responsive overall I have no
complaints about this case the ghost
tech atomic is a very solid good-looking
case and if you're looking for a
protective water-resistant case for your
iPhone 6 then I recommend you trying
this one out the price is also
unbelievably low so that's it for the
video I will leave a link in the
description section if you guys want to
check it out and as always if you enjoy
the video please leave a like if you
didn't you can dislike and let me know
