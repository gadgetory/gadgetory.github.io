source I hope it doesn't fail miserably
Alexa turn on living room lights okay
all right so it's Monday around six
o'clock I would say and as you can see
IKEA went ahead and deliver the rest of
my furniture and the living room is just
a complete mess so I just finished
editing the raise ox ultimate gaming PC
video so I know I'm just going to spend
the rest of tonight
and assemble furniture it's gonna be a
great night
finally got the stuff in our bedroom
this is basically the dresser that's
supposed to go right over there so
hopefully I can assemble this within an
hour
all right so after about four hours of
treacherous work finally managed to
finish up the dresser but one bad news
as you can see one of the drawers
missing I don't even know what happened
but basically one of these were missing
from the package either IKEA screwed me
or I managed to lose it somehow so I'm
gonna have to hold on to this until
tomorrow and hopefully you'll be
finished by then all right so it's now
Tuesday morning um having some breakfast
real quick and then I'm going to be
finishing the script for the Ray Sox
benchmark video and I'm going to film
the Rays off benchmark video and then
hopefully assemble some furniture later
at night because honestly I just don't
want to think about IKEA furniture right
now a few things came in yesterday
actually I'm sure you'll quick I got
this drawer from Amazon this is going to
go against this wall next to the
alternate station basically we're going
to put like the printer on top of it and
then a bunch of other miscellaneous
items I think I'll really clean up this
whole room and then I'm gonna be working
on these two shelves for the storage
room this is gonna be an absolute
nightmare I'm just I just want to get
the thing over with though now an update
with this basically so yeah as I said
before this piece is missing this ink
and focus this little wooden piece is
missing one supposed to go in here and I
can finish up the last drawer but
everything else is pretty much set
really awesome drawer from Ikea this is
a mama ma LM drawer by the way a dresser
I should say form IKEA really sweet it
was actually really easy to assemble so
what I like about this setup is that
it's really easy to swap tripods just
basically snap to camera out slap it in
the other because it's using the same
exact fluid head from Manfrotto it works
easily now it's time to get some sexy
b-roll shots all this time and if we
gotta put the sli bridge on bail
this is one of my favorite shots
so I just finished filming the b-roll
now it's time for the benchmark portion
of the video I got the 4k monitor that I
received from LG and actually no I'm s
job sent this to me so I can use for my
videos huge thanks to Matt strap for
what give me up and yeah for ultimate
gaming pcs I'm gonna actually do four
key benchmarks from now on instead of
1080p and then for budget gaming pcs
I'll do 1080p benchmarks I think I just
makes so much more sense so bad news I
looked everywhere and I can't find the
cable the power cable for the 4k monitor
from LG so fortunately I'm gonna have to
use the 1080p monitor from Asus and do
1080p benchmarks I probably misplaced to
join the move I looked for for 30
minutes so I'm sorry guys I'm with you
to 1080p benchmarks hopefully my next
Altima gaming PC I would have the cable
to do it so the bad news continues I
swear I can never catch a break so I
turn the PC on and one of the GPU logos
doesn't light up the one on top it's
supposed to be as bright as the one on
the pot on the bottom so yeah I took it
apart it turns out it's a hardware issue
because everything is plugged in the GPU
itself also still works and functions
but the life isn't light up and I just
can't have that so I ordered a metal one
from Amazon it'll be here tomorrow and I
can finish up the b-roll because that
just doesn't look nice at all but yeah
everything else is running normally we
got that stock 4.0 gigahertz which I'll
be overclocking the temps are nice and
cool for now the PC does recognize yeah
there you go to Ty Nexus 16 gigabytes of
RAM
Microsoft Windows 10 so yeah everything
is good
drivers are up to date I'm gonna be
overclocking the CPU and then I can
start doing the benchmarks but look how
sick the wallpaper is one of my good
friends philip sent this to me
he custom-made it because the one i'm
using is the red version oh by the way
uh i mounted a poster next to my setup
instead of the old hat station a lot of
you guys wanted it there and i kind of
agree what you said it looks it kind of
looks good there so yeah put it there we
are custom made this one into a green
version for my upcoming race ox build
and I just really matches the entire
theme so Thank You Philip Whitman for
sending this to your freaking awesome
Oh rap or 0.6 let's see if in you all
the way up to 5.0 that would be
ridiculous four point six let's get four
point seven nice let's saving it all the
way up to five point
oh that would be crazy by the way I'm
using the AI suite to do the
overclocking normally I would overclock
manually using the BIOS but I'm kind of
limited on time so I'm gonna rely on the
AI suite to do the overclocking for me
oh my god about the four point eight
okay I don't know I don't wanna jinx it
but I think we're gonna get the least
five at least five it's compression OH
four point nine and there it is
whatever I'm happy with that
alright so it turns out it wasn't even
four point eight we got four point seven
if this focuses gigahertz so yeah I mean
it's not bad but it's not great either
so another slightly bad news I can't run
the final track benchmark on the PC
because 3dmark does not have a Windows
10 version of fire strikes so
unfortunately the only other two
benchmarks I could run
is Geekbench and set up a new r15 along
with the rendering test but yeah
basically those and then the game
benchmarks is all I can do for this PC
build so yeah let's start
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
