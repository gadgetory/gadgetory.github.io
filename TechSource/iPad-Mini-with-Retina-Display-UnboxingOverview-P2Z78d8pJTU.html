the new iPad Mini with Retina display
this is what everyone has been waiting
for a much smaller iPad with the same
experience as the bigger ones now with a
Retina display and the same specs as the
ipad air they kept the old iPad Mini a
sort of a budget iPad Mini at 299 as the
newer ipad mini with retina display
which were unboxing today is priced at
399 and like I said before you get the
same specs as the ipad air for just a
hundred dollars less we have the same a7
64-bit processor with the m7 motion
coprocessor with the same display
resolution 2048 x 1536 that gives a
pixel density of 326 which is identical
to the iphone but it is better than ipad
air and that's because the ipad air had
a much larger screen you get the same
standard items from Apple so I won't go
through them and I'll just skip straight
to the close-ups and hands-on so the
iPad Mini is point seventy three towns
and it is slightly heavier than the
first iPad Mini which was weighed at
Point 68 pounds it also has a five
megapixel rear camera and a new improved
FaceTime camera which is at one point 2
megapixels with backlight lumination I
also forgot to mention that you can pick
one up in either white or Space Gray a
notable change on the mini is the power
adapter the original one came with the
same type as the iphones which is a 5
watt power adapter and i've upgraded the
new mini to 10 watts which increases the
charging speeds apple claims that the
new iPad Mini with Retina Display gets
up to four times the CPU performance and
up to eight times the graphics
performance also 10 hours of battery
life the new iPad Mini also uses mi mo
technology which incorporates using two
antennas instead of one delivering up to
twice the Wi-Fi performance of its
predecessor honestly the screen does
look beautiful with grey colour
reproduction and overall quality I do
not see a single pixel on this thing and
it's definitely improvement over last
year's ipad mini display there is a lot
of writing nowadays in the tablet
industry and I seem to always come back
to the apples tablets because of a few
reasons the app marketplace is the
complete opposite to iOS 7 on a tablet
honestly I 07 is in my opinion an
unproductive operating system as it
looks like we stretched out
ios7 from the phone nothing new has been
added like multitasking functionality or
even control center to improve the
overall use of the tablet but when you
get into apps that are optimized for the
larger display things do change new
columns appear and experience becomes
several times better without developers
utilizing the extra screen real estate
this reason alone is enough for me to
recommend this over an android
competitor but that's it for the
unboxing overview make sure you guys are

giveaways this is the tech source and
we'll see you next time
