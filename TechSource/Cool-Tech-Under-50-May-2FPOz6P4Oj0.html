and welcome to cool tech under 50 for
the month of May the support on my
videos these past few weeks have been
insane and I just want to thank those of
you
I've been slapping a crap out of that
like button but without wasting a number
time let's begin the video so starting
off the video we have a monitor stand
from Satechi the cool part about this is
that it features four USB 3.0 ports
along with an audio jack for your
headphone and microphone this means that
you don't have to have an extra USB hub
or extension since you have one built in
the monitor stand itself which is super
convenient you do have to connect the
provided USB and audio cables to the
monitor stand and hook up the other end
to your PC the actual stand can support
up to 22 pounds and 24 inches in size
but as you guys can see here it can
clearly support my 27-inch Asus monitor
with the size sticking out of it
the surface is made out of plastic
however the legs are made out of
aluminum and you also have the option of
lowering the entire height by an inch if
this is too tall for you overall a very
solid monitor stand with useful features
next up on the list is the Satechi
aluminum headphone hanger not only does
it look really cool but it also features
three USB 3.0 pass throughs and a
headphone jack allowing you to hook up
your phone USB flash drive or even
headphones straight into the hanger on
top of all that it comes with a
dedicated cable management area in the
back so if you have wired headphones you
can basically wrap them around to clean
up your overall setup this is truly the
olan one headphone hangar and it cost
under 50 bucks I highly recommend it you
guys probably saw this coming a mile
away but if you're new to the channel
and haven't heard of the brand yet and
really liked the appearance of my
headphones and be sure to check out the
brand's they make the best quality skins
with the most precise fit in the world
for practically any device but I'll drop
a link down below for you guys to check
out this next item is personally one of
my favorites and in fact I've been using
this on my iPhone 6s plus and screaming
with it on periscope this is an eight
millimeter fisheye lens from a pixel and
it comes in this little container to
keep the lens from getting damaged it
comes with this clip which the lens
needs to be screwed on and then the
pinches on the smartphone right on top
of the
camera you can do this for either the
front or even a rear facing camera it
doesn't really matter so check this out
guys this is what it looks like without
the lens and this is what it looks like
with the lens on definitely a huge
difference here are a few more examples
for both video and pictures now I did
notice a small difference in quality
when putting a lens on but honestly it's
not a deal-breaker and it's barely
noticeable
these next two items are from Native
Union first up you have to jump cable
which is a super compact and portable
battery booster
it features an 800 million power battery
making this the perfect backup charger
in case of emergencies one of the things
I really love about the jump cable is
the build quality and design it also has
built-in cable management which makes it
extremely easy to carry around in your
pocket charging the jump cable once it's
out of juice is really easy just simply
plug the USB portion into a power source
and plug the lightning cable into your
iPhone or iPad and you are set it also
features auto charge technology which
basically charges your phone to 100%
then charges the jump cables internal
battery so if you use this as your
everyday charging cable then you will
always have your backup battery charged
and ready to go also for native Union is
the key cable a very simple but awesome
lightning cable that allows you to
charge or sync your devices in style
it comes with a tiny keyring that's
meant to be hooked up to your keys so
not only does it add some style to your
keychain but you always have a charging
cable wherever you go native Union is
also giving all for their awesome
charging cables away and if you guys are
interested in participating then make
sure to sign up to the giveaway which I
will link below speaking of style if you
guys carry a bunch of keys around then
the orbit key is definitely something
you should look into
it's basically a wallet for your keys
that helps keep everything organized
last but not least we have the Satechi 5
port USB charging dock it's pretty
self-explanatory
it's a dock with five ports that allows
you to charge your smartphones tab
for even flat powerbanks one of the
ports actually features Qualcomm quick
charge technology which allows you to
charge select devices up to 75% faster
it's pretty much perfect for anyone that
has multiple devices that need charging
simultaneously but I'll do it for this
month's episode of cool tech as always
if you guys enjoy these series make sure
to slap the crap out of that like button
to show your support and I will see you
guys in the next video
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
