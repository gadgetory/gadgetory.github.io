this quick video we're gonna be taking a
look at the GTX 1080 performance and see
how well it runs games in 1080p and 4k
it will be tons of GPU comparisons in
the next few days so if you guys are new
to the channel make sure to hit that
subscribe button because you don't want
to miss out so Before we jump into the
gaming benchmarks let's take a quick
look at the card itself so the GTX 1080
founders edition will start at $6.99 and
features a 16:07 megahertz base clock
speed which can be boosted up to 17 33
megahertz and only needs a single 8 pin
PCIe connector to power it up in fact
that only uses 180 watts which is only
15 more than the GTX 980 there's also a
nice upgrade and memory the gddr5 has
now been replaced by gddr5 X which is
basically a new memory technology that
allows the 1080s
8 gigabyte of memory to perform more
than one third quicker with a bump in
bandwidth up from 7 gigabits per second
to 10 gigabits per second unfortunately
the actual memory width is not being
increased and still has a 256 bit bus
which most likely means that there will
be future 1080p AI cards with a wider
384-bit bus in terms of i/o we have
three display points which are
DisplayPort 1.4 ready one HDMI and one
digital DVI ports both GTX 1080 and 1070
cards will support DisplayPort 1.3 and
HDMI 2.0 offering HDR support and
allowing pascal's GPUs to support 1080p
and 144 P displays at 240 Hertz also the
ultra wide 1440p displays will be
supported at 180 Hertz and 4k displays
will be supported at 120 Hertz that's
pretty impressive your movie MD
lastly the aesthetics look amazing by
far the coolest looking graphics card I
have seen at least from the front but
turning it over to the backside not so
much I honestly hate the way the back
plate looks it's just too bland for my
taste but moving on to benchmarks so the
piece I'm going to use for the
benchmarks is black snow which is
running on a 6700 K
at stock clock speeds I'm also using
Asus z170 deluxe motherboard 16 bytes of
RAM and an H 100 I v2 CPU cooler for 5
spec benchmarks that scored a 16,000 794
for the regular test a 93 17 for the
extreme and a 5032 for the ultra moving
on to the unit in heaven benchmark the
1080 got an average frame count of 100
55.74 1080p on Ultra settings and 36.6
for the 4k version for Metro last light
and 1080p on very high settings the
average frame rate was 150 point 7 and
30 point zero 4 on the 4k benchmark and
finally for GTA 5 1080p on max settings
the GT x 1080 pulls an average frame
rate of 76 points 73 whereas at 4k
resolution it only got an average FPS of
24 point 47 please keep in mind that
these settings are completely maxed out
and adjusting a few options will get you
higher frame rates these are just for
comparison reason since I will be using
these exact same settings on all my
benchmark tests
and finally for temps the GTX 1080 got
up to 83 degrees Celsius during full
load and around 38 degrees during idle I
will be comparing the GTX 1080 against
the 980 denying a TTI and even a Titan X
but if there's a specific card you guys
want to see the comparison on make sure
to drop your comments down below that's
basically the thing guys so much for
watching make sure you subscribe to the
channel so you don't miss out on my
future content and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
