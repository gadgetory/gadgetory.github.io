welcome to episode 4 of setup wars where
you submit your desk setup for a chance
to get featured on my channel and a
chance to win some money
I hope sees every Monday and I randomly
select five of your submissions and
feature them on my channel you guys get
to vote on the best desk setup if you
guys are new to the series and want to
submit your desk setup then you need to
watch the requirements video linked in
the description section down below but
with all that said let the set up Wars
finally begin
all right so the five chosen contestants
for this week are Danny
Reba natto Brendan George and Tyler
congrats for making it into this week's
episode of setup words by the way all
the products I mentioned in this video
will be linked down below in the
description section for those of you
guys that are interested but with that
said let's go ahead and check out
Danny's setup okay so we have a fairly
simple setup going on over here you have
a 29 inch LG ultrawide monitor with an
interesting wallpaper choice I guess
you're kind of going for a red and white
beam over here but I do like the red
glow we got going on behind the monitor
I guess since you're up against the
corner the LEDs form like a triangle
shape and it looks really cool a few
things you have on your desk are the
13-inch MacBook Pro Apple keyboard and
mouse you also have an iPhone Lightning
dog and a quirky Cordys for cable
management not a whole lot on your desk
which is good because you do have a very
clean setup I also notice the humongous
speaker you have on top of your desk now
normally this would bother me but for
some reason it just works with your
setup and there's really no other place
you can put it since you only have one
so not many cables underneath as well it
looks like you rattled them underneath
the carpet I think I'll see I have no
idea how you did that without the carpet
having bulges so I give you a thumbs up
on that and I'm also glad you don't have
an H 440 PC case because I've seen
enough of those in these setup words now
this is just me but if I were to put up
a picture of a car and frame it on my
wall it's definitely not going to be
picture of a Honda so I'm assuming you
either do that and want to display your
artwork or there's another meaning
behind it by the way if you did draw
that I give you an A+ really good job on
the details I was going to make a
sarcastic joke on the fact that you have
a landline phone but I'm gonna let it go
since it offsets the lamp on the
opposite side to make it somewhat
symmetrical but anyways overall very
clean I'm really diggin the glass table
and you have great taste and monitors
Thank You Danny for submitting your desk
setup next up we have webinar oh and
damn there's there's a lot going on over
here first up I want to mention that I'm
really diggin the atmosphere you got
going on this does look like the real
deal man cave I also notice that you
went with a white red and black theme I
like so on that awesome desk of yours
there is a 40 inch philips TV hooked up
to your pc along with a 24 inch Dell
monitor you also have a Razer Tartarus
gaming keyboard a rabu wireless keyboard
any Mad Catz rat 7 Gaming Mouse by the
way that Gaming Mouse looks like a damn
Transformers Mouse I mean this is what
Optimus Prime uses when he's gaming but
usually you guys have to check it out
I'll leave a link to it down below I
also see a Plantronics 780 headset with
a red cable you definitely pay attention
to details so I will give you props for
that one thing I would strongly suggest
is perhaps getting a larger gaming mouse
pad because I have no idea how you game
on something that small so on the wall
looks like you have a mounted Toshiba TV
which looks like it's hooked up to your
ps3
point for Team Sony you did a fantastic
job on cable management and you have a
very unique desk layout I honestly
haven't seen anything like that and the
red LEDs that you had behind the desk
really ties everything together however
I don't know how I feel about those
stools I'm sure they are for guests but
I would have done something with back
support so that your guests can relax
while gaming or watching movies for a
long period of time in one of your other
picks you actually have really comfy one
seat sofa so I'm not sure what made you
decide to switch them I also want to
mention that you have a beast of a
computer really great choice on the
Corsair 780 T tower if you're going to
build a badass PC like this you have to
have a full window to show off your
stuff and plus one for keeping your
theme and really great job on the cable
management once again inside the PC I
won't waste time going through the parts
or aspects of the PC but I will have
them linked below the set up equipment
in the description section for those of
you that are interested all right next
up we have Brandon looks like we have a
dual monitor setup different models but
they are both from Asus to be fair he
didn't mention that one of the monitors
is discontinued which is why I wasn't
able to get to so thank you for letting
me know I can sleep better at night I'm
not sure what the deal is with that huge
poster on your wall I mean what is so
special about it that you have to remind
yourself that is designed
made in New Zealand and what is designed
and made in New Zealand I don't get it
so on the table we have a Razer
BlackWidow chroma keyboard a DeathAdder
mouse and a razer mousepad and is that a
ps4 controller I see you know what that
means I also notice that you have a
Razer Mouse bungee and for those of you
that don't know what that is it
basically keeps the mouse cord off of
the desk so that way the mouse isn't get
stuck when you're actually gaming but I
want to hear your experience with it so
let me know if it's working out for you
in the comment section down below that's
going to take a look under your desk so
okay looks like you use zip ties and
some tape to clean up the cables a bit
so not bad at all and I just noticed you
eraser headphones near your PC tower
I wish you would have sent me pic of
your PC but oh well but anyways you have
a pretty good setup just get to the same
monitors and you will get my approval
but thank you Brandon for submitting
your desk setup next up we got George
let's go in and see what you submitted
holy speaker is Batman it looks like we
have a triple monitor set up with two
pairs of Pioneer 5.1 speakers spread on
three separate tables from Ikea I really
love the presentation you just can't
look away from it I think that the blue
LEDs under the desk and I'm guessing
there are some behind the monitors as
well really adds to the overall setup
it's just gorgeous man I mean what can I
say really good job so looks like you
went with three LG 24 inch IPS monitors
mounted under onyx stands and you did a
really good job routing the cables
behind them you have a black widow
keyboard MX mouse and a Corsair mouse
pad and on the left of those you have
the remote to change the color of the
LEDs I'm guessing and the galaxy note 2
with a galaxy tablet right next to it
you also have some filming gear which
I'm guessing are use for your YouTube
channel and a 32 inch sony tv for
console gaming and from the controller
on your desk it's evident that you are
team Microsoft by the way great choice
on the Audio Technica headphones amazing
job on cable management you have a ton
of stuff on your desk and the fact that
you kept it all the way from site
deserves an award
I'm also digging your PC set up overall
really clean cable management and I see
that you're rocking the MSI GTX 970
graphics card which is a solid choice as
always I will leave a link to the parts
and specs down below oh yeah my nothing
really to criticize you I'm really
impressed with the clean and symmetrical
setup you have thank you George for
entering setup wars last but not least
we have Tyler okay so we have two
different sizes and two different
colored monitors
in his defense he did try and get
another monitor but they were out of
stock so they went in and updated them
to a different size model so don't sweat
it bro I got you so on the table we got
another black widow keyboard and a Death
Adder Mouse and an extended mouse pad
from glorious you know what makes me
really happy every time I see an
extended mouse pad instead of the
traditional square ones
it really does clean up the overall look
of the desk props on picking up the
snowball mic and mounting it on your
desk
that reminds me I actually have to pick
up one of these for myself but it's
going to take a look under your desk and
it looks like you did a good job on
cable management overall very clean and
I didn't even notice that you have LEDs
it seems like LED strips are also very
common in these desk setups but yeah
overall a very simple setup Thank You
