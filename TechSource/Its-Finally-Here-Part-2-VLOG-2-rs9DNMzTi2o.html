first part of the benchmarks I'm kind of
getting hungry so I go get something to
eat
the only thing I had this morning was
like a box of cereal and it's 234 now so
the only thing I had this morning was
like a box of cereal yeah go get
somebody
screw it McDonald's it is food he got
blueberry pies now definitely try that
thank you
where do the McDonald what can I get for
today yes can I get a Big Mac meal with
extra Big Mac sauce and I'll get to the
blueberry pies please you will ride the
tickle that's it
all right give me 19 sit down the very
first one I thank you thank you I don't
know why but I'm super excited to try
those blueberry pies they just look so
damn good on the poster
Thanks can I get some ranch and catch
him
you forgot my iced tea
you could even give the drink first
oh I can get some out of ketchup too
also this is what I do with my ranch I
get out some ketchup and I pour it in
the ranch I know looks gross but
honestly it's amazing it's kind of like
Thousand Island sauce from in-and-out or
somewhat like that without the pic holes
and stuff but try it out guys I think
you will love it this is meant for your
fries just dip it in there mix it up and
eat it
mmm so good not bad I don't give it my
seal of approval but I will give it my
not bad award
back in the office let's get back to
work
I saw the gaming benchmarks I've done
the only one that I'm working on is the
grand theft auto 5 because apparently
there is an update so I'm currently
waiting on that to finish uploading or
updating I should say I don't know if
you guys noticed this but in my
voiceover videos there's a slight echo
there's a noticeable echo in my voice
and that's because I guess it's a big
room and there's not many items here to
absorb that sound so I picked up one of
these acoustic foams it's in gray in red
which is the closest I can find for
black and red I'm going to put these
against the wall over here I got some 3m
tape spray adhesive spray adhesive can't
even speak put some on the back of it
and then mount it against the wall here
and some pretty cool design around my
silver play button but yeah hopefully
this will absorb some sound and they'll
be less echoing my voiceovers but that's
basically after this I'm done with the
benchmarks and I can go assemble my
shelf so I'll see you guys soon
so as I was assembling the furniture
this happened
yeah I still me tore a piece of this as
thing is so flimsy I basically grabbed
it one hand and then it just snapped in
place like that so yeah probably should
have done that so call Amazon and they
are the best customer service they're
actually going to send me another one
completely free for without charge so
yeah I got pretty lucky on that so I'm
looking to finish assembling this today
and then I'll just be missing one drawer
and I can finish it up in two days
I swear today is just not my day and
spent hours putting his dresser together
and look what happened I get to the very
last nail in the back and put it in an L
it crooked and it just came out from the
top so the very last nail I swear to God
today I just been a clusterfuck of bad
news and bad things happening after
another so thank God at least I'm
getting a new one in a few days from
Amazon so I can just pop off the top
cover and then replace it so yeah I
think I'm going to call it guys thank
you so much for watching this is my
first ever vlog so obviously the quality
and editing will improve if I decide to
continue but let me know if you guys
actually enjoy this I mean other than
assembling furniture needing a Big Mac
it's really nothing else interesting
happening but yeah anyways you guys want
me to continue these vlogs let me know
by leaving a like and drop me a comment
down below if you want me to continue
but other than that I'm gonna go knock
out I'm exhausted I'll see you guys in
the next video
what's up guys so it's now Wednesday and
I started day off doing some errands so
far so good nothing bad has happened
knock on wood I also got the third Titan
X in the middle today from Amazon so I
can finish doing the b-roll shots for
the benchmark video but in the meantime
I have three Titan X's just sitting here
maybe I'll do a 3-way SLI build Nats
overkill
well yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and
replace the bad GPU Chet thing cuz the
one on the top place with that finish up
the video and I should have this
uploaded hopefully on Friday if not
Saturday for you guys also one more
thing remember that little piece I was
missing from the furniture I went to
Lowe's and I finally picked one up for a
bunch of them up I should say finally I
can finish this damn project boom
finally done
all right moment of truth so I just put
the P a PC I just put the GPU in I'm
scared
I hope it works oh and we have liftoff
ladies and gentlemen oh man
my house was like pounding like I did
not want to wait another freaking day
for this but the so I bridge back on by
the way you guys can adjust the color on
these graphics cards using the the
GeForce experience program I'm gonna
show you real quick
open up your GeForce experience and then
you go to my rig up there and then down
here it should be called LED visualizer
and then you click on configure LED
visualizer hopefully you guys can see
that and basically just click on
whichever lights you want the one on top
the one on bottom or if you want all
LEDs you select on the old LED option
and you guys can select which option you
guys like this animation there's
breathing starts to breathe in and out
yeah that's pretty cool I just thought
I'd share that with you guys in case
some of you out there that never knew
about this but you obviously have to
have a geforce card for it to work
alright so i put on a new shirt somewhat
fix my hair still a huge mess and i'm
ready to film the second part of the
benchmark video when i can finally
finish this project up and go ahead and
start on my budget build for november
which honestly at this point I might as
well just push it to December but
alright I will see what happens
yeah let's get started
what's up guys it's ed back again from
tech source and welcome to the gaming PC
build for the month of November anyways
that's it wrap it up here thank you so
much for watching I will see you in the
next video so yeah I think that would
pretty well I'm really happy with the
way that turned out now it's time to
edit all right so it's not o'clock and
it's getting pretty late I'm gonna wrap
this vlog up
I will try make these very short I'm
sorry that the first vlog had to be
split in two parts um I'm kind of new at
this so bear with me guys until I adjust
into this vlogging world assuming you
guys still want to watch these if have
you guys are I haven't fallen asleep but
tomorrow is going to be somewhat
productive day I'm actually editing or
rendering I should say the first vlog of
part 1 and tomorrow I'm going to finish
editing that video that I shot today
that will be up on Friday I don't know
when you're gonna be watching this vlog
and oh I want to show you the drawer I
assembled so this is the drawer from
Amazon like I said I'm gonna put my pin
err on top well obviously in my camera
bag and then some stuff on the drawers
of course like paper and ink
this drawer was like 60 bucks though and
honestly for its price I give it a 4 out
of 5 and you get free shipping or if
you're a Prime member but I'll leave a
link down below if you guys want to
check that out but it's a really nice
drawer but yeah it's really it's nice
and deep it's nice and wide did she said
and you can feel a bunch of stuff in
there so yeah really nice drawer I think
it comes in black as well but anyways
it's enough promoting the drawer from
not even getting paid for I'll leave a
link down below if you guys when I check
that out I'm gonna try and clean this
office up tomorrow and hopefully get
these installed as well these are
cushion things the acoustic foams to
absorb sound I'm going to mount it on
the wall around the silver play button
yeah
I'm done rambling thank guys for
watching if you enjoy honestly if you
enjoy these vlogs let me know by leaving
a like and drop a comment down below if
you want me to continue if you don't
like my blogs dislike the video so I
know and that's it I will see you guys
