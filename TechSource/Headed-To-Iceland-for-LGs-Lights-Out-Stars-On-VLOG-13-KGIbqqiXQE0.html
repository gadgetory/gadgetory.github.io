I've ever been in it's like a ghost town
in here we just got picked up by LG now
we're heading to our hotel as you guys
can see my eyes this is how much sleep I
miss a nap or how much sleep I need I
should say so
since I got the hotel come on pack and
knock
all right so this is the hotel oh look
at that LG has created oh my god
is that me is that sir see me looking I
god it's got like my freakin chair
everything why am i pointing a finger
looks like I'm flipping off something up
what's up guys Evan thanks so this is
legit Leonie even got my little like
avatar yeah it's freaking awesome
that is so badass Wow I think so why did
you say that out of that Wow they want
us to get drunk this is so freaking
awesome what's in there a little
unboxing but first let's finish up the
tour so yeah nothing really to fancy
because it's kind of like an
old-fashioned themed hotel really nice
really cozy so anyways yeah that's one
side
yeah little chair here and that is the
bed area and yeah it's massive like view
here is this crazy alright so I guess on
the left side here is where the bathroom
area is how do you know that I can make
this switch
okay yeah that doesn't work that's which
does not isn't liking so yeah I don't
know why the light switch isn't working
but this is apparently the bathroom it's
a walk-in shower whoa I almost freaking
broke this thing so it opens up
and some pretty cool is there seriously
male toilet in here say apparently the
bathroom is in here again how to fix the
lights but not sure why they would
separate this with the shower but hey
that's pretty cool
seriously this is freaking amazing guys
LG you guys seriously are spoiling me
thank you guys so much for this this is
I never knew I would be an action figure
one day I'm excited thank you guys so
much so I'm figuring out the lighting
situation basically have to put in your
key card in this main switch area and
then that basically powers the entire
hotel also when I come back from the LG
tour I'm gonna go ahead and unbox these
little packages here later on today and
take a closer look at this so yeah very
excited
I just got done with the LG interview
right now we're just chillin with some
sparkling wine and I think later I'm
gonna go get some dinner with the LG
reps so and then probably call it a
night because honestly I'm exhausted and
by the way I want to apologize if I
sound like a zombie because I haven't
gotten much sleep and I'm extremely
tired so I'm sorry for my enthusiastic
as usual
