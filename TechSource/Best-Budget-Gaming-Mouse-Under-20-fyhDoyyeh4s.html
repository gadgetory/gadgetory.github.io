welcome back to another roundup video
but we look at the best budget gaming
gear on there a certain dollar amount if
you guys remember last time we took a
look at some dope RGB mouse pads and
I'll jump link below if you guys want to
check that out but in this video we're
gonna take a look at the best budget
gaming mice under $20 so I went in
Amazon and I bought all the gaming mice
on the $20 that had high ratings and
lots of reviews so with that said let's
kick off the video with the popular
Logitech G 300s so this goes for $20 and
it's an optical gaming mouse designed
for people with tiny hands if you guys
have large hands like me do not buy this
mouse it's very uncomfortable the cool
thing about the g 300s is the extra
buttons on top which are great for
macros it will take some getting used to
but the software allows you to easily
change the functions on there as well as
control the RGB lighting on the side the
mouse is really light so it's easier to
pick up during gaming but one thing I
noticed while using the mouse is that it
requires a little more force than usual
when clicking and they're pretty loud
too I do wish the added some type of
texture for the scroll wheel because it
can get slippery if you have oily or
sweaty hands but I don't know it's a
decent Mouse for tiny hands I give it a
3.5 next up is the popular red dragon m6
a1 with over 6,000 reviews it's going
for 12 dollars and it might already be a
deal-breaker for most people due to the
color scheme it has red accents and red
lighting which can be disabled using
their poorly made software when it comes
to comfort it's not the most ergonomic
Mouse on the list
it feels very rough due to the texture
of the top mouse buttons and I'm not a
fan of the ABS plastic side grips it's
also a very flat Mouse so it's not ideal
for claw or finger type grips for Palm
users however it's great what I do like
what the mouse or the textures on the
side button as well as the scroll wheel
for gaming it's not bad it definitely
gets the job done it's very light it
tracks well and you can actually adjust
the weight by removing the rear cover
and adjusting the weights that way
personally the mouse is light as it is
with the entire set on but the option is
there to make it lighter the feedback on
the clicks are also much quieter than
the G 300s and for $12 I feel like you
really are getting what you pay for I'm
surprised this has a lot of positive
reviews on
Amazon my waiting on this is a 2.5 next
up is the her lef 300 which comes in at
$18 I gotta say the lighting on this
mouse is pretty cool there are some
noticeable hotspots but if you keep the
color cycling then it's not that
noticeable
there's even a dedicated LED button
right next to the DPI button which lets
you cycle through a few different
effects however you do have more options
for lighting through their buggy
software you might experience issues
setting up the RGB lighting I'm hoping
they can fix this in an upcoming update
because they now work for me even using
two different pcs lighting aside is very
comfortable in the side grips along with
the light weight to make it very easy to
lift and slide around during gaming the
buttons are very easy to reach however I
would have liked to see some texture on
the scroll wheel but it's not a big deal
considering it does have a rubber type
grip on it I would say this mouse is
great for all grip types it's not too
flat or round however it is designed for
right-handed users only it's also not
loud and the clicks provide great
feedback it's really a shame because I
really like this mouse if it wasn't for
the buggy software I would have given it
a higher rating but for now it's a solid
four for me next on the list is another
red dragon Mouse the m7 11 Cobra which
is way better than the m6 so one for
several reasons
first off the design it's way more
comfortable and the software is so much
better there are two DPI buttons on the
top to cycle through the sensitivity and
the third button controls the RGB
effects but you do have more options to
tweak the sensitivity and the lighting
through the software the mouse has a
nice smooth surface with textured grips
all around including the scroll wheel
the clicks provide great feedback and
tracks really well on both cloth and
hard surface mouse pads I really enjoyed
my time gaming with this mouse and so
far I would say it's the best gaming
mouse on the list I can't find any
reason not to give this mouse a five out
of five well done red dragon next up is
the cheapest mouse on the list coming in
at just $10 this mouse is more on the
larger side and its slightly heavier
than the others but it is still
comfortable to use I'm personally not a
fan of this cracked look style that it
has going on and the fact that you can't
control the lighting might be a
deal-breaker as well too
people so it mouse has a really smooth
surface and the grips on the sides
combined with the concave design makes
it really easy to lift and slide around
I've been in 1 &amp;amp; 2 any issue as well
gaming on it I do like the grip on the
scroll wheel however the side buttons
are a bit too high and they're also too
thin for my taste the clicks on the
mouse are noticeably louder than the
other mice on the list and it does feel
like it requires a little more force as
well just like the G 300s from Logitech
I mean for $10 you can't really ask for
much I don't even know how this company
is making money selling this mouse I
give this a solid 3 out of 5
these next two mice from pic tech are
very similar in terms of build quality
and specs it's got the same dpi in the
same sensor so the mouse on my right
hand is actually the newest version and
it has a different design and RGB
lighting but for the most part both the
mice feel the same the newer version of
the mouse also happens to be the number
one seller on Amazon they both have a
texture to grip on the side button and
the scroll wheel which is nice and
they're both very comfortable to use
during gaming they're not that life at
the same time they're not heavy as well
making it very easy to lift and slide
across the mousepad the newer Mouse has
one extra button on the side which you
can program and the software is more
advanced giving you more lighting
options to choose from personally I like
the design of the older Mouse better but
the RGB lighting and the software on the
newer version is way better you have
more RGB options on the newer Mouse
compared to the older one this company
over here definitely knows how to make
mice I gave both of these a 4.5 last
minute least we have another red dragon
Mouse this one is the m602 and it goes
for seventeen dollars this mouse is the
widest one from the list so it's more
cater to people with larger hands it
also has a contour shape to it so it has
these subtle resting points for your
thumb and pinky finger on the other side
I have to admit though it was a little
weird coming to this Mouse from the
others because of the contour shape so
it might take some getting used to but I
did find it comfortable near the end
despite it being a really light Mouse
it's not so easy picking it up because
of how wide it is so I don't recommend
it for fast paced games the scroll wheel
has a textured grip to it and so does
one of the side buttons to help
distinguish the difference and there are
two things I don't like about this Mouse
the red braided cable which defeats the
purpose of heavy
RGB mousepad in the first place and once
again the software it's very buggy and I
can't get the RGB lighting to work looks
like it's stuck on the default a rainbow
cycle so if you're looking for a static
color I would look elsewhere if they
change their cable and they fix their
damned software I would have given this
a 3.5 but for now it's a solid three and
that does it for my roundup of the best
gaming mice under $20 if you guys
