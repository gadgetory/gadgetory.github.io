welcome to another episode of best tech
deals of the week we don't have that
many UK deals this time around but still
some pretty sweet deals so let's go
ahead and begin so starting off with
some UK deals we have a 23 inch asus
monitor with an IPS display going for
around one hundred and sixteen pounds
the super budget 430 watt power supply
from EVGA also dropped in price so if
you guys are planning on building a
budget PC soon and you live in the UK
and this is probably the best deal you
can find anywhere staying on the topic
of PC gaming I found on r9 380 graphics
card that dipped in price and finally
stumbled across a nexus 6p smartphone
with 32 gigabytes of space going for
around 385 pounds jumping into newegg we
have a bunch of sweet deals like this 34
inch LG ultra wide monitor that's going
for four hundred dollars off right now
you get a 2560 x 1440 p display which
won't be too hard on the graphics card
and it's excellent for productivity we
also have a great deal on a two terabyte
hard drive that's going for 70 bucks
using the code listed below if you've
been holding off on buying a power
supply that now's your chance you can
get a 500 watt psu from EVGA for only 20
bucks you get ten dollars off using the
promo code which ends soon and an extra
twenty-five dollars in the form of a
rebate card from other words the new
MSI's e170 a is going for only 80 bucks
that also comes with a sweet-looking red
mouse from steelseries if you want an
extremely tight budget that are looking
for a monitor then the LG 19.5 inch
monitor is going for only 70 bucks but
keep in mind that it's not 1080p instead
you get a 1600 x 900 display so if you
need it for everyday tasks and web
browsing then it's perfect for you if
you must have a high resolution this
acer g7 monitor is the next best option
that's under 100 bucks and this is in
1080p but if you guys want a really
badass gaming monitor for the absolute
lowest price anywhere in the world then
the q knicks 144 hurts monitor is
something you guys should check out by
now it's only going 470 bucks which is
the lowest price available for a 144
heads gaming monitor anywhere it does
have a 1.5 millisecond response time
which is kind of weird but it's only
available until the 25th of this month
there was
one catch though according to the
description it states that the monitor
has to be compatible with your GPU so if
your graphics card isn't listed on here
I guess it won't be compatible with it I
never knew 100 is needed to be
compatible with graphics cards that's
pretty strange finally on newegg we have
a corsair h60 cpu cooler going for 50
bucks after a ten dollar mail-in rebate
I haven't given much love to Apple users
so starting off we have a 12-core mac
pro going for 8800 with an instant
savings of eight hundred dollars next up
you have a late 2015 21.5 inch imac with
a retina 4k display you only get two
hundred dollars off but regardless it's
still a deal finally let's take a look
at some amazon deals a 27 inch dell
monitor with a quad HD display that's
off three hundred bucks currently a
Samsung Galaxy Tab s2 that dropped 100
bucks of the weekend and a thermaltake
mini-itx cube Chessie's case that's
going for forty-eight dollars these last
three deals are on games infamous second
son is going for twenty bucks on the ps4
Mad Max on the xbox one only is going
for twenty-five dollars and finally the
Elder Scrolls 3 is going for only six
dot seventy-nine cents for PCs that's
what the best tech deals of this week as
always if you guys enjoyed a series make
sure to leave it like and i'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
