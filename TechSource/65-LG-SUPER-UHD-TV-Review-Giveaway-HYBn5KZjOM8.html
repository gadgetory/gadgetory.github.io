this video we're going to be taking a
look at LG's new super UHD TV and if you
guys are interested in winning one of
those make sure to stick around for more
info so what you're looking at is LG's
65 inch super UHD TV they have models
ranging from 55 inches all the way up to
65 inches with 3d technology variants
the super UHD TV also features an IPS 4k
quantum display technology which gives
off wider viewing angles so no matter
where you are sitting in the room you
still get the best experience honestly
the color reproduction of this TV is
ridiculously good and you can't really
tell through a camera lens this is a
perfect example of you need to see it in
person to believe it even though there
is a much 4k content out there the TV
will still upscale it to 4k meaning the
images won't get pixelated with the
quantum display you get a much wider
palette of over a billion rich colors
for a more lifelike picture it also
states that the TV features a trumotion
240 Hertz refresh rate which is just a
marketing term the TV in fact has a 120
Hertz refresh rate in terms of
aesthetics the TV looks beautiful super
thin silver bezels with an aluminum
curve the base I don't really have a
problem with a silver base but I
definitely would have preferred black
bezels
so that it blends in with the screen the
TV itself is also extremely thin
measuring just under an inch from each
side taking a look in the back you can
find all the necessary inputs along with
4 holes which are VESA compatible in
case you decide to mount it against the
wall you also get one USB 3 N 3 HDMI
ports and two standard USB ends near the
bottom to the left of that you get the
usual optical out SBC Ethernet port and
of course your antenna or cable on the
bottom center of the display you will
find a joystick to navigate the menu and
a pair of 20 watt speakers which were
designed by Harman Kardon and let me
tell you guys these sound pretty damn
good considering their built-in speakers
here's a few audio samples
to achieve it
there's only one path to peace there
extinction
try to create a suit of armor around the
world but I created something terrible
artificial intelligence
it's called the option program this is
definitely one of the very few TVs that
I have tested out that actually have
great built-in speakers
another thing that LG did write is the
remote and operating system I can't tell
you how many horrible remotes and
operating systems I've been through and
I feel like LG has the best OS offered
on any TV and I can say that because
I've tested Samsung's videos and even
Sony's TVs and none of them come close
to start off the remote itself is super
easy to use
LG calls it their magic remote is
compact and doesn't have a million
buttons on there only the essentials
that you need I especially love the
scroll wheel and I feel like this is
something the other TVs are missing
big-time it just makes it that much
easier navigating and scrolling through
pages the remote also features a
built-in sensor that allows you to
simply point and click and although it's
not something I'm a huge fan of it's
definitely a lot better than using the
directional buttons to type out words
personally I would prefer to have a
small keyboard built in the remote maybe
on the opposite side so that I can just
turn it over and start typing stuff
whenever I need to it also has a
built-in mic so you can use your voice
to search for things which was
surprisingly very accurate Game of
Thrones I found myself using a voice
search more than the actual
point-and-click feature the remote does
use two double-a batteries which are
included but I toss those aside and use
my EBL rechargeable batteries instead
once they run out of juice in a few
months I simply recharge them and slap
them back inside I never have to buy new
batteries again if you guys are
interested in checking these out I'll
leave a link below for you I'm also a
huge fan of LG's new web OS 3.0 which is
the operating system that it's running
it's simplified colorful and extremely
user friendly so on the main page is
where you will find LG's content store
you can check out your most recently
viewed TV shows or movies for easy
access
on the top of the screen is where you
can find the specific tabs for TV shows
movies apps and gaming under the premium
tab is where you can find all the apps
that come with a TV but a quicker way to
access the apps is by pressing the home
button on the controller I personally
don't have cable since I don't watch TV
so the two main apps that I use
constantly are Netflix and YouTube
and since this is a 4k TV meaning it has
a resolution of 3840 by 2160 I can enjoy
4k content straight from YouTube a lot
of youtubers myself including film and
4k and I get to watch the content the
way it's meant to be watched the TV also
features screen sharing on select
devices that are compatible meaning you
guys can connect your smartphone tablet
or laptop and miR the content straight
from your device
luckily the YouTube app has a built-in
mirror or airplay option so that I can
connect my iPhone directly to the TV
through the YouTube app and play any
video I want I love this feature since I
can exit the app and still use my phone
without interfering with the video
before I get into gaming I want to talk
about the main feature of these TVs that
separate it from the rest of the
competition
so LG's super UHD TVs come with HDR
technology which allows the TV to
display more realistic images it has
more depth thanks to its brighter
brights and improved shadow detail more
specifically there are two formats for
HDR content Dolby vision and HDR 10 LG's
TVs are the only ones available now that
actually support both the movies or TV
shows that are mastered for Dolby vision
or HDR 10 can be enjoyed on LG's TVs
which basically lets you watch the
movies the way they were meant to be
watched here's a good example of what it
would look like with and without Dolby
vision as you guys can tell the colors
come to life as they drag the bar across
more and more Hollywood blockbusters and
TV shows are being mastered and Dolby
vision and being played in cutting-edge
cinemas across the world if you guys
want the same experience you need Dolby
vision or HDR 10 and since LG's new TV
has both you won't be missing out last
but not least let's talk about gaming so
how does LG's new TVs perform while
gaming on a ps4 or Xbox one well not
that good to be honest even though the
TV has a 60 Hertz refresh rate the HDMI
outputs less than that meaning there is
noticeable input lag it definitely
doesn't feel like you're getting a 60
Hertz or fresh rate it's more like 30 to
40 it's a shame because I do like
playing on my ps4 occasionally but with
the input lag I just can't play well the
responsiveness in a key
she is greatly impacted but gaming aside
I really really like this TV in fact
it's already replaced my samsung tv
downstairs as the main living room TV
but that will do it for the review if

always want to give you huge things to
