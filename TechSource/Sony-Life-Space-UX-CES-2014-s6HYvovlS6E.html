Squarespace the one tool needed to
create your very own website or
portfolio for free trial or your first
purchase use the Kotex source one for
ten percent off what's up guys text
sources here at the CES convention in
Las Vegas and we came across a bunch of
cool companies with new and innovative
products however there was only a few
that stood out from the rest Sony was
one of those few we took a look at all
their products from gaming TVs watches
two cameras like the new sony alpha five
thousand i got announced recently with
the 20.1 megapixel CMOS sensor a by ons
x processor and built-in Wi-Fi the Alpha
5000 is labeled as the world's lightest
interchangeable lens camera weighing at
seven point four ounces without a
battery card or lens however we were
most impressed with Sony's lifespace UX
room in the digital age the users
experience has become very important so
Sony created a new world where you can
enjoy your entertainment content without
the restrictions opposed by boxes or
frames and the essence of their vision
is to create a new category that they
call life space UX it's going to
simplify the way you live the first
concept they showed us was this simple
table combined with Sony's super compact
laser projector basically while you're
having breakfast you can view the news
you can see the traffic before heading
out to work check out your schedule and
people can even leave you notes and vice
versa you can also sit down with your
family and sort photos and even share
them with the people you want over here
he's showing an example of people
sending him photos all across the
country they were able to get this done
using Sony's highly accurate image
sensors making them go above and beyond
all with just one touch do you also
introduce their compact short-throw
laser projectors combined with their m7
speakers creating a pleasant environment
it plays relaxing music and projects a
moving image usually pertaining to
nature and attached to the projectors
are the speakers the entire thing is a
prototype we do not know if you can
increase the size of the projected image
as of yet the next concept introduced is
called a wall mount display when off it
basically looks like a mirror so it
would easily fit into any home's decor
however when you walk by and see a
contact that might be of interest you
can select it with just one touch and we
simple gesture you can navigate and read
that article sony believes that there is
definitely potential for this product in
the future and it will enhance how users
interact with their content and
entertainment and lastly they save the
best for last they introduced the
world's first ultra short throw 4k
projector compared to conventional
projectors with flat panel displays
which seemed to be in a certain distance
to project the image these can be placed
fairly close to the wall as you can see
and will cast up to a 1 47 inch image
here's a sample of what they showed us
now the best part about all these are
the designs when not in use they are
very unintuitive it's right into the
room without breaking up the ambience of
your home sony also announced that this
product will be available in the US this
summer now using one of Sony's lifespace
UX concepts will certainly enhance your
lifestyle but if you combine all four
then you can influence all aspects of
the home let's say for example you want
to take your family to deep-sea diving
or swimming with the fish with one touch
you can see the sun shining through the
water above on the walls you can see the
fish swimming all around you and on the
table you can see the coral reef below
that's just one example of bringing all
four concepts together overall we were
really impressed with the presentation I
can't wait for Sony to release this so
we can take a closer look at it here at
the text source we will also be
uploading a few more CES coverage within
