month and you guys get to vote on the
best custom PC if you guys are new to
the series and want to submit your
custom PC make sure to watch the video
linked down below but with that said let
the PC Wars begin
stop paying full retail price for games
guys g2a offers really cheap CD keys for
any game out there for any platform they
sell super cheap CD keys for windows too
and this is actually where I get my
games from as well as operating systems
that I use for my custom PC builds each
month but I'm gonna leave a link down
below so you can see for yourself so as
always departs for the pcs will be
linked down below for anyone that is
interested but with that said the 5
custom pieces that I am featuring this
week are from Jessie Joann Josh Nick and
Stephane congratulations for making it
to the very first episode of PC wars
ok so first up we have Jesse from
episode 5 of setup wars with a stunning
red white and black build and side the
courser air 540 case another really
clean build rockin yet another 4790k
processor overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz
this beast is also running to EVGA gtx
980 s and sli with 16 gigabyte of
corsair dominator platinum Ram and a
courser H 105 to keep things cool cable
management is spot-on and the PC got a
fire track score of a whopping 17
thousand 410 which puts this thing
really close to 4k gaming pcs very
impressive indeed the only thing I'll
recommend is an EVGA sli bridge to go
with the build but other than that you
have a beast PC Thank You Jessie for
entering PC Wars at number 2 we have
Joanne's PC another black and red build
inside a fan Tex luxe case this is the
second PC to feature a 4790k CPU clock
at 4.0 gigahertz
it also has 16 gigabyte of RAM and an H
100 i GTX CPU cooler Cayla management is
ok I don't know why you didn't out the
cables coming from the GPU through the
back and into the PSU because it really
stands out like that for 5 spec
benchmarks I managed to score ten
thousand two hundred and fifty four but
yeah other than fixing that one cable
you have a pretty solid build thank you
John for entering PC Wars next up we
have Josh with our very first budget
build inside the courser 230 TK
it's rocking at Intel G 32:58 CPU which
is clocked at 3.2 gigahertz and an Asus
GTX 750 Ti
it also has 8 gigabytes of g.skill RAM
and an Asus be 85 mg motherboard I'm not
sure why you went with an ATX case when
a microwave TX case would have been
enough but anyways cable management is
decent and the PC scored 836 88 which is
expected but I would recommend checking
your drivers because it doesn't seem
like they are updated other than that
it's a pretty cool budget build you got
there Josh thank you for entering PC
Wars next up is Nick and his black and
white build using the fractal design r2
case inside this bad boy we got the i5
4690k clock - 4.7 gigahertz and gigabyte
r9 280 graphics card 8 gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance Ram and a coarser h-60
to keep things cool chalo management is
spot on and I'm digging those custom
black sleeve cables for benchmarks it
scored a 79 18 for fire strike which
puts it right below an oculus rift spec
gaming PC the only thing that bothers me
are those 2 red fans on the cooler but
other than that you have a sick
black-and-white gaming PC Thank You Nick
for entering PC Wars last but certainly
not least we have stuff on and has beast
with dual Titan X's yup this is our very
first Titan XL I build inside the
courser 750 airflow Edition case we have
a 59 60 X on a stock clock - EVGA super
clock time X's 32 gigabytes of g.skill
DDR Ram at 2800 megahertz and an H 100 I
GTX CPU cooler honestly I love the parts
but if you spent that much on the PC I
would at least gotten some custom cables
the stock cables from coarser just don't
look great especially on a monster build
like this for benchmarks that scored an
incredible 20,000 774 which puts this
thing in the 1% bracket which is
expected with parts like these but other
than pimping out the PC with some custom
cables LEDs and a cooler looking sli
bridge you my friend have an ultimate
gaming pc Thank You Stefan for entering
PC Wars
