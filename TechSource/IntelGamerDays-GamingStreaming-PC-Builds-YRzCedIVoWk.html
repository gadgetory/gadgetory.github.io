teamed up for this awesome event that
they're hosting called Intel gamer days
it's a limited time us exclusive event
featuring awesome deals and buying
discounts specifically targeted for
hardcore and mainstream gamers the event
lasts from September 1st to the 16th so
be sure to check it out by visiting the
link below
they're also hosting a giveaway on the
coarser won gaming PC and find out how
to enter stick around to the end alright
guys so in this video I'm really
focusing on two separate PC
configurations the first one is a
low-end
budget gaming PC under $700 and the
other one's gonna be a high-end really
awesome good-looking gaming and
screaming PC with an all-white color
scheme in fact some of the parts might
be on sale for the Intel gamer day so
make sure you guys check that page
before you purchase any parts once again
the link to that will be down below and
before I began to want to give you huge
thanks to Intel and courser for
sponsoring this video so starting up
with a beast budget build this is gonna
cost a little over $600 and it features
the i3 8100 quad-core processor with 4
threads the CPU has quickly become very
popular in budget build because of its
crazy performance and actually
outperforms its competitor the rise in
2200 G and the rise in three 1200 by a
noticeable amount for just pure gaming
horsepower around $100 the i3 8100 is my
recommendation since we're going Intel
we do need a compatible board and since
the CPU is locked there is no need to
spend more for overclocking the best
value right now is from gigabyte in a
stubby 360m board it's a micro ATX board
with four Ram slots and that to support
it's got six USBs three of which are USB
3 and also three fan headers all in all
it's a solid board for the money the
only downside is that B 360 boards only
support up to 2666 rated RAM if you're
using an i3 chip for Ram however I did
pick up a 3000 megahertz weighted stick
simply because it was only five dollars
more than the 2666
might as well go with that just in case
you end up upgrading your board later
down the line it's only five dollars in
the meantime your system will underclock
the RAM
really but you wouldn't run into any
issues using this the stock heatsink on
the CPU is fine I'll get the job done so
instead of buying another cooler we will
actually use that money and put it
towards something else for example on
the storage
I do recommend at least one SSD in this
build so to start things off a 120
gigabyte SSD from coarser will provide
the PC with a nice boost and speeds I
would personally throw in the operating
system on here along with any of the
games you mostly play
I do recommend adding a one terabyte
hard drive later down the line for mass
storage and of course storing other
useless files either an included in this
price tag because an SSD is a really
good place to start and also to keep the
cost down for the graphics card I was
actually lucky to find a gtx 1066
gigabyte founders Edition on Amazon for
just $200 with this card you can easily
game over 60fps maxed out settings in
1080p I don't know how many the person
is selling so if you guys are clicking
on a link below and you see different
price or if it's so loud then I'll drop
a link to the GTX 1050 P I instead which
is around the same price but around 200
bucks you can still gain comfortably
over 60fps with the 1050 Ti however you
might have to lower the settings on some
games depending on how demanding it is
if you really want to hit that 60 FPS
mark the case we're going with is the
coarser carbide spec oh five which is a
good-looking old black case with an
acrylic side panel it has one USB 3 port
on top with a single 120 millimeter fan
included in the case however it does
have space for additional two fans on
the top and one more in the rear so it
can support up to total of five fans
I do recommend adding an additional 120
millimeter fan in the front for a better
airflow because I just feel like one
isn't enough in that entire case courser
does sell an LED fan for around 10
dollars but if you guys don't care about
colors I want to save money you can
actually pick up this 4-pack that cost
around $15 which i think is a much
better deal finishing up the parts is
the cxm 550 watt power supply which is
bronze certified and it's my modular
meaning you can connect only the cables
you need and keep the inside of your PC
cleaner with less clutter so that's it
for the first build that's the
configuration I recommend for anyone
looking to spend
and $700 on a solid 1080p gaming PC over
60 FPS on most games of course obviously
feel free to tweak the parts to your
liking and taste so once again the link
to everything will be down below this
next build is a balance between
performance and aesthetics my goal was
to build a good-looking texture style
gaming and streaming PC for less than 3k
starting off with the CPU I was gonna go
with the new 8086 Kay but then I
realized there isn't a huge performance
difference between both CPUs especially
since the 8700 K can be overclocked up
to 5 begin hurts easily and it cost $100
less so naturally I stuck with it it's
also gonna be great for screaming
because of its six cores and twelve
threads it will even help out on the
productivity side obviously we gotta
cool the processor because we're gonna
overclock it and there's no a IO that
can do it better than the H 150 I Pro
from Corsair this is a 360 millimetre
radiator with 3 120 millimeter fans also
it's RGB the black tubing on these are
nasty so we're gonna cover them up with
the cable mod any il sleeve kit for only
$20 the motherboard was an easy choice
you can't really go wrong with Asus
boards some of the best performance and
reliability out there so I went with the
prime Z 370 because of its features
price and the color scheme it is 2018 so
you got to have our GB RAM the white
vengeance pros from Corsair are the
cleanest and personally my favorite RAM
sticks out there in fact I'm using 32
gigs of these in my personal build for
storage we are keeping it simple with a
single 480 gigabyte m2 SSD for the
operating system and important programs
while the other 480 gigabyte SSD can be
used for games and other files now the
graphics card I wanted to go with is a
unicorn it's very rare to find a galaxy
dition out there I don't know if they're
out of business or they don't make cars
anymore but I think it would look really
awesome in this build with the old white
shroud a 1070 T I also get you over 100
FPS and quad HD gaming in most games
which is 2560 by 1440 P if you're gonna
use high-end hardware like this then you
have to play in a higher resolution it
just feels like a waste playing only on
1080p
I'm also gonna toss an RGB back play on
it because why not
might as well just RGB all the things
inside here and you can actually
customize the backplate do any design
you want but to keep things simple I'm
just gonna showcase a blank white one
the case you are using is the spec Omega
RGB mid tower case which will complement
the build beautifully the strip in front
of the case is RGB and the case itself
comes with to RGB fans already installed
the side panel is tempered glass and I
like that it comes with a PSU cover as
well I'm gonna throw in a can of spray
paint because I would love to paint a
few parts in that case white just so
there's less black inside for example I
would love to paint the motherboard tray
the PCI brackets PSU shroud and even
part of the radiator from the h1 50i
cooler I'm personally not a fan of the
HD RGB fans that Corsair makes so I
would actually replace those with the ll
version instead we're gonna be putting
three of them on the radiator on the h1
50i cooler which is going to be mounted
in the front of the case and then three
additional fans on the top and rear for
optimal airflow we're gonna need a hub
to hook up all these RGB fans so we're
gonna throw in a commander Pro to make
things easy and also throw in a few RGB
strips as well so that the insides are
lit powering the build is the HX 750
watt Platinum certified power supply
that is fully modular which means ladies
and gentlemen we are obviously going
with custom sleeved cables from cable
mod this is the design I'm going with on
the cables with white aluminum cable
combs that's gonna be the icing on the
cake
this entire build with the mods will
cost around $2,600 so those are my two
recommended configurations as always
make sure you guys check out Intel gamer
days because there might be some deals
on the parts mentioned in this video and
also that is where you'll find more
information on the coarser 1a gaming PC
giveaway as mentioned before all the
