games with other people this is Ed and
also likes to play video games with
other people the difference between Bob
and Ed is that bob has a headset with a
built-in microphone
ed however does not have a built-in
microphone which can be frustrating
sometimes when you can't communicate to
other players Bob on the other hand is
having a lot more fun playing his game
because he can talk to his fellow
teammates and opponents ed on the other
hand has some trouble communicating
which makes his game time very
frustrating bob has no complaints
whereas ad has just about had enough
you see ad really likes his headphones
and he does not want to buy a new set
just because of the microphone well ed
doesn't have to worry anymore because
now there is antlions mod mic a
detachable microphone that you can add
to any headphone you want now I can keep
his headphone and using microphone
whenever he needs thanks at lying
what does it be guys it's ad from Texas
and we are taking a look at outlines mod
Mike a detachable microphone that you
can use with any headphone so inside
this awesome carrying case you will find
an alcohol preparation pad a sheet of
instructions showing you how to install
the mike to magnetic bases that allow
you to rotate the mic or completely
remove it from whatever headphone you
attach them to and finally the mod mic
itself there has been a lot of
improvements from their previous version
of the mod Mike one being that the cable
is much more thicker and resilient it
also has a much stiffer steel spine than
prior flexible booms which should lead
to greater durability so this is the
mute version which has a switch down
here to easily mute the microphone on
and off and you can also pick up a non
mute provision for a few bucks less the
cable is extremely long measuring three
point three meters but it does come with
a velcro wrap which is awesome if you
need to shorten the length the mod mic
also comes with a one-year warranty and
they are really fast on replacing parts
for anyone that has issues so the
installation is quite simple just remove
the piece of tape on the bottom of the
base and position it wherever you want
on one side of your headphones and press
down firmly the adhesive is surprisingly
really strong so you don't have to worry
about it falling off any time soon
you can easily adjust the position
without removing the entire piece which
is really convenient and the magnets are
also really powerful you can also detach
the microphone with ease which is
awesome for people that use multiple
headphones overall I gotta say that this
is an awesome product to own I am
actually in this dilemma myself I have
an audio technica ath m50x headphones
and these don't have a built-in
microphone but I love these headphones
so much that I don't want to replace
them so having a detachable mic like
this is pretty sweet but how is the
quality of the microphone well here's a
quick sample I did using the microphone
so here's a sample of me using the
antlion mod mic this is the raw file I
did not do any editing to it so yeah
this is basically what it sounds like
keep in mind that I am using a high-end
microphone to record this video so it
isn't fair to compare it side-by-side
but when you compare it to other
headsets with built-in microphones then
you will notice the difference anyways
that is it for the video I will leave a
link in the description section for
pricing and availability
overall I am really impressed with this
product I am definitely keeping this for
myself and the awesome people at ant
line are sending an extra one to us
which I want to give to you guys so if
you are interested in getting one of
these for free let me know in the
comment section down below I will pick
around the person by the end of this
month and I will announce it on my
Twitter page so make sure you guys are
following me on there this is that from
tech source and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
