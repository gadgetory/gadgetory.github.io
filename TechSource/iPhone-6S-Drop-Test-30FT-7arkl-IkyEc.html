this video we're going to be dropping
the iphone 6s from waist height ear
height and then lastly from up top at 30
feet so that way sigimor time let's
start off by dropping it from the most
common area the waist so no actual
damages from that drop the front of the
screen is at one-hundred percent and the
phone works perfectly the back received
minimal damage those scratch marks by
the way were from the realistic scratch
test video that we did on the iphone and
i'll leave the link to that down below
if you guys want to check that out but
the only two areas that the iphone 6s
car messed up is the crack on the glass
covering the camera and a little scuff
mark near the bottom right moving on to
the ear height drop test this is the
second most common area that phones get
dropped from alright so after that
dropped the frame did get bent in a
little bit near the top along with some
of the scuff marks other than that the
rest of the phone remains unharmed
lastly let's take a look and see what
happens when the iphone is dropped from
30 feet facing downwards c21 oh my god
oh my god I'm coming
always
yeah things done for sure has no ways
about oh
see if the screen works God know if it's
gone
here's a dumb no one see that yeah
alright so it's safe to assume that the
iphone 6s is pretty much destroyed I
mean what phone wouldn't be after being
dropped from 30 feet the entire glass
has shattered to a point where a bunch
of pieces flew off and you can see
behind the glass it does appear that the
phone still works because when I hit the
home button part of the display lights
up showing some signs of life but since
the screen is completely annihilated
there's really no way to use it anyways
that's basically for the video not sure
what you really learn from this other
then don't be stupid and drop your phone
from 30 feet but other than that the
iphone 6s is a rock-solid smartphone and
even dropping it from waist height or
ear height it will still live regardless
you should probably protect your
investment and get a case or even skins
anyways thanks again for watching and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
