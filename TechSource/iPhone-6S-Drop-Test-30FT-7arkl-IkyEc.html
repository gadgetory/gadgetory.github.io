and in this video we're gonna be
dropping the iPhone 6s from waist height
ear height and then lastly from up top
at 30 feet so that ways to get more time
let's start off by dropping it from the
most common area the waist so no actual
damages from that drop the front of the
screen is at 100% and the phone works
perfectly the back received minimal
damage those scratch marks by the way
were from the realistic scratch test
video that we did on the iPhone and I'll
leave a link to that down below if you
guys want to check that out but the only
two areas that the iPhone 6s got messed
up is the crack on the glass covering
the camera and a little scuff mark near
the bottom right moving on to the ear
height drop test this is the second most
common area that phones get dropped from
all right so after that drop the frame
did get bent in a little bit near the
top along with some of the scuff marks
other than that the rest of the foam
remains unharmed
lastly let's take a look and see what
happens when the iPhone is dropped from
30 feet facing downwards to 1 oh my god
oh my god
always
yeah things done for sure hasn't always
Oh
see if the screen works
here's the thumbnail one see that yeah
all right so it's safe to assume that
the iPhone 6s is pretty much destroyed I
mean what phone wouldn't be after being
dropped from 30 feet the entire glass
has shattered to a point where a bunch
of pieces flew off and you can see
behind the glass it does appear that the
phone still works because when I hit the
home button part of the display lights
up showing some signs of life but since
the screen is completely annihilated
there's really no way to use it anyways
that's basically it for the video not
sure what you really learn from this
other than don't be stupid and drop your
phone from 30 feet but other than that
the iPhone 6s is a rock-solid smart
phone and even dropping it from waist
height or ear height it will still live
regardless you should probably protect
your investment and get a case or even
skins anyways thanks again for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
