tech stores so in this vlog I'm actually
gonna do something a little different
I'm gonna give you guys a quick home
tour I haven't actually done an update
since I moved in so figured now is the
perfect time
alright so walking in you are greeted by
the living room and as you can see
already there are a few updates I've
already done but it's going to look to
the left side will quick I've picked up
this wall shelf for my Kia and kind of
mounted it above the shoe stand and it's
really convenient way of accessing like
the keys or sunglasses on your way out
so yeah really happy with this shelf yes
there are new chairs so this is the IKEA
TV stand I picked up in black I think
it's available in white and gold as well
but it blends in really nicely with the
55 inch 4k Smart TV from Samsung and
also the soundbar from go group which
really makes this room into like a
theater really happy with that by the
way I actually did a video on it you
guys can check that out and everything I
mentioned in this video will be linked
down below a few things I have on the
side are my surveillance camera this is
the guardzilla which I can monitor my
home from it has a motion detection
night vision and also as a speaker and
microphone which I can communicate with
the awesome device there and this is my
Amazon echo named Alexa and actually a
lot of you guys have been asking me on
how I control my lights to do this Alexa
turn off living room lights
okay Alexa turn on living room lights
okay all right so the way I hooked that
up is really simple actually what I did
was I picked up a Belkin Wemo switch
which is a smart switch you can control
with your smartphone or you can connect
it to Amazon echo and you can control
whatever it plugs in here you can
basically turn it off by clicking on
this button or by using your app but
what I did was I hooked it up to Amazon
echo because they are both compatible
and I use Amazon echo to control that
Wemo switch so yeah and the lights are
connected to that power strip in there
and that power strip is hooked up to the
Wemo switch so if that windmill switch
turns off so do the lights and once
again like I said I'll link everything
down below alright so moving towards the
dining room area is where I put my poker
table you can apply down real quick and
this is the executive poker table that
you guys have seen from my office tour
we kind of play Texas Holdem on the
weekends nothing really interesting $20
buy ends nothing crazy just a really
nice way to let loose gather bottled
beer and just relax okay so the to the
left of that there's the kitchen area
which has two insurances not sure why
and I'm gonna leave for you guys by
going over the kitchen stuff but there's
the dining room area washer and dryer is
in there we I do love my boos so you got
some bottled kettle one margarita mixes
then we got some live shot glasses up
top and then you got the wine glasses on
the bottom with some storage for wine
which as you can see it's gonna be
depleted anyways enough about this
nonsense let's go ahead and go upstairs
where all the good stuff is um this is
like our bathroom you guys already seen
this nothing really has change it's just
like a half bath for guests that we use
going upstairs
is the bedroom area this is where the
magic happens
so I picked up that IKEA lamp in the
corner there and I replace the bulb with
a lifx smart bulb which I can control
using my smartphone which is actually
pretty sweet if you ask me you can use
the wheel here to change the color you
can also adjust the intensity by moving
this wheel up and down
or you just turn it off if you want it
off of course let's say if you don't
want any colors you can go to the whites
and you get adjust the temperature of
the whites which is actually really
sweet
normally I keep it around 25% to set the
mood you know what I'm saying well yeah
I guess extremely bright in here as you
can see I have it set to 7500 K at 100%
and has really lights up the entire room
so to the left of our bed is Brian's
bathroom I don't dare go inside here
this is her territory and then we got
the IKEA dresser which I've been
struggling on fixing if you guys have
been watching her vlogs recently last
but not least this is our queen bed and
the reason why I'm showing you the bed
is because I think that comfort is
extremely important in everyone's life
so these guys from Casper mattress
actually reached out to me and asked me
they can send me a mattress for review
and what better timing because honestly
I was in need of a mattress
I had my previous mattress for like five
or six years now and I've been tossing
and turning these past few months that I
think was just time for me to upgrade
this mattress is super comfy guys like
as soon as I slept on it for one day I
definitely knew that I was going to
replace my old mattress so basically
what makes the mattress so comfortable
is that it's made out of two materials
we got the memory foam which provides
contouring support to your body and then
you have the latex foam which keeps you
cool and adds a healthy balance the best
part about the shopping experience is as
you guys can try it out for a hundred
nights for free with no hassle returns
if you're not happy with it oh by the
way these mattresses are super
affordable because they actually sell
directly to the consumers honestly if
you guys have trouble sleeping at night
or looking to upgrade your mattress
definitely check these guys out you do
get 100 nights for free so you don't
have to worry about it if you don't end
up keeping it but if you do decide to
fall in love with a mattress like I did
and
sigh to pick one up you guys can use the
code sleep 2 to get $50 off of your
first mattress I'm going to leave a link
to their website down below so make sure
you guys click on it and also the coupon
code down below well yeah that's
basically my room so enough about that
let's go ahead and move on to the good
stuff not gonna show you my storage
because it's still the same nothing has
changed so yeah this is basically the
master bathroom which is the one I use
cuz biade has her own you got a walk-in
shower over here got a tub which I never
use two sinks which I only use one and
then this is the headquarters I will
wait till the white balance adjusts
there we go so this is the headquarters
a lot of things have been changed so
that is my setup you guys have seen this
many times this is where the magic well
the other magic happens
I'm currently walking the single Titan X
right now until I we do my entire PC
build oh I should say build an entire
new PC build hopefully later this month
or January Cultra wide on my flexmount
which I've shown you guys before on my
setup video really sweet thing I've
actually never told you this guy's but
the reason why I have my civil play
button on the top of my workstation is
because I always look to it for
motivation it kind of tells me that I've
accomplished something and that I'm in
the right path so every time I'm feeling
down or I just don't have the motivation
to continue I just look at that for a
few seconds or you can just stare at it
for a minute and I'm back at it yeah
when I get my gold play button which is
when I pass 1 million subscribers that's
definitely going to replace that and I'm
gonna have to redo the foams because
it's a much bigger plaque over to the
right I have my iPad air 2 custom
painted by color where also has a little
engraving down there for my channel
which is pretty sweet
moving over to the right side I have the
docking station for my smartphones which
honestly I've been slacking I haven't
been doing much smartphone content
mainly because just bores me honestly if
it
depresses me every time I look at a
smartphone it's just I've done so much
in a channel before but now I'm trying
to transition into PC gaming and just
other technology related reviews and
videos not so much smartphones but once
in a while you guys will see it pop up
Daniel I have done the famous
modification this slide Apple drawer got
the best power bank in the world this
thing charges my iPhone 200% from zero
like in an hour to two hours really fast
I actually feature this in a cool tech
video along with these awesome
rechargeable batteries these have 21
hundred million power each and they
actually last longer than actual
double-a batteries which is pretty sweet
and they do make a triple-a batteries as
well but every time they went out of
juice I hook it up to the charging Bay
and I juice it up but yeah my laptop on
there nothing really interesting here in
boxing night keep it nicely hid in there
small out of vacation to the wires as
you can see put it in a little a box
which kind of cleans up the power strip
which is pretty sweet got the filming
gear on that side I've already did a
video on that stuff so you guys can
check it out if you want got my filming
desk and then the alternate editing
station aka Bob station which she hasn't
really been doing much recently but as
you can see it's missing a PC right now
that's going to change soon so over on
the side is basically where my wireless
printer rests which is the canon pixma
MX 9 to 2 by far one of the best
wireless printers out of but my mom's
printer actually broke down and I gave
her mine and then I went into bought
another one for myself because not only
do you save a lot of money on the ink
cartridges but it also prints out really
nice image quality on the side is my
filming gear usually I keep my lenses my
recorders and then below that in this
little suitcase and in here is basically
some battery packs I have you want as
controller for my slider and a bunch of
other stuff that I use from time to time
oh yeah I think that's basically it for
the home tours for a long time I'm gonna
go back to the usual vlogs after this so
thank you guys again so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
