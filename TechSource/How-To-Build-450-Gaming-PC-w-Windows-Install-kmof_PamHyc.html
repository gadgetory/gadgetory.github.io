Texas and welcome to the build guide of
Vaporeon the 450 dollar gaming PC for
December if you missed out on what this
baby can do make sure to check out the
gaming and benchmarks video by clicking
on the card on the top right so all you
need for this build is a screwdriver and
of course the parts itself I've linked
everything I use down below and I even
included some optional parts that are
compatible with the build like a CPU
cooler and SSD and even alternate
options on graphics cards in case you
guys have a little more or a little less
to spend so step one is to lay your PC
case down and unwrap the cables and
remove the box of screws attached to the
drive bay take out your motherboard and
slide open the lever then take your CPU
with the pins facing downwards and match
the triangle on the socket to the gold
triangle on your CPU once you have
figured out which direction is correct
gently place the CPU down while not
applying any force and make sure not to
touch the surface of the CPU if you do
you will need to wipe off your
fingerprint you seventy-five percent or
greater isopropyl and a tissue or
lint-free cloth like a coffee filter if
you don't have any you can use tissue or
toilet paper just make sure to blow off
the remaining length off of the CPU if
there are any if the CPU doesn't rest in
place you may need to wiggle it around a
little bit for it to fall in place but
after that go ahead and lower the lever
and lock it in place next step is to
install the RAM sticks go ahead and
release the locks off of each slot that
you're installing there is one on each
side if you're installing four sticks
then put one in each slot now if you're
going dual channel aka you have two RAM
sticks then install them in the gray
slots that you see in the video make
sure to align the notches on the RAM
sticks with the notches on the RAM slots
gently lower the RAM sticks evenly and
apply pressure on both sides at the same
time in order to snap it in place repeat
the same process for all the RAM sticks
if you installed it correctly the locks
should be fully seated inside of the RAM
now it's time for the CPU cooler
depending on what color you are
installing make sure to follow the
instructions listed on the manual if
you're installing the stock cooler like
in the video then follow these steps
first position the cooler and the
orientation you want what I usually do
is I make sure to have the least cable
slack as possible for a cleaner wiring
job so since the CPU fan header is right
next to the cooler I don't need that
much cable slack so I basically wrapped
it around the cooler so that only a few
inches of cable slack is visible and
this is the orientation I'm going to
install the fan you will need to align
the hooks from the motherboard to the
brackets on the cooler don't worry about
applying thermal paste since it already
comes pre applied with some so once you
figure out your orientation of the
cooler slowly lowered it until it comes
in contact with the CPU try not to move
the cooler as you hook up both sides
starting from the side that doesn't have
the lever rotate the motherboard to the
other side and do the exact same but
afterwards make sure to lock it in place
using the black lever it should snap in
place if you do it correctly lastly
connect the cooler to the motherboard
CPU fan header which should be colored
white you are not ready to install the
i/o shield and the standoffs in the case
make sure the shield has the three
circle cutouts on the bottom and snap it
in place on the back of your PC make
sure all four sides of the shield sits
flush against your PC now let's install
the standoffs
you will need eight of these screws that
came with the case and you need to
install them in these exact locations
once they are nicely tightened go ahead
and gently lower the motherboard in
while avoiding bumping into the case and
trying to match the cutouts of the i/o
shield with the motherboard ports you
will then need eight of these black
screws and you can begin screwing in the
motherboard as always I recommend a
crisscross pattern while tightening the
screws and please don't over tighten
them only get them to a point where it's
comfortable as in use a screwdriver with
your fingers and not your entire hand if
that makes any sense you don't want to
apply too much pressure on the
motherboard which can damage it next up
it's time to install the power supply
lay down your case and insert the power
supply with a fan facing downwards on
the top cutout of your case you will
need four of these to screw in your
power supply you can use your other hand
to push the PSU against the case in
order to align the holes if you want to
next up we are going to install the hard
drive so go ahead and grab the black
SATA cable that came with the
motherboard and hook up one end to the
back of the hard drive and also grab one
SATA power cable from the power supply
unit that looks like this and then
connected to the other hard drive slot
once you do that position the cables to
the right side of the case and make sure
that the screw holes of the hard drive
are facing towards you align the holes
and then grab four of these long screws
which are needed to secure the hard
drive against the rack all right next up
grab the other end of the SATA cable
that's hooked up to your hard drive and
locate the SATA port on the motherboard
which should be all the way on the
bottom right it doesn't matter which
point you connect it to as long as it's
from one of the four up top if you have
an SSD instead the process is exactly
the same however this time you will have
to use the smaller holes and a smaller
round headed screws for some reason I
was blind and then I realized the other
two holes on the bottom so if you're
installing it make sure all four holes
of the SSD align properly in my case I
should have lowered the SSD a little bit
the process of connecting the cables is
exactly the same for the SSD as well
next up we are connecting the cables
that came hooked up with the PC case
first up is the USB 3.0 so grab the
cable with the blue tip and connect it
to the slot on the motherboard that says
USB 30 as in USB 3.0 make sure you hear
it snap in place next up is the HD audio
you won't be needing the AC 97 so you
can go ahead and disregard that the
label for this one is called F audio for
front panel audio and you can find that
all the way on the bottom left of the
motherboard next cable is the USB and
you can connect this one to either one
of the two USB ports near the bottom
next up are the small set of cables
we're going to start off with the HDD
led but remember that the triangle
symbol means positive flip it face down
so that the words HDD led are facing
down and plug it in the bottom left slot
as indicated on the motherboard next up
is the power LED positive and negative
cables these go on the top the positive
one goes in first and then the negative
one right next to it next up is the
reset switch however for this one you
have to face the white letters up and
plug it in next to the HDD LED on the
bottom last but not least we have the
power switch and this one goes right
above the reset switch but with the
white letters facing down like this now
that we got the nightmare over with it's
time to hook up the 24 pin power cable
to the right side of the motherboard
this one is one of the hardest cables to
connect because you will need to apply a
loss of force in order for it to click
in place spin the PC case to the back
I can make sure that the clip is fully
hooked over and that there are no gaps
between the cable and the socket the
last cable we need to hook up to the
motherboard are both of the CPU 4 pin
connectors this one connects to the
socket on the top left of the
motherboard again make sure to apply a
good amount of force to snap these in
place it's important that these are
fully connected so now we are ready to
install the graphics card so go ahead
and remove the top two white PCIe
brackets near the back and carefully
slide in the GPU in the case once the
GPU is inside the case go ahead and snap
it in place make sure to install it on
the very first PCI slot for optimal
performance lastly we need to hook up
both of the PCI cables to power up the
GPU make sure that the words PCI are
facing up and just connect them one by
one to the GPU that's it you are done
with part one take this time to make
sure all the cables are connected and
that there are no loose connections or
cables hanging around also if you're
adding extra fans make sure to connect
the fan cable to any fan header on the
motherboard now we're going to install a
fresh copy of Windows 8.1 and you guys
can upgrade to Windows 10 for free later
on so don't worry about that for now if
you want to use your current hard drive
or SSD then you don't need this step
just plug it in like we did before in
the video and you are good to go for
everyone else here's what you need to do
grab a flash drive with at least 16
gigabytes of space and plug it in to
your computer then you need to download
the installation media from the
Microsoft site I did leave a link down
below for you guys once you are here
click on create media and it will begin
downloading once it completes the
download open up the folder and run the
program pick your language the Edition
and architecture everything should match
with mine unless you have a different
language click Next and choose your USB
Drive click on Next to move on a prompt
should appear stating that the files
will be deleted make sure you don't have
anything important in them before you
continue click on OK to proceed this
should take some time to download
depending on the speed but once it's
complete it will automatically install
the operating system to the USB Drive
this can take anywhere from 15 minutes
to an hour so please be patient once
it's complete you will get this message
saying that your USB Drive is ready you
guys will need a Windows 8.1 CD key to
continue you can get one on your own
or you can get it for much cheaper using
the reddit CD key swapper and I'll drop
a link in the description
section four the thread why not they go
anywhere from 25 to 40 dollars which is
dirt cheap but wherever you guys pick it
up from make sure to buy the 8.1 pro
edition and not be standards and faster
version we installed on the flash drive
once you have a CD key we are ready to
install windows on the PC so go ahead
and insert the USB Drive in the front of
the PC and boot it up it will detect the
USB Drive and it will take you straight
to the setup screen now if it doesn't
then that means the PC did not detect
your flash drive so go ahead and hit
control-alt-delete to restart your PC
and hit the Delete key continuously
until you get to the BIOS screen
navigate to the BIOS features tab up top
and then go down and click on drive
priorities next go ahead and click on
either one of the boot options and if
you don't see USB flash drive listed on
here and that means you didn't connect
something the right way
make sure both of the USB cables are
hooked up to the right parts on the
motherboard in the meantime you can use
another USB port on your PC preferably
any one of them in the back once you
swap the USB ports exit out of BIOS by
restarting the PC and it will take you
to the installation part of Windows and
then it will ask you to enter the CD key
so go ahead and enter in the CD key that
you purchased here and then click Next
when you get to the screen click on
custom and then select which partition
you want to install windows on if you
have to otherwise leave it on default
and click on next let windows install
the files on to your PC and once it's
complete you will get this message
remove the flash drive and click on OK
to restart the PC once when those
finishes the installation process you
will reach the screen go ahead and
follow the prompt and finish filling out
your info once you reach the desktop
it's time to download the drivers now if
you're connecting your PC via ethernet
cable then you don't need a wireless
adapter if you want to connect your PC
via Wi-Fi then you need to purchase this
wireless adapter this will cost only 10
bucks and I'll go in and drop a link
down below for you just insert it in the
USB port and it will automatically give
your PC internet access via Wi-Fi once
you reach your desktop it's time to
install the drivers you will need to
visit gigabyte to download them so
you'll need to download the realtek
audio AMD chipset and real Tech LAN I
left a link in the description section
so it's easier for you guys to find it
after you download and install those
it's time to install the graphics card
drivers again I left a link to the
website just go there and download the
Radeon software once you have downloaded
the files and install them on you
you are complete congratulations you
have a fully functional gaming and
productivity PC if you guys enjoyed this
video or if it was very helpful please
