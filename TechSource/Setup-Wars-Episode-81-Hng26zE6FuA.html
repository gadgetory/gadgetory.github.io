hopefully a productive week

sure to watch the video linked down
below let the setup wars and begin
if you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2a
comm because they have the cheapest CD
keys available for pretty much any game
I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out as always you
guys can find the gear for every one set
ups link down below along with anything
I recommend in this episode so your five
contestants for this week are and Ray
angel have your heavier Xavier John Luke
and John I think that's how you say John
Locke or June luck congratulations for
making it on the show turning off the
episode we have Andre with a very
refreshing setup it kind of feels like
I'm gonna forest somewhere with all of
these plants and bamboo sticks in the
background I'm definitely feeling this
relaxed vibe just by looking at this I
can only imagine what it feels like
actually using this setup every single
day add some tropical rain sound effect
on those speakers and this will be an
awesome productivity setup
so yeah enough of being sidetracked
let's get back into the actual setup so
Andre is using a 29 inch LG ultrawide
monitor which he overclocked to 75 Hertz
and he's also using the func
KB 460 keyboard with cherry MX Reds
right next to the logitech g502 RGB
spectrum mouse and we also have a
drawing pad right above that if I were
to add a TV in my setup this is exactly
the way I would have it set up about 10
feet away from the actual desk most
people have their desks against the wall
and the TV right above it which I don't
understand completely I mean what if
you're on the computer and want to watch
something on the TV at the same time you
have to constantly look up and down if
that were the case but Andres situation
all he has to do is tilt his eyes
slightly above to see what's on the TV
desk setups don't have to be right
against a wall especially if he wants to
mount a TV andre setup is a prime
example of that even the cable
management isn't affected by not having
a desk against the wall he hooked up a
power strip and a few cable racks to
keep all the wires off the ground and
routed the rest of the cables down the
legs
excellent work he does have a pair of
super luxe HDS hanging from one side of
the desk and on the ground is the pc
which has a 4790k and an RX 470 overall
a well-put-together setup Thank You
Andre for entering at first I thought
this next setup had 4 displays but it
turns out it's only a triple monitor
setup with a poster on the wall
surrounded by a bunch of acoustic foams
ok we get you're a big fan of Joker
we got the Joker wallpaper figurines and
even some posters come to think of it it
actually has a black and purple theme as
well so he's rockin 3/8 or 24 inch
gaming monitors at 144 Hertz were fresh
weight each and on the table we have the
Corsair k70 RGB keyboard and coarser m65
mouse which by the way he drilled a hole
for cable management nice work also on a
desk we have a pair of clip speakers and
a ps4 console by the way did you know
that the brands has a purple skin on
their website you should definitely pick
some up for your console you also got
skins for head phones laptops
smartphones and a bunch of other devices
so if you guys want to spice up your
setup make sure to check them out I'll
drop a link to it down below for audio
he is using a blue snowball ice
microphone
a pair of status audio monitoring
headphones that are hanging from a
cooler master 212 Evo CPU cooler hey if
it works it works right cable management
seems to be under control it looks like
the IKEA Signum is holding up majority
of the cables and he's also added some
LEDs on a desk to give it that under
glow effect the PC that's powering the
setup has a 4790k and an EVGA GTX 1070
paired with a gtx 980 and it looks like
an anode see stated that he will be
upgrading to a second gtx 1070 very soon
a very nice joker themed setup Thank You
Angela for entering a number three we
have Xavier with a beautiful laptop
powered triple monitor setup on a custom
made desk
he has a 34 inch curved ultrawide
monitor from Dell in the middle and two
27-inch monitors on the sides which are
mounted on the desk I guess he did that
to align all three of the displays
together
nice job I'm still shocked that a single
laptop can power three monitors that's
pretty impressive he's also using
wireless peripherals the Microsoft
designer keyboard and Logitech MX master
Mouse Xavier did such a good job keeping
everything symmetrical as well so I have
to give props on that for audio he is
rocking a pair of Logitech Z 333
speakers a shure sm58 microphone and the
popular m 40 X's resting on the
silverstone headphone stand which by the
way is the one I'm using for my setup as
well cable management is pretty much
flawless he's got some 3m tape cable
clips raceways and even velcro straps
holding everything together I mean if it
weren't for that power outlet being
visible this setup would be practically
wireless oh so it looks like he does
have an actual PC it appears to be a
prebuilt CyberPower PC down here which
actually makes more sense now and Uwe
laptop coated power 3 monitors that's
absurd ko Management isn't the only
thing that's nice and tidy his entire
room is all the drawers are organized
and I'm really loving those blue lounge
cable organizers that you are using
I might just pick some up for myself
also drop links down below in case you
guys want to check them out but
definitely one of the cleanest setups
I've seen in a while
Thank You Xavier for entering speaking
of white and black setups here's another
one Jean is rocking a 32 inch Philips
monitor a row cap is ku keyboard and a
tie a mouse on top of the glourious
extended mousepad props on staying
consistent
the entire thing away you have a black
and blue headset never mind
speaking of audio he also has a Dell
surround sound speaker system which
honestly kind of defeats the purpose of
placing them in front of you I mean they
are supposed to surround you so maybe
put two of them behind you somehow cable
management is clean everything is tied
together neatly and mounted under the
desk job well done I have no complaints
here even its PC case is white it has a
4790k and a gtx 980ti honestly if the
one for your headset this would have
been a flawless black-and-white setup
but you know what I might leave a few
headset options down below that will go
really well with your setup so make sure
to check it out Thank You Jean for
entering last but not least we have John
and an insane quad displace setup a 27
inch Acer predator in between - 27 inch
Acer monitors and a massive 40 K 4k TV
from Samsung on the desk key as the
Razer chroma Black Widow keyboard and a
razer epic Naga Mouse on top of the
Razer Firefly mousepad for audio he has
a pair of bose companion 2 speakers and
a HyperX cloud 2 headset that's pretty
much it for the surface of the desk and
there's not much going down under the
desk as well the back board of the desk
is blocking out the cables so I can't
really give you any feedback the
computer on the other hand got Daniel
this thing is a beast it's rocking a
5820k in to msi gtx 1080s and sli other
than picking up a hangar for your
headset this is a pretty straightforward
overkill setup excellent job staying
consistent with the color scheme and
thank you John for entering so that is a
fist episode of setup for us as always

the best test setup as always I'll
