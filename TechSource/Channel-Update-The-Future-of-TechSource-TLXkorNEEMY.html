it's been a while since I've done any
video where I can just sit in front of
the camera and talk about what's on my
mind without any scripting or editing
and stuff like that so it's a nice
change
first and foremost though I just want to
say I'm closing in on almost six hundred
thousand which is which is crazy I mean
I'm so excited I'm so happy I am so
grateful to be in this in this position
right now you guys are awesome thank you
so much for your support your feedback
your comments your likes your dislikes
sharing my videos and all that really
you really make tech source what it is
today and I can't do any of this without
you guys so thank you so much for that
really like I won't just give you guys
an update on text source what's going on
and what you guys can expect in a few
months even years and that's about setup
Wars and the other content on my channel
so I've been reading your tweets and
your comments and your emails and you
guys are bringing because I concern that
there are a few individuals out there
that are kind of copying my content set
up words specifically and they're
basically doing what I'm doing and I
just want you guys to know I'm well
aware of that thank you but you guys
don't have to worry about that I'm not
too worried about that I mean they can
copy the format's they can do basically
whatever I'm doing the same style if
they want to and
you know I'm okay with that because
there's one thing they can't replicate
you know they can't replicate the host
they can't replicate the personality of
the channel or the personality of the
video and I feel like that's the beauty
of YouTube is that anyone can do
whatever they want so and everyone has
their own unique twist to it you know
their own personality if you will so
that's why I'm not really bothered with
all of these I just copycats if you will
so you know it's I look at it as
inspiration I don't look at it as you
know being copied from so if you guys
are sending me comments and stuff like
that
you don't have to do it anymore I'm well
about what's going on and I'm completely
fine with that
so but thank you again for bringing that
to my attention you guys are awesome I
also want to talk about the future of
setup wars because as you know that is
the main reason why tech source is what
it is today I think I've gained over
200,000 subscribers just from my set up
or series I was looking at the analytics
a few days ago which is crazy that's
like 1/3 almost 1/3 of my subscribers
and that's crazy because of you guys
setup Wars is becoming or probably is
one of the most popular tech shows on
YouTube and that's just that's crazy to
even say you know I came so far from the
first episode but I was watching a first
episode like a few weeks ago and I was
like it's so crap like who subscribes to
this and who liked the video if you guys
have a chance go check it out it's it's
horrible it's like the worst episode
ever anyways I've grown so much from
that and I've learned so much and I feel
like I've evolved from the very first
episode
if the episodes almost 50 episodes later
it's crazy and I feel like I've
progressed with the channel so I was
pretty cool so I kinda wanna talk about
the future of setup wars right now I
have three additions in case you guys
are not familiar with it youtuber
edition you got the regular setup Wars
that I do every Monday and then you got
the worst setup
addition which is every 10 episodes I'm
gonna be adding two more additions and
the reason why I'm doing this is so I
can have the show more balanced
I've been putting high-end setups with
regular budget setups and it just
doesn't make any sense the high-end
setups always in the winning because
they are like 50 monitors and like a
$50,000 PC and just it's just not fair
so I'm gonna be doing a budget edition
of setup Wars and also a Ultimate
Edition of setup ORS that way I can
separate the submissions more I think
it'll be way more fair that way
so yeah you basically have one episode
that are high in setups and one episode
that I've budget setups and I feel like
that just makes more sense and it's more
fair
so yeah look out for that in the next
few weeks maybe in a few months
definitely be adding that to the setup
Wars collection if you will you know
guys I always try and make each episode
as fun as possible I try to make it
entertaining and I always try and add
like this twist to it so I kind of what
makes people want to come and watch
setup or is it I've been waiting you
guys comments and tweets about saying
that set up Wars is like the best thing
on Monday for you guys and you can't
wait to go home from school to watch it
or what's the highlight of your day and
that really makes me happy to read and
that's I really appreciate that guys I'm
glad that you're enjoying the series I
will try and always improve it every
time of course and spend more time with
it but overall I'm really happy with the
way it's going I'm really excited for
the next 50 episodes and held even the
next few years
I don't even though there's no telling
where set of boards is going but it's
going up and it's going really fast
because of you guys so thank you so much
for the feedback you leave me for the
comments the likes and dislikes all that
thing you guys so much for that and
finally I just want to give you guys an
update on the future of tech source if
you guys have been following me on
social media you guys would know that
tech source is officially incorporated
since February of this year so I think
like three months ago
and Texas is officially a corporation I
am the CEO I am the president of Texas
official which is the name of the
companies and someone to go to Texas or
someone to Texas for some reason so at
the name a tech source official but the
channels name is still gonna be Texas
that has nothing to do with it
but any who's have been a one-man team
I've been doing videos for myself I've
been editing recording all that nonsense
by myself 99% of the work is meat is
done by me and that's a lot of work
especially putting out a video a day
it's a lot of work it really is a lot of
work so as you guys can tell I basically
have no life YouTube is my life so
that's gonna change that's gonna change
2017 early 2017 I've announced this on
Twitter I'm gonna be hiring one maybe
two people persons people I'm gonna be
hiring two humans to help me out with
the channel early 2017 even February
March
whatever January maybe even and I want
to hire through YouTube because I know
that whoever's watching my videos know
my style of videos know the content I
produce and they are into tech which is
three things I'm looking for more info
for that and requirements and you know
experience all that will be covered
later this year so maybe like in
December I'll be talking about a job
opening for tech stores because I'm
looking to hire to help push out videos
the future of this company of this
channel I eventually want to upload one
to two videos a day that's my goal and I
can't do it by myself so that's kind of
what I'm aiming for
but anyways think I so much for watching
Susie thank you for your support I can't
believe I made him 600,000 subscribers I
just this progress is bollocks it's
mental we're get out my British accent
it's phenomenal thank you guys so much
for your support I love you you guys are
the best
I can't say that enough and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
