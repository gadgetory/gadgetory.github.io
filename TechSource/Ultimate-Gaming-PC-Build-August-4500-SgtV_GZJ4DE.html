never pay full price for a game ever
again
g2 a offers the best prices for any game
out there for practically any platform
click on the link below to see for
yourself what's happening guys it's that
back again from tech source and welcome
to the august pc build this is XE on the
4500 ultimate gaming pc this is part 1
of 2 where i go through the parts i
selected and the reasoning behind them
and then part 2 will be the gaming
benchmarks and performance tests by the
way all the parts I mentioned in this
video will be linked down below in the
description section both that said let's
go ahead and check out the specs so I
went with an Intel i7 5820k processor
and msi x99s gaming 9 motherboard 3 gtx
980ti s 16 gigabytes Rd scale Ripjaws
ddr4 memory and a X 1200 eye power
supply with 2 512 gigabyte SSDs which
will be set up in raid 0 and lastly a
Lipa aqua changer 120 CPU cooler some
other miscellaneous items I picked up
our static and airflow fans from Corsair
some red threaded SATA cables and
magnetic LED strips from BitFenix and a
custom threaded cable set from the guys
at performance pcs all of these awesome
parts will be packed inside the
Magnificent Colossus case from BitFenix
as soon as I laid my eyes on it I knew
that this was the case for my build its
an ATX full tower chassis that features
two USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports along with
a built-in fan and led controllers one
of the main reasons why I chose this
case was because of the BitFenix s3 it
is a storage compartment and a security
system in one place I now have a
dedicated place for my external hard
drive but it can also store your phone
or other valuable items as well and you
can lock it up with the included key
there's even a dedicated place to route
the cables through which really cleans
up the entire case and since you can
lock the top compartment you can
practically lock down your keyboard
mouse and USB drives and no one can take
them without the key no USB ports or
buttons sticking out of the case
combined with the awesome LEDs makes
this case an obvious choice for me in
fact this is the case I'm going to be
using for my ultimate water
bill that's going to be happening early
2016 for the motherboard I decided to
take a break from Asus and go with an
MSI gaming 9 X 99 board if it isn't
obvious by now I decided to stick with
my trademark colors the popular red and
black theme which I'm sure most of you
guys are already sick of seeing on my
channel
the x99s model supports 8 RAM slots of
128 gigabytes of ddr4 memory up to
speeds of 3333 megahertz on a quad
Channel it also supports Intel i7
processors and features 5 PCI 3.0 slots
that can support up to four-way SLI and
also features 10 SATA ports and a single
M docks to port it also has a total of
10 USB ports now some of the awesome
features on the gaming 9 board that
makes it an awesome choice for gaming
are as follows killer doubleshot pro
that ensures you won't get kicked from
an online game because of high peeing
streaming engine which enables you to
capture high frame rate video in real
time gaming without sacrificing your CPU
or GPU performance
it also features Sound Blaster cinema 2
you can clearly hear specific sounds and
gaming environments which means that you
can hear the enemies perfectly you also
get amazing surround sound just by using
stereo headphones or speakers turbo m2
is also another feature and you get
speeds up to 32 gigabytes per second
through PCI Express for the latest
generation SSDs and lastly my two
favorite features OC Genie 4 that will
give your PC an adrenaline shot
delivering up to 20 percent performance
and the gaming app that will give you
control on overclocking your CPU and GPU
all with a touch of a button those are
just some of the awesome features that
the MSI gaming 9 motherboard comes with
and the fact that it's in black and red
made this a simple choice for me for the
CPU I went with the 5820k and I'm sure a
lot of you guys might be asking why I
didn't go with the 59 30 K for a few
hundred bucks more or even the 59 60 X
or about three times the price the
simple and short answer is price per
performance since most games don't even
support over six cores it would have
been a waste going with the eight core
59 60 X now I know that the 59 30 K has
40 lanes which will give me a 16 16 8
configuration with a 3-way SLI as
opposed to the 5820k S 16 8 and 4 but
the performance difference is very
marginal and it's not enough to justify
spending a few hundred more 40-59 30k
now if I was going for a Productivity
type setup and I wanted to connect two
or more 4k monitors than the 59 30 K
would have been the ideal selection but
since this is strictly a gaming PC the
5820 made more sense instead of going
with a single GPU or the common 2-way
SLI I decided to try something new and
go with three geforce gtx 980ti s from
msi as well to keep the black and red
theme consistent the msi Edition on ATT
I has a core clock of 1,000 megahertz 60
gigabytes of gddr5 memory with a 384-bit
interface and uses 250 watts of power
for each card it also has a single HDMI
port three display ports and a single
DVI it also features twin frozer which
generates 19 percent more airflow
without increasing drag for supreme
silent performance in some cases
eliminates the fan noise completely by
stopping the fans when they are not
needed one of the reasons why it took me
so long to post this video is because
I've been waiting for Asus to send me
their enthusiast Edition as the library
which even till today I still haven't
received it it's actually still on
backorder yes Ally Bridge comes in two
three and even four way configurations
and it looks badass but I'll go ahead
and drop a link to that down below on
where you guys can get them for a great
price I should have it by the time the
PC is built and part two is uploaded
though since this is an X 99 build I had
to go with ddr4 Ram I went with the
fastest memory I can find for 3000
megahertz turns out g.skill was the
obvious choice which isn't surprising
since they do make some of the best RAM
sticks out there for gaming oh and they
look pretty badass too for cooling I
went with the Aleppo aqua changer 120
millimeter unfortunately the case
doesn't support 240 millimeter radiators
which is why I couldn't go with the
Corsair H 100 I GTX so the next best
option was the aqua changer with speeds
between 500 and 2,300 rpm and super
quiet fan speeds this will provide
enough cooling for when I overclock the
CPU for storage I went with to 512
gigabytes Samsung 850 Pro SSDs that I
will be hooking up together with raid
zero for super fast boot up and loading
times to power up all these bad boys I
went with the cursor ax 1200 I
supply it's a fully modular PSU and it
packs enough power for 3-way SLI and
more allowing the bill to be practically
huger proof I did purchase some
additional accessories that will
definitely make the PC stand out a bit
more instead of going with the standard
pin connector cables from Corsair I
decided to pick up some awesome custom
threaded cables from cable mod by the
way huge thanks to performance pcs for
sending this out to me and I'll go and
leave a link to the website if you guys
want to pick some awesome cables up for
your PC and they also have a bunch of
other PC parts for modding as well
so definitely check them out I also
picked up some magnetic white LED strips
from BitFenix which will definitely make
the components inside stand out also
from BitFenix are two of these threaded
red SATA cables to go with my SSDs
additionally I picked up some pretty
sweet gaming gear that will go really
well with the PC a corsair k70 RGB
keyboard along with the m60 RGB gaming
mouse I also picked up the Sennheiser
Game one headset some additional gear
include a pretty sweet headphone hangar
and a sick extended gaming mat from xqo
without a doubt this is going to be
pretty sweet setup once it's completed
and big red will officially be no more
if you guys are excited to see part 2
let me know by hitting that like button
so that's all the parts I'm going to be
using for the build
once again I'll be leaving links down
below for anyone that's interested I
actually picked most of the parts up
from BH photo and believe it or not they
actually do sell PC parts and they have
really great deals on them so if you
guys are building your next PC
definitely check their website before
you go anywhere else because chances are
you'll find them a lot cheaper there
anyways that's it for the video thank
you guys for watching let me know what
you guys think about the parts by
leaving a comment down below and as
always if you guys want me to continue
doing these PC builds every month let me
know by leaving a like on the video and
