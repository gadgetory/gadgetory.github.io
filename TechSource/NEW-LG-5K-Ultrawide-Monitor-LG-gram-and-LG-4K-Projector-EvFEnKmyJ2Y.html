possible by deep cool and MSI right now
there's an awesome giveaway on the new
msi optics curved gaming monitor and all
you have to do to enter is drop a like
and leave a comment down below on what
you enjoyed about today's video you can
increase your chances of winning by
leaving a like and comment on every
single CES video throughout this week on
tech source every year I look forward to
checking out the LG booth at CES because
they continue to innovate and release
new and exciting products well this year
was no different they have an entirely
new monitor lineup that I'm excited to
talk about as well as a new 4k projector
which we will take a look at later in
this video so on the productivity side
we have several monitors I got announced
the most exciting and personally my
favorite is their new 5k ultrawide
monitor it sports their new nano IPS
display which provides excellent viewing
angles and vibrant colors combined with
the insane
50 120 by 2160 resolution and you get
extremely crisp and beautiful images the
monitor also features dual five watt
speakers Thunderbolt 3 support and an
HDR pro DCI p3 98% color gamut which
basically is another way of measuring
the color accuracy to simplify it a bit
more you will get over 100% srgb so this
monitor is perfect for productivity and
color sensitive work LG has also
slightly changed the base design they
still stuck with the usual silver accent
colors but tweaked it a little bit also
it is basic compatible so it can be
mounted against a wall or a desk mount
if you guys remembered a member view of
the 34 UC 89 G gaming monitor from LG I
wasn't quite happy with aspects and I
specifically asked for a higher
resolution and gsync well I'm happy to
say that LG has listened to us all and
gave us just that the 34 GK 950 G is a
34 inch ultra wide curved gaming monitor
with a 34 40 by 1440 P display with
g-sync
and 820 Hertz for a fresh wait who wants
overclocked you get the same DCI p3 98%
white color gamut and the nano IPS
display just like the 5k ultra wide
another cool feature of the ultra wide
gaming monitor is LG's new sphere
lighting which is basically a ring of
RGB lights on
back of the monitor which you guys can
change within their menu I think this is
very cool because if you have the
monitor against the wall it will give
off a nice glow effect so it's basically
meant to replace RGB strips another
monitor they announced at CES was a
thirty one point five inch 4k monitor
with daisy chaining technology now this
is for the productivity side and it
basically has the same specs as the 5k
monitor with the addition of an extra
Thunderbolt three port that supports 4k
daisy-chaining you get the same wide
color gamut HDR pro over 100% srgb and
built-in dual five watt speakers there
are no prices for the monitors as of yet
they're expected to be available in
quarter two of this year however guests
can expect a full review of both of the
ultra wide monitors on the channel so
make sure you are subscribed LG has also
refreshed they're gram lineup for 2018
and a lot of you guys know that the gram
is my favorite laptop because it was
featured in 2017 favorite tech of the
year and I actually take it with me
everywhere I go in fact I took it with
me to see as 2018 so I was excited to
hear that they actually released new
models three different sizes and either
white or gray through that the 13.3 inch
which is the smallest form factor a 14
inch and their biggest 15.6 inch laptop
all weighing under a kilogram with the
exception of the 15.6 inch laptop
weighing just over that the new gram
laptops will come packed with a 72 watt
hour battery which charges completely in
three hours the 13 inch laptop also gets
you around 22 and a half hours of use
compared to the previous 13 inch laptop
that lasts only 18 hours the Graham
lineup will also ship with 8th gen
processors and ddr4 memory which LG is
claiming to be 40% and 50% faster
respectively for storage the Z 980 comes
with an SSD however it does have space
to add an additional SSD to expand the
storage space and LG is claiming that
this is the only place you'll find this
option available amongst other slim
laptops I personally hate when companies
would put the webcam near the bottom on
the actual hinge of the laptop because
the angle is very awkward and I get that
they do that to keep the bezels very
thin on a display but LG has actually
managed to move the webcam back to the
top while main
painting very thin bezels another new
feature on the Z 980 is the fingerprint
reader which is very welcomed you no
longer need to type in your password to
access windows and finally the last
feature is the Thunderbolt 3 support
which can not only be used to charge a
laptop or charge other devices but you
can also connect to 4k displays or a
single 5k display no current prices on
the Graham lineup however they are
expected to get launched in February
this year the last thing I want to talk
about is LG's new 4k projector
it supports HDR 10 and it can expand up
to 150 inches and let me tell you guys
it looks so much better in person and as
a 2500 lumen laser illumination system
which is expected to last up to 20,000
hours of use I think the cool part about
the projector is that the image quality
is so crisp and bright that even when
the lights turned on the quality didn't
get affected it also has bluetooth
built-in so you can use it to connect to
other Bluetooth devices such as speakers
it does come with a handle making it
easy to carry around and you can
actually lay it flat on its side or
mount it against your wall the fact that
it comes with an automatic retractable
cable makes it that much more convenient
when traveling or storing it away no
prices as of yet but it's expected to
launch sometime in March but that pretty
much does it for this video let me know
in the comments section which product
you guys are most excited about from the
LG booth and as always make sure you
subscribe for more CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
