message the other day asking if I can
pick up the Dell XPS 13 laptop and do a
video on it and I said sure why not
so I went to Best Buy and picked one up
I did spend a very good long weekend
with the laptop and I was actually
pretty impressed for the most part the
bezels are super thin on this and I did
some gaming on it
I shoot some music and most importantly
I got a lot of work done so this video
is basically my review and my one-week
experience with the Dell XPS 13 laptop I
hope you guys enjoy so this is the
non-touch Dell XPS 13 laptop the 13
representing the screen size a 13.3 inch
1080p matte display with super thin
bezels flat top starts at $8.99 for the
base model and Microsoft is actually
having a sale right now if you put in
the code PC grad 15 before you check out
you get 100 bucks off your total price
which is a killer deal right now so
there are a few versions available we
got the basic non touch Core i5 model
with 128 gigabytes of SSD space that
starts at 899 with two other options
with more RAM space and even a better
processor for 80 bucks more you can go
with the Signature Edition which
includes office 365 so the model I
picked up is the base non-touch Core i5
model clocked at 2.2 gigahertz with 4
gigabytes of RAM 128 gigabytes of
storage space and an Intel HD graphics
card as I said before the bezels are
super thin in fact the XPS 13 is the
world's smallest 13 inch laptop which
says a lot the full aluminum body
definitely contributes to its superlight
2.6 pound weight popping it open we are
greeted with a carbon fiber type
material for the armrest and a touch
sensitive trackpad like the MacBook I'm
not really a laptop user so it took me a
few minutes to get used to tapping
instead of pressing but I soon found
myself using nothing but the tap feature
to navigate around it's nice but it's
not 100% accurate there will be times
where it won't recognize me tapping the
trackpad but it's very rare and really
bother me at all what bothers me is
using the trackpad as a mouse it's not
as smooth or responsive as I would
expect from a well-built laptop now I'm
not sure if it's my particular model or
from the software but the trackpad just
doesn't register my finger gesture as
well sometimes it feels choppy and then
there are times where the gesture is
delayed and then there's the usual
I just scrolled why isn't it scrolling
situation
so yeah the trackpad could be definitely
improved maybe it's a lot more
responsive on the i7 model the keyboard
however is great the distance between
each key press is short and very
responsive with no lag whatsoever I have
pretty big hands so sometimes when I'm
typing on a laptop my palms would get in
the way of the trackpad and it would
interfere with my typing so I'm forced
to lift my palms up while I type on most
laptops however on the XPS 13 I can
easily rest them without it coming into
contact with the trackpad so definitely
a huge plus there the keys are nicely
spaced and very convenient to reach I do
wish that the backspace button was a bit
larger though since that is the only key
slightly out of reach which forces me to
reposition my hands while typing other
than that the keys are nicely lit at
night and very comfortable to type with
taking a look on the right side of the
laptop you can find a lock support USB
3.0 slot and a micro SD card reader on
the opposite side is where the charging
port is located followed by a mini
display port another USB 3 and your
headphone or microphone jack there's
also a tiny button on the side here when
pressed will indicate how much battery
is left in the laptop taking a look on
the bottom of the laptop is where the
fans are located along with two long
horizontal rubber feet which do a great
job preventing the laptop from moving if
you are typing on a solid flat surface
then there's this flap thing which has a
serial number and other very useless
information written on there not sure if
that's really necessary but I'm guessing
they wanted to cover it up to be more
aesthetically pleasing last but not
least we have the front-facing camera on
the lower left of the laptop so the dell
XPS 13 has a front facing camera that
can shoot in 720p it's located on the
bottom left of the laptop which is a
pretty weird location but I get why they
had to do that the laptop is actually
essentially bezel-less so there's no
other place to put the camera
if you can get used to that it's
actually pretty decent fun facing camera
the only thing I would suggest is to
refrain from typing as you're talking to
someone because that would be pretty
weird I don't know about you guys but
when it comes to Windows 8 laptop
I really prefer to have a touchscreen
feature it just makes it really easy to
navigate and it's one of the reasons why
I really like the surface 3 thankfully
there is Start eight which is basically
a Windows Start bar for Windows 8 I use
this on all my PCs I must have a Start
menu when I'm using Windows 8 otherwise
it drives me nuts for some reason the
logo glitched when I installed it on the
laptop but usually the Start Menu logo
is supposed to appear down here like the
usual I will leave a link to where you
can download it for yourself down below
personally when it comes to Windows
laptops I would opt for the touchscreen
version since I really do enjoy using
that instead of the trackpad but for the
rest of us that picked up a non touch
screen version the Start menu Edition
will definitely make your life a lot
easier alright so let's talk about the
display instead of a glossy display
which will bring you more vivid color
more contrast along with deeper blacks
you get an anti-glare coating which
helps prevent reflections this is
especially important if you're going to
use the laptop in bright areas or even
outside on the direct sunlight but I
gotta say for a matte display the colors
are very sharp and vibrant you also get
really great viewing angles so if you
and your buddy want to watch an episode
of Game of Thrones together there will
be no visual distortion text also look
sharp
there is no blur or Distortion even when
scaling fineness is also great on the
XPS 13 even at maximum brightness you
still get vivid colors and it doesn't
appear to be washed out at all in super
low light mode you can dim it all the
way down while still being able to see
everything clearly productivity wise I
think that 13 inches is the perfect
screen size as long as you are not
editing if you need a laptop for editing
I would say either 14 or better yet a
15-inch laptop so you can take advantage
of the extra screen real estate if you
need a laptop specifically for mobility
and watching videos with internet
browsing I would say anywhere between 10
to 12 inches with suffice for the rest
of us students in particular I would say
13 inches is the sweet spot the screen
is large but not large enough where it
becomes bulky and heavy
and it's compact enough to carry in your
backpack or bag throughout the entire
day since it has a mini display fold you
can hook it up to your larger monitor if
you need a bigger screen to work on
you can either duplicate your own screen
or extend it and use it like a second
monitor as long as you keep the
resolution at 1080p there won't be any
lag anything past that is a disaster all
right so now for performance the i-5 is
great for most things but lag is still
present
it's especially obvious and annoying
when scrolling through long webpages
that's basically where I notice it the
most when it comes to multitasking it
performs really well it plays videos up
to 2k resolution smoothly even with
multiple windows open in the background
I was actually impressed that it was
able to handle bioshock infinity at a
consistent 30fps
I mean sure the graphics were set too
low but still for a core i5 ultrabook
that is pretty damn good I don't see why
you can't play some of your favorite
games on the XPS 13 granted that you
lower the settings of course so after
playing for about 20 to 30 minutes the
fans kicked up to maximum and the laptop
got really warm it didn't get to a point
where it was hot but warm enough or I
could feel the heat emitting from the
keys I found myself constantly taking
breaks as the keys would get
uncomfortably warm for my finger tips I
played Bioshock infinity on 50%
brightness for about an hour and I
noticed that it drained 30% of battery
life so I would assume you would get
anywhere from 2 to 3 hours of battery
life if you were gonna game non-stop of
course that would depend on your power
plan and level of brightness this was
really the only time that the fans
kicked up 100% and they were pretty loud
gaming aside the laptop got me a solid
ten and a half hours of use so I
dedicated my entire day using the Dell
XPS 13 my morning started at 10:30 a.m.
with 100% charge and a laptop died on
834 p.m. same day the brightness was set
to 50% and it never turned off I use the
laptop for browsing the web writing the
script for this video streaming Spotify
in the background and I watched a total
of 30 minutes of video on YouTube I did
not do any gaming as that does drain the
battery life
a lot faster so I'm pleased to say that
the battery life is outstanding on the
XPS 13 if you focused on productivity
and not CPU or GPU intensive tasks so
besides the heating situation when
gaming and the backspace button being
small and out of reach with the
inconsistency of the trackpad I would
say that this is an awesome laptop for
the price especially since you can get
100 bucks off right now I don't think
you can find a better deal anywhere else
when it comes to 13-inch laptops
it's super compact thanks to its super
sexy pin bezels it has great performance
and the battery life is outstanding for
productivity if you're looking for a
13-inch laptop for school or
productivity and some light gaming on
the side then the Dell XPS 13 is the one
for you if you don't care for gaming and
want a smaller more portable laptop then
you should check out my review of the
Surface three which is a laptop any
tablet in one that has a 10-inch screen
I will leave a link to that in the
description section if you guys want to
check that out so anyways that's it for
the video I hope you guys enjoyed it if
you did feel free to like the video if
you didn't you can dislike and overall I
gotta say that this is a very solid
laptop for the price point if you guys
you don't win $2 discount then you get
an even better deal on an awesome
looking 13-inch laptop if you guys are
looking for something slightly larger
than the 13-inch laptop then you guys
should check out the Lenovo flex 3
it's the 14 inch screen and for the same
price you get double the RAM the same
processor and more space you also get
eight gigabytes of SSD space and I'll be
the link to that in the description
section if you guys want to check that
out but as far as the 13-inch range that
is they saw the laptop to go with
anyways thanks again for watching if you
guys want me to review a different
laptop or product definitely let me know
by dropping a comment down below
but anyways is that from tech stores I
will see you guys in the next video
