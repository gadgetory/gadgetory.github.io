see hi everyone look what's up guys is
that back again from Texas and welcome
to setup wars episode 20 will you submit
your desk set up to get featured on a
channel and a chance to win a prize if
you guys I need you to series and want
to submit your desk setup you need to
watch the video linked down below but
with that said let the setup wars begin
so GTA offers a bunch of really cheap
cd-keys for a bunch of games out there
including Windows seven and eight CD
Keys only for a fraction of the retail
price but I'm going to drop a link down
below if anyone is interested so this
week we have a special guest Dom
Esposito and he'll be showing off his
desk set up and what powers his channel
but those of you guys I don't know who
Dom is then you need to stop living
under a rock now but seriously he
produces some of the crispiest tech
videos known to mankind and I'll go
ahead and drop a link to his channel
down below so you guys can check out
without wasting any more time here are
your five contestants for this week Alex
calleb Erik glassy and Ivan
congratulations for making it to set up
for is episode twenty by the way all of
the gears you guys see in the setups
will be linked down below for anyone
that is interested along with all of the
products I recommend in this episode
without thinking over time let's go
ahead and start off by looking at Alex
setup so starting off the show we have a
very clean triple monitor setup from
Alex we have three LG 22 inch monitors
hooked up to the Ergo tech triple
monitor stand and on the desk we have
the CM storm quick-fire keyboard with
Cherry MX switches and illogic tech g500
mouse we also have an extended mouse pad
from extract pads really not much else
on the desk other than those Logitech z3
one three speakers and this beautifully
crafted one-of-a-kind coaster pretty
good job on cable management and I can
see that you have your PC under the desk
instead of on top and honestly if I'm
being Frank the setup is just bland
don't get me wrong it's a very clean and
beautiful setup and if that's your style
by all means go for it but I think it's
missing some personality or something to
make it unique
first thing I'd recommend for you to
pick up are some actual real coasters
now high linked a few options down below
for you and if you're a fan of Game of
Thrones then you might like the house
sigil coaster set that I actually use
for my own personal setup next thing I
would probably do is maybe at a poster
or two on the wall above the monitors
since it seems kind of empty but yeah I
mean things like that just to fill up
the empty spaces but other than that you
have an awesome setup thank you for
entering next up is Caleb with his black
and red
so we have a 26 inch vizio tv a
coolermaster quick-fire keyboard and an
ethic city scroll six emails on top of
the reflex mousepad they actually happen
to pick up recently sell a choice on the
mousepad for sure also on a desk we have
a pair of super luxe headphones and a
tablet a phenomenal job with cable
management I love how you mounted the
Belkin power strip on the roof of the
desk as well as the USB hub on the left
and then a disk drive on the right I
also noticed you're rocking the Corsair
spec Oh two case that I featured in my
top 5 PC cases under $50 really solid
choice on the case as well the one miter
thing I would add is a hanger for your
headphones elevation labs actually sells
this anchor that you can hook up under
your desk which is a great way to keep
your headphones off the desk and away
from sight other than that minor fix you
have a very organized and clean setup
Thank You Caleb for entering at number
three we have Eric with his Alienware
setup we have a single 27-inch Dell
monitor a SteelSeries apex keyboard and
a razer naga hex mouse also on a desk we
have an xbox 360 a blue Yeti mic and the
ever-so-popular Razer Kraken headphones
I call this an alienware setup simply
because of the PC now although I'm
strongly against pre-built pcs I do
appreciate a great design when I see one
anywhere definitely makes some awesome
looking chassis
cable management is pretty good although
it can be improved with some cable drops
instead of tape also I noticed the LED
strips facing up on the desk and those
actually belong either under the desk or
on the back of the desk so I would
definitely switch that up so it's not
visible the Xbox 360 also looks out of
place and I think it will look a lot
better under your display so a monitor
riser would fit perfectly in your setup
but other than that it's a pretty simple
setup thanks Eric for entering next up
is glassy with an elegant triple monitor
setup so we have three a OC 23 inch
monitors hooked up to three individual
capstone monitor mounts on the desk we
have the Razer BlackWidow keyboard Naga
epic chroma mouse on the SteelSeries qck
mousepad over on the right side we have
a wireless headset from SteelSeries
hooked on the total beach headset stand
no sign of cables underneath and I'm
really digging that Super Furry chair
you have
I feel like the glossy frame from the
monitor mounts blends in so well with
the glossy table it makes this setup
look even better I do look the
presentation and it's easily one of the
best-looking setups I've ever seen on
setup Wars Thank You glassy for entering
last but not least we have Ivan and his
quadruple martyr setup plus one for
representing ROG and another plus one
for the black and red theme all right
who said that
say that to my face so he's rocking
three Acer 23 inch monitors with a vizio
4k monitor mounted on top I wish you got
a closer shot of the stuff on your desk
but it looks like you have a Corsair k70
RGB keyboard and an M 65 Mouse excellent
job with wire management especially
covering those cables running down from
the TV so there are two different types
of setups we have the traditional
keyboard and mouse setup and then the
racing setup with the Thrustmaster TX
wheel set really digging those IKEA
shelves you have on the wall there I
think it adds a very sophisticated
looked here setup and you have a pretty
badass PC as well it's rocking a 4790k
paired with a gigabyte 980ti graphics
card rather black setups are way to
comment I get it but it's always nice to
see what people do with the color scheme
to make it unique and different from
others beautiful setup Ivan thank you
for entering so that's it for this
week's episode of setup wars voting
begins now so make sure you guys drop
your comments down below and vote on who
has the best desk setup as always the
voting will end on Saturday and allows
the winner on Sunday on my Twitter and
Instagram accounts so make sure you guys
are following me there if you want to
know who wins all right so moving on to
the main event dumb going to show us
what you got what's going on everyone
I'm Dom Esposito from youtube.com slash
DOM and welcome to my setup obviously
the star the show lives on my IKEA
Galant desk with my dual LG 34 inch
ultra wide display setup and I have them
floating above the desk using a triple
monitor mount with the middle section
removed to support the width of the
displays now I use the space behind the
monitor to keep random props my Sony v6
headphones and I have a Philips hue
lightstrip running along the backside of
the desk for some
mood lighting on the sides of the desk
I'm rocking a pair of Yamaha hs8 monitor
speakers resting on ultimate support
speaker stands empowering the entire
setup is my late 2013 six core Mac Pro
gr8 studio which I use to store and edit
my footage off of and a focus right
Forte for all of my audio and I also
have a boom arm attached to the left
side of the desk and use a rode
procaster microphone for most of my
video voiceovers as far as cable
management goes my game is strong I'm
using a blue lounge cable box to house a
couple of power strips and plug
everything in and I have a Furman max2
power conditioner to manage the entire
setup I have a few cable tubes that are
super helpful for managing groups of
cords and I utilize velcro cable ties
like my life depends on it it may be a
lot of work to get it this clean but
it's worth it for this cable management
masterpiece along with my desk setup I
also have a media setup which I keep
pretty simple on the top of the stand I
have an lg 4 9 u be 8500 u HD webOS TV
which is the star of the show over here
and I keep a few remotes below it along
with my Apple TV and a Logitech keyboard
to better control some of the webOS
features now below that I have my Xbox
one PlayStation 4 and a DVR box and on
the bottom shelf I keep my controller
collection a stack of games and a couple
of gaming headsets I guess you could say
that the main theme of my set up is
productivity I like to keep everything
organized and clean cut so I can sit
down get my work done and then I have
the media center in case I want to kick
back watch some TV or play some games
big shout out to Edgar for having me on
setup Wars and I hope you enjoyed my
huge thanks to DOM for being on the show

detailed setup tour on his channel and I
go to leave a link to that down below if
