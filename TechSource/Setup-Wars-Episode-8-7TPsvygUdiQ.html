tech stores and welcome to setup Wars
Episode 8 where you submit your desk set
up and get featured on my channel and a
chance to win a prize I host them every
Monday and I randomly select 5 of your
submissions and I feature them on my
channel you guys get to vote on the best
desk setup if you guys are new to the
series and want to submit your desk
setup you need to watch the video linked
down below for the instructions and
requirements so with all that said that
the setup wars finally begin alright so
the 5 chosen contestants are Owen fahadh
Elliot Zak and rod congratulations for
making it to this week of setup Wars by
the way all the products I mentioned in
this video will be linked down below and
also any products I recommend to you
guys will also have a special section
down below so starting off the show is
Owen with his clean dual monitor setup
one from Samsung and another from AOC
which are not only different sizes but
different colors also on the desk we
have the famous Corsair Vengeance k70
keyboard along with a corsair m65 RGB
mouse and turtlebeach p 11 headphones he
also has some LED strips on the back and
it looks like you did a really good job
with wire management for the PC he is
rocking an AMD FX 6300 cpu with an MSI
GTX 660 graphics card and that awesome
500 are white case from Corsair and as
always I will leave a link to the full
parts down below I like that you are
next to a window but since it doesn't
have any blinds doesn't that Sun glare
bother you or gamy
which takes me to my recommendations
obviously I would recommend blinds if
you don't have any also an ATH headphone
hanger on the right side of your table
would really clean up your desk and you
will have a place to hang your
headphones I would like to see two of
the same monitors but recommending
monitors is crazy since they are
expensive so I will try and stick to
these smaller things lastly I recommend
hiding the remote for your LED strips
and what I usually do if I want to hide
small things like this is by sticking
them to the
of my desk as you can see I did the same
here with my camera battery charger by
sticking double-sided 3m tape on the
charger and attaching it to the roof of
my desk and I used some cable drops
throughout the wire in the back after a
few attempts I got used to where the
location is and I'm sure you can
recognize where the buttons are on the
remote after a few tries without even
looking but I'll go ahead and link all
that stuff down below for anyone that's
interested along with the 3m tape that I
used but I think uon for entering set
upwards next up is for hot and we have a
dual Samsung 24-inch monitor setup an HP
Elite v2 keyboard along with an HP X
4500 wireless mouse he also has the
Logitech Z 200 speakers on the desk and
the Xbox one headphones hanging from the
wall okay so pretty straightforward set
up a point for having the same monitors
and another point for the awesome cable
management down below I like the fact
that you put the speaker's behind the
monitors and I mean the only other thing
I would recommend is perhaps a mouse pad
and actually a man they left a comment
on the last set upwards video asking why
I always recommend mouse pads the reason
why I recommend mouse pads aside from
aesthetics is the fact that it helps
protect the life of the mouse would
services and also plastic fake wood type
surfaces also wear out the mouse's feet
and also wears out the surface of the
table and what that does it increases
the mouse's strain it makes it that much
difficult to use over a period of time
so that's why I recommend mouse pads in
my setup or videos of course there's the
exception on a glass surface given that
the mouse actually does work on a glass
surface like the MX wireless master
mouse other than that you have a simple
clean set up thank you for Hart for
entering setup wars next up is Elliott
and it looks like a dual display setup
the left one is a 24-inch asus monitor
and on the right we have a 25 inch LG
monitor on the desk we have a steel
series apex keyboard and a SteelSeries
rival mouse but I don't know how I feel
about that mousepad choice it really
doesn't go well with your setup there
was also some speakers from acoustic
energy and solos play on your desk
and there's even a SteelSeries Siberia
headset hanging from the monitors pretty
cool micro ATX build using the cursor
240 air case although I would have gone
with white LEDs instead of blue wire
management is decent however I think
that you can definitely clean it up more
with the omnimount cable sleeve which
I'll also link down below I would also
recommend a headphone hanger that you
can attach to the right side of your
desk it will work for your setup since
your pcs on the right side as well but
other than that great setup Elliot thank
you for entering setup pores next up is
Zack and Holy orange Batman
we have a triple 24-inch asus monitor
setup which is mounted on the wall with
the model price arms and excellent
presentation with that wallpaper choice
and the orange wall just somehow works
with this setup oddly enough there's
also a Samsung soundbar underneath along
with a k70 keyboard and m65 mouse solid
choice on the gaming gear my friend for
some reason the monitors aren't flushed
together the middle one seems to be
slightly behind the other two and it is
noticeable and kind of bothers me a
little bit I also can't help but notice
that you have a speaker stand made out
of connects which is really creative and
I'm sure you have one at least I hope
you have one for the other side as well
really great job on the cable management
I see that you've added them along the
desk legs and you have a really cool
custom painted PC fun fact Zac actually
painted the heat spreaders the PCIe
brackets and the case grills on the air
540 so props on that amazing painting
job dude as far as the specs we have an
i7 4790k with a GTX 970 graphics card
one thing I would strongly recommend for
you to pick up is a piece of wood or
maybe even some cardboard something
similar to put between your PC and the
carpet so that it isolates itself from
the ground and now it doesn't build up
static and end up damaging your
components but other than that you have
a really dope set up Zack thank you for
entering setup wars last but not least
is rode and it looks like we are in his
bedroom on the desk is a 23 inch LG
monitor also a razor like cosa keyboard
and a Naga epic Mouse hanging from the
lab I see a Plantronics rig headset on
the right side of the monitor we have
the Lenovo Y series laptop with a Red
Lobster on top
I kind of have mixed feelings about the
stuffed animals on your desk but that's
what you're into I have no problem with
that I also noticed a blue metal gear
rising plasma lamp right next to the
Sony TV that thing looks really cool you
also have a bunch of little figurines on
top of your soundbar which is mounted on
the wall and then you have your Wii and
ps3 on this side over there you do have
a lot of stuff connected on your desk so
I don't expect you to have clean cable
management however there are some stuff
linked down below that can certainly
help you out seppings I'll recommend is
perhaps an actual hanger for your
headphones and I feel like the TV would
look a lot better mounted on the top of
your soundbar but having it on your desk
works just as fine yeah really cool
setup I'm really digging the plasma lamp
I just can't seem to stop staring at it
but thank you road for entering set up
words alright so that's it for the
