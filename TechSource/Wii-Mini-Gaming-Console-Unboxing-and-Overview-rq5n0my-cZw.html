with another unboxing and overview video
this time we're gonna look at Nintendo's
mini version of their Wii console this
is the Wii mini it comes in an Mario
Kart game and it's priced at only $99
making this a perfect gift for Christmas
with all the new next-gen consoles being
released this year in a tunnel that I
wanted to be left out thus to loosing a
more affordable we system Nintendo
consoles aren't for the average hardcore
gamer I mean we all know that it's
mostly targeted for the younger age
group and it offers a completely
different style of gaming more on the
casual side so if you purchase a Wii
mini you do get a game which is pretty
cool it does come with only one
controller though so you might want to
pick up an extra one if you aren't alone
you also get a bunch of booklets
including warranty instead of God which
I won't bore you guys to death with
moving down further is the huge fabric
and back here is the censor bar which is
used to detect the motion from the
controllers and here is the console
itself if you can't already tell it
seems like they went with a very simple
design it actually reminds me a lot
about the older 8-bit Nintendo H
consoles kind of like the Super Nintendo
this year is the AV cable unfortunately
it doesn't support HDMI this is a Wii
Remote Plus they didn't include two
batteries along with it and last but not
least this is the second part of the
controller called the nunchuck which is
an optional controller with a joystick
let's take a closer look at both
controller starting with the Remote Plus
it does come already wrapped in one of
their jackets it's the same controller
as the Wii nothing has really changed on
it you have the gamepad on there with
the trigger underneath the controller
the home buttons on top there along with
the volume buttons which controls the
speaker in the middle of the controller
down here is the slot where you would
connect the optional nunchuck for games
that do support it although it's not
required to use the nunchuck for games
using it simply amplifies the gaming
experience make it a much easier to play
because of the joysticks games like fps
and Mario World would be a pain to play
with just directional pad
not only is the price of the console
affordable the games are - they have a
huge library of games at most average
around $30 whereas the new titles go for
50 I really like how simple design is
you have a reset button on the left and
an open button on the right I prefer to
style write it in a disc slot like the
Xbox
sighs and the ps4 simply because you
don't have to power on the console if
you just want to remove the disk if you
look at the back side you have your
power in sensor bar AV out and USB ports
the USB port is used for external
devices like the rock band guitar
microphones and can even be used to
charge your cell phones and media
players because of the price it does
have a lot of downsides it does not
support HDMI there is no online gaming
and it can't play GameCube games over
although I think but the price is
definitely a great gift to someone who
is in a hardcore gamer I would most
likely give this to someone that's on
their 18 just because of the simplicity
otherwise I would go with a real console
but I wraps up the unboxing and overview
of the Wii mini
I want to thank you guys for watching
the video I also want to know what you
guys think about the console so feel
free to leave any comments down below
and as always this is the tech source
and we'll see you next time
