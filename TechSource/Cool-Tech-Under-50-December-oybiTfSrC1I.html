time for another episode of cool tech on
their fifty and if you guys are new to
the series that means you missed out on
some really awesome tech in the past few
months so I'll go to drop a link to the
playlist of all my cool tech videos in
case you guys are bored and wanted to
catch up but without wasting any more
time let's begin
so you can find all the products
featured in this video down below in the
description section in the order that
they appear so it's easier for you guys
to find them first up on the list we
have the ultimate mini tripod from
Manfrotto solid construction out of
stainless steel with a dedicated button
to adjust the ball head to any tilt
angle you desire it's perfect for small
cameras and even can support DSLRs up to
a maximum weight of 2.2 pounds you can
even close the tripod and use it as an
extension for selfie videos or
hard-to-reach shots I actually use this
tripod for my vlogs and it works great
the locking mechanism is extremely
powerful and it's able to hold my Sony
mark 4 without any problems
you can even add a Joby mount and hook
up your smartphone to it this is by far
the coolest mini tripod I have ever used
and definitely deserves to be on my list
next up on the list are rechargeable
batteries from EBL now there are a bunch
of other brands out there but EBL not
only has the lowest cost but the
batteries last much longer than other
brands if you guys want to save time and
money on replacing batteries the EBL
charging Bay and rechargeable batteries
are what you're looking for I absolutely
love these things I use them in my
remotes headphones wireless mouse and
the most important thing I use every
single day my H 5 zoom recorder which
eats up my batteries really fast
I can't obsess enough about how these
make my life so much easier
there are many articles out there that
actually prove rechargeable batteries
last longer than regular alkaline
batteries so I set up two - a triple-a
batteries will charge fully between
three to eight hours or as it takes
anywhere from 6 to 15 hours for the
double-a batteries after a single
recording session using my H 5 I would
lose one bar battery with a standard
alkaline batteries by using rechargeable
batteries I was able to maintain three
full bars the LED indicator will display
red if it's still charging and green
once it's fully charged the only thing
is you can't charge single batteries you
will need to do them in pairs I honestly
don't care about the money I'm saving
I'm more happy about the convenience it
offers these next few items are from
anchor first up we have the Power Core +
10,000 milliamp hour portable charger
with Qualcomm certified quick charge 2.0
meaning you get 75% faster charging
speeds on quick charge compatible device
is like LG g4 galaxy s6 HTC m9 and more
it also features power IQ which will
provide the fastest possible charge
depending on what device you are
plugging in there's also the power core
plus 20100 milliamp hour for double the
juice and the only difference with this
one other than the capacity is that it's
a USBC power bank with an output of 6
apps which can fully charge a macbook
one iPhone and an iPad air 2 on a single
charge that's right guys you can use
this power bank to charge your new
MacBooks they also have a new line of
cables called power line these are
available for both lightning and
microUSB cables and they are made out of
Kevlar fiber making it one of the most
durable cables in the world
the power line version also provides the
fastest possible charge via any USB
charger plus data transfer just my
amazing subscribers the guys at ankor
are hosting a giveaway and they're also
providing you guys with a discount code
for 33% off the Power Core along with a
free powerline cable with a purchase of
the twenty thousand one hundred million
power bank they don't have a lot of
units available so make sure to snag one
if you're interested but all the details
and requirements for the giveaway and
discount codes will be linked below if
anyone is interested this next item
isn't out yet but will soon be on
Kickstarter it's called echo and it's
the world's first hi-fi and Wi-Fi hub
for headphones and speakers the concept
is pretty simple connect echo to any
sound source and cast hi-fi audio to any
headphones or speakers wirelessly echo
comes in four sound pucks and each sound
puck provides the user with 24-bit
stereo audio which is better than CD
quality you guys can enjoy your favorite
content together from music to movies to
video games with the same high quality
audio stream up to 10 sets of headphones
or speakers simultaneously the smart
pucks are simply placed on the base unit
to recharge and it's battery life
provides up to five hours of active
listening from a range of up to 100 feet
if you guys are interested in checking
this out I'll leave a link below on
where you can sign up for notifications
because it will be on Kickstarter soon
so I talked a lot about the band on the
channel but I haven't really gone over
the other options they provide they make
some badass skins for consoles as well
and I'm actually rocking the black and
red carbon fiber skins on my ps4 but
they have other materials and color
options available that look a lot
cleaner they obviously have
our phone skins as well but they do
laptop smartwatches and other devices as
well so if you're interested in picking
out your devices definitely check out
the very first link below these next two
items are from new lacks first up is an
aluminum stand for smartphones and
tablets it's available in silver and
champagne and pretty much just holds up
your device the stand could be adjusted
to practically any angle you want and
it's a great addition to any desk setup
to keep your tablet or smartphone off of
the table or you can just use it to
watch videos this next item is my
personal favorite out of everything I
featured in this video this is the
wireless Bluetooth keyboard that comes
in a magnetic case you simply open it up
fold the back and you have yourself a
stand for your tablet I'm using my iPad
air 2 in this video but it's compatible
with smartphones tablets laptops and
virtually everything that has Bluetooth
capability I don't know how to express
the amazing quality of the keyboard in
just under a minute but here it goes
it's nice and clicky with great feedback
there's zero lag while typing all of the
keys are within reach and the keyboard
is extremely light and perfect for
travel it will get you up to sixty days
of standby time and it will go to sleep
automatically in 15 minutes if afk the
only thing I wish they would have done
was to make a keyboard a bit wider and
fit more space between the keys since I
have large hands I sometimes press other
keys by accident but the more I typed on
it the more I got used to it combined
the keyboard convenience with a
touchscreen feature of any tablet and
you get the best of both worlds I
strongly recommend this to anyone
looking for a solid Bluetooth keyboard
for their tablet or smartphone next on
the list are some Bluetooth earphones
from sound pete's quite possibly one of
the best Bluetooth earphones anyone can
buy under 30 bucks it will ask you up to
five hours of music playback with a one
to two hours charging time it's perfect
for jogging going to the gym or other
outdoor activities it does have a
built-in mic for accepting calls and
comes in a neat little carrying pouch
with some extra gels and cable
management clips in terms of sound there
is definitely a lack of trouble with a
nice amount of bass but you will need to
use the larger ear gels to get a nice
snug fit voices and instrumentals are
super crispy and clear and the noise
isolation is great even at 50% volume I
receive the J board X 2's for review a
while back and I gotta say that these
are way more comfortable than the X 2's
overall if you want a pair of awesome
headphones for under 30 bucks these
should definitely be on your list next
up on the list is a smart screen shield
for your iPhone 6 and 6s it's a very
thin layer of glass that will not only
protect the front of your phone from
scratches but it will also give you two
invisible buttons that act as a back and
confirm button no matter where you are
on your iPhone simply tapping on the
bottom left of the screen shield will
take you back I would say it works 95%
of the time you just have to make sure
to apply some pressure when pressing it
instead of gently tapping it the bottom
right of the screen shield is connected
to the top right in this case it's
actually where the settings is located
for Instagram the top left of the screen
shield is connected with the bottom left
which in most cases is usually the back
arrow key it's definitely a cool piece
of tech to give you an alternate way of
navigating through your iPhone while
protecting it at the same time last but
not least we have the e box which is a
great accessory for cable management if
you have a power strip with a bunch of
plugs sticking out of it and want to
clean up your cables and step up your
cable management game then the e box
power cable has your name on it it's
large enough to fit power strips that
are up to 14 inches in length and has
plenty of ventilation underneath and on
its sides to prevent from overheating so
that's it for this episode of cool tech
on their 50 if you guys enjoy these
series and want me to continue doing
them every single month
make sure to pimp slap the crap out of
that like button make sure to slap the
crap out of that like button to show
your support and I will continue to do
these every single month I actually have
a cool tech under-five coming up in a
few weeks so make sure you guys are
sticking around for that but I don't
know that thank you so much for watching
and I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
