Texas and in this video we're going to
be taking a look at the echo from we
boost now we boost claims that the echo
can make your wireless carrier signal up
to 32 times stronger this is basically
we boost introduction of a consumer
level signal booster the unit's
themselves are super glossy and scratch
pretty easily so I would definitely take
care when handling them setup is real
easy put the booster near a window
making sure it's placed in a location
with the best reception positioned the
antenna six feet away facing it the same
way as the booster and plug in all the
included cables and you're done once the
light turns solid green you're all set
up and you should start to receive up to
32 times better reception when we turned
on the echo we noticed an immediate
difference in both the number of bars we
had as well as the speed of our
connection going into this I was
skeptical but the echo actually helped
almost double our download speed which
is crazy what's cool about the echo was
that it works with any phone and any
carrier so if you do plan on picking one
up for yourself it's a pretty solid
investment and I consider to say more of
an upgrade to my house than anything
else however the 350 dollar price tag
does seem a little steep and I would
only recommend this product to someone
who has very poor indoor cellular
connection and experiences dropped calls
and slow internet speeds if you fall
into this category and f-350 dollars
just lying around i would recommend you
to take reboost on their offer of a
30-day return policy and try the echo
for yourself but that basically wraps it
up thank you guys so much for watching
this is that from tech source and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
