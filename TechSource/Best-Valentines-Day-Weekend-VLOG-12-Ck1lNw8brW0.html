back to the channels vlogs I know it's
been ages since I posted one I'm sorry
I've been working on other tackle
related videos on text source but I
haven't forgot about you guys so here I
am making another vlog thumbs up for the
return so basically we're going to be
heading out this weekend to San Diego
for Valentine's Day kind of just take a
break from YouTube and making videos and
as I say that I'm making a video for
youtube good good anyways yeah we're
basically going for Saturday night
Sunday night and then we are coming back
Monday morning and I'm waiting on
Brienne because I'm all packed and ready
to go
medic she is finally she's on time um I
impact that much actually I just have
one bag here of my my clothes I need
another bag here for my tech stuff so
you gotta have your tech stuff got my
chargers my tablets or tablet I should
say and there's one bag of clothes so
I'm going really light because only for
two nights
looks like the wind blew some more crap
into our pool which no one even swims in
Oh an update on Alexa her rear bumper
got fixed by the way guys check it out
I completely forgot to make an update
video but they did an amazing job by the
way shoutout to GTA body and grand theft
auto body such a lame name but hey they
did a good job as you can see the color
actually is spot on because there's
actually paint the rear bumper so I'm
really happy with this with the way it
turned out
welcome back Alexa so woke up an hour
ago and you have had a chance to eat
anything because we've been packing so
gonna go and grab some grub we want to
go somewhere fast oh I have it is
all right so apparently fast means
fast-food so where are they McDonald's
over here and I'm gonna get something
real quick on the road I don't I forbid
eating in my car but she insisted that
we get there as soon as possible so I'm
gonna make this one-time exception
exception and that is it I have this on
file so if anything I can always refer
back to it I know we forgot to fill up
before we left so I'm gonna go and fill
it up real quick and
Oh toast 4:30 already and we have about
we still have two hours before we get
there
traffic is been crazy seems like
everybody and their mothers are going to
San Diego this weekend
this Valentine's weekend our other
mistake was we showed up looking to shut
up left on Friday because this is crazy
so yeah I'm kind of kind of grumpy as
you can tell just want to go fit over
just a little bit so the three-hour
drive became a five and a half hour
drive but nonetheless we made it better
got our stuff and go and check
all right so finally made it to our
hotel I'm going to unpack well quick
maybe rest a little bit and then head
out get something to eat maybe go to a
bar or something but I'll give you guys
a quick tour of this little hotel so the
entrance is right there bathrooms in
there got our king-size bed little
dresser over here TV I don't know what's
in here oh I guess the room to the other
side mirror desk lamps one cedar couch I
guess so whatever that is and I pretty
cool patio outs here outside oh no
frickin never actually been at an hotel
or a patio so this is really nice and
that is overlooking the ocean a room
tour is not complete without the
bathroom and Wow
we that is a huge tub be a smear
sink and got a walk-in shower over here
and pull it of course I saw about to
head out get some food maybe go to a bar
get some drinks I'm gonna leave the
camera here at the hotel because I kind
of want to carry it around me tonight I
just want to relax and let loose but I
promise to take the camera with me
tomorrow and vlog the entire day so I'll
see you guys in the morning
good morning everyone look at that view
what's up guys so it's the next morning
and now we're heading towards my
Valentines Day present I don't know what
Breanna got me
I'm excited can't wait to see what it is
by any means we'll see what it is all
right so we're back at the hotel just
chilling right here at the patio
enjoying the view I couldn't take my
camera with me to the surprise because
no cameras were allowed but basically
she got us a couples massage at this
place called cascade spa I don't know if
they were Thai or Vietnamese but they
did an amazing job on a massage which
was like about an hour they used their
elbows their knuckles their fingers and
massage every part of the body like they
they move muscles and letting you know
existed that's how good they were so
that's like the first hour and then they
bought us tea afterwards and then we
went into a sauna and after that we got
a facial and a foot scrub and just
entire experience and there are to our
experience was amazing so definitely a
really great Valentine's Day gift so the
plans for the rest of the day Breanna is
getting ready we're going to head out to
our Valentine's Day dinner which is
around 6:45 p.m. luckily we got
last-minute booking available since that
place was packed it's an Italian
restaurant
I'll have the name linked here somewhere
if you guys want to check out but it
seems like a pretty fancy place and
they're having a Valentine's Day
specials so definitely excited for that
so I know that food is usually
overpriced at hotels but I have to show
you something real quick that's pretty
crazy
so check this out you guys is um
obviously got some water you had some
nuts and you got some like snacks over
here you got some cookies some gummy
bears which isn't that a lot to be
honest but check out the price on these
things we've got the chocolate chip
cookies which are eight bucks the gummy
bears which are seven bucks and that's
not even the crazy part there's actually
an eight percent tax that's not included
at a twenty one percent service charge
so yeah you getting charged like almost
30 percent on top of what these usually
costs which is ridiculous there's
something I'm really good at in this
lifetime rather than making pcs I think
it's making a damn good drink check it
out
nine out of ten that's pretty damn good
she always does this be quiet
we need to be at the restaurant at 6:45
it is now so it's 30 minutes away
plus you have to take and take into
account traffic and parking so therefore
wait 6:05 be pilatus or fall all right
so we're five minutes late but at least
we made it all right so this Monday they
have two Valentine's Day it's time to
check out all right right all right so
it's Monday day after Valentine's Day
and it's time to go and check out
are you have 17 what's the left over
nest Anna thank you have a great day
so even though we checked out we're
still going to be in San Diego for
another four to five hours we're not
quite way to leave to LA all right so we
are here at the gas lamp district here
in San Diego we're going to go grab some
brunch
and then maybe walk around from it
head back to LA
so Brianne got a Bloody Mary
what kind Bloody Mary times Oh the
classic marrying and I don't know what
this is too big it

much

pesto sandwich

quits heading back to the car and then
heading back to LA I think like bottle
at my house so I'll see you guys when I
get to headquarters what's up guys so
I'm back here at the headquarters
traffic wasn't too bad it would be it

hours to get there but it was so pretty
packed but I'm here the weekend was
