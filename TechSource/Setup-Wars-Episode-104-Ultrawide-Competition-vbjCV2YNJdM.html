and welcome to the setup wars episode
104 LG ultra white edition where the
winner will take home a brand new
ultrawide monitor we're doing two gaming
versions and two productivity I did a
video on one of them I'll drop the link
to it down below actually the last
episode if someone took home an
ultra-light so there are three more
episodes left and three more winners
ladies in general with that said and
done let the set up for is begin
so starting off the episode we got a
fellow tech youtuber called Adil I think
that's how you say his name I'm sorry if
I brought you that does have a channel
called tech bomb so be sure to go over
and check him out after the show I'll
drop a link to it down below he actually
has a really nice coordinated
black-and-red setup featuring the
27-inch asus monitor you got the core
search great keyboard and razer
deathadder chroma mouse symmetry is
definitely on point as well as
organization I love the way he routed
the keyboard wire around the base of his
monitor stand and even plugged in his
mouth to his keyboard for audio he's got
a pair of SMS headphones and a blue Yeti
pro microphone which is custom painted
and white accents he also painted the
Harman Kardon sound sticks and white to
match the rest of his setup
speaking of matching with the setup his
PC is also black in red with white
accents and it's the first Reisen build
on setup Wars it has an 1800 X 16 gigs
of ram and the Sapphire are X 480 inside
the arrow cool p7 case very nice K
Weismann inside the PC is excellent just
like the rest of his setup it's nicely
routed and hidden although I'm not
really sure what that random handle is
doing on the wall wait a minute that an
actual backboard or closet or something
because the more I look at it it kind of
looks like a slidable door but anyways
this is a really nice setup great work
with the color coordination and cable
management good luck Adil and thank you
for entering as he was mixed up with a
minimalistic setup so he's got a 27 inch
curved monitor from Samsung we got the
Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones and a
wireless keyboard and mouse from
Logitech I like how you use the pull out
drawer to store his iPad and ps4
controller this may be a simple setup
but it has its purpose and tiny mods
here and there which I like for example
the cable clips on his desk holding up
the charging wires or the self-made
raceway from toilet paper rolls I think
and then we got the power strip that's
hooked up on the bottom of the desk
obviously I would recommend channel
raceways instead of the toilet paper
rolls but I'm guessing you one of the
safe some
and make your own but hey if it gets the
job done then it's all good with me
and finally the PC that's powering the
setup has been 6700 K and a gigabyte GTX
1060 Thank You Azeri for entering and
good luck dude and number three is Eddy
and it appears that he built his setup
inside of Best Buy I mean doesn't that
background look like one of those
product shelves as you'd find in an
electronics store I seriously thought I
was getting trolled for a second but
apparently you can buy these racks and
build your own shelves which is really
cool because you can pretty much
customize the height to your liking but
anyways let's get back on track so the
setup is powered by a twenty one and a
half inch iMac with retina display we
also got a steel series apex M 800
keyboard any Death Adder chroma Mouse
from razor he does have two pairs of
headsets the m50x is on the desk and he
Logitech G for 30s under the desk other
than that he's got a blue Yeti
microphone and Xbox one somewhere in his
room can't really say much about the
cable management other than it seems to
be under control but it pretty
straightforward and basic setup also
guys not every person has a draw
dropping setup and I'm trying to give
everyone a fair chance to win an
ultra-light monitor so hope you guys can
appreciate that but anyways good luck
Eddy and thank you for entering speaking
of jaw-dropping setups check out emails
everything is practically mounted
against that backdrop we got a set of
five sony speakers as pc some xbox
controllers headsets and this is pretty
cool we actually built in two outlets
that is very smart and convenient
whenever he needs to power something or
charge your device he can just simply
plug it straight into the desk nicely
done the monitor is a 27 inch curved one
from Samsung and it actually blends
nicely with the backdrop and kind of
gives it this bezel islook because the
border is also light
we got the coarser gaming k55 RGB
keyboard and m65 pearl mouse i'm very
glad that he mounted most of the stuff
on the back board instead of keeping it
on the desk
imagine how cluttered what i've been if
he didn't do that so on the desk he's
got some other miscellaneous items like
the microsoft surface ue boom speaker
and some trays filled with some stuff
for audio he's got quite a selection the
m50x is for music PBG ones for gaming
which are also from our
nikka and the io r+ bluetooth headphones
for when he needs to go wireless
not much I can say about the cable
management since the entire desk is
blocking them but what I can say about
the PC is that you need a serious
upgrade because he's still using the FX
8350 and rx 470 the GPU is fine but you
definitely need an upgrade for that CPU
aside from the setup he did hook up a
monitor right next to his bed which is
connected to his Xbox one which is
genius because he can just lay in his
bed and watch Netflix or even game and
if he's not in his bed he's gaming on
the big TV also props on that Xbox mod
with the see-through panel and D brand
skins that's pretty cool a very sick
gaming room and setup thank you email
for entering and good luck last but not
least we have Ethan and his alien vs.
predator setup so he's walking a 24 inch
lg monitor Logitech G 9 10 keyboard and
the popular g502 proteus core mouse this
is definitely a tiny setup but Ethan did
a great job keeping everything nice and
tidy the cables are managed very well
and props for using a cable sleeve for
the PC wires not a lot of people do that
for audio he's got the turtlebeach air
force X 12s hanging under the desk and
also the JBL charge speaker right under
his monitor I don't know what his
obsession is with alien vs. predator but
he's got a bunch of framed pictures we
even got a few knives and figurines
there's one on his desk and also one in
the shelves oh it also a giant TV above
a fireplace would an ADP wallpaper can't
forget about that a very clean setup
good luck and thank you Ethan for
entering so that is it for this episode
of setup orders as always you guys know
what to do make sure you guys vote using
the apps nice down below those are the
only votes I'm going to be counting
because if I use straw poll or comments
section people always find a way to
cheat and they duplicate their votes and
they actually buy votes on straw poll so
I do not count those anymore I'm only
coming to vote in the nice app down
below make sure you guys vote on who you
think deserves the ultrawide monitor so
you guys so much watching all of your
faces and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
