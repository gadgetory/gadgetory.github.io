Texas and today I'm going to show you
the process of custom painting your
graphics card now I'm going to use my
GTX 780 Ti as the demonstration here in
this video but you can use practically
any graphics card that you like I'm also
going to show you the process of
disassembling the graphics card the
right way so you don't end up damaging
it during the removal and the painting
process so before we begin you will need
a few things you will need a screwdriver
a hex tool some cardboard boxes or
something equivalent some sandpaper and
your choice of color paint also make
sure that the sandpaper is in a form of
a sponge or something similar that you
can grab one hand for easy use and you
will know what I'm talking about later
in the video so the pain I'm going to be
using is the dupli-color engine enamel
because this is basically the only high
heat resistant paint I can find that
comes in red but you can pretty much use
any high heat paint for your parts I
also listed some trusted paint brands in
the description section down below if
you guys want to check that out
so anyways once you have your tools the
first step would be to carefully
disassemble your graphics card before
you can paint the parts here's a good
time to figure out what parts you want
to paint you can either paint them all
the same color or go with a variety of
colors to match your theme that you had
in mind start by removing the graphics
card piece by piece if you don't have a
780ti then just use your common sense
when removing the screws it's not that
hard
so I went ahead and remove the four hex
screws on the black pieces which
surrounds the fan first and then move to
the other four screws right beside it
next I remove the black screws with one
being on each side of the card after
that I had to remove both of the silver
plates that we're keeping the parts
together each side has two silver screws
that needed to be removed after removing
all those screws I can finally remove
the graphics card parts one by one
starting off with the silver piece make
sure you are very careful and try not to
force anything else since you can damage
the parts after removing the silver
casing and the plastic shield there are
four small screws that need to be
removed as well before I can continue
using a small tip screwdriver I managed
to remove all the tiny screws and lift
up the black piece but not completely
remove it
yet since the logo is still inside I
just picked up something sharp and push
the logo right out of it and then right
after that I remove the final silver
piece from the card and to do that I had
to remove the two final silver screws
that are located on the side now I don't
know about you guys but this green logo
is nasty and does not go well with my
build so I decided to do something about
it but before I do I had to disconnect
it from the car to make my job a lot
easier and this part is pretty tricky
and it would be a lot easier with some
pliers but instead I had to use what
tools I had on hand which were two flat
heads with just enough force I was able
to pull it out without damaging the card
now once the logo is disconnected I got
some sand paper and started sanding off
the green paint and this is very
important make sure you are sending the
logo off equally so make sure to stop
and check constantly and you know if you
start seeing black spots on the logo
then that means you are starting to sand
off the white plastic and you don't want
that it's pretty hard to stand it
perfectly but you won't really notice
the minor black spots once it lights up
as you can see here for my second one I
did sand a little too much near the
bottom and it started to remove the
white plastic but that's fine since I'm
going to paint over it anyways you can
also leave them as it is if you are
deciding to go with a white build it is
not necessary to paint the letters white
since it will look great without them so
now that all the parts are removed it's
time to paint them I just basically lay
them on some cardboard and place the
parts on it and applied one layer of
coat equally from top to bottom
on all the pieces now when you're
painting your parts make sure to get all
the sides and it is recommended to do at
least two coats so the paint doesn't get
scratched off easily for the GTX logos I
decided to paint them red so I figured
an easy way to do this was to spray a
flat cardboard piece and lay the logo
face down kind of like a stamp and
repeat it until all the letters are
covered and to me it did turn out pretty
good so once all the pieces are painted
to your satisfaction I would wait at
least three hours before assembling the
video card back together just so you
don't end up smudging the paint off the
cars as you put them back together so
here's what my cards look like after the
paint job I think they turned out great
and these bad boys will look even more
badass at
night so that's it for the quick guide
on how to custom paint in your video
card I hope this was somewhat helpful to
some of you and if you guys have any
questions at all about the process feel
free to leave them in the comment
section down below and I will answer
them within 24 hours
this is that from tech stores and I will
see you next time
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
