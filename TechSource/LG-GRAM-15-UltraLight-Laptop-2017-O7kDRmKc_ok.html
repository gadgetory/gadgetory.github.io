is the gram 15 which is the lightest 15
inch laptop ever coming in at just over
one kilogram I did review their previous
version of the LG gram last year and I
wasn't really impressed however I'm
happy to say that LG has listened to our
feedback and improved their 2017 model
the one I'm using in this video is
running on the KB Lake i7 7500 you we
got 16 gigs of ram a 512 gigabyte SSD
for storage and a touch screen 1080p IPS
display however they do have other
models and colors to choose from ranging
all the way down to a 13 inch version
with several color options and also the
price of the new LG gram laptops start
at $1,200 depending on the size and
specs the build quality is a lot better
than last year's version build with
magnesium alloy it's pretty durable
considering how thin and likes the
laptop is the screen does have a bit of
flex which is to be expected
while the keyboard area has a lot less
flex than last year also the hinge is
well made there's only improvement since
now you can open it with just one hand
for size and weight it's definitely a
sturdy laptop I'm not complaining here
however if you're going to be traveling
with it I strongly recommend using a
laptop bag for that extra protection the
one I'm using in this video is something
I recently purchased at Amazon just for
this laptop and it's awesome if anyone
is interested in checking it out I'll
drop a link to it down below so
connectivity we have a lot of options on
one side we got a USB 3 HDMI and a USB
type-c which is great if you want to
hook up to an external 4k monitor and
charge your laptop at the same time on
the other side we've got one more USB
3.0 and a regular 2.0 along with the
headphone jack and a micro SD card slot
we also included an Ethernet dongle one
of the major improvements from last
year's model is the battery life
according to PC marks works benchmark a
lasted 7 hours and 16 minutes of simple
office productivity tests from typing up
Word documents making spreadsheets
coding and a bunch of other tasks
however I did take this to my mom's
house for the weekend where it lasted me
a solid 12 hours of Lights use from
watching YouTube videos to wedding
scripts for my videos and even checking
emails the brightness level was around
80% and I left the power plan on LG
optimized by default I was very
impressed with the battery
life and it's a good thing too because I
did leave the charger back at home on
purpose
the screen on the laptop is great it's a
1080p IPS panel with great viewing
angles and although it doesn't have the
most accurate colors it's nice and
bright even under direct sunlight LG has
also managed to squeeze in a big 15.6
inch display with incredibly thin bezels
I mean another stand compared to the
Dell XPS 15 lineup but they're pretty
damn close I love the fact that LG added
a touch screen I can't begin to explain
how convenient it was when using the
laptop if you're like me and hate
carrying around your mouse with your
laptop or even just hate using a
touchpad
then you're definitely going to
appreciate the touchscreen option it
eliminates the need for a mouse it was
so convenient dragging boxes zooming in
and scrolling through pages while I was
working on the notes for my next setup
for this video I mean you do get finger
prints on a display which by the way has
a glossy finish but if you're looking
for a truly portable laptop a
touchscreen display is definitely a nice
feature to have the camera gets you 720p
recording at 30fps however it is located
right on the hinge because of these
super sand vessels so it kind of looks
like you're looking over the laptop if
you're looking directly at the screen
which is kind of weird the lowlights is
very grainy so I recommend switching on
some lights if we're going to use it at
night the speakers are located on the
bottom of the laptop and they are both
firing outwards and the quality is
pretty bad then again I don't know what
laptop actually has decent sounding
speakers
however the gram 15 does have DTS
headphone X which is short for digital
theater system which makes up for the
crappy speakers the audio sounds so much
better and crisp from plugging and the
headphones through the jacks now let's
talk about the keyboard the most notable
change from last year is that now the
keys are backlit finally you get two
bonus modes and the option to completely
turn them off if needed this was
definitely a huge issue for me last year
because I use my laptop a lot at
nighttime it's also really comfortable
typing on the keyboard with my large
hand the touchpad is positioned
perfectly so that my hands don't get in
the way and accidentally touch it which
is kind of hard to find on a laptop the
keys are nicely spaced have a very short
travel distance when pressed and offer a
great feedback another great addition to
the grand 15 is the numpad and even
though it's pretty cramped to the side I
much prefer this over not having it the
only real complaint I have about the
keyboard is that the num lock doesn't
have an LED indicator so I don't know if
it's pressed or not which is a bit
inconvenient the trackpad on the other
hand is pretty accurate and very
sensitive I didn't experience any lag or
stutter from scrolling through pages and
the taps and clicks register every time
so I have no complaints there
and finally productivity surprisingly I
was able to edit 4k video on my Vegas
Pro 14 with some slight stutter but I
had to put the laptop in high
performance mode which by the way uses
up a lot more battery and it does get
pretty warm however a rendering will
take a while especially if it's in 4k
resolution it took me about 10 minutes
to render out a simple 30 second 4k file
so I wouldn't work on any large projects
on this laptop unless is 1080p I think
that is much more manageable and then we
got gaming obviously it's not a gaming
laptop but if you must game csgo and
overwatch is playable in the lowest
settings in 1080p which will get you
around 30 sts if you consider that
playable that is but if you load a
resolution to 720p you can get over 60
once again I don't recommend this laptop
for gaming but
if you must like games like these are
definitely possible in low settings the
LG ground 15 has made some major
improvements over its predecessor and if
you're looking for an extremely portable
and lightweight laptop with a giant
screen and a long battery life that will
get you through a full days of use then
I strongly recommend this laptop for you
in fact I've already replaced my
previous laptop and this is now my main
driver I'll drop a link to it down below
if anyone is interested in checking it
out thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
