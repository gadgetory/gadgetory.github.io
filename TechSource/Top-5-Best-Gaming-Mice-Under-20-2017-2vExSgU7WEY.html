top five mice video I think it's been
well over a year since I've done one I
haven't even done keyboards or headsets
or microphones in a while too so I'm
gonna start off by doing the top five
gaming mice under $20 and after
researching for about five hours to find
the best ones out there under 20 I have
been successful before you pay full
price on your next purchase consider
checking out deals or tech for the best
tech deals online because not only do we
have a team of people uploading deals
daily but we cross-check them with
multiple websites to make sure you're
getting the best price out there right
now we cover all of us UK Canada and
even Germany so check out deals for tech
link below also guys just to let you
know I purchased all the mice here with
my own money none of it was sponsored
and none of it was sent over for review
also at the end in the video I'll be
talking about my least favorite Mouse as
well as my favorite out of the bunch so
with that said let's begin so first up
is TechNet which is the only wireless
mouse on the list
it is not rechargeable so you would need
to supply the mouse with a single
double-a battery which is not included
I'm currently using a rechargeable 2800
million of our battery from EBL and it's
lasted me over a week so far in terms of
accuracy the tech net is the least
precise Mouse out of the 5 featured in
this video I don't recommend this for
gaming at all even if you're playing for
fun the mouse itself isn't as
comfortable as I would have liked
there's a lot of sharp edges and
straight lines I'm also not a fan of the
side buttons and the mouse wheel it's a
bit too tactile for me it doesn't have
the sturdiest build either but it's very
light making it easy to pick up or glide
across the mousepad
it does have LEDs but it's only in blue
and it's really dim in well-lit areas
luckily there is an option to disable it
in the back for those of you that don't
fancy the lights for twenty dollars
apparently this is one of the best
wireless gaming mice you can buy judging
by the ratings but with my experience
with it I'm gonna give it a solid two
out of five the blade Hawk's is a
slightly better Mouse
it's more precise and way more
comfortable with a low-profile design
making it very easy to lift and glide
the build quality is also nice and has a
good weight to it
however the mouse buttons feel a bit
mushy there isn't an audible click
feedback that you get from other mice
and because of that it's much quieter
than the rest of the mice featured in
this video it does come with two macro
buttons on each side which by default is
set to back and forward but because of
its symmetrical design both left and
right handed users can use this mouse
without a problem
the side buttons are very easy to press
and the mouse wheel has a nice rubber
coating so no complaints here the button
on the top cycles through the DPI
settings and changes the color of the
mouse wheel only the rest of the colors
around the mouse constantly pulsate and
change unfortunately there is no way to
set a static color nor can you turn it
off I give this mouse a solid 3 out of 5
a number 3 is here rally this mouse is
extremely comfortable it's designed and
built very well we get nice audible
clicks all around the mouse with a
smooth mouse wheel up top unfortunately
it is made for right-handed users only
the side buttons are easy to reach it
does have 2 DPI buttons up top which
cycle through specific LEDs up to 5,000
dpi but the best part about this mouse
is that you can customize everything
through its software you can change what
each button does you can set up macros
dpi settings polling rates and even
change the color of the mouse altogether
while giving it some special effects
there's even an option to turn out the
lights for those of you that don't care
for them I do like the grit material
outsides it's really easy to pick up and
it slides nicely across the mousepad
its responsive very precise especially
in those intense games I mean there is
nothing I dislike about this mouse it's
a solid 5 out of 5 I'm surprised you can
buy a perfect gaming mouse like this for
less than $20 well done here ollie my
first impressions of the magic eagle
from habit is that it's built very well
there's a nice weight to it and it's
very ergonomic I do feel a little bit of
resistance when clicking on the
left and right buns which is nice the
mousewheel is very smooth and has an
anti slip rubber coating although I'm
not a fan of that text right next to it
obviously it's a Gaming Mouse we don't
need some corny text to tell us this it
kind of ruins the overall aesthetic it
does have six different LED colors that
corresponds with a dpi switch but I find
it completely pointless since the mouse
has red colored buttons if you're a
gaming mouse manufacturer and you're
watching this video please for the love
of God do not combine the DPI switch
button with the LEDs on a mouse it is
the dumbest thing I've ever seen for
example this is a nice looking black and
red Mouse and I want to change the LED
colors on here to red LEDs so it matches
the color scheme of the mouse and also
the color scheme of my setup well I
can't do that because the red color is
actually tied in with the lowest
possible dpi setting on this mouse which
means I have an extremely slow mouse
attached with the red LED and there's
nothing I can do about it because there
is no option in the software that lets
me change it however there is an option
to turn off the LED lights but you have
to download their driver first the grip
on the sides are nice it's very easy to
pick up for quick movements and slides
nicely across a mousepad
unfortunately it's made for right-handed
users only I'm personally a claw gripper
myself but this mouse is great for palm
grippers as well honestly the only
things I hate about this mouse is the
fact that they intertwined the DPI
switch with the LED colors and that ugly
text right on the mouse itself and
because of that I give the magic eagle
from habit a solid 4 out of 5 finally we
got the g10 from key idea the crappy
name aside it's actually built very well
it kind of reminds me of the SteelSeries
rival 100 Mouse with its low profile
technically it has an ambidextrous
designed for both left and right-handed
users but the side buttons are only
available for right-handed users which
is kind of lame the buttons provide
great feedback and are clicky with a bit
of resistance the mouse wheel has an
anti slip rubber coating as well and
looks very similar to the magic eagle
with the LED lights running down this
it's very comfortable to hold it's not
too heavy making it easy to lift and
glide across the mousepad there isn't a
software for this one as well so not
only are you stuck with a pulsating LED
color which is based on your dpi setting
but you don't get an option to turn off
the lights as well that's pretty much
the only gripe I have with the mouse
other than that it's a solid pick and I
give it a four out of five so my least
favorite Mouse out of the bunch is
obviously techn it because of its
horrible accuracy and the actual design
it's not comfortable at all I feel like
the build quality is subpar but I can't
really give it too much crap because it
is a wireless gaming mouse and there
aren't a lot of wireless mice out there
under 20 bucks that are solid so I would
say this mouse is perfect for travel and
office work I don't recommend that for
gaming even if it's more casual stay
away from this which leads to my
favorite Mouse out of the five which is
obvious it's the only one with a 5 star
rating and that is the her le this Mouse
pretty much checks all the boxes when it
comes to a solid Gaming Mouse guys
customizable LED lights the comfort
level precision responsiveness it's got
a pretty cool design and it's built
really well the fact that you can buy
this for only 17 dollars is crazy I
don't know how this companies making
money off this mouse because this is a
damn good deal I really hope this video
was helpful to you guys out there and if
it was and you're feeling awesome feel
free to drop a like to show your support
if you guys didn't like the video feel
free to dislike as well that is
completely fine too I'm gonna be doing a
lot more top 5 budget videos like these
in fact I got a few plans for my next
episode so let me know in the comments
section which one you guys want to see
first top 5 gaming headsets on their 50
top 5 mechanical keyboards under 50 or
top 5 budget microphones on their 50 but
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching as always I'll leave a link to
all the mice that I featured in this
video below I love your faces and I'll
see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
