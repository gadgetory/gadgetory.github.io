sound like this well over the weekend
I got pharyngitis which is a form of
sore throat and I've been using these
crappy cough drop pills to kind of help
me out with honestly it isn't even doing
anything
so I apologize if I sound like a dying
giraffe in this video what's up guys is
that from Texas and welcome to setup
wars episode 44 where you submit you
desk setup to get featured on the
channel if you want need to see reason
want to submit your desk setup make sure
to watch the video linked below little
that's that I'm done let that set up
boys begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always everyone's gear for their setups
will be linked below along with anything
I recommend in this episode but here are
your 5 chosen contestants we have Alec
Andres King Mitchell and Ryan
congratulations for making it on the
show starting the episode is Alex ultra
wide set up we have a 34 inch LG monitor
on top of the Alex add-on unit and below
that we have the Corsair Vengeance k60
keyboard and a razor
Orochi mouse on top of the IKEA Galant
desk also on the add-on unit we have a
pair of Logitech x2 30 speakers and
hanging from the desk below is the
Logitech G 430 gaming headset since
we're down here let's check out the
cable management it appears that the
IKEA Signum Rack is here to save the day
great work keeping all the wires off the
ground not much else really going on
here we have a Macbook hidden between
the monitor riser and to Ikea lamps on
each side of the desk which are not
parallel with each other the only thing
I'll recommend is to run the headset
wire underneath the desk since your PC
is on the ground a modification that
small believe it or not makes a huge
difference
oh I almost forgot about the PC so we
have a 45 98 gigabytes of RAM and a GTX
960 that's powering the set up I also
like that you have your USB hub on top
of your PC and set up on your desk a
pretty clean and organized setup overall
Thank You Alec Baldwin for entering
Andre the Giant is next up with a
gorgeous black and white build on top of
the IKEA glass home tabletop other
that's we have the acer 24-inch g-sync
monitor coolermaster quick fire rapid
keyboard with vortex white back with key
caps and a me onyx Neos mouse excellent
choices for the gaming gear you sure
know how to pick them up to the left
side is the pair of grado sr 325 e
headphones which are connected to a DAC
and amp also great choice on the
headphone hanger I'm actually using the
same one in black for my set up back
there
and this is the Silverstone headphone
hangar I do like the little turret from
Portal that you have on the desk which
is a nice and subtle contribution to
symmetry and overall personality of the
setup kale management is not bad I mean
you didn't keep all the wires off the
ground and wrap them around the rails
but it does look a little messy and it
doesn't look like you spend a lot of
time organizing it the PC that's
powering the setup has a 4790k Asus GTX
980 Strix and eight gigabytes of
Platinum's inside the stunning s340 case
by NZXT I gotta say Andres I really like
the small modifications you made like
routing the mouse cable under your PC
and reversing the keyboard wire small
changes like that really contribute to
an overall clean setup the only thing I
would change is maybe removing the Xbox
controller since it doesn't really have
a purpose there and maybe running the
headphone wires any few more loops
around the stand to shorten the cable
slack but other than that you have a
very sexy black-and-white build thank
you for entering coming out number three
is king coyote with his bedroom set up
under the desk we have a median monitor
uh yeah we also have a CM storm
quickfire TK and Amy onyx caster on top
of a mousepad which is also on top of
another mousepad from razor talk about
mousepad ception
you also have the ever-so-popular KRK
Rokit six studio monitors hooked up to a
focus right to eye for audio interface
cable management is on point we have yet
another IKEA Signum rack saving the day
and I also just noticed the v-moda
headphones you have attached on what
looks like a custom headphone hanger the
PC is powering the setup has the 46 70 K
and an Asus GTX 580 what other than
having some loose cables running along
the floor I think that this is a pretty
sweet bedroom studio Thank You King for
entering next up is Mitchell with his
quad display setup up top you have an LG
32 inch TV and below that we have three
27-inch dual monitors hooked up to the
ez mount triple monitor stand we also
have a pair of KRK V XT four speakers
which are actually symmetrical with each
other good job on that on the desk is
the Corsair strafe RGB silent keyboard a
SteelSeries sensei raw mouse on top
glorious extended mousepad we also have
a Thrustmaster t500 RS wheel setup for
racing games there are two pairs of
headphones resting on hangers and those
are the m50 X's and the Beats Studio
wireless headphones to be truthful this
was my face when I saw the cable
management but after reading the notes
you left for me I'm gonna go ahead and
give you a pass apparently for god knows
what reason this desk is built into the
house which makes cable management
difficult and my only question is what
the hell was the architect thinking when
he designed this I mean there isn't even
enough space for poor Mitchell to put
his PC on the right side of the desk
this is something I definitely wouldn't
hide I mean look at this piece it's
rocking a 6700 K though he took a good
bytes of RAM and to Asus Titan X's I
mean besides the ugly sli bridge and
random colors this is a hell of a build
I'm really sorry to see that it's
against the wall but I get why you had
to do that other than destroying the
desk and getting a new one so that you
can improve your cable management and
move your PC I really don't have
anything to recommend but I'm sure you
made the best of what you have so with
that said thank you Mitchell for
entering last but not least we have Ryan
with a cool but OCD taunting setup yes I
would I'd love to see the giant 40 inch
Sony TV right above your setup but we
all don't get what we want
so on the IKEA linman desk we have a 24
inch Dell monitor courser K 65 RGB
keyboard and an EVGA Torx x3 mouse I
mean it's pretty much the gist of it we
have a pair of Sony headphones off to
the left side and as PC on the right
which is rocking a 6600 K and an EVGA
GTX 970 and finally cable management is
on point with the Signum rack yet again
I do see a bunch of stuff on your desk
and although most of them have purpose
being on there the remotes are kind of
just sitting there picking up a drawer
that you can install under your desk can
really clean up the unnecessary
accessories or items on your desk like
the remotes but that's all I got
Thank You Ryan for entering so that's
for this week's episode of setup wars
