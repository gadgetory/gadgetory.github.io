source and I'm actually really excited
to do this video today there's a bunch
of really cool announcements that I want
to share with you guys
also the PC giveaway announcement is in
this video as well so make sure you guys
stick around for that but before I get
into the requirements of that I want to
give you guys some update on what's
going on and that's what some of your
questions
all right so first things first the PC
bill for next month for June is actually
already happening I posted a poll on my
Twitter page and have you guys vote on
the budget amounts so I'll also leave
the link below if you guys want to
participate on the budget amount I'll
check back later this week so I can
start picking the parts and ordering the
parts so I can begin working on it for
the month of June so once again the link
will be down below if you guys want to
participate on the budget amounts so
I've been thinking about starting a new
series on tech source and I want to know
what you guys think about this so
basically the idea is I will have you
guys submit your desk setup tours
whether it's a video or pictures and
I'll be selecting five of the coolest
best set up tours that I found and I'll
be featuring it on my channel for
everyone to see I'll be leaving my
compliments some feedback and I think
it's a really cool way to interact with
you guys but I'll maybe host it once a
month for now and see how that goes but
let me know what you guys think about
that that's something you want to see
happen definitely let me know by
dropping a comment down below alright so
on my last video you guys asked me a
bunch of questions and I also reached
out on Twitter today and asked if you
guys have any more questions you want to
ask me and they get a bunch of questions
so I'm gonna go ahead and answer some of
them that I picked out and once again if
you guys want to ask me any additional
questions you can ask me through twitter
at hashtag ask Edgar and I'll definitely
feature your question in my next ask me
video but anyways I'm gonna go through
some questions here real quickly and
then we can move on to the next segment
all right so the first question comes
from Jack bond and he asks what's the
knife called that you always use in your
videos to unbox new products and I
picked this up actually about a year and
a half ago and this is the firefighter
I'm knife I guess from TAC force and I
guess you can call this official
unboxing knife it's a really cool
looking black and red of course is black
and red knife and I've been using it for
all my videos so I'll leave a link below
if you guys are interested in checking
that out but yeah
this is what I use I saw the next
question comes from a Mason Bonnell and
he asks how do you try and set yourself
apart from other people also doing these
types of videos that's actually a really
good question if you guys have noticed
but my channel's motto is technology
with spice but one of the things that
really sets my channel apart from other
tech youtubers is I guess the way I
filmed the videos the cinematic angles I
use and the way I incorporate the music
in my videos as well it's a very huge
factor music is such a big form of
entertainment that if you incorporate
that into your videos it just makes it
that much more enjoyable to watch I've
been doing that since the beginning and
so far it's kind of been the trademark
of tech source and it's been working
really well for me I think alright the
next question comes from Scotty and he
asks who are your biggest inspirations
on YouTube that's also another good
question my main inspiration that
actually made me want to start my own
channel was Lou from unbox therapy back
in the day I just really loved the way
he filmed his videos the way he
incorporated music into his videos the
cinematic style and stuff like that so
that really inspired me to create my own
channel and start doing the same thing
right now he's got more of a laid-back
chill style for his videos and that
actually works for him now so you know
more power to him but like 2 or 3 years
ago the way he was filming then was one
of the reasons why I got into YouTube I
so the next question comes from Sergio
and he asks what happened to Bob did he
quit tech source or did he just stop for
a while after his computer broke those
of you that been with me for a while
probably noticed that there was somebody
else helping me with my videos his name
is Bob he was my cousin
well after you stole my cousin and he's
actually taking some time off to focus
on school
and his work he can't really commit to
tech stores full-time which is why I'm
currently running this by myself but I
can definitely see him coming back and
helping me out later this year
especially when the iPhone 6s comes out
I'm gonna need a bunch of help for that
so he's not really entirely gone he's
just chillin for now ice the next
question comes from Curie
when did you start YouTube and did you
thought you would get a hundred plus
subscribers so I started YouTube in May
2012 which is a little over two years
now and to answer your question no I had
no idea I'll be sitting here right now
in an empty office talking to a camera
with over a hundred thousand subscribers
that's insane and I owe everything I owe
all this to you guys so thank you so
much for that alright so the last
question comes from Arlene and he or she
asks would you consider setting up a
patreon account to help you with
building pcs and doing giveaways PC
bills are expensive yes to build one and
to especially give it away it's gonna be
very expensive for me to do it once a
month the PC that I'm actually giving
away now is sponsored by the Lockean
company they're the ones who actually
pitched in and made it possible so
that's kind of why I'm able to give it
away even before I set up something like
that I would obviously have to ask you
guys if you were cool with that and what
your opinion is on that if I do set up a
patreon account any contributions I get
would go into a PC build and the PC
build would be given away back to you
guys so I wouldn't really keep any of
the contributions to myself also whoever
contributed to the PC build would
obviously have higher chances of winning
but again this is all new to me and I'm
not really considering anything yet
and I want to hear what you guys have to
say so definitely let me know by
dropping a comment down below if this
does happen then you can definitely see
a PC build at least once a month and it
will definitely be a giveaway but
anyways let me know what you guys think
so that's it for the questions I'm
really sorry if I didn't get to answer
yours I'm trying to make this video as
short as possible but if you have any
additional questions you want to ask me
use the hashtag ask Edgar and ask me on
Twitter and I will feature your question
in the next ask me video but let's go to
move on to the giveaway announcement
which I'm sure 900 sent of you are here
because of that
so before I get into the requirements of
the PC giveaway I want to clarify
something that's been a topic for this
past few months and even the past year
on tech source so as I mentioned before
this PC is sponsored by the locking
company comm and those of you that don't
know
the other main sponsor of tech source
they make it possible for me to purchase
smartphones and basically do coverage on
them and I do at least two unlocking
videos per month for them there's a lot
of people that are annoyed of those
videos that keep popping up on the
subscriber feed my advice to you guys is
honestly you just don't watch it it's
not made for you guys it's specifically
made for whoever searches up that video
if the person wants to lock a note for
their gonna type in how to unlock Galaxy
Note 4 they're not gonna type how to
unlock Galaxy S six so that is why I do
one for every one of the phones that
come out I try and balance my videos as
much as possible you guys won't see two
more locking videos back-to-back
consecutively so if that video does pop
up you guys don't have to watch it
honestly they're not meant for you guys
they're meant for people that search up
that video this isn't their first actual
giveaway that they have done with us
those of you have been with the channel
for a while know that actually did other
giveaways is there a white ps4 destiny
bundle giveaway and a $600 gaming PC
giveaway last year and they're doing
this to show appreciation to you guys my
subscribers for being really cool with
the unlocking videos as long as the
awesome feedback continues on the
locking videos like if you guys stop by
and leave a like or comment stuff like
that then they'll definitely be a lot
more giveaways from them but this is
basically as a thank you to you guys
okay now for the giveaway requirements
thank you for sitting all the way to the
end you guys really appreciate that I
know this video has been dragging on but
I just had to make some things clear
anyways the requirements are simple all
you have to do is go on to their
Facebook page I will leave a link below

basically it
