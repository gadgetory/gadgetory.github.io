and welcome to another episode of the
best tech deals of the week
I do wanna apologize for not doing one
last Tuesday I was pretty backed up in
projects but I do wanna let you guys
know just in case the old so tech is
always up and running and in fact it
gets updated four times a day for you
guys
US UK and Canada as well I'll drop a
link to it down below if you guys want a
book market and check back whenever you
want but anyways before I started
episode guys actually anchor reached out
to me and they wanted to share this
amazing deal just for you my subscribers
so anchor is having a 70% off sale for
the next seven days on iphone 7
accessories from bumpers to screen
shields and even dashboard car mounts
additionally you get immediate 30%
discount on several products all you
have to do is sign up and click on the
blue button to unlock your code and then
right before you check out and put the
code and you are good to go
if all the codes are taken for today
there will be new codes added on the
website each day so make sure to check
back the next day now this is only
available for US UK and Germany so my
fellow Canadians I'm sorry I'll drop a
link to this page down below for anyone
that is interested so continuing on with
the show we have the Amazon echo going
for $140 now this thing plays all your
music from Spotify to Pandora and you
can even control lights and switches
that are compatible with Wemo Philips
you and a bunch of other smart home tech
devices for example why have you sucked
up to my two IKEA lamp downstairs and I
can turn both of them on or off just by
talking to it mechanical gaming
keyboards with a 10 keypad section is
very hard to find under 50 bucks but
check this out guys this one is actually
36 dollars and you get anti-ghosting and
five different LED color modes that will
give the keyboard a pretty cool effect
the color of the LED is a turquoise
color so it might turn off a few people
but for this price there is no other
keyboard like it
speaking of keyboards if you're balling
in cash and want something with better
quality the Corsair strafe is a solid
option right now and it's going for $20
off its regular price now let's take a
look at some GPUs so first up we have
the rx 460 going for only $90 and that
is with a mail-in rebate but let me
remind you guys that you're saving 30
dollars on an already cheap GPU if you
have more of a budget the msi gtx 1070
is going for only 386 after a mail-in
rebate which should save you around $44
if you are a patient person if you
haven't played far cry 4 yet but always
wanted to well here's your chance at
grabbing a copy for only $25 on both ps4
and Xbox one asus has they're very
popular gaming monitor the BG 2 for 8 QE
going for 220 now this thing is a beast
for gaming you get 144 hours to refresh
rate 1 millisecond response time and
it's also basic compatible so if you
guys want to mount this thing you can if
you have an iPhone 7 plus then this deal
might be for you the OtterBox Commuter
Series is going for half of the price
than the actual website so instead of
paying $50 you guys only paid 25 or a
solid and protective case here is
another solid gaming monitor featuring a
1 millisecond response time and a 144
Hertz were fresh rate that can be
overclocked to 185 Hertz guys that is
insane it is from a less popular brand
which is why they're going for only $160
but that price definitely makes it worth
it CIRA reg or crier reg however you say
it has a budget CPU cooler for both AMD
and Intel CPUs going for $30 however
this sell ends in 6 days which is this
coming Saturday if you've been looking
for a keyboard and mouse to buy then you
should check out this deal on new egg
the razor Deathstalker essential and
abyss gaming mouse has a combo deal of
65 dollars the keyboard itself goes for
50 bucks if you buy it separately so you
will definitely be saving a lot of money
unless you hate razer products then this
isn't for you so those are all the deals
for this week as always a pretty short
episode as always make sure you guys
check out the Anker deals going on down
below if you guys enjoyed this episode

you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
