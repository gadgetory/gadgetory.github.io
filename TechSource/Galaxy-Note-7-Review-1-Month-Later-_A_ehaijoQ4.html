and in this video we're gonna be taking
a look at the galaxy note 7 I know it's
been a while since I did a phone review
so I apologize I've been doing other
things but nonetheless I had this for a
few weeks so now it's time to do the
review so getting the boring specs out
of the way the device is equipped with a
5.7 quad HD Super AMOLED display
Snapdragon 820 processor 4 gigs of ram a
3500 million of our battery and a
standard offering of 64 gigabyte of
internal storage with the option to
expand the camera you will find is
carried over from the s7 and s7 edge
with a 12 megapixel rear and 5 megapixel
front shooter beginning with the design
and the samsung galaxy note 7
exemplifies a flagship smartphone in
every way from the metal construction
surfaced with a Gorilla Glass 5 on the
front and back this device is one of the
most beautiful you will come across and
even at it's screen size of 5.7 inches
it still feels comfortable in the hand
of course with glass comes a number of
drawbacks including a slippery
fingerprint and scratch prone surface
thankfully though I think a dbrand skin
will solve that problem without any
hesitation and I'll drop a link down
below if you guys want to check them out
for your smart phone as well the 2560 by
1440 p resolution on this phone will
blow your mind not only is it a Super
AMOLED display but it has a pixel
density at well over 500 it's crispy as
hell and something that you definitely
have to experience in person
the colors are incredibly vibrant and
the viewing angles and brightness are
exactly what you would expect out of a
display of this caliber so the bottom of
the device features a type C port and
this is actually the first time Samsung
has done this on any of their
smartphones we can definitely expect
this to be a trend going on forward you
will find a speaker located right next
to that and to say the least this is one
of the most disappointing features of
the phone
much like the s7 and s7 edge the IP 60
dust and water resistant rating is
likely to blame but nevertheless the
sound is really muffled and tinny to say
the least and here's a quick test
Samsung has gained the reputation of
delivering arguably the best cameras
found on smartphones in the market and
they have done it once again here
as mentioned before they brought over
the same camera from the s7 and s7 edge
the 12 megapixel at 1.4 micron pixel
size and F 1.7 aperture is able to offer
a sharp and pleasant image the pictures
would be considered on the saturated
side but color balance for the most part
was accurate and aside from a slight
overexposure the camera was very
consistent in delivering an overall
solid photo the dual pixel autofocus
technology is noticeably fast and useful
as well also a 4k video recording turned
out just as beautiful as the picture
samples on the front you will find a 5
megapixel camera with an F 1.7 aperture
and one thing that's great about
Samsung's front facing cameras is the
wide field of view was pretty much able
to capture a lot more compared to any
other smartphones front camera so a lot
of people including me were surprised
that Samsung decided to put in a 3,500
milliamp hour battery in a phone of this
size that being said it was able to
offer decent but less than impressive
battery life getting me through a day in
most cases but for power users this
might be quite disappointing thankfully
there are a couple power saving options
available in order to maximize usage
these perform tasks such as adjusting
the displays screen resolution and
brightness for example the TouchWiz
experience is once again improved this
year and really complements the note 7
and its s-pen features very nicely the
device was smooth as expected and lag
was never an issue in my time of usage
that being said I still find the
interface overloaded with a bunch of
features that you will never use so even
until today I am still not a fan of
TouchWiz sorry Samsung the s-pen has
been enhanced this year with an increase
in the pen sensitivity and a reduction
in the pen tip size from 1.7 millimeter
2.6 millimeter and that definitely makes
a difference when it comes to drawing
writing and overall responsiveness in
general use Samsung has also added an
array of features integrated with
TouchWiz with one of the most notable
ones being
to capture a gift and share it
instantaneously the pen delivers a
one-of-a-kind experience to the
smartphone and is still the reason why
Samsung is at the top of the phablet
market the samsung galaxy note 7 is
definitely a device that anyone looking
for a new smartphone should consider as
it offers a complete package any major
features factored in when talking about
a smart phone are top of the line on
this device including the design the
gorgeous display and most likely one of
the best cameras on a smart phone these
features and many more make it highly
justifiable at its premium price point
with that being said the only negatives
I found while testing the device were
the speakers and the battery life and of
course TouchWiz but that's a personal
preference that's pretty much as a
review thank you guys so much for
watching as always if you guys enjoyed
this and want to see more phone reviews
on the channel be sure to leave a like
and I will see you guys in the next
