the Internet and gives you a quick quote
and the most cash for your iPhone so if
you're looking to get the best price for
your iPhone definitely check them out
it's simple fast and secure what's up
guys it's ed from Texas and welcome to
another ultimate camera comparison video
this time we are facing off the Galaxy
Note edge against the iPhone 6 plus but
before we get into the good stuff let's
take a quick look at their camera specs
so the edge has the same exact camera
and specs as the note 4 which is a 16
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.0 some notable camera
features include continuous autofocus
touch to focus digital and optical image
stabilization the camera could also
shoot in 4k resolution at 30fps
the iPhone 6 plus has an 8 megapixel
camera with an aperture of 2.2 and some
notable camera features include
continuous autofocus as well slow motion
at 240 FPS digital and optical image
stabilization the 6 plus can also shoot
in 1080p at 30 or 60 FPS for
front-facing cameras the Edge has a 3.7
megapixel camera that can shoot up to
1440p whereas a 1.2 megapixel
front-facing camera on the 6 plus can
only shoot in 720p so that's it for the
specs portion of the video that sit back
relax and take a look at some samples I
hope you guys enjoy the video
what does it be guys it's ad from Texas
once again and this is a camera
comparison between the Galaxy Note edge
and the iPhone six-plus there will be an
audio icon either on the top left or top
right of this video and basically you
will indicate which phone's audio is
being used
the note edge is being recorded in 4k
resolution whereas the iPhone 6 plus is
being recorded in 1080p which is their
maximum resolution
when it comes to autofocusing the no 4
does a horrible job not only is it slow
at focusing but the accuracy is also
pretty bad
it has trouble detecting the object
sometimes so I'm not impressed with the
speed and accuracy at all on the note
edge
now the six-plus is a different story
superfast focusing speeds due to its
ultrapixels feature and it picks up the
object every single time the six-plus
definitely creams the notes edge on
focusing speeds and accuracy when it
comes to daytime picks I have to hand it
over to the north the sharpness is
unparalleled when compared to the six
plus look at how much detail there is on
the flower petals on the left and then
look at the same pic on the 6 plus no
competition there it is a little about
detail though when it comes to truer to
life colors and note 4 also comes the
closest the grass on the left is closer
to real life colors than the right and
the same thing goes for the green on
this dumpster the 6 plus tends to have a
bit more contrast for indoor shots I
have to give the point to both the edge
and the 6 plus once again the detail on
the edge pictures are just incredible
and the 6 plus has better whites for
night shots using flash the 6 plus takes
the point no question just like the note
for the edge has horrible flash it just
over exposes the object every single
time whereas a 6 pluses flash really
does a great job bringing the object to
life for daylight video the note 4 takes
the point for having sharper images
mainly because it was filmed in 4k
resolution whereas a 6 plus can only
shoot in 1080p
however the 6 plus takes the point for
being more stable than the edge since 4k
disables video stabilization the edge
however has a much better mic than the 6
plus the audio is louder and more crisp
which is why I'm giving the overall
point to the edge for daytime video for
low-light video I think the 6 plus
deserves the point here there seems to
be this fog over the edge video which I
like and you can see more clearly in the
six plus video for example the sign that
says Northwest Business Park is far more
legible than the edge so that's it for
the camera comparison I think both
phones have their strengths and
weaknesses for daytime video and
pictures the note 4 takes the crown
however when it comes to low-light
performance the 6 plus takes the win so
it really comes down to personal
preference when deciding which phone you
want to go with do you take more pics
during the day or night is the question
to ask here anyways what do you guys
