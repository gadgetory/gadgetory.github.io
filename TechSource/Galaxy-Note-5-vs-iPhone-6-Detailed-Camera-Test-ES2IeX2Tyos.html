welcome to another detailed camera
comparison test this time we are facing
off the samsung galaxy note 5 against
the iPhone 6 plus but before we jump
into the samples let's take a quick look
at the specs the galaxy note 5 has a 16
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 1.9 that can shoot up to 4k
resolution whereas the iPhone 6 plus has
an 8 megapixel camera that can shoot up
to 1080p for 5 facing cameras the note 5
has a 5 megapixel camera that can shoot
up to 1440p and the iPhone 6 plus has a
1.2 megapixel camera that can shoot up
to only 720p by the way for those of you
wondering where I got these awesome
carbon fiber skins from that I'll go
ahead and leave a link down below on
where you guys can check them out so
without wasting any more time let's sit
back relax and take a look at some
samples
what
both of the phones do a phenomenal job
when it comes to auto focusing the
iPhone six-plus however has slightly
faster speeds thanks to its focus pixels
feature the note 5 does a great job as
well not quite as fast as the 6 plus but
it still gets the job done nonetheless
and it's extremely accurate when it
comes to daytime video there's just no
competition against orc a video when
comparing it to 1080p 4k resolution will
always look better because the footage
is super sharp and detailed there's also
a lot more field of view on the note 5
aside from 4k the colors appear to be
warmer on the note 5 whereas the iPhone
6 plus is more towards the cooler side
however it's barely noticeable for
low-light video the note 5 remains on
top thanks to the 1.9 aperture giving it
amazing low-light performance the
footage is not only brighter on the note
5 but there's a lot less noise you can
especially tell by looking at the
shadows on the ground for that billboard
sign for stabilization both phones
feature optical image stabilization
however the note 5 also includes video
stabilization as well both of the phones
were also strapped on a device to ensure
a very accurate reading and by the looks
of it the note 5 is by far the most
stable out of the two so it takes the
point what's up guys and welcome to the
front-facing camera and microphone test
portion of the video between the galaxy
note 5 and the iPhone 6 plus the iPhone
6 plus is being shot in its highest
resolution which is 720p and the Galaxy
Note 5 is being shot in 1440p there also
been a do icon somewhere on the screen
which will indicate which phone's audio
is being used and I'm going to stay
quiet for a bit so you guys can hear the
background noise and I strongly
recommend using headphones for this
portion of the test
for front-facing videos on o5 not only
has a much wider field of view but it
also has sharper footage thanks to its
higher megapixel counts the iPhone
six-plus however has a much better
dynamic range you can actually see the
color of the sky whereas it's completely
overexposed on the note 5 so I'm gonna
go ahead and award the six plus and the
note 5 both 8.4 front-facing camera
however the note 5 takes the point when
it comes to mic audio it's slightly
louder and a lot clearer than the iPhone
6 plus for daytime pics both phones
lover excellent color reproduction the
note 5 has much sharper pics because of
the higher megapixel count but the
iPhone 6 plus delivers truer to life
colors there's not a huge difference but
I do notice it on some shots for example
in this pic the flower in the middle
appears to be more on the pink side on
the note 5 the closest to the actual
color of the flower is represented by
the iPhone 6 plus the same goes for the
subscribe below on this shot just like
the galaxy s6 the note 5 tends to have
slightly more saturation which throws
off the balance the note 5 also has a
much better dynamic range you get
crystal-clear image with a nicely
balanced exposure there are times where
certain areas get overexposed but
overall I find the note 5 to have the
best dynamic range out of any smartphone
that I have ever tested for low-light
pics both phones actually do a great job
in low-light performance the note 5 has
sharper pictures because of its 16
megapixel camera but the iPhone 6 plus
holds up well too which is surprising
seeing as it's a much older phone lastly
when it comes to flash the note 5 takes
the final point for having a brighter
and balanced flash which is great for
taking pictures at a distance so there
you have it the galaxy note 5 completely
dominated the iPhone 6 plus on the
camera comparison test but some of you
guys might argue and say that these 6s
is right around the corner and that this
test was pointless well there will
definitely be a rematch between these
phones no doubt along with other
comparisons including speed tests and
benchmarks so make sure you guys are
