today we are building a beast gaming and
streaming pc to game over 100 FPS in
1080p across triple-a titles now here's
the thing this entire PC is gonna cost
you around $1000 without the optional
parts which I'll talk about in a bit I'm
gonna show you guys step by step from
start to finish on how to build a gaming
PC I'm also gonna show you how to
overclock the CPU the RAM and the
graphics card I'm also gonna show you
how to install windows and download the
drivers and at the end of this video
we're gonna play a bunch of games if you
want to see the performance of this PC
you can even use this video to build
yourself any PC regardless of what parts
you guys are using because the process
is pretty much identical so if you guys
want you can follow along and build
yourself whatever PC you want using this
video so before we begin let's go over
some parts this is actually for a
subscriber he reached out and he asked
me to build the best possible gaming and
streaming PC for about $1000 and these
are the parts that I recommended him all
right so the Rison 5 2600 fits the
budget perfectly it's a 6 core 12 thread
processor that offers the same
performance as the 2600 ex after
overclocked but it's $35 cheaper the
extra 2 cores will help out when it
comes to multitasking and encoding so
it's gonna be great for streaming it's
also gonna help out on video editing or
any other applications I've acquire
multiple cores to get a nice stable
overclock we're going with the MSI B 450
tomahawk I've used this board in so many
builds and I keep coming back to it
because of its reliability price and
features it has four dimm slots so you
have the option of adding two more RAM
sticks later down the road it has USB
type-c support and overclocking on this
board is really easy the BIOS is user
friendly and I've had nothing but good
experiences overclocking with this board
in the past
speaking of overclocking I did pick up a
cooler for only $35 now this is optional
but since we're spending around $1,000 I
figured picking up an aftermarket cooler
would be a great idea since we're gonna
be overclocking the 2600 this is the
hyper 212 black edition and it fits the
theme perfectly and it costs only $35
you can even use the cooler that comes
with the CPU regardless if you're
overclocking or not the cooler comes
with the Rison 5 is pretty beefy and
I've seen people overclock their chip
23.9 even for gigahertz
or higher just
by using the stock cooler on that so
that is why this is optional and it's
not required for this build for RAM
we're going with 2 8 gigabyte sticks
from team Vulcan so total 16 gigs at
3000 megahertz which is going for only
$90 right now I actually got a pretty
good deal on this for storage we are
starting off with a 240 gigabyte SSD
from PNY his operating systems gonna go
on here as well as a few of his favorite
games he currently does own a hard drive
but all of his stuff and he's gonna
bring that over to this build once it's
complete the grabbers Kartal going with
is the EVGA r-tx 20 70 black edition
which fits perfectly with the theme of
the build and this GPU is gonna be great
for gaming over 100 fps and 1080p or
1440p this build is perfect for anyone
that owns a hundred forty-four Hertz or
higher 1080p or 1440p monitor because
you're gonna be taking advantage of the
high refresh rates with these average
FPS counts which you guys will see indie
gaming benchmarks at the end of the
video powering everything is the EVGA
600 watt bronze certified power supply
and everything is going inside the deep
cool Ducasse cv 2 it's actually a really
good looking case with a side panel it's
got a shroud to cover up the power
supply and it has a USB 3 port in the
front with a fan controller that lets
you control up to 3 fans at the same
time for 50 dollars this is actually a
pretty solid case speaking of fans I did
pick up four 120-millimeter fans from
Roseville this only costs $14 guys
believe it or not well worth the
investment for better airflow and cooler
temps inside your PC highly recommend
this but in the end it is optional it's
not needed for this build
so if you guys removed the optional
parts from the list like the cooler and
the fans then the build will cost you
only $1,000 but with the optional parts
you're looking at around a thousand
fifty all the parts used in this build
will be linked down below I'm also going
to be doing a pinned comments with
timestamps in case you guys want to skip
to certain parts of the build guide now
with that said there are a few things
that you will need for this build a
screwdriver
obviously I recommend the fan tech
screwdriver kit because the tip is
magnetic and it as an extension making
it really easy to reach tight spaces
I'll leave a link below if you guys want
to check that out you'll also need a
tray or some sort of cup to hold the
screws so that you don't misplace or
lose them you also need a blank USB
Drive
at least 80 bytes of space because we're
gonna be installing windows on here and
speaking of installing when those guys
don't spend over $80 for a Windows copy
you can actually get it for only $15
using the link below it says cd-keys
comm and if you guys use the code listed
below you'll get an extra 10% off so I
use these guys every time I build a PC
and I save a buttload of money every
single time and finally obviously you'll
need a large flat surface to work on
preferably something that's not
conductive so if you have a wooden desk
then you are golden oh yeah with that
said let's begin place the motherboard
flat on the box and get ready to install
the CPU all processors regardless of its
AMD or Intel have a golden triangle in
one corner you have to match that
triangle with the triangle on the actual
motherboard so go ahead and lift up the
lever and while grabbing the CPU by its
sides gently lower it down on the socket
do not touch the surface or apply any
pressure it should just fall in place
afterwards go ahead and lower down the
lever and lock the CPU in place next
it's time to install the cooler I'm
going to show you guys how to install
both the stock cooler and the
aftermarket cooler that I'm using for
this build now if you're using the stock
cooler go ahead and remove all four
screws holding the brackets down to keep
the plate behind the motherboard
position the cooler any way you like
just make sure that the cable can reach
the fan header on the motherboard
the fan can only be in two positions
either the logo facing the left or the
right gently lower the cooler down while
aligning the screws with the mounting
holes on the board
proceed to tighten each screw one by one
in a crisscross pattern do not fully
tighten them at first just enough until
all four screws are caught in the thread
afterwards you can go ahead and tighten
them in the same rotation until you
can't anymore there is no need to apply
thermal paste since the cooler does come
with one but if you do mess up and need
to wipe it clean make sure using 99%
isopropyl and some tissue paper or
coffee filter to clean the surface of
the CPU okay now I'm going to show you
the process of installing the hyper 212
black cooler if you're installing a
different cooler just follow the
instructions on the manual it's very
easy to install first up you'll need to
figure out what socket type your CPU is
and this can always be found on the box
itself this is important because you
will need to know what screws you're
going to be using and how to
installed bracket so for my socket type
which is m4 I'm going to install the
screws closer to that longer piece just
as illustrated so insert the screw in
the hole and slide it toward the longer
piece just like how it is illustrated in
the manual
once you're done we're gonna lock it in
place using the white clip make sure the
screw is in the correct position before
you slide the clip on locking the screw
in place go ahead and do this for the
other three screws until your mounting
plate looks just like mine remove the
screws holding the brackets in place and
this time remove the mounting plate from
behind the motherboard and insert the
one we just made while holding the
mounting bracket with your hand
carefully flip the motherboard over
while making sure it doesn't fall off
you're gonna need four of these to tie
in the mounting plate to the board make
sure to use a tightening cap to tighten
the screws next we're gonna remove the
fan from the heatsink by pulling on the
bracket and releasing it do the same
thing on the other side and remove the
fan flip the cooler upside down and go
ahead and grab the mounting bar and with
the grooves facing towards the heatsink
just like I have over here place it
underneath the mounting hole and tighten
the bar with a screw driver do the same
exact thing for the other side as well
some aftermarket coolers don't come with
thermal paste already applied so go
ahead and grab the thermal compound from
the box and apply a small dot right in
the center of the CPU remember it's
always better to overdo it rather than
not putting enough so don't be afraid if
you think you added a little extra I
like to spread my paste so that it
covers the surface evenly but it's not
required you don't have to do this
method make sure to remove the label
before installing the cooler also make
sure the logo is right side up then
gently lower it down while aligning it
with the screws on the motherboard start
by gently tightening the screws until it
makes contact with a thread again do not
fully tighten them just yet stick with
the crisscross pattern until old screws
make contact with a thread then you can
go ahead and finish off tightening all
four the screws now it's time to put the
fan back on so make sure the sticker is
facing towards the heatsink and using
the same method as before pull the
bracket over the fins do the same thing
on the other side now this cooler comes
with two extra brackets in case you want
to add an extra fan in the back or push
and pull that's why they gave a fan
splitter cable that way you can hook up
fans and then plug that straight into
the motherboard but if you using only
one fan like me then just plug the cable
directly into the motherboards CPU fan
header which should be right next to the
RAM slots now it's time to install the
RAM if you guys have four dimm slots
there is a specific order you need to
install them it's almost always labeled
right on the motherboard as you can see
we need to occupy the second and fourth
RAM slots first so go ahead and open the
locks on both sides and align the gap
from the RAM to the notch on the actual
RAM slot gently lower the RAM down and
apply pressure on both sides until it
snaps in place do the same thing for the
other Ram stick and just make sure that
both sides are fully locked before we
place the board in the case we need to
install the i/o shield make sure the
text is facing the right way and apply
force from inside the case until all
four corners snap in place don't be
afraid to apply force this part can get
really annoying next it's time to put
the motherboard inside the case now if
your case does not have any standoffs
already installed you have to manually
put them in make sure to install the
standoffs in the correct place so that
it aligns with the holes on your
motherboard the case I'm using already
has been pre-installed so I don't have
to worry about this gently lower the
motherboard down while making sure the
cutouts from the back align with the i/o
from the motherboard and I'm gonna go
and use these type of screws to tighten
the board in place make sure you are
tighten them using your wrist do not
over tighten these now it's time to
install the power supply in the back of
the case just make sure the fan is
facing downwards before you slide it in
proceed to align the holes with the back
of the case and start to tighten them in
you're gonna need four of these screws
to do that after the power supply we can
install the SSD or hard drive I'll show
you guys how to do both starting with
the SSD remove the SSD tray from the
case and position the SSD so that the
ports are facing the top and make sure
to align the holes before screwing them
in these use the same screws as the
motherboard before we slide the tray
back in let's connect the cables real
quick grab a SATA cable that came with
the motherboard box and connect one end
of it to the SSD we do to supply power
to the SSD so grab the SATA power cable
that's connected to the power supply
which looks something like this and go
ahead and route this through the cutout
in the case and plug that into the back
of the yes
d then you can proceed to slide the tray
back in and tighten it using the thumb
screw
installing the hard drive is the same
process however this goes in the back of
the PC so go ahead and remove the hard
drive tray and place the hard drive on
it with the ports facing the top just
like before and install the screws just
like the SSD it uses a SATA power and
data cable so go ahead and plug those in
the back of the hard drive and slide the
tray back into the case the other end of
the SATA cable plugs into the SATA port
in the motherboard and you can find this
on the far right side underneath the 24
pin okay now we're gonna install the
fans that we bought for this build this
part is optional so if you're not
installing these then you can skip to
the next part start off by removing the
top panel of the case by pushing in the
tabs near the back we're gonna install
to the fans over here so make sure to
position the fan so that the arrow is
facing up since we are using them as
exhaust slide the fan in from the bottom
and align the holes with the case and
start screwing them in proceed to
install the other fan as well and once
you're done you can put the panel back
on the third fan we're installing goes
near the front of the case and since
this fan is going to be used for intake
we need to position it so that the arrow
is facing the left for this we need four
of these longer screws since we are
mounting it from the back alright now
it's time for the fun part
hooking up the cables starting with the
24 pin so this plugs into the 24 pin
socket on the motherboard it's not hard
to miss make sure that it sits flush
with the socket otherwise you can have
issues with booting next cable is to
provide power to the CPU socket hence
why it's labeled CPU this one goes on
the top left of the motherboard and it's
usually labeled CPU power once again
make sure that it sits flush if your
case has a USB 3 port in the front then
you will have a USB 3 cable like this
usually with a blue tip but for this
case it's black this one plugs into the
USB 3 header on the motherboard which is
labeled J USB but be very careful with
this cable because it's really easy to
bend the pins if you insert it at an
angle make sure you go straight in next
cable is the HD audio and this one goes
in the bottom-left of the board labeled
J AUD by the way there's only one way
that these cables get plugged in so
don't worry about plugging them in
correctly next cable is labeled USB and
it's to power the other USB ports in the
front of the
this plugs into any USB header labeled
jus B there are motherboards out there
that have more than one so it doesn't
matter which one you plug it into we can
now plug the fans into the motherboard
and the cool thing about this case is
that it has a fan controller which lets
you control a speed of up to three fans
and because of this there is a splitter
for three fans so I went ahead and
plugged the top two fans and the rear
fan into the splitter now if your case
doesn't have any splitters you can plug
them directly into the motherboard any
of the headers labeled fan would work
now since I have a total of four fans
and three of them are connected to the
fan controller I still have one left to
connect so I plugged the fan which is in
the front of the case to the fan header
on the board labeled system fan if your
motherboard does not have enough fan
headers for all your fans you can pick
up fan splitters which are sold on
Amazon and I'll jump a link below if you
want to check it out so the fan
controller won't work unless you give it
power so we have the male molex cable
that's connected to the PC and plug that
into the female molex connector that's
connected to the power supply these are
the last set of cables are gonna be
connecting and these plug into the
header labeled jfp one so the first
cable we're gonna plug in is the power
switch and this goes into the third and
fourth pin on the top row for the sake
of simplifying things make sure to have
the letters facing towards you the next
set of cables are the power LED plus and
the minus the power LED plus goes into
the first pin and the minus goes into
the second pin this is what it looks
like with all three of the cables
plugged in on the first row HDD led plus
goes into the first and second pin on
the bottom with the letters facing
towards you and right next to that is
the reset switch once again make sure
all the letters are facing you this is
what the bottom row should look like if
you plug everything correctly some cases
don't have all the cables so if you're
missing a few of them don't worry about
it just plug in what you have we are
going to install the GPU on the top PCI
slot for the best performance so go
ahead and remove the PCIe brackets that
line up with the top slot in my case I
had to remove the second and third
brackets grab the GPU from the bottom
and insert it in the top slot until it
snaps in place make sure to tighten it
back using at least one of the thumb
screws grab the final cable from the PSU
labeled PCIe and plug that into the
graph
and this is what your PC should look
like after everything is plugged in you
are pretty much finished and you have
built yourself an awesome gaming PC the
only thing left to do is install Windows
download the drivers and overclock the
CPU RAM and GPU all right so grab your
flash drive and plug it into any PC that
has access to the Internet go ahead and
visit the windows media website and
click on the download tool now open the
program and just follow the instructions
on there when you get to this screen
click on create installation media and
then click Next make sure to select the
flash drive option and click Next again
and on this page select the flash drive
that you connect it to the PC it's gonna
delete all the files on there so make
sure that you don't need anything from
it the files are going to be downloaded
into the USB Drive and this process can
take some time depending on your
internet speed so just sit back and wait
for it to complete once it's complete
just hit finish and remove the USB and
plug it into the PC that we just built
before you power on your PC make sure
the cables plugged in behind your power
supply and the switch is set to the line
also make sure that your HDMI or
DisplayPort cable is plugged in directly
into your graphics card hit the power
button and wait for the PC to boot up
and it'll automatically detect the USB
Drive and take you to the Windows setup
page if it doesn't detect the USB Drive
make sure to plug it in from the back
side and if that still doesn't work you
have to manually boot from the USB by
either hitting f8 or whatever key is
assigned to it depending on your
motherboard
once you out the main screen follow the
prompts until you get to the activate
window section over here type in the
windows CD key and hit next remember you
can get a Windows 10 key for less than
$15 through the link below and if you
guys use the code TSS 2 you can get an
extra 10% off in the next page you have
to select which version of Windows
you're installing and it's really
important that this match is the same
version of Windows on your CD key in my
case about Windows 10 Pro so that is the
version I'm selecting go ahead and
accept the terms on this page and make
sure to select the custom option and
pick which drive you want windows to be
installed on I strongly recommend
picking your SSD over a hard drive for
faster speeds in my case I only have an
SSD installed so I'm going with that
option windows will then begin
installing the files to your drive and
it will restart a few times so just make
sure to follow the prompts on the
until you get to the desktop screen now
I'm going to show you guys how to
download and install the drivers I will
leave a link to all this down below so
all you have to do is click and download
them
you still need internet access so find
the PC that has it and visits your
motherboard website and go to the
support tab and select the version of
Windows you are using these are the
drivers that you need to download the
chipset driver the onboard audio drivers
and the LAN drivers if your motherboard
has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth then
make sure to download those drivers as
well so if you're using an NVIDIA GPU go
to the geforce website and download
geforce experience if you're using an
AMD GPU go to the AMD website scroll
down and download the auto detect tool
if you want to overclock your cpu
download the Cinebench r15 benchmark and
h/w monitor so that we can monitor the
temps now if you guys want to overclock
your graphics card download msi
afterburner and to benchmark the GPU
we're gonna be using having benchmark
once again I'll drop a link to all of
this down below so it's easier for you
once everything is downloaded open them
up and install the files to your PC
alright so now your PC is officially
ready to go if you're not planning on
overclocking then you're done if this
was helpful to you guys dropping a like
would be awesome thanks for watching and
I will see you in the next one
that's a kill
for those of you who want to squeeze
extra performance out of your PC we're
gonna overclock it starting with the CPU
so go ahead and restart the PC and hit
the Delete key on the keyboard so it
takes you to the BIOS screen once you
are here hit f7 to enter the Advanced
Mode and then go into the overclocking
menu change the Explorer mode to expert
and just copy my settings if you're
using the same CPU as mine set the CPU
to four gigahertz then change the XMP
profile to profile one and set the DRAM
frequency to match the frequency of your
RAM I'm running 3000 megahertz weighted
Ram so I set it to 3,000 go ahead and
scroll down and change the CPU core
voltage to 1.3 volts and the DRAM
voltage to 1.3 5 volts this is a very
safe overclock even with the stock
cooler but to make sure the PC is stable
we're gonna hit f10 to save the changes
and then reboot the PC once you are on
the desktop open up Cinebench r15 and
run the cpu benchmark if it completes
without crashing then that's a good sign
as you can see the cpu temps are under
60 degrees which is really good if your
cpu temps go above 85 degrees that's
when you should start worrying about it
if you guys feel comfortable you can
always go back into the BIOS and
increase the CPU frequency I was
actually able to push my 2600 to 4.1
gigahertz at one point 3 to 5 volts just
remember if the PC crashes when you
increase the frequency you need to go
back and increase the voltage I like to
increase the voltage in small increments
of 0.001 to 5 but whatever you guys do
do not pass one point 4 volts on your
rising to chip and make sure the temps
on going over 85 degrees the best way to
test how stable the overclock is is by
actually gaming on it so if your PC
crashes within an hour of gaming then
you need to go back into the BIOS and
lower the settings if you're happy with
the CPU overclock we can go ahead and
proceed to the GP overclock which is a
lot easier so go ahead and open up msi
afterburner and the heaven benchmark set
the quality to ultra and tessellation to
extreme and make sure the resolution is
1080p but windowed so that it doesn't go
fullscreen
if you want you can click the detach
button on the MSI Afterburner
and move the monitor chart to the right
side to check out the temps go ahead and
drag the power limit
bar all the way to the right and hit the
checkmark to save the settings we're
gonna open up the heaven benchmark and
hit f9 so that the benchmark starts now
while it's running in the background
we're gonna increase the core clock I
like to start at 50 megahertz or we're
gonna change it to 50 and hit apply and
we're gonna wait for the benchmark to
complete one cycle if it doesn't crash
we can go back and increase it by
another 25 megahertz and you can do this
until it gets to a point where the crash
is I got my GPU up 225 megahertz but as
you can see the benchmark crashed as
soon as I hit apply so I know for a fact
that's gonna be stable at 100 megahertz
which is what I left it at I could go
back and increase it by 5 megahertz and
probably squeeze more performance out of
it but I left it at a hundred just to
keep things simple now it's time to
overclock the memory it's the exact same
concept but this time you can do 100
megahertz increments since memory
overclocks a lot easier so make sure to
leave the benchmark running for a full
cycle before increasing it if you're
happy with the GPU overclock make sure
to save your profile and hit the windows
button so that way it over clocks it
when you boot your PC remember if your
PC crashes during gameplay you have to
go back and lower the clock settings
until your system becomes stable these
benchmarking tools don't really compare
to real-world use it's just meant to be
used as a starting point as you can see
this is a pretty beast gaming PC you
could pretty much max out any game and
still get well over 100 FPS and either
1080p or 1440p resolution I also think
the bill turned out very nice with the
old black stealth look overall very cool
temps thanks to the extra tree fans we
installed and the case design but what's
more impressive is how quiet the system
is while gaming
and that does it for my build guide
ladies and gentlemen if this was at all
helpful or if you guys enjoy the video
leaving a simple like with me in the
world to me it took me a good week to
put this video together for you guys it
does take a long time so I greatly
appreciate any likes or dislikes you
guys can leave for this video I'm really
happy with the way it turned out it's a
really clean build and I know that
Sergio would be happy to game and scream
on this beast
it is officially text or certified after
all but anyways guys I'll drop a link to
all the parts used in the build down
below and consider subscribing if you
guys enjoy content like this thanks
again so much for watching and I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
