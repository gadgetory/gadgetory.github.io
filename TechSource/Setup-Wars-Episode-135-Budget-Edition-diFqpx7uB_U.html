to setup wars episode 135 a budget
edition I basically do these every five
episodes and then I do worst setup
editions every ten episodes so if you
guys want to participate in the next
budget edition make sure to watch the
video linked below
let the setup Wars begin kicking off the
episode is Daxton and his black and
white gaming setup that he also uses for
school work he's 16 and a Best Buy sales
associate which means that he's on a
budget he also stated that he's a huge
fan of logitech because they have
amazing customer service I love that you
didn't write anywhere in the notes that
you actually like the quality of the
products just customer service it's
interesting we got the Logitech G 2:13
prodigy keyboard g502 proteus Mouse Z
323 speakers and the G 430 headset all
from Logitech I gotta admire the brand
loyalty there I also like the unique set
of items you have hung from the wall the
license plate actually has a sentimental
value because it's from his very first
accident where his car burned down and
the watch was a gift from his father and
stepmom on their wedding day there
wasn't much else on the setup it's very
compact and straightforward great cable
management and the PC running at all is
a budget build rocking the G 45 60 and a
1050 TI Thank You Daxton for entering
and starting off the show up next is
Hayes coming from Louisiana and this is
his setup for gaming he actually runs a
small graphic design business which is
where he saved up his money to buy most
of the items and his setup for a 14 year
old that's pretty badass the desktop is
made from scratch using some scrap wood
and resin while the legs are built from
square pipe bars and he helped from his
dad and cousin the monitor he's using is
actually the bezel meaning that he took
apart the casing so the bezels aren't as
big that's definitely the first time
I've heard of that so I was reading some
comments on setup wars the other day
regarding my recommendation to run the
mouse wire underneath the keyboard and
some people were complaining about that
because they were saying competitive
gamers need a lot of cable slack to move
the
mouse around I think you guys
misunderstood what I was trying to say
you can have as much cable slack as you
want running the cable underneath the
keyboard is just to clean up the surface
that way you don't have that nasty cable
running across the desk it has nothing
to do with cable slack you can pull out
as much cable as you need if I'm
underneath the keyboard anyways back to
the setup so for audio he's rocking a
JBL extreme speaker blue snowball
microphone and the px3 gaming headset
hanging underneath the desk the cable
management is very clean it looks like
most of the cables are routed inside
that giant tube and the rest are covered
using wall raceways down here is a PC
that's powering the setup and it's
sitting on carpet and this is the second
PC featuring AG 45 60 and a 10 50 TI one
thing I would recommend for your PC is a
computer stand which will not only help
prevent dust and dirt from going inside
your PC potentially damaging it but it
also has wheels on it so you can move it
around easily whether you want to clean
the carpet up or maybe you want to plug
something in from the back I also feel
like your desk is just way too big for
the amount of things you have on there
but I guess you can call it future proof
if you ever need to add additional
monitors later down the line or maybe
even upgrade to an ultra wide and add
some bookshelf speakers you definitely
have all that extra space to work with I
guess I'm just wondering why you haven't
placed your PC on the desk since you
definitely have extra space for it I
really like those backlit hexagons that
you built on the wall it's very unique
and definitely add some spice to the
overall setup but very nice and
considering you're only 14 and on a
budget that's pretty damn impressive
Thank You haze for entering Jacob is up
next who is only a year older than haze
with a very clean gaming setup featuring
a 21 inch monitor that's hooked up to an
interesting monitor arm below that we
got the pair of Logitech Z 150 speakers
and the k70 RGB keyboard with the Death
Adder
elite Mouse on the right as the budget
PC running on the I 360 180 TX 1060 from
EVGA with the Sennheiser GSP 300 gaming
headset hanging from the S 340 elite
case pretty good work with the kill
management looks like he hooked up
everything underneath the desk and
routed the cables through the channel
raceway that I recommended so many times
in the past excellent work not much else
I can say very clean gaming setup that
gets the job done Thank You Jacob for
entering coming all the way from
Slovakia in Europe is jaraj and his
video editing and gaming setup now you
guys might be wondering
II D why the hell is this guy in budget
edition he has three freaking monitors
relax okay he's using outdated 17-inch
monitors that cost him a total of 30
euros the desk itself is custom made by
him from old shelves that he took apart
from his wall and he even created a spot
just for his PC on the right side
awesome job on the custom work my man
that's actually very impressive the
three monitors fits perfectly on the
desk riser with a USB hub attached
underneath there and there's even a spot
to hang his jam bird headphones I also
love that you drill a hole to route the
keyboard and mouse wire through and take
a look at the wire management underneath
his desk
beautiful job couldn't have done it
better myself the PC powering the setup
has an athlon x4 8:45 and gigabyte gtx
1050 there's really nothing I'll
recommend for your setup I think you did
a great job putting it all together
despite being on a tight budget I do
want to let you know that I read your
note and I appreciate the kind words so
if you're watching this video send me an
email through setup ORS because I do
want to send you $100 I know it's not
much but I'm hoping you can use this
towards your next setup upgrade last but
not least is Ronald who is not only the
youngest contestant of this episode
being only 12 but also the one who has a
true budget setup I mean this guy built
his entire setup underneath his bunk bed
that's genius I mean you can jump
straight out of bed and start gaming and
vice versa all jokes aside obviously he
didn't have the extra space in his room
for a setup so he had to make the
decision of putting it underneath his
bed having a setup is better than not
having a setup so Ronald is rocking a 25
inch ultra light from LG and a budget
keyboard and mouse that I don't know the
name of he doesn't have any headphones
so instead he's using speakers that he
bought from some Chinese website in fact
he purchased the keyboard and mouse from
that same Chinese website the PC
powering the setup is an eyesore it's
equipped with an FX 6300 and a gtx 740
there was a few things I noticed the
your pc though first up you put the RAM
sticks in the wrong slot you do need to
double check that and make sure they are
both in the correct alternating slots
also you might want to bring that GPU to
the top x16 slot you might not notice a
huge difference in performance but every
little bit helps I do have to give you
some props on attempting the cable
management I mean at least you zip tie
those cables to the bed but the rest of
the wires are kind of just hanging from
the back if you don't want to invest in
some better cable management equipment
then that's fine but you can pick up
some cable clips to help keep those
wires from sagging those are actually a
lot cheaper I read your notes Ronald and
I know that I inspired you to build your
current PC and you're actually planning
on building your next one so if you're
watching this video toss me an email on
setup boards because I do want to help
out on your next build thank you for
being such a longtime subscriber I
appreciate it and thank you for entering
so that does it for this episode of
setup words I hope you guys enjoyed it
make sure to drop your comments below
and vote on who you think has the best
desk setup if you guys do enjoy the
budget edition of setup or and dropping
a like would be awesome and if you guys
don't like it please I encourage you to
leave a dislike thank you so much
watching as always I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
