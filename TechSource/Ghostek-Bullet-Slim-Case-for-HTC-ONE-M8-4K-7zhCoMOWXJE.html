tech source and today we are gonna take
a look at the ghost tech bullet slim
case for the HTC One m8 this case was
designed to be very protective of the
phone while still keeping a slim profile
something I really like about this case
though is that it also comes equipped
with this kickstand which makes watching
videos and movies with the HTC One 8
that much better especially when using
boomsound speakers another cool thing
about this case is that it comes with a
screen shield and a microfiber cloth
which is nice to see since a lot of case
manufacturers have lately not been
including extra accessories with their
products but it's refreshing to see that
ghost tech still does being that this is
a two piece case installation couldn't
be easier all you have to do is put your
phone into the rubber portion of this
case and snap the front ring on once the
phone is in you do still have access to
all the functionality of the phone like
the microUSB port buttons and even the
IR blaster located on the top this case
doesn't add too much thickness to the
device as you can see here but it does
add a lot of protection we wanted to see
just how durable this case was so we put
the phone in the case under the drop
test we did two tests one for me right
which is about five feet eight inches
and one face down from about four feet
and the phone I can gladly say survived
not only did the phone survive the case
was an almost perfect condition as well
the only visible damage was a little
scuff mark on the upper left corner of
the back of the case cases like this is
a must for people who have a tendency of
dropping their phones especially when a
phone like the HTC One m8 can go for
around $700 and an investment in a case
like this can cost as little as ten
dollars the overall build quality of
this case does feel premium especially
when considering the current price of
only $15 I will put links in the
description section just in case you
want to check them out and get more
pricing information anyways this is Bob
from tech Saurus thanks for watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
