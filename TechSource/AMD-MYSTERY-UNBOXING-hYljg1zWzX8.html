I'm welcome to a special unboxing video
right in front of me we have a mystery
box from AMD now I'm not gonna pretend
not to know what's inside
obviously they sent in their brand new
rising 2 processors however the box is a
little too big just four processors so
yeah there's obviously some other things
in here which I don't know anything
about so with that said let's go to
unbox it
so while I'm unboxing this I don't want
to give a huge shout out to my website
deals our tech guys this July it's gonna
be our 2 year anniversary it's almost
two years that the website has been
running and for those of you that don't
know we pretty much search the internet
throughout the day and post the best
deals that we find from Amazon Newegg
and eBay across four countries it's
honestly one of the best places to find
deals on PC parts and pretty much every
other tech category so if you haven't
already check it out and I'll drop a
link below I would really appreciate it
alright so let's get this out of the way
oh-ho okay I can see why the box was
heavy so we got two different boxes in
here we have this okay and this so we've
got a tiny box here which looks like it
can fit two processors and then we got a
massive one for I'm guessing
motherboards RAM sticks all that kind of
stuff so let's go to the box this one
first actually it's yep pretty much
called it we got the new horizon 5 and
Rison 7 second gen processors get these
out of the box over here so this is the
Rison 720 700 X it's an 8 core 16 thread
processor the base clock is 3.7
gigahertz and it can go up to four point
three gigahertz and this one over here
is the 2600 X 6 core 12 thread processor
with slightly lower clock speeds than
the 2700 X so guys these are raisins
second generation CPUs which are
basically a newer version of
last gen that was launched around
February of last year I believe you get
slightly higher bass and boost clock
speeds better gaming performance and
improved efficiency while sticking to
the same a m4 socket and keeping the
same TDP except for the 2700 X which has
a slightly higher TDP than B 1700 x of
last year and just to clarify for you
guys the 2600 X is basically the newer
version of the 1600 X and the 2700 X is
the newer version of the 1700 X just to
clarify a little bit for you guys and I
think all the new horizon 7 CPUs come
with their new rave prism cooler it has
which has a built-in LED inside but
don't quote me guys so this is their new
wraith prism cooler which honestly looks
very similar to their Wraith spire the
only new difference i see is that the
actual fan blades or the actual fan is
transparent which is gonna actually
light up when you turn it on and you
still get the same LED ring around the
fan as well all this is on their NDA so
I can't really talk much about it I
don't know if it's gonna have a better
performance than a previous cooler you
guys are just gonna have to wait and see
and the benchmarks alright and the risin
5 I think comes with their basic Wraith
stealth cooler so doesn't seem like
anything's changed here there are no
LEDs on this one so another friends on
the rise and 2 processors coming from
first gen is that AMD switched from 14
to 12 nanometer production process which
AMD says will yield 10% performance
boost on its own while the higher clock
speeds are potentially showing around
18% benchmark gains but of course we
will confirm if that's true or not once
the benchmarks are out another great
thing about the new rising 2 CPUs is the
price it's actually going to be slightly
cheaper at launch compared to 1st gen
risin at launch and because of this
first gen rise in CPUs we'll get a nice
price cut making them slightly more
affordable also all the new rise and 2
processors coming from Rison 5 all the
way to 7 are available at the time of
watching this video so I'll drop links
below if you guys
check that out but anyways moving on to
the big box let's see what's inside here
okay you got a little cover over here it
says bring your imagination to life okay
alright I'm diggin it first up is the
motherboard from MSI this is their new
chipset for the rising 2 CPUs the x4 70
gaming m7 AC and then we got one more
from Asus it looks like and this is
their x4 70 chipset motherboard the ROG
crosshair 7 hero there's actually one
more thing in here and the RAM sticks
from g.skill oh he's not actually the
same ones I unboxed in my what's in the
Box episode if you guys remember these
are the new sniper X camouflage themed
RAM sticks so yeah they send in 16 gigs
thirty four hundred megahertz RAM sticks
which are Rison compatible ok it's
pretty much it you know this video
really got me thinking I haven't done an
AMD build in such a long time so I might
do one on a channel the question is
should I do a high end build or should i
the way budget build I guess budget will
be a little difficult because of the GPU
prices but maybe I can do something with
the a-series chips but anyways let me
what you guys think or which you guys
want a name the high end build or a
budget slash mid-range build let me know
your comments down below that's pretty
much it for the video I hope you guys
enjoyed it tossing your like would be
awesome if you guys didn't like the
video please leave a dislike I encourage
you I love your faces and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
