and today we're building another PC I've
been doing a lot of high-end builds
lately so I decided to shift the gears
down a little bit and focus on budget
oriented builds this was actually budget
slash mid-range and it's for my friend
Tony which is a high school buddy of
mine he reached out recently and he's
like and I hate playing for night on my
Xbox one I want to go back to the PC
master-race and play with you guys and I
only have a budget of $1,000 what can
you do for me
so one thousand dollars these are the
parts I came up with he also wanted a
good-looking PC sometimes when you're
doing a budget build you focus mostly on
the parts aspect and you overlook the
aesthetics part so when you're done
building it it looks like a pile of
garbage so he wanted a black and red
build and it was a lot easy to put the
parts together because a lot of parts
are in black and red I also wanted to
make this PC kind of future proof for
him so laying down the line if he wants
to upgrade it's gonna be a lot easy for
him and all he has to do is just swap
out some parts so all the parts in this
build with the windows key came out to
nine hundred dollars flat give or take a
few cents and with tax I think it came
out to nine hundred ninety dollars so
under the thousand dollar budget
and by the way guys is gonna be a full
step-by-step build guide on this exact
same PC so if you want to pick up the
parts and follow along and build
yourself is the exact same computer make
sure to watch that video and if it's
available already I'll drop a link to it
down below all right so let's go over
the parts real quick starting with the
CPU which was the easiest choice I
picked the horizon 520 600 X because of
the value this is risings a
second-generation CPU and it's a 6-quart
well thread processor it's unlocked and
it comes with it's very own heatsink and
I kind of wanted something in between 4
and 8 cores for Tony let's say later
down the line he decides to do some work
maybe it's light editing or 3d modeling
whatever it is the extra two cores would
definitely help on with that so you have
a $210 this was overall a solid pic and
it's actually the sweet spot between
gaming and also taking advantage of
multi-threaded applications whether
you're editing 3d modeling that extra
two cores definitely comes in handy
especially when overclocked
moving on to the motherboard this is the
MSI x4 70 gaming plus and this one came
out to I think one hundred and thirty
dollars so the reason why I went with
the x4 70
take advantage of these
second-generation rice and chips what I
mean by that is the new platform offers
better optimization also better
performance and you get support for
higher memory speeds after all this is a
future-proof build so it doesn't make
sense going with last generation product
so that is why I ended up spending the
extra 50 or 60 bucks and going with the
x4 70 chipset and of course it matches
the color scheme so that's always a huge
plus so Ram is pretty hard to find with
the ridiculous prices out there so I
looked around I think this was on sale I
picked it up a new egg for $90 it's from
t fours and these are 3000 megahertz
weighted RAM sticks so four gigs each
and it's also black and red so it's
gonna complement the color scheme
beautifully GPU prices are also
ridiculous and now nobody this would
cost around 250 bucks back in the day
but I managed to pick it up for solid
three hundred dollars on BH photo this
is the zotac gtx 1066 gigabyte variant
and this is the mini version with this
card in your maxed out settings and
1080p over 60fps I've actually
benchmarked it a few times in my
previous builds I know this card can
deal with the beast especially
considering its form factor it's got a
single fan in a very very small profile
for storage we're going with a simple
120 gigabyte SSD from crucial this costs
$43 and we're pretty much gonna throw on
the OS on here and all the games and if
20 wants to add an extra hard drive or
an m2 later down the line he can do so
but for it to keep things simple we're
gonna start off with a 120 gigabyte SSD
powering everything up is the EVGA 500
watt power supply which is 80 plus
certified I picked this up for $35 and
it has plenty of juice to power any
future upgrades that Tony wants to do
for example he wants to upgrade a CPU to
an 8 core or update the GPU to a 1080 TI
even if it wants to overclock those the
EVGA 500 watt will give them plenty of
power to do so
let's face it the stock PSU cables
aren't hideous and I didn't want to
place my order and spend extra money on
premium cables from cable mod or those
companies so I actually picked these up
from Amazon for 32 dollars so these are
beautifully sleeved black and red cable
sleeves that are going to essentially
replace or cover
the nasty black power supply cables like
I said earlier guys we are focusing on
aesthetics as well not just the parts
inside the build last but not least the
case we're going with is none other than
the NZXT s340 this is the black and red
version and I picked this up for 60
bucks you can't go wrong building in an
s3 for he's always been my top five
cases to build in and in fact big red
was built inside this case at one point
so yeah it comes with pre-installed fans
in there unfortunately we're not going
on RGB if 20 wants to add RGB lights
later down the line or fans he can
easily swap those out so yeah this is
the case we're going with overall a
solid pick and tony was a huge fan of
the design as well so I'm actually gonna
hook Tony up because we are friends with
benefits that didn't sound right what I
mean by that is I'm gonna come up with
some extra stuff that I've laying around
so I'm gonna upgrade his PC with an m2
this is 240 gigabytes from a data we're
actually gonna put the eos on here for
him and I'm also gonna hook him up with
five terabytes of external storage from
Seagate so you can put your porn on here
whatever you want to do Tony you're
welcome
I almost forgot to mention the CD key I
spent $14 in the CD key which brings a
total up to nine hundred and fourteen
dollars with some sense you guys might
be wondering ed where the hell did you
get CD key for $14 the websites called s
CD key com I think I'm saying that right
and they're selling Windows 10 Pro
64-bit
for 14 dollars which is insane and this
is legit guys because I've actually
bought a CD key and I use it in big red
so I'll drop a link below if you guys
want to check that out and there's
actually a discount code if you guys
want to put in the code or list it on
the screen you'll get I think three
percent off which is like 40 cents or
something I know this counters a
discount but anyways check them out guys
if you want to so yeah with that said
I'm gonna shut up and put together the
PC so hope you guys enjoyed this montage
and at the end of it I'm gonna bring
Tony over get his reaction of the PC and
go over some benchmarks and stuff like
that so yeah let's begin
hi guys so I covered the entire setup
with a blanket he's outside I'm gonna
grab him right now
so excited so many months at welcome to
the office you I'm excited for you check
it out dude let's do this how long
that's like 10 years ago dude I'm
excited I'm shaking I'm shaking here we
go close your eyes okay well actually I
stay close oh yeah there we go there we
go three two one whoa dad is sexy is
this what you expected in your mind like
a Japanese really how so you'll be this
nice look can you tell how quiet it is
do you like how quiet it is I'm in here
anything like this is amazing
you've outdone yourself thank you that's
what I do came to the right place
alright man so it's walking to 2700 X
it's overclocked that actually to 4.1
gigahertz it's stable at one point three
seven five volts you have no idea what
I'm talking about it's actually for my
viewers out there it's also got eight
gigs of ram the zotac gtx 1066 gigabyte
graphics card and i made it nice and
pretty for you guys i mean a nice and
pretty for you with the custom cables
and the RGB fans so i want you to put
this to test drive man i want you to
test out a game i downloaded fortnight
for you let's bring you over a chair
how about this Tony if you get one kill
in this game actually not nice to me see
how about this Tony before you die you
get three kills operator GPU to a GTX
970 for this video a kills three kills
never played on never play on a PC it's
gonna be interesting challenge is I
don't know which button does what but
I'll figure it out so while you're
playing the game and we actually
benchmark the PC for you we played games
like pub G for tonight's even realm
Royal and Grand Theft Auto
oh no and max settings or very high
settings in all games you were getting
over 100 FPS and 1080p so is this PC can
pretty much handle anything you throw at
it that's the dream alright pick up your
name's gonna be bad so yeah how do I
pick up volume oh it's you it I can hear
some what's coming make it two kills
since I have no idea if anyone's near me
so Tony I also updated some parts in the
PC so the original by GT game II was a
thousand bucks right right
I swapped the 120 gigabyte SSD that you
had earlier which had this nasty silver
casing to the HyperX 1 which is 480
getting so not only did you get more
space okay but it looks better in the
bill because it got that black and red
colour scheme you're amazing
I also swap the I also added two extra
fans in there you can tell by the TS
logo on that it's kind of custom-made
Texas fan or they're from gamers storm
so what I did was I moved the two fans
that was inside the case already tyrunt
so now they're basically being used as
intake and I added those two extra fats
on there so better airflow overall for
your PC nice sorry I'm focused
I know surviving trying to figure out
the bus ass huh oh I see someone we got
someone okay let's do this
here we go I'm not worried you didn't
see you get closer oh my god oh no how
do I build oh my god Wow it is sensitive
Oh
Tory's aiming at you no know how to die
are you doing
da da da da I had a son I had a shot oh
my god
yeah there you go it's okay it's still
good enough
that's right so before you go Tony I'm
gonna show you a few things memorize
told you I threw in two extra fans you
can actually control those fans with
your smartphone so these are from gamers
storm and you can actually control it as
an app called MF control and click on it
not only can you control the speed of
your fans but you can even control the
lights so it's red right now
I'm can tap on blue because blue orange
white or anything on the the color wheel
which is pretty good and over here if
you click on the fan option you can
adjust the speed of your fan called
smart mode okay and you could put
powerful well except the fan speed
regular which is kind of medium or
silent which is what you were hearing
all the time a few other things before
you go I know your best buddy of mine
and Ben's best friend exactly for my
