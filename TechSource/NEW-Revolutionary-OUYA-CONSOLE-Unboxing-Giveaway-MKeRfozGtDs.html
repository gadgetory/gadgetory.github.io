another giveaway this is a new console
just released
it's called weeow so we're gonna do an
unboxing and a giveaway on this so let's
get started
so this is a gaming console pronounced
Booya and retails for $99 how this works
is you hook this up to your TV and you
can play games that are available from
the Android Market and there are even
games exclusively available only on the
ouya this video will only be a quick
unboxing and later we will put up a
review for the system and go over some
popular games on it all right so let's
take a look at the side of the box and
check out some specs this case is made
out of sandblasted aluminum and plastic
for the CPU they got NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad
core they have one gigabyte of memory
eight gigabytes of internal flash
storage which can be expanded if you use
your own flash drive it does support
Wi-Fi it has a USB 2.0 and a micro USB
port and this little guy even has an
HDMI port for 1080p quality all right so
let's get this unboxed so this console
is currently running Android 4.1 jelly
bean and what's so unique about this
system is that you can even create your
own games another great thing about this
system is that all games come with a
free demo so you can test it out before
purchasing it now with that being said
there are also games that are free but
have in-game purchases like coins and
such so when you open the box you get
something saying and so begins the
revolution I personally don't think it's
going to revolutionize anything but
moving on first up we got the controller
nothing fancy here as you can see it has
the basic functions like most
controllers it has the four trigger
buttons to being on each side it has two
analog sticks a d-pad four buttons on
the right side with each of them
spelling out the consoles name which is
pretty cool and honestly it all comes
down to comfort when designing a
controller now I don't know about you
guys but this does look a lot like the
Xbox controller if they position the
console button on the top it would be
identical moving right along we have the
console right here as you can see it's
small enough to fit right in your palm
making it really convenient to take it
anywhere you go and it's just so simple
to set up making it great for almost all
ages you have all your connections on
one side giving you an easy access to
set things up and this device actually
gets really hot just after an hour of
you so when you are playing with this
make sure it's in a wide open area where
it's nicely ventilated and this side
here is actually the side that faces the
ceiling with the power button being in
the middle
a quick tap turns it on while holding it
down turns it off and you can also use
the controller to do this okay back to
the unboxing there's actually more stuff
behind this in a secret compartment the
box being this small makes it really
convenient to carry it around wherever
you go so here you see the power cord
and honestly I'm not happy with the
length of it though they could have made
it just a bit longer but the person who
wins this will have to deal with it it
also comes with two double-a batteries
for the controller I wish they would
have made a chargeable but once again I
am NOT a designer and here they were
nice enough to include an HDMI cable
once again really short it could cause
problems for TVs that are mounted
against walls like - and last but not
least very down there you have some
warranty information on the ouya so make
sure you guys will quick where the
batteries on the controller go for those
wondering there are two face plates on
each side of the controller you have to
remove in order to gain access to the
battery tray despite how it looks it's
really easy to remove and it even comes
with these straps already installed
making it really easy to remove the
batteries and replacing them with new
ones when the time comes overall I think
the OEO is a great system to have on the
side with its lightweight compact size
and so many games to choose from the
Android Market as well as the price
being only $99 this makes the ideal gift
I'm going to show you guys a few popular
demos real quick just so you can get an
idea of how the games look on this
console so this first game is called the
boards and as a survival game where
you're basically the spaceship trying to
survive and your weapon is music you
lose once the green health bar is
completely gone and it's really
what an amazing it sounds better so this
next one is called chrono blade and it's
like a cross between Diablo 3 in God of
War you have your health and mana bars
and you use combos to take down waves of
enemies I enjoyed cleaning this one
actually was pretty fun so does last one
it's called vector and it's a parkour
inspired game it's really fun and
throughout the game your lot more levels
and stunts and it gets just a lot more
interesting so that's it for the
unboxing thank you guys so much for
