source and I am back with part 2 of our
$600 budget gaming PC build if you guys
haven't seen part one then here is the
link to that video where we go through
every part that we selected so in this
video we will be running benchmarks and
playing some intense games to see how
well our PC performs we are also going
to be giving this PC away to one lucky
subscriber so stay tuned for the
instructions so let's start off the
video with the benchmarks the first
being Cinebench with an FPS score of
eighty four point ninety two and a cpu
score of 419 now keep in mind that this
CPU is not overclocked and as I
mentioned before in the previous video
you can overclock it up to four point
one via Hertz if you like although I do
strongly recommend you getting an
aftermarket cooler if you choose to go
that route next up we got Nova bench
with an overall score of 1290 with GPU
and CPU scores slightly above 500 and to
give you guys a better idea of what to
compare the scores to a GTX Titan gets
an average of 1650 for the graphics test
last but not least we had to run 3d mark
specifically the firestrike benchmark
seeing as that is one of the best
benchmarks currently available
especially for gaming so we've got a
score of 37 39 and for the parts we
chose this is actually an impressive
score but enough about the benchmarks
let's go ahead and check out the
gameplay alright first up we got Batman
Arkham origins we played it both on max
settings and regular settings to give
you guys a better idea of the pcs
performance so for max settings the CPU
and GPU both reached 58 degrees Celsius
and for regular settings we have
slightly less temperatures with the CPU
being at 39 Celsius and the GPU being at
46 moving on to the FPS the game's FPS
actually fluctuates depending on what
you're doing and we kind of broke it
down to give you guys a much better idea
here are the differences in FPS on high
and regular settings so for normal
combat situations using gadgets and
warming around we get an average of 48
FPS on max settings compared to 60 FPS
on regular moving to intense fighting
scenes and cinematic shots we get
average of 33 FPS on max settings
compared to 60 fps once again for
regular so overall the average FPS comes
the
to 40.5 for mac settings and 60 on
regular next game we tested was Metro
last light so here are the temperatures
for running the game on normal and max
settings keep in mind that we tested
these one hour apart while the PC was
off so we can get accurate readings on
normal settings the CPU reached 57
degrees Celsius while I've maxed it only
increased by 2 degrees GPU OIS we got
readings at 47 degrees on normal and 49
and max settings so really not much of a
difference there when it comes to
temperatures moving on to frames per
second we got a surprisingly low 11 FPS
on max settings just from moving around
without any action going on which is
completely unplayable and switching it
back to regular we jumped up to 60fps
without any problems for intense
situations where there is a lot of
shooting and combat the FPS drops to 5
on max settings and on regular it dips
down to 26 so the average FPS on Metro
last light is 8 on max settings and 43
on regular needless to say he you should
probably keep this game on regular
settings if you want to enjoy playing it
the last game we played was titanfall
and we got some pretty impressive
numbers on normal settings the CPU was
at a steady 54 degrees and it bumped up
to 55 when we switched it to max
settings GPU is we got a reading of 50
degrees on normal whereas on max
settings it jumped up to 53 so once
again no major difference is there when
it comes to temperatures moving on to
frames per second we got a steady 50 FPS
on max settings for normal situations
for example basic combat running around
the map and even wall running but
switching the game to regular we capped
at a steady 60fps now for intense
situations and titanfall battles the
game dip down to a cost and 44 FPS on
max settings and taking it down a notch
to regular settings we get a constant 50
FPS for the same situations which brings
the overall FPS for max settings 247 and
regular settings 255 so overall this PC
does exceptionally well for its price
tag although you won't be able to run
most games on max settings it will
certainly get you 60 FPS on regular or
even sometimes low settings for most
games so that wraps up this video I want
