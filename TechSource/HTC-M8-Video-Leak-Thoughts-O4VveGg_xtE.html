Texas and apparently there's a leaked
video of the brand new HTC I'm a going
around on YouTube so we decided to take
a look at it and give you guys our first
impressions so the first thing we can
see in this video is the size difference
between the HTC One and the m8 the MA
definitely looks a bit taller however
the width still looks the same the front
still sports boom son with stereo
speakers but what's odd to me is that I
notice the top speakers are not the same
size as the bottom ones I'm sure this
does not affect loudness of the top
speakers but it does affect the way the
phone looks to me I mean call it OCD but
I like it when things are symmetrical we
can also see that HTC has moved the
sensors to the left of the front facing
camera taking a look at the back you can
see the all new brush design as well as
the rumored second camera the uploader
did not go into detail on what the
second camera is going to be used for
but leaks have suggested that HTC could
be utilizing a new refocused technology
where the user can focus on a different
part of picture after the picture has
been taken and on the back we can also
see dual LED flashes which should
provide better pictures when flash is
enabled the new brushed aluminum on the
back looks better than HTC One in my
opinion it gives the phone a more
premium look like it was made out of
fine metals one thing that I can already
tell that's going to annoy me is the
on-screen buttons I'm not saying that
the on-screen buttons are bad but the
way that HTC implemented them is
actually horrible they have kept a
useless black bar below the screen that
contains nothing but HTC logo and it
just doesn't make sense why HTC did not
use that space to make the screen bigger
or even make the phones footprint
smaller the size of the phone do look
thinner and a lot better than the HTC
One because it looks like they use the
same material for the back the HTC One
actually use the soft plastic material
that in my opinion took away from the
overall look of the phone the software
does not also look good as well there
are a lot of glitches and lack present
that we see in the video but I want to
worry about this too much because it's
not an actual retail model and most
likely as I'm finished software running
on it the new sense does look a lot more
refined and sure to stock Android but we
won't be able to really tell
until we get this phone and review
ourselves the uploader does compare the
speakers on the MA to the current HTC
One and from what we can tell they do
seem louder but now for the camera I
can't really speak much about this
except the camera software the uploader
does not properly show us what the
camera quality looks like on the new m8
in one word though the new UI for the
camera is simplistic there is a new menu
that shows all different modes that you
can choose from and there are a couple
modes here that we are not familiar with
just yet one of which is the new selfie
mode we have no idea why HTC included
this but maybe it takes a picture of the
user and automatically enhances it but
we will have to wait and see on that
there's also a dual capture mode which
like Samsung devices will use both front
and back facing cameras at the same time
to take a picture the user in the video
also says that the picture quality looks
better so we'll have to take his word
for now the overall phone seems to be
more curved which could be a good thing
offering a good feel in the hand so how
do we feel about this leak well if it is
real which it probably is then I've
definitely satisfied in my opinion the
overall design of the phone is improved
and probably will offer a better in hand
experience thanks to the curved nature
of the phone HTC sense does seem to be
improved as well but we will have to
take a closer look at that when we get
our hands on a retail version for a
review we can't speak on the camera nor
the speakers yet because we haven't used
the device but we are sure they will be
definite improvement over last year's
HTC One this video does not reveal
anything really new to us that the
previous leaks had not already but for
now as I said before I'm definitely
satisfied but I wanna know what you guys
think about that mate let us know in the
comments down below and make sure to
subscribe to get all the coverage on
this phone when it does get released
this is that from tech source and i will
see you next time
