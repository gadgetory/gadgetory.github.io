stores and welcome to the Azorean gaming
pc build and i wanted to build a monster
gaming pc for just 800 bucks and by the
looks of it I think I did a pretty good
job so I've been thinking about doing
one PC build every month from now on and
if that's something you guys want to see
happen make sure to hit that like button
that way I know to keep going but
anyways without wasting any more time
let's go in and start this video
okay so I went with the i-5 4590
quad-core CPU because the performance
you get from Intel processors are just
amazing they are especially great for
gaming if you don't mind paying a little
bit more for this bill to work I had to
get a quad-core Haswell chip which will
be able to handle any game out there I
was also able to overclock the CPU to
3.5 gigahertz which is pretty good
considering that I don't have liquid
cooling for the graphics card I went
with the Sapphire Radeon r9 290
overclocked version and it features a
four gigabyte memory a clock speed of 50
200 megahertz a single HDMI and
DisplayPort along with triple fans pair
this baby with the i5 4590 and you have
yourself a solid gaming PC for RAM I
went with two four gigabyte g.skill
sticks with 16 megahertz memory speed
and winning these in dual channel mode
ensures you get optimal read and write
speeds it's also plenty of RAM for
basically any game out there keeping all
the parts together is the ACE rock z97
anniversary motherboard it can support
up to fifth generation intel i7
processors and 32 gigabytes of RAM with
3100 memory speed
it also features six SATA ports and six
USB ports because I wanted to keep the
budget at the $800 mark I had to ditch
the SSD and get a terabyte hard drive
from Western Digital there should be
plenty of space for most people and if
it isn't you can definitely add more if
you choose to to power up the Azorean I
went with a corsair 500 watt modular
power supply this build really only
needs about 350 watts of power to one
but I figured 500 is a good amount for
future proofing any additional upgrades
I also went with a modular PSU to make
cable management a lot easier and if you
guys want to save a few bucks you can go
with a non modular version which I'll
also link below finally I went with a
corsair 300r ATX mid tower case you do
have the option to get a clear side
panel however I opted for the all-black
panel it features two USB 3.0 ports an
audio and microphone port along with the
power buttons all located on the front
of the case for easy access and it has
plenty of clearance inside for even the
biggest of graphics cards so how does
the PC perform for gaming and benchmarks
well that actually performs better than
the neutron 2.0 from Austin
his channel he did an $800 gaming PC
last month and while this PC actually
does a lot better for the same price
point but I'll let you guys check out
the results for yourself
so before we jump into the gaming and
benchmarks here are the actual specs of
the PC and the clock speed you can see
that it's running at a stable 3.5
gigahertz the motherboard temps are
averaging around 37 degrees Celsius
which is similar to all four cores on
the CPU as well and if you look on the
bottom you can find a graphics card
temperature as well which is currently
at 43 degrees Celsius so overall really
cool temperatures across the board
starting off the benchmarks we have the
popular Cinebench r15 which is used to
test the CPU and graphics card
performance skipping to the end we have
an FPS score of 111 point seven and a
CPU score of 521 and you can compare
this score with your own PC to see where
it stands if you're interested now
moving to a more popular test for gaming
PC's we have the 3d mark 11 fire strike
benchmark Azorean scored an 85 34 which
is 83% better than all the results and
you can see how high ranks up compared
to other high-end gaming pcs so I really
got a solid score now let's take a look
at gaming with some of the most popular
graphic intensive games like GTA 5 I run
the benchmark test on this game and
receive this score of 94 point 5 frames
per second on normal settings but here's
the actual gameplay with the frame
counter on the top left
for biofuel for and managed to pick up
an average frame rate count of 69 point
five on high settings
for Metro last light on high settings I
was able to get an average of sixty five
point five frames per second
for Bioshock infinity on high settings
you get a very high one hundred ninety
seven point five times per second
last but not least we get a solid 130
frames per second for Diablo 3 at high
settings as well
so this PC can definitely handle graphic
intensive games with ease so if you guys
only have 800 bucks to drop on your next
PC this is definitely the one you want
to build anyways that's it for the video
thank you guys so much for watching if
this is something you want to see done
