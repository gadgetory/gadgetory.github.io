welcome to another episode of what's in
the box
AMD edition now as you guys can see the
setup is kind of different also the
lighting is very crappy and I apologize
I finally moved to my new location and
I'm shooting with a different camera by
the way so the quality may not be the
best I got the a 6500 right now and I
got the g7 up top which is my overhead
camera so if we kind of went back and
forth with the red raven anyway that's a
completely different story let's not get
sidetracked
so yeah I got some Vega samples as you
guys can see but Before we jump into
that of course I want open up some fan
mail and sitting in my storage room for
about two months now I've been very busy
with the move as you guys can probably
tell i've been unpacking things setting
things up ordering stuff is just been
chaos this past month also have a new
peel box by the way somewhere that's
very close to my home so the chatsworth
one is no longer valid so I'll have a
link below in case you guys want to send
some stuff and have it featured on
what's in the box
but anyways moving on to some fan mail
it's opening up real quick whoa I just
got a CPU what the heck I know you
already have a lot of RAM sticks so I
decided to send you this old CPU I found
I hope you like it
keep up the good content greetings from
Croatia
the question is email does the CPU even
work and what the hell is this exactly
it's an Intel Celeron 2.4 gigahertz if
it works maybe I'll do a PC build who
knows around 2 $300 but thank you email
for sending and the CPU this one feels
like a t-shirt yep if steel skill is
whoa the lighting is so bad right now I
apologize you guys this let its setting
down right now this is literally the
worst time to shoot a video here at the
office because I can turn on my studio
lights so yeah I have no choice I got to
make this video now because I got to get
these things out of the boxes and start
benchmarking it because the NBA releases
in two days
gotta get these videos ready for Monday
my name is Jason I'm 26 and I live in
Montana about two years ago I started
planning my build for my first ever
gaming computer I watched depend on your
videos this brings me to the t-shirt
enclosed I have been working on my brand
tuxedo flamingo that's an interesting
name over the last few months there are
tons of people that know me by my build
style but I'm trying to get my name out
there more so this dude's name is tuxedo
flamingo apparently he does some pretty
cool custom loops and he has his own
brand and logo which is a flamingo when
I took seed oh how interesting thank you
Jason for sending this in and the
t-shirt as well best of luck on your new
brand I hope it works out thank you
again for sending it in
so the next one is from Office Depot or
Office Max or even the same company I
don't even know anyways it's just at
address to source tech I don't know if
that's a troll or an honest mistake
because I don't know how hard is it to
mess up tech stores to be honest I think
it's a troll but pretty funny so okay
this is just the catalog for Office
Depot does Office Depot watch me Loki if
you guys are watching I want to sponsor
an episode of setup makeover hit me up
one more box and then we're moving on to
AMD stuff I promise this one is also fan
mail I don't know what on earth this can
possibly be maybe a painting or it's too
light to be a skateboard I don't know
check it out so this is please don't cut
bubble wrap off just be careful for
what's in the box episode this literally
is shaped like a skateboard what the
heck is this
I know you said don't cut the bubble
wrap off but I got to get the tape off
somehow
whoa what what is this it's like a black
and red skateboard top board
what is this cleaning call that even
though it's got my tech stores logo
although it's missing the outline that
still looks pretty dope and one of my
previous drafts of my logo that looks
pretty sick and I've been watching you
and your videos for the past year or so
now I watch every video you post I
especially love your setup or series
which inspired me to make my own badass
setup which I'll be submitting for an
episode in the coming weeks and what's
in the box so I made you a game of
Thrones slash tech stories board it's
not perfect but I put a lot of work into
it I don't know if I know how to ride
one but to be honest I would be honored
if you'd hang it on your wall that's
what I would do
keep doing what you're doing and I can't
wait to see the what's in the box
episode where you open this Thank You
Nathan Pollock Nathan to lock honestly
dude boom follow me right now I had no
idea this was Game of Thrones as well I
don't really see oh I was forgot it here
is the three-headed dragon whoa this is
the Targaryen House Targaryen logo I'm
guessing that's what that is I was kind
of questioning why it was Game of
Thrones as well that is freakin sick
dude latching on there's nicely done
you've been watching my videos for a
long time because I only mentioned that
a few times I represent House Targaryen
so props on that Nathan see you're the
best you are awesome thank you so much
for setting this in I will find a way to
put this somewhere and my setup may be
when I'm working on my setup tour
I'll have this in the background
somewhere so you see though this is
amazing thank you so much for setting
this and it's a shame I don't like
skateboard then again I wouldn't dare
damage something this beautiful so this
is definitely a work of art stand out
Hank I rather hang this and step on it
and write it thank you again dude all
right there's no more fan mail now it's
time for the amv stuff which I'm sure a
lot of you guys are here for so actually
remove the box from this one but I
didn't take it out of its packaging I
left it just like this for this video
all of the stuff is under NDA
unfortunately I cannot talk about specs
can't talk about pricing I cannot talk
about anything the only thing I can do
is show you guys the actual product and
the actual boxing unboxing and also this
is not the retail packaging guys so the
stuff is clean here are just press
samples so don't expect this to be
retail packaging anyways so yeah I don't
expect any packaging like this if you
were to buy it from a store but anyways
it's open stuff so I believe this one is
the rx 64 you can see the Radeon rx Day
your logo over here looks like there is
a flap of pop this open there is a tiny
brochure what does it say
until now game developers have been
shackled by hardware limitations unable
to witness the full extent of their
imagination a lot of hype in this Vegas
stuff guys
oh wow this is very clean what the heck
is this like a glass cube this looks
pretty sick I'm not going to I go to but
also if there was like a tech stores
logo engraved on here that have been
really sweet to put on my desk I don't
know exactly what that is inside but it
looks freaking awesome the way they did
that I don't know if you guys can tell
through the video but there's something
inside that represents the video logo
you go see Intel coming up a packaging
like this do you guys need to step up
your game out there so we've got a wrist
strap in here Radeon rx Vega we got some
screws and I don't know if this is a
real working GPU chip but they've
included like a mock-up or a model of it
inside here that is pretty cool no I
think this is definitely a model this is
not working
put this aside check out the rest of the
stuff and the GPU itself which is
surprisingly heavy actually wow this is
nice a lot of you guys know that I
wasn't a fan of the original GPU
reference designs it was very bland and
just wasn't a fan of it but this this I
like very sleek very clean design so
there you have it guys this is the RX
Vega
64 water-cooled the GPU so it's not
supposed to compete against the GTX 10-7
a and as always make sure you guys stick
around because you will see my
benchmarks on these alright next up is
another AMD sample or one that was this
one might be Oh Moo yeah
and speaking of old reference design it
is the same design which I said before
I'm not a fan of but not about how looks
about how it performs so and as always I
will be putting this to the benchmarks
right alongside the rx 64 I'll be
comparing it against the gtx 1070 to
1080 and as well as the 1060 and bring
you guys full coverage on those as well
so make sure you subscribe to the
channel if you aren't already I also
want to ask you guys what type of
content other than benchmark support
that you want to see done with these two
GPUs do you want a super high end build
or do you want a balanced mid-range
build let me know in the comments
section what you guys want to see done
all right let's not mess around with
this so aside from the GPU I did get
some hardware to help me with the build
this first one is from MSI I believe
let's see what they sent me so the first
one is the cooler master 240 looks like
it's their new CPU cooler that supports
the am 4 socket surprisingly this
doesn't come with thermal paste applied
so I'm assuming that they're going to
supply you guys good guy cooler master
looks like this did supply you guys with
thermal paste so that's always cool so
yeah the cooler master 240 millimeter a
IO cool are very excited to use this of
one of my AMD build coming up on the
channel so make sure you guys stick
around for that
speaking of AMD build guys a lot of you
were wondering why you didn't see any
thread Ripper coverage on taxes the real
reason was I didn't get any samples
I've been awake every night since then
contemplating wondering why
why did I am me not send me any driver
for samples
it's something I said they might have
good enough what is it that I don't have
that other much smaller channels do does
mainly question the choices I've made
please and
tell me
I thought we were friends
[Laughter]
I guess I was a bit night
I knew all along who my true friends
really are
Thank You Andy but it's time to finally
move on
all jokes aside I am not mad at AMD this
I was just joking guys they did send me
all my biggest samples so obviously I'm
grateful for that so thank you so much I
will just kind of confused at one point
why other channels got it not me but
it's all good in the hood
I will try and get my hands on threader
for samples even though it's going to be
late
because I do want to do some builds with
the 1950 ex and I know a lot of you guys
have been asking me that specifically so
I will give you guys what you want just
give me some time to get a hold of some
samples as they come in final package is
also from AMD again thank you guys so
much
oh I did not even know they were sending
me this one so guys this is a 27 inch 4k
gaming monitor from viewsonic holy moly
it could be a lot of work to open this
one up so I'm just going to leave this
one closed for now I'll drop a link to
it though down below in case you guys
want to check it out so apparently this
has Ultra HD IPS panel and it's got AMD
freesync so that's one of the reasons
why they sent this to me is that I can
do my benchmarks on it very excited to
check this monitor out though with a 4k
display from viewsonic Wow so that is it
for the video I hope you guys enjoyed it
if you drum that what's in the box
videos make sure to leave a like to show
your support and if you guys didn't like
it feel free to dislike as well that is
cool too huge thanks to a and B for
sending is then I have a lot of work to
do this weekend apparently also huge
thanks to Nathan for sending the frickin
skateboard thing that's taken to sake so
I got to figure out a place to put that
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
and let me know again guys in the
comment section what you want to see
done with these two GPUs which want to
build which one do you want to see a
build with VR x64 or the rx 54 but that
will do it for this video as always
anything mentioned in this video will be
linked below if it's available of course
I will see you with an excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
