again to LastPass for sponsoring this
video to learn more click on the link
below so I was shopping around to find a
mechanical keyboard to do a video on and
this one caught my attention for several
reasons
the price the rating and the design it
just looks like a really cool keyboard
and judging by the reviews I thought hey
maybe you guys might be interested in as
well I did accidentally buy an extra one
and instead of sending it back I'm just
gonna do a giveaway on it so if you guys
are interested all you have to do is
drop a like and leave a comment below on
what your favorite part about the
keyboard was I'll pick a winner next
week and I'll announce it on my Twitter
account and yes this is worldwide so the
keyboard is currently going for $60 in
Amazon and it comes equipped with Hawaa
no switches they're basically equivalent
to Cherry MX blues by no means am i a
switch expert guys I cannot tell the
difference between these and actual
Cherry MX blues all I know is that they
both sound and feel the same to me
people online say that the hano switches
are slightly heavier to press than
Cherry's which is actually true because
they have an actuation force of around
60 grams you still get that satisfying
click and the tactile bump that you
expect from Cherry blue is while typing
I personally don't like blue switches
I'm not a fan of the tactile feedback
and how loud they get while typing or
gaming my preferred choice is always
Cherry MX Reds as far as build quality
the et robot is built really well for
$60 I'm impressed that they were able to
use an aluminum frame for most of the
keyboard in fact the only plastic piece
is the back cover
there's no noticeable flex anywhere on
the keyboard nor is there any bowing in
the center overall very solid
construction and it's pretty hefty - I
know let's talk about the keys so this
is a full-size 104 key anti-ghosting
keyboard with a Windows lock and a full
numpad the keys are nicely spaced and
have a concave shape to it which helps
identify the center of the key that way
you're not accidentally pressing other
keys I also didn't notice any noticeable
wobbling on any of the keys once again
solid construction as far as the font
I'm not a fan of it to be honest they're
nice and big which is great but it looks
like something out of a sci-fi movie
some of the keys are harder to read like
the letter B and the number 6 which to
me looks like the letter G the keyboard
does come with media controls however
they are hidden which is kind of
annoying you have to actually look in
the manual to figure out which keys do
what for example holding a function key
and pressing f8 will skip track and the
f7 pauses and plays sometimes I would
forget which key does what so
accidentally press the wrong key and
instead of pausing or playing it skips
to the next track which I find kind of
annoying
what I would I prefer to see is text on
the side of the key labeling what each
key does while holding down the function
I don't think it's gonna be a
deal-breaker for most people however I
guess it's a lot better than not having
any function keys at all sadly the
keyboard does not come with a wrist rest
nor do you get any extra key caps
instead you will find a key removable
tool and two extra switches in case you
need to replace some speaking of
replacement you can actually hot-swap
this entire board judging by one of the
reviews left on Amazon for this keyboard
so if you guys are not a fan of the blue
equivalent switches then you can swap
them out with the ones you prefer on the
bottom of the keyboard you'll find the
standard rubber feet
and legs that give you a bit of tilt
another thing I don't really like about
the keyboard is the cable running
straight from the center of it it's
actually more of a nitpick than anything
really
I much prefer keyboards with the cable
coming out from the center because I do
like to route the cable straight
underneath my desk for a much cleaner
look but unfortunately what this
keyboard I'm not able to do that finally
let's talk about the lighting which I
think is the main selling point of this
keyboard I do want to start off by
saying that the RGB lighting on this
keyboard is on par with other high-end
keyboards like courser and razer which
is crazy considering it's only $60 aside
from the keys being backlit there's an
ambient light that wraps around the
keyboard from side to side which i think
looks really cool the keyboard has 18
backlit lighting modes and 9 ambient
light modes you can control the color of
the lighting with the function and the
right arrow and the brightness with the
up and down arrows and the left arrow
controls the direction of the lighting
to control the effects you have to use
the function and any of the six keys
above the arrow keys the plus and minus
buttons control the speed of the
lighting and finally to control the
ambient lighting around the size of the
keyboard you have to use the Print
Screen key if you guys want to see all
the RGB effects that the keyboard can do
I actually made a separate video going
through every single lighting effect
with this keyboard so check out the
video if anyone is interested I mean it
doesn't have a wrist rest and the
function keys aren't visible but hey um
does this keyboard kick ass and pretty
much everything else this is honestly
the perfect keyboard for anyone that's
looking for a solid RGB Mac keyboard -
the high premium price that they would
have to pay for it I just wish they had
a white version of this keyboard which I
think would look way cooler and a penny
much wraps up my review of the et robot
keyboard if you guys enjoyed it and want
to see more types of keyboard videos on

always and don't forget to comment below
on what your favorite part about this
keyboard was if you want to enter for a
