this episode more about it later in the
video what's up guys it's a from tech
source and as the holidays get closer
and closer it's my job to help you guys
out on some gift ideas
so can we focusing on gaming tech under
$25 because a lot of us are on a budget
for the holiday season everything
mentioned in this video will be linked
below so with that said let's start off
with the best mechanical keyboard under
$25 actually this is the only mechanical
gaming keyboard under $25 and it's from
Aki
it's an 87 ki mechanical keyboard with
blue switches and it's the perfect gift
for any gamer out there while it may not
have RGB lights or a 10 ki numpad it's
still the best choice out there for less
than $25 you can't have a keyboard
without a mouse and what I recommend is
the her LEF 300 which is a 5000 dpi
Mouse with an optical sensor and RGB
lighting the fact that you can customize
the lights using their software is
pretty awesome because no other Mouse in
this price range offers that level of
customization there's a dedicated dpi
button up top along with a button to
cycle through the colors and this is
actually the mouse that end up being my
favorite one out of the top 5 mice under
$25 video so in case you guys are
looking at other options I'll link that
video below rounding up the gaming
peripherals we got the gqo gaming
headset this is the USB gaming headset
with a built-in microphone which has a
flexible arm these are also really light
after a few minutes of wearing them you
will forget that they are on your head
the microphone quality on this gaming
headset is surprisingly good and there's
no editing done to this by the way this
is what it sounds like in fact it's
actually a lot better than some gaming
headsets that cost around 50 bucks it's
also very comfortable with padded
cushions and they are large enough so
that it covers the entire ear but don't
expect any noise isolation because you
can pretty much hear everything around
you clearly the only downside is that
you can't adjust the height of the
headband
instead the headset adjusts itself
because the padding for the headband
stretches out as you wear it this next
item is something I actually bought for
myself and decided to include it in this
video because it's an awesome
piece of tech so this is a headphone
hanger but it also doubles as a charging
dock and a cable holder so in addition
to hanging your headphones on here you
can also hook up your charging cables or
anything similar you can also charge
your headphones or other accessories by
using either of the three USB ports
which is super convenient I'm currently
using the Bluetooth headphones and the
Mophie ninja's which are both
battery-powered
so it's nice to be able to juice them up
while they're not being used it comes
with an extra adhesive tape and three
cable management clips to help you route
the power cable underneath a desk now if
you don't want to use a 3m tape you can
actually use the two screws that it
comes with and drill it to any surface
you want you're definitely gonna see
this a few more times on the channel
because I absolutely love it and I
highly recommend it for anyone with
multiple headphones you can actually use
those ports to charge your smartphone
power banks and other accessories
they're not only for headphones speaking
of cable management this is something I
know you guys are gonna like assuming
that you haven't heard of it by now so
this is the magnetic cable organizer
from the case you get three tiny cable
clips which are magnetic and each one
has a specific length that it can fit so
this here is my charging station in my
studio where everything gets juiced up
and ready to go I attach the magnetic
clips to the side and hooked up a
microUSB cable so whenever I need to
charge my devices I simply grab it from
the base and hook it up to my device the
magnetic feature is really convenient
and I strongly recommend this to anyone
trying to improve their cable management
game next up is a laptop bag that I've
been using for the past six months now I
recently switched to the ghost tech one
which I did a video on but Powerbank
actually fell off after a few weeks of
use so I decided to go back to the cool
Bell bag it's a really nice looking
messenger bag that can fit up to a 15
point five inch laptop it's got a front
zipper near the side and two additional
horizontal pockets one in the front and
one in the back the middle compartment
is where you can store your laptop and
it also comes with two pouches what I
like about the cool Bell bag is that it
comes with a detachable strap so you
guys can decide whether you just want to
carry it using the handle or strap it
around your shoulder but the most
convenient feature for me personally is
the luggage strap in the
I absolutely love this because I travel
a lot with a carry-on so being able to
hook this up to my luggage is very
convenient for me I personally love the
gray color but they do have a few
different colors to choose from and
actually at the time I did pick this up
for $20 on sales so it might be a little
higher this time around but regardless
it's an awesome messenger bag which is
why I'm recommending it last but not
least we have a vertical stand for the
ps4 pro so this comes with a cooling fan
and it adds two additional USB ports for
a total of four the cooling fan won't
give you extra performance but it will
keep the temps down on your ps4
prolonging the life of the hardware
inside it also comes at two charging
docks for the controllers and I think
it's a cool piece of tech to clean up
your console station-keeping guys a
place to store your ps4 and controllers
what's cool about the vertical stand is
that it will let you know when your
controllers are fully charged via the
LED indicator down below this one is
made for the ps4 pro specifically but
they do have one for the slim and for
the regular PlayStation 4 as well which
I will link below that pretty much wraps
up this video if it was very helpful to
you guys dropping a like would be
awesome but if you guys didn't like it
feel free to dislike as well and please
let me know your constructive criticism
in the comments section below everything
mentioned in this video will be linked
below as well thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
one have you guys ever wondered who your
ancestors are well check this out guys
there's this company out there called
23andme who specializes in finding out
more about you literally 23andme was
named after the fact that the human DNA
is organized into 23 pairs of
chromosomes so they sent over one of
their saliva kits and sponsor this
episode and all I have to do is spit in
this tube and send it over to their lab
so that they can test it out and break
down my DNA the cool thing about this is
once you get the results back you will
know more about your ancestry genetic
traits and even your health things like
how your DNA influences your facial
features hair taste preferences sleep
quality and more your 23andme results
can help you grow even closer to your
family by learning more about the
genetic connections you share with them
for example I'm actually curious to find
out if my mom has the same taste
preferences as I do I do encourage you
guys to do this with me or if you just
want to help support the channel
then head on over to 23andme comm slash
tech source and pick up a kit for you
and your family today I will be showing
my results with you in another video so
