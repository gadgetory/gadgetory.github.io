welcome to my second budget build for
the month of December and in case you
guys missed it I am building one for MD
and now I'm building one for Intel these
are both sub $700 gaming pcs if you're
in the market of building a gaming PC
because you want the game over 60 fps
and 1080p and these are the two bills
that you need to focus on right now the
$700 Intel build or the $615 rising
build I can safely say that you can't
get anything else that performs better
within this price range
I'm also gonna be doing a build guide
for this PC and I'll be going over
everything step by step and show you how
easy it is to build this PC it is a
beginner guide for noobs and I'm gonna
show you how to install Windows download
the drivers and even how to overclock
your GPU so make sure you guys hit that
notification button so you don't miss
out all right so this PC is gonna cost
you a little under $700 at the time of
making this video if the price has
changed by the time you're watching it I
will leave alternative links below so
that you don't end up paying more than
$700 and still get the same performance
the processor I went with is the i3 8100
which is a quad-core CPU that's locked
at 3.6 gigahertz and let me tell you
guys this CPU is a beast compared to the
Rison 1200 this is a coffee like chip so
unfortunately we do need a Z 370 board
because it's not backwards compatible
with any other board out there and right
now the most affordable z 370 board out
there is from msi coming in at $120 the
good thing is if you ever decide to
upgrade in the future to an unlocked
processor like these 80 600 K or even
the 8700 K then you don't have to worry
about getting a new board the RAM
selection was tricky because I had to
find the perfect Ram that will not only
fit within the budget but will also
provide extra performance when combined
with the processor the i3 8100 loves
fast memory in fact you can see up to 20
FPS difference between a 2400 and a 32
hundred megahertz rated Ram stick there
are multiple sources proving this
through benchmarks online and even I
tested it on myself and confirmed it
using the same RAM sticks from the Rison
build it's pretty crazy I did however
overclock the RAM all the way up to 36
hundred megahertz easily within the BIOS
the graphics card I decided to go with
was the GTX 1066 gigabyte
from ZOTAC for several reasons first off
it was the lowest price GPU at the time
giving you the best value for
performance it was going for only $240
compared to the $280 price tag of the
lowest priced rx 588 gigabyte variant I
also wanted access to GeForce experience
and gsync while still saving money at
the same time also after overclocking I
was able to push the boost clock to
2,000 megahertz let me repeat that for
you a steady 2,000 megahertz on the
boost clock and just for comparison the
highest average boost clock people can
reach on their RX 580 card is around
1500 megahertz this card is beast when
overclocked I was able to hit every game
over 60 fps and maxed or high settings
with the exception of ashes of the
singularity but more on the performance
later in this video storage is always
subjective so I stick with the usual one
terabyte hard drive from WD however you
can easily substitute this for a 240
gigabyte SSD or add more storage if you
wish and powering the build is a 430
watt power supply which is plenty for
this PC also I didn't have a 500 watt
power supply in stock if you're gonna be
building this PC I strongly recommend
going with the 500 watt power supply
from EVGA which actually costs even less
than the 430 watt power supply it even
has enough power for an 8700 K and a GTX
1080 both of them overclocked so if you
guys do decide to upgrade later down the
line you don't need to buy a bigger
power supply in theory your PC will only
use up to 450 watts and that's with an
overclocked CPU and GPU with an extra
SSD as well again just to clarify I'm
using a for your 30 watt power supply
because that is all I had the 500 watt
power supply went into the rising build
the case I'm using for Blue Lotus is the
Roseville now Tillis which is a mid
tower chatzi's for only $25 guys this is
the best case out there hands down
within this price tag it has a clear
side panel it's got four USB ports on
top two of which are USB 3 it also comes
with pre-installed standoffs and to top
it all off it has two 120 millimeter
fans already pre-installed
it even has space for a lot of storage
you get up to three hard drive bays
which can also be used for SSDs
and additionally you get two extra
spaces for SSDs one near the top next to
the optical Bay and one more in the back
of the case it's a really nice case for
the unbelievable price however by the
time you're watching this the price will
most likely go up because a lot of you
will start buying it or maybe I picked
it up on sale and I wasn't aware of it
if the case is sold out all of the
prices no longer the same then I'll drop
a link to a few other alternative cases
under $30.00 that way you guys stick
within the budget temps were really good
on full low the CPU was peaking at 67
degrees and the GPU peaking at 84 and do
keep in mind that the GPU was
overclocked speaking of overclock like I
mentioned before I got the boost clock
to hit a steady 2,000 mega Hertz and
8808 megahertz on the memory clock it's
interesting because I used the same GPU
for the Rison build and I couldn't get
the same clock speeds
I guess the motherboard and the airflow
in the case make a huge difference the
PC is also quieter than the Rison build
four five track benchmark has scored a
little higher than the rising build at
ten thousand seven sixty one however it
was slightly slower when it came to
rendering which makes sense because of
the lower clock speeds I exported a
three-minute 5k read file in a little
over fifteen minutes
very impressive numbers when it came to
gaming I was blown away by how much
performance you can get for just seven
hundred dollars GPUs have come a long
way and it's awesome to see that we have
access to such powerful components that
are available to consumers who are on a
tight budget well over 60 fps and most
triple-a title games either in max or
high settings GTA 5 was running like
butter at a 135 EV PS average doom using
OpenGL and ultra settings was also
kicking ass as well over a hundred
frames per second destiny too was
pushing slightly over 100 FPS and small
areas that would jump over 120 fps and
other open areas or lots of action would
get you in the high 80s but overall
gameplay was very smooth without any
hiccups or stutter the most impressive
was pub G an average FPS of 81 on high
settings that is crazy to see on a
budget PC going into buildings would
push the FPS count over 90 and then wide
open spaces with action going on it
would hover in the mid 70s but either
way you are getting well over 60 fps and
a very smooth and I can't believe I'm
saying it an enjoyable experience hunt
pub G guys I can safely say that this is
the best budget gaming PC that I've ever
built on the channel for around $700
hands down and that is why I want to do
a build guide because there might be
people out there that want to build this
exact same machine and I want to show
you guys step-by-step on how to build
one especially since Christmas is around
the corner so make sure you guys have
notifications enabled because it is
dropping very very soon and I might even
do a giveaway actually on this you know
what let's do it let's do a giveaway
I'll actually build two more of these
and I'll give them away to three total
subscribers I did not even plan for this
it's literally just happening right now
so yeah guys I'll pick three random
people from the comment section I'll
announce the winners on December 24th
which is Christmas Eve on my Twitter
account so make sure you guys are
following me there you will have only 20
four hours to claim the prize this is
worldwide international so yeah that's
that dropping alike is not required but
it'll be awesome if you guys want to
show your support on the channel can't
believe I'm getting away PC three of
them okay anyways thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoy the video and
I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
