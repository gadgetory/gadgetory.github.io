tech source and in this video I'm gonna
be going over five of the best PC cases
that you can currently buy that's on
their 50 bucks whether you're building a
gaming PC or a productivity PC if you
guys want to save some money on your
next build you came to the right place
so without wasting any more time let's
begin so starting off the list at number
one is the deep cool tesseract mid tower
case that comes in at $36 this is an
excellent case for a budget
black-and-blue build since the front has
a blue accent and it comes with two 120
millimeter blue LED fans the case also
features one USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0
port near the front of the case and
comes with a clear side window option as
well as an all-black one the case also
has enough clearance to fit even the
biggest of graphics cards up to 310
millimeters in length
it also has 22 millimeters of clearance
for cable management which is really
nice to see in a budget case as far as
cooling is concerned that supports a
single 120 millimeter fan in the front
and another 120 millimeter fan in the
rear both of which are included with the
case you also get two additional 120
millimeter fan support for the side
panel and two more for the top
additionally you can put a 240
millimeter radiator on the top if you're
going with a liquid-cooled build this
next case is the cheapest one out of the
rest coming in at just 30 bucks if you
want an extremely low budget then the
Roseville FB m01 case is for you it
features two USB 2.0 ports in the front
and comes with two pre-installed fans an
80 millimeter rear fan and a 120
millimeter one in the front but you can
easily replace the rear fan with a 120
millimeter version if you choose to it
doesn't have a clear side panel option
or even offer space for a cable
management or even additional cooling
but what it does offer is a compact and
affordable case for budget builds so if
you guys aren't planning on expanding
and want to spend more money on better
components like graphics cards and CPUs
then this case has your name on it next
up we have a pretty badass looking case
from raid max this is the vortex v4
series mid tower case it comes in at $40
and has three
color options that include orange yellow
and blue features one USB 3.0 and one
USB 2.0 port in the front and comes with
a clear side panel the case also comes
with a 120 millimeter rear fan and
supports additional 120 millimeter fans
for the top and two more in the front
along with a 120 millimeter radiator for
the back in terms of clearance the 2.5
inch drive bays can be removed to
support long video cards from 12 to 15
inches in length the vortex v4 case also
has space between the motherboard and
the side panel for cable management and
honestly for $40 you get a really solid
and good-looking mid tower case this
next case is the one I use for the
October's budget build this is the NZXT
source 210 tower it comes in at just $40
and it features two USB 2.0 ports in the
front and comes with a single 120
millimeter rear fan additionally it can
support two 120 millimeter fans for the
front the bottom and on a side panel as
well as two 120 millimeter fans for the
top or a single 140 millimeter fan on
top instead in terms of clearance it has
20 millimeters of space between the
motherboard and the side panel which
should help with cable management there
is also enough clearance to fit in a GPU
with a length of 230 millimeters with
the hard drive bays included and 330
millimetres without the bays if you're
looking for a solid good-looking white
tower for your next PC bill that costs
well under 50 bucks then you should
definitely check out the source 2 10
from NZXT they also have a black version
as well last but not least we have the
corsair Carbide series mid tower case
this comes in at $50 which is more than
the other cases featured in this video
but with that price to get one of the
best cases available anywhere for this
price range it features one USB 3.0 and
2.0 port in the front for easy access
and has room for two 140 or 120
millimeter fans for the front 2 120
millimeter fans for the top and a single
120 millimeter for the back the case
does come with a single 120 millimeter
red LED fan for the front but you can
replace that with any other colored LED
fan to match your theme the amount of
airflow you get in this case is amazing
and there's enough clearance for even
the biggest of graphics cards since
there are no drive bays that can
potentially get in the way the case also
has lots of openings for a very
clean wiring job but one thing I really
love about this case is the side panel
you get a huge window to show off the
components inside honestly if you have
50 bucks to spare I would definitely
dump it on this case especially if you
plan to upgrade in the near future the
carbide Series case has it all I do want
to give an honorable mention to the
popular cooler Master Elite 110 mini ITX
tower this case comes in at $40 and it's
perfect for anyone who wants to build an
extremely tiny and portable PC it
features two USB 3.0 ports and comes
with a 120 millimeter fan in the front
what options to add two more 80
millimeter fans on the sides in terms of
clearance that can support a single 120
millimeter radiator in the front and
it's big enough for GPUs with a length
of 210 millimeters it can also fit up to
3 HD DS or 4 SSDs if we're talking about
storage not much else to say if you guys
are going with a budget Mini ITX build
then this case needs to be on your list
now if you guys have an extra 10 dollars
and want more features and space for
cooling then you should check out the
Thermaltake core v1 as well but as I
