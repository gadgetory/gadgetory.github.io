welcome to my new series on the channel
level up my wig it's very similar to
setup makeover but instead of redoing
the entire set up I'm gonna be focusing
on upgrading the PC only I'm actually in
Boston Massachusetts right now visiting
Michael who has a gaming channel over
200,000 subscribers and apparently his
PC is in need of an upgrade I do want to
give a huge thanks to Samsung for
sponsoring this episode and sending over
their 97 the evil m2 SSD to help me
level up his rig alright let's go check
it out
hey how are you good to meet you - this
is Bob my cousin how's it going man good
to meet you yeah this is her does she
have a name
it carries over from me being a kid so
shadow is the car nigga very edgy very
edgy alright yeah you weren't kidding it
upgrade a bit of a mess in there Wow I
gotta ask you one question hard way have
you ever heard of an air duster I use my
mouth a lot
oh and do it and hope that works okay
yeah definitely needs an upgrade so they
call them right good I'm glad you agree
so what exactly do you use your PC for
basically it's it's my go to everything
for work so recording video streaming
editing video rendering out the the
video afterwards it just it never stops
work oh that was so speeding my John
24/7 yeah it's pretty much on 24/7 ok so
now does it handle and gaming for
example I'm guessing you play in 1080p
yep I play and record in 1080p if I'm
not recording at 1440 okay but even in
both it's been struggling when I'm not
recording I can go anywhere between
depending on the game 40 to 60 frames a
second once I flip on the recording
software that dips it sits down Wow is
it playable you would say wait while
screaming it's playable depending on the
game I have to be very picky and choosey
about what I'm playing oh but you prefer
obviously you my friend oh yeah I would
I want to be able to run this thing at
60 plus you know yeah of course that
yeah okay so Mike tell me how long does
it usually take for shadow to boot up I
mean if I was to average on this thing
on boot up time anywhere between one to
three minutes probably on average and
then one to three minutes yeah yeah
booting and then as far as the game
depending on the game anywhere between
thirty seconds to two minutes how much
it needs to bring up it makes sense why
you're keeping it on 24/7 yeah so has
there ever been a time where lag has
affected you at a very crucial moments
from winning a game or
to the next level yeah I'm sure there's
plenty of it on film as well from me
recording but yeah when I'm any any
multiplayer competitive shooter online
if the frames dip you're immediately not
gonna be accurate and I've died more
times than I can remember because I
haven't been able to pull off the
headshot that I was looking for at least
hit the guy because it's stuttering it's
being slow it's fighting me in every
turn Jesus sucks
yeah so I guess that's pretty much it
let me do my thing come on work my magic
I'm gonna bring you in afterwards and
finally we'll deal the PC hopefully
meets your standards I'm assuming well
thanks I appreciate it do this okay so I
pretty much all the parts I need to
level up Mike's wig we're gonna be
giving them a brand new CPU new
motherboard and some new RAM also gonna
be building inside in your case so long
cosmetic upgrades as well the icing on
the cake of course is the Samsung 97 the
Evo m2 SSD it's going to be a huge
upgrade compared to his current storage
device the nine seven evil offers speeds
up to thirty five hundred megabytes per
second read and twenty five hundred
right it's gonna allow Mike's PC to boot
faster and load up applications and
games faster as well it doesn't make
sense having a beast gaming PC like this
if you don't have the storage to
complement it you know you really
shouldn't cheap out on one of the most
important pieces of any PC but anyways
with that said I think it's time to
level up Mike's rig let's do it
I said a PCS finally done mike is
outside waiting on my grab a little
quick and see what he thinks of his new
rig three two one
what do you think you are a master of
your craft
it is gorgeous holy crap
I haven't said a pc look like this since
ever what did mean what the color scheme
it's beautiful dude black and red is
gorgeous more space that I've ever had
in a PC before I love the see-through
design
God it looks great nice so I know you
were using an older platform you were
still on ddr3 so we went and upgrade you
to something more recent we got you 267
GK skylake CPU which is using ddr4
memory and I expect actually the only
thing we didn't upgrade was the graphics
card and the power supply and you came
in 1080p that card is still a piece so
still gonna get the job done for you
awesome
we also updated your storage your PC is
now using the new Samsung 970 Evo m2 SSD
it's basically gonna run faster than
before and you also have faster read and
write speeds compared to before
according to the crystal disk mark that
we ran it's also gonna affect your
gaming experience let's say you're
playing a game and you got a load up a
map or let's say you finished a mission
and you got a move on to the next level
well the 970 bow is gonna help you load
a lot faster with those incredible
speeds compared to your previous storage
device that way you spend less time
waiting and more time gaming it's also
great for heavy workloads I know you
told me you're youtuber also and you do
editing as well
yeah but the PC is my main central
workforce man thing edits and renders
and takes care of everything so it's
perfect because the 97 Evo has this
thing called turbo write technology
which basically uses the correct buffer
size to speed up the read and write
speeds so it's perfect when transferring
large files or using applications such
as an editing software so your models
pretty much it what do you think dude
it's beautiful first thank you for
coming here and building this thing for
me I have never had a better-looking PC
in my life and a big thanks to Samsung
for the 970 Evo that thing is going to
change my workload drastically awesome
they will congratulations thank you very
much sheet thank you guys so much for
watching if you want to check out the 97
Evo I'll drop a link to it down below
and also drop a like if you guys want to
see more types of content like this let
me know what you guys think about this
PC also by leaving your feedback down
