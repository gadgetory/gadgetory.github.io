possible by Squarespace what is up you
guys welcome to the final video of the
Mac versus PC project it has been a
while since we posted a part one it has
been a very stressful process getting
this entire thing together the Mac Pro
got sold out so we had to wait a month
to get it and then really push back the
entire project and things got a bit
crazy we do have enough footage here to
show a clear winner though when it comes
to performance so let's start off by
running the benchmarks I won't go over
the specs of the pcs because we've
covered that on part 1 of the video
which you can find the link in the
description down below also keep in mind
that both the Mac Pro and the
workstation PC are the same price and
the purpose of this video is to
determine which PC performs the best for
the same price alright so we started off
with the benchmarks we ran Cinebench r15
for both computers and skipping straight
to the results it looks like the custom
PC got a score of 73 FPS with a cpu
score of 710 while the mac pro scoring a
bit higher getting a 79 FPS score and a
964 cpu so already it's doing a bit
better than the custom PC which has 8
cores compared to the Mac Pro with only
6 the next benchmark test we ran was
Nova bench and the custom PC scored a
1412 while the Mac Pro scored a 1919
while the RAM scores are relatively the
same the Mac Pro has a much higher score
when it comes to CPU GPU and even
Hardware tests like writing speeds which
is kind of odd because both pcs do have
PCIe flash storage so the Mac Pro
already wins on the benchmarks but how
do both pcs perform while using them for
actual work workstations are not gaming
PC's so their main purpose is to
actually get work done and I believe in
order to test abilities for both pcs we
need to have them render intense 3d
files well we were able to get 3ds max
for the PC version and render one of the
templates that arrived with the program
and it took a good 19 minutes to render
a 5 second scene unfortunately 3ds max
is not available for the Mac Pro we also
looked up alternatives like cinema for
Diann Maya and we just couldn't find a
premade template to use for the
comparison I feel really disappointed
actually seeing as this would have given
you guys a much better idea of how each
PC would perform I didn't want to end a
video which is running benchmark so I
figured some rendering is better than
none so I opened up Adobe Premiere Pro
on both PCs and using the same exact
settings for both I dragged three video
files into the program and rendered them
at the same time even though the Mac Pro
had less cores it finished five minutes
earlier than the custom PC and based on
the benchmarks and overall experience we
had with both computers for this past
month I have to say that the Mac Pro
wins hands down honestly I was never a
fan of the Mac Pro I always thought it
was an overpriced waste bin but after
the experience that I went with building
a custom PC and wanting you to drive her
problems and hiccups I came to the
conclusion that is just not worth it I
believe that it's not about the parts
but how well the parts work with each
other and the Mac Pro comes ready to use
with no installation needed not to
mention how quiet it really is when
doing work and all that is packed into
one elegant small design I honestly
thought that the custom PC which had two
more cores than the Mac Pro with equal
parts would perform much better but I
was obviously mistaken my final thoughts
the Mac Pro is definitely the best
choice when it comes down to
workstations there I said it
I'm glad I made this video because it
convinced me that I was wrong
I made this mainly to prove that the
custom PC would outperform the Mac Pro
but never was I so wrong anyways that is
it for the video let me know if you guys
agree or disagree with what I said I
will read all of your comments so
whatever is on your mind feel free to
leave them down below I want to hear
what you guys have to say about this
anyway this is Ed from tech source and
I'll catch you guys next time
so before I head out I want to thank the
people at Squarespace for making this
entire project possible Squarespace
makes it really easy to create your very
own website or online portfolio in fact
we create our own website text or TV
using Squarespace in less than a day and
it turned out exactly how we want it to
they have so many beautiful templates to
choose from to match your needs or you
can even start from scratch like we did
everything is drag-and-drop
you don't need to know anything about
coding at all and Squarespace really
cares about the design so all their
templates are extremely clean and allow
your content to be the focus of your
website what's also cool is that your
website even scales to look amazing on
mobile devices also starting from today
all Squarespace plans now support
commerce functionality which means that
you can sell products online no matter
which plan you choose the best part
about all of this is that is free to try
seriously guys go ahead and try it out
for 14 days and see if you like it all
you need is your name email and password
no credit card is required and if you
guys end up loving it which I'm sure you
will you can use the Kotex source 2 for
10% off they're already super low prices
this is that from tech source and I'll
see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
