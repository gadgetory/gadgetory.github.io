One m9 is sponsored by cell cashier comm
they compared iPhone prices on the
internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iPhone what's up
guys and welcome to another ultimate
camera comparison video this time we are
facing off the HTC One m9 against the
iPhone 6 plus but Before we jump into
some samples let's take a quick look at
their specs so the m9 has a twenty point
seven megapixel rear facing camera with
an aperture of 2.2 that can shoot up to
4k resolution at 30fps and the iPhone 6
plus has an 8 megapixel camera with an
aperture of 2.2 that can shoot only up
to 1080p at 60fps some notable camera
features on the 6 plus include digital
and optical image stabilization as well
as continuous autofocus unfortunately
the m9 has only digital image
stabilization but the m9 can also shoot
in slow-mo at 120 fps
whereas the 6 plus can shoot in 240 FPS
for front-facing cameras the m9 has a 4
megapixel camera that can shoot in 1080p
whereas the 1.2 megapixel camera on the
6 plus can only shoot in 720 all right
so that's it for the specs that sit back
relax and take a look at some samples I
hope you guys enjoy the video
what's up you guys it's ad from Texas
and this is the sound and stabilisation
test between the two phones that you see
on the screen also make sure to look at
the audio icon somewhere on the screen
and it will indicate which phone's audio
that is being used basically now all
phones are strapped on to one device and
they are secured so basically what you
are looking at is a fair and controlled
stabilization test also if you guys are
into these types of camera tests that
make sure hit that subscribe button
because there is a lot more coming soon
when it comes to auto focusing the six
plus does a fantastic job utilizing its
focus pixels feature to quickly detect
the object and focus right on it not
only is it super fast but it's also very
accurate the m9 doesn't have continuous
auto focus which is a bummer so you do
have to focus by touching the screen
which can get annoying really fast so
both phones honestly did a great job
during the day I have no complaints on
either phone the m9 does seem to have a
bit more contrast however which is
completely fine by me even indoor shots
are great on both phones exposure and
white balance are great however the m9
over exposes when targeting black
objects when it comes to selfies the m9
is the clear winner the 6 plus Pig looks
very washed out whereas the m9 takes
more rich and vibrant selfies switching
to night shots is where we have a
problem the m9 is just straight-up bad
there's just too much white noise and
blurriness everywhere even though both
phones have the same 2.2 aperture the m9
falls short in fact their flash is even
worse than last year's model
it completely over exposes the shot so
I'm have to give the point to the six
plus for low-light pictures for daylight
video both phones do a great job however
the focusing on the m9 tends to wander a
lot creating a very shaky viewing
experience the only advantage that the
m9 has for video is that you can film in
4k which means that there's a lot more
detail and more room to work with if you
do cropping Alice T would like to see
them stick to 1080p and add optical
image stabilization instead because
there's just too much shakiness in the
video and I feel that the 4k option is
useless to most people I will give a
point to the m9 however for having a
much louder and clearer audio when
recording for low-light video
performance the 6 plus takes a point
once again the m9 really suffers an
overall low-light performance and that
doesn't seem to have changed from that
last year's model there's a lot of white
noise and the image is just too dark
depending on the light source and you
really just don't want to use the m9 in
low-light situations at all so the final
verdict is well the 6 plus is your
obvious choice when it comes to overall
camera performance the only reason I
would pick the m9 over the 6 plus is if
I take a lot of selfies and photos
during the day now if you're a night owl
and love taking pictures the m9 is not
the phone for you I'm sorry to say
