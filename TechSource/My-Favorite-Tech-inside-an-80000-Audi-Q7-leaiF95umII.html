and this is the 2018 out eq7
I do want to give a huge thanks to outie
for sponsoring this video so this is the
2018 out eq7
a luxurious SUV that spackled a lot of
cool tech my first impressions when I
sat inside was wow it's actually very
comfortable it's spacious and look at
all these buttons it felt like a cockpit
inside a spaceship there's a lot of
subtle things about the q7 that I really
enjoyed like the sliding display on a
dashboard the LED accents throughout the
car and the head-up display which will
project information like speed and
navigation directly onto the windscreen
so that you don't have to constantly
look down or over at the display the q7
has several cameras and sensors around
the vehicle that are constantly being
used while you're on the road for safety
one of the examples is the traffic jam
Assist which can be activated next to
the cruise control lever it's not fully
automated but it does automatically
maintain a distance between the car in
front and it does this by either braking
or accelerating I feel like anyone who
lives in an area what a lot of traffic
would really appreciate traffic jam
assist as it does pretty much most of
the driving for you and since it's doing
the driving for you why not sit back and
enjoy a good massage I'm not even
kidding these seats come in with
built-in massagers you can pick from
several options and you can even control
the intensity my favorite by far is the
wave which starts from the lower back
and moves all the way up to your neck
area honestly I just can't see myself
sitting in a different car seats this is
I'm already used to it comfort is
obviously one of the things that the q7
does right driving this around for a
whole week I noticed how quiet and
smooth the ride was it handles turns
really nicely and the suspension can be
adjusted to accommodate the type of road
you're on setting it closer to the
ground is better for Canyon riding and
there's even an option for off-road
which raises the suspension all the way
up the q7 also comes with MMI touch
interface which has handwriting
recognition technology so instead of
selecting numbers or letters you can
simply write it down with your finger
and it will input the data it also helps
navigating through the map simply by
moving your finger
the touchpad you can also pinch it in
and out on the touchpad and it will zoom
in or out on the navigation screen the
virtual cockpit is also really cool it's
a fully digital twelve point three inch
instrument cluster that can be
customized to show basically anything
from performance to navigation details
already actually works at Nvidia and
they're using the new Tegra k1 GPU to
power their virtual cockpit one of the
things I really enjoyed on the q7 was
the top view camera as I mentioned
before the q7 has sensors and cameras
all around the car and it will switch to
the appropriate camera to help you
well there's even a top view option
which will combine all the cameras
together and you're able to see all
around the car from the top once again
I'm gonna give a huge thanks to out he
for sponsoring this video and I want to
ask you guys what was your favorite tech
from the q7 let me know by commenting
down below thanks for watching and as
always I'll see you in the next video
this feels so good I don't even want to
leave the car right now
like seriously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
