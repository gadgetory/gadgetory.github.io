welcome back to another build on the
channel today I'm gonna be building a
$500 budget PC to start gaming right now
whether you're coming straight from
console or maybe you want to get into PC
gaming because all your cool friends are
playing for tonight and apex legends the
cpu we're going with is the i3 8100 and
despite being a year and a half old this
quad core lock the CPU is still beast at
gaming compared to the 2200 G and the r3
1200 from a and B on stock the e100
performs much better in gaming and you
guys can check the full benchmarks in
this video that my friend Brian did from
tech yes city if you're interested the
motherboard we're going with is the
gigabyte h3 10 ma which supports a gen
processor so there's no need to flash
the BIOS and for RAM we are throwing in
8 gigs at 26 66 megahertz which is the
most that this board supports and to
keep the average FPS above 60 and 1080p
gaming we have to go with the rx 570
specifically the card from power color
to stay within the budget this is the
red dragon and it's going for around
$130 which is a solid deal this card is
beast when it comes to 1080p gaming and
it outperforms the GTX 1050 Ti and it
even cost less than the gtx 750ti so
that's interesting for storage we're
keeping it simple so one terabyte from
Seagate
and powering the entire build is whereas
the power suit is an EVGA 450 bronze
certified power supply and lastly
everything is going inside the clean
master box q 300 L from Coolermaster
it's a micro ATX case with an acrylic
side panel 2 USB 3 ports on the side and
an included 120 millimeter we are fan I
also like these cube designs on the mesh
filters for the top and front this case
only goes for $40.00 and it's perfect
for this budget build all-in-all this
build will cost you around $500 plus the
cost of the CD key which is around $15
you guys can actually buy it from SCT
comm and if you use my code you can get
an extra 10% off make sure to check the
link below if you guys don't want to
spend full price on a CD key now I want
to be clear guys this PC is not meant
for future expandability so if you guys
are planning
upgrading parts within the next year or
so this build is not for you it's
specifically for people that want the
best gaming performance right now around
$500 without the hassle of upgrading
parts or overclocking anything you just
slap on the parts and you get to go now
here's a better part list for both Intel
and AMD for people that want future
upgrade ability I'll drop a link for
those parts as well as the parts that
are going to be used in this build down
below if you guys want to check that out
but anyways what that said let's put
these parts together and see how well it
does in gaming
I first came csgo we are on maxed out
settings that looks like this time I'm
not playing with medium bots guys I am
playing with oh that was my apologies
fellow terrorists but ever played
against hard bots so I'm tired of
killing easy BOTS or medium bots so I'm
gonna try and test my skill alright Wow
yeah hard bots aren't that hard
apparently Wow my aim is so bad
Jesus you would think benchmarking csgo
so many times
that would be good at it well yeah frame
wise we're getting in the high hundreds
low 200s depending on where we're going
oh no I'm not gonna I'm gonna get this
oh why am I so bad yeah low to hundreds
high one hundred
oh my I should just stay away from
matchmaking honestly just stick to BOTS
that was so terrible anyways as I was
saying hi like so as I was saying
average FPS and the high hundreds low at
200 so then again this game can run on
pretty much any potato that's not really
surprising really well yeah fluid
gameplay no lagging no stuttering the
800 100 is kicking ass
oh oh my god alright whatever moving on
to the next game alright guys the next
game is fortnight the game that everyone
loves to hate or loves to play depending
on who you ask
I check out the settings real quick
everything is maxed out in 1080p except
anti-aliasing which is off and then
post-processing is set to low okay so
we're getting anywhere from 70 to 80
high 70s low 80s in the beginning let's
get into a fight and see if the frames
did
I'm gonna die out here I know it
oh all right
ladies and gentlemen fortnight's all
right next up is battlefield 5 we are
playing domination multiplayer settings
we are let's see we are on high preset
we're getting in the high 60s low 70s
not bad this game is definitely playable
with the 80 100 and the RX 5 70 you
won't be getting over 100 FPS but is
still playable so if you guys want to
play over 100 you gonna have to lower
the settings down to medium but this is
definitely playable over 60 in high
settings
I got you
hey you get that buddy Oh
alright well that is battlefield 5 ion
multiplayer legend I'm moving on to the
next game our next game we have apex
legends for some reason MSI Afterburner
does not work with this only fraps does
so you guys can see the FPS counter on
the bottom right settings we are using
pretty much set to high this is by
default and in touch any of the settings
here and it's way for a game alright so
on the ground right now average FPS
we're looking at high 80s low 90s so far
just running around no battles
alright so except there's a fight going
on over here so looks like in battle the
frames did that down to the low 60s
which isn't bad I mean the goal is to
keep above 60 FPS and this is in high
settings so do keep that in mind the
cool thing is that there was no
stuttering or lagging during the fights
so that is also a really good sign oh my
god I literally almost died
oh my god what was that what you have
apex Legends is definitely playable over
60fps on this five hundred dollar budget
PC well it may not have future
expandability but it sure does kick ass
in 1080p gaming we were getting over 60
fps across most games and high settings
with no lag or stuttering while keeping
low temps and no fan noise like I said
earlier if you guys want to sacrifice
performance in exchange for upgrade
ability then the a and B route is your
best option once again I'll drop a link
to all the parts I mentioned in this
video including all the parts for this
build if you guys enjoy the video and
want to see more like it feel free to
toss a like to show your support and if
you didn't you know what to do consider
subscribing because I will be building a
budget gaming setup featuring this PC
which is coming out very soon then you

your faces and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
