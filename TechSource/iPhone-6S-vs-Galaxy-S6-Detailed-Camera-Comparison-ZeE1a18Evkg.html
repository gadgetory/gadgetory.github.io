Texas and welcome to another detailed
camera comparison test this time we are
facing off the iPhone 6s plus against
the Samsung Galaxy s6 but before we jump
into the samples let's take a quick look
at the specs the iPhone 6s plus has a 12
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.2 that can shoot up to 4k
resolution and the galaxy s6 has a 16
megapixel camera with a 1.9 aperture
that can also shoot up to 4k resolution
for processing cameras the iPhone 6s
plus has if a megapixel camera that can
shoot up to 720p whereas the 5 megapixel
camera on the s6 can shoot up to 1080p
if you guys want to pimp out your smart
phones with the sickest skins on the
planet then you should check out the
brand's they have a bunch of different
types for practically all devices
including smartphones laptops and even
consoles but I'm gonna drop a link down
below for anyone that is interested so
without wasting any more time let's sit
back relax and take a look at some
samples
you
when it comes to autofocusing these 6s
Plus does a great job it utilizes its
focus pixels feature to detect the
object quickly and focus with 100%
accuracy the galaxy s6 also does a
phenomenal job accuracy and speed is
there on both cameras I honestly don't
have any complaints when it comes to
daytime video both phones shoot
exceptional crispy footage the s6 is
more towards the warmer side whereas the
6s plus leans more towards the cooler
colors the iPhone 6 plus however has
slightly better dynamic range if you pay
attention to the background you can
actually see more of the mountain
whereas it's slightly overexposed on the
s6 so for daylight video the 6s takes
the point when it comes to the light
video the s6 easily takes the point not
only does it have a much wider field of
view but the objects are far more
visible if you pay attention to the
billboard you can actually read most of
the words on there from the s6 footage
whereas it's mostly blurry from the 6s
Plus low-light video goes to the s6 for
stabilization both phones were shot in
4k and were strapped on a device to
ensure a very accurate stabilization
reading I had to rewatch the video a
bunch of times because both phones are
practically identical both the success
and the s6 have optical image
stabilization however if you pay
attention really carefully you can see
that the s6 is actually slightly more
stable and for that I will award the
point to the s6 but honestly it's barely
noticeable and both phones doing
outstanding job what's up guys and
welcome to the front-facing video camera
and microphone quality test portion of
the video between the iPhone 6s plus and
the galaxy s6 both of the phones are
being shot in a tides resolution and
also there'll be an audio icon somewhere
on the screen that will indicate which
phone's audio
used also because it listen to this on
your headphones I'm going to stay quiet
for a bit so you guys can hear the
actual background noise
poor front-facing video the s6 has
sharper footage since it's being shot in
1440p and it also has a much wider field
of view the 6s plus however is stuck at
720p so I'll give the point to the s6
for sharper footage
however the 6s plus takes a point for
having a much better dynamic range the
background on the s6 is completely
overexposed whereas it's nicely balanced
on the 6s plus for microphone quality
the s6 takes the point simply because it
has a much louder mic now let's take a
look at daytime picks the s6 has warmer
colors whereas the 6s plus is more on
the cooler side the 6s Plus also tends
to have more contrast which makes the
colors pop whereas you get a more
flatter look on the s6 a great example
is this shot of the purple flowers now
in terms of true-to-life colors the
iPhone six-plus nails it on almost every
shot the s6 has slightly more saturation
which makes the red stand out a bit too
much the true colors of the flowers and
leaves in this pic are resembled best by
D 6s plus and the same goes for the
subscribe below the yellow Jeep and my
red shirt you can really see the
saturation levels clearly from the
galaxy s6 from this pick
dynamic range also goes to these 6s plus
the exposure levels are always on point
no matter the shot and you get a nicely
balanced exposure whereas the background
on the s6 is overexposed most of the
time in terms of sharpness the s6 takes
the point I'm sorry but the 12 megapixel
camera just doesn't compete with the 16
megapixel camera from the s6 I mean both
phones have their strengths and
weaknesses but overall the iPhone 6 plus
has a much better camera for daylight
pictures if you factor in everything I
mentioned which is why it gets the point
for daytime picks for low-light pictures
both phones do a pretty good job for the
most part the color reproduction on the
s6 is a lot better than the 6s plus you
can really see the colors more even in
low-light
however the pictures are more sharper on
the 6s Plus here's a picture of the
billboard sign but cropped in 100% you
can see that the word deluxe is a lot
more sharper on the 6s Plus same thing
for indoors you can see the entire
Logitech mouse whereas some parts are
darker on the galaxy s6 also when it
comes to motion the 6s plus does a much
better job the shutter speed is much
slower on the s6 which results in more
motion blur so that question the 6s plus
takes the point for low-light pictures
lastly when it comes to flash both
phones an exceptional job both from a
distance or even close-up shots however
the point goes to the galaxy s6 simply
because the final shot is more true to
life like in this picture with the red
flowers whereas the iPhones flash alters
the final image so if you guys counted
all the points the clear winner is the
iPhone 6s Plus now before all the
Phandroid dislike the video please keep
in mind that this was a fair test and
nothing was altered on the pictures

raw files straight from the cameras if
