today we're gonna be unlocking the LGV
20 so you can use it with any GSM
carrier in the world now there are a
bunch of unlocking websites out there
and it doesn't really matter which one
you use but if you're looking for the
cheapest prices and the fastest delivery
times then you should check out the
unlocking company comm if you want to
save money so the first step is to find
the IMEI number of the phone and you can
do that by opening up the dial pad and
typing in star pound zero six pound once
the number pops up you have to go back
on the website and enter all of the
information in put in the manufacturer
the model of the phone and on the next
page you have to select which country
the phone was originally purchased from
and the carrier of the phone so once you
check out they will email you don't lock
out the price and time vary depending on
the phone but you are getting a fastest
delivery times with the cheapest prices
so once they email you the code it's
time to unlock your phone so make sure
it's powered off before we continue pop
open the back cover and remove the
battery to gain access to the SIM tray
then go ahead and pop in the SIM card
you want to use with the phone and then
you can go ahead and put back the
battery and the back cover and then boot
up the phone once you boot up the phone
and this prompt will appear asking you
to put in the unlock code and this is
where you put in the code that was
emailed to you once you put in that code
and hit unlock your phone will take you
straight to the home screen and your
phone becomes permanently unlocked so
that's how you unlock your LG v20 to use
with any GSM carrier as always thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
