percent off a three year plan I like the
fact that Eadie doesn't know that
splatoon is a video game not anime yeah
I kind of dropped the ball on that one
guys I've heard of the game splatoon I
had no idea that wallpaper on the
monitor was actually from splatoon so
yeah it shows how much I know about
switch games then again it shouldn't be
surprising to you guys at this point if
I'm not butchering names I'm calling
something wrong on the show where
there's the wrong console or I can't
figure out what anime or game character
it is is there's always something going
on in each show so yeah you guys should
expect that for me so starting from now
guys I'm gonna be reading the top
comments of my previous episode I'm
gonna respond to it in the next episode
that makes any sense
but anyways with that said welcome to
setup wars episode 145 budget Edition I
do have to remind you guys budget
doesn't mean cheap it means that they
have a specific budget that they are
working with it could be a high budget
it could be a low budget but that is the
theme of today's episode so yeah with
that said let the set up wars begin
so starting up the show we have Jamie
from Ireland and his cozy setup that he
uses for gaming and the occasional
streaming he's using a 24-inch
AOC monitor that's resting on the
redstone computer desk that he picked up
from Amazon and he managed to fit
everything on it the coarser k55
keyboard the SteelSeries rival 1/10
mouse and his pc which was mostly built
around a budget except the RAM sticks
it's obviously picked those up because
of its RGB feature and it blends in with
the AYGO igb fans but 16 gigs is
overkill for this build he could have
saved $100 by going with only 8 gigs and
use that extra money on other parts or
he could have bought a nice headset for
yourself I don't know if using a
Bluetooth speaker as your main audio
source is a good thing as I mentioned
before he does stream occasionally which
is why he has a blue snowball microphone
attached to a boom arm one thing I did
notice is the cable management he went
with the let it hang method if you guys
have seen my how-to video on the cable
management basically you wrap most of
the cables together using a cable sleeve
and use a cable box to hide the power
strip and the rest of the cables being
plugged into it other than the usual
recommendation for the keyboard and
mouse wire I think you have yourself a
nice and cozy setup Thank You Jamie for
starting up the show
Bryce is up next from Iowa and I know
what you guys are thinking Edie this guy
has two monitors why the hell is he on
the budget edition well it's because he
built his set up with a budget of $1,500
and he spent only 1487 and also he has a
broken phone so he's using two Acer
monitors that are hooked up to a mount
and underneath that we got the courser
k55 keyboard and the Logitech M 310
mouse oh and by the way the K 55
keyboard is Corsairs budget keyboard I
like what he did with his setup he
personalized it it's not just another
setup out there the pictures on the wall
and the stuff on the shelves all
contribute to the setup and his
personality and speak of the drawings
you actually do all of that himself very
talented a few things on the setup that
got Brice into the budget addition in
the first place are the self-made low
budget phone stand-in
he built from Legos which by the way
he's holding a shattered phone and his
PC of course it's rocking the i3 8100
and an EVGA GTX 1060 I don't know if 16
gigs was a wise choice in this
configuration though again just like the
first contestant I would have just gone
with 8 gigs and put that extra money in
something else aside from the PC he also
has a MacBook for when he needs to
travel Ferrario is rocking a single
sound bar from insignia unfortunately he
does not have any headsets or headphones
but what he does have is excellent cable
management just look at how beautiful
she looks from the back I haven't seen
anything this amazing on all fours so
good this is a very balanced setup with
budget in mind Thank You Bryce for
entering Elijah is up next from my
hometown California represent this is
his gaming and editing setup featuring
two BenQ 24-inch monitors that are
hooked up to his desk and he's also
using the eraser BlackWidow chroma
keyboard and the red dragon m7 10 RGB
mouse for audio he's using these cyber
acoustic speakers which are in an
interesting location they are underneath
his desk on the shelves I don't know how
much of an impact that has on sound but
I guess he wanted to keep the top of the
desk clean he does have a headset as
well which is also in an interesting
location it's way back there underneath
the desk it honestly looks pretty far
away I notice the Livesey likes to keep
things hidden for a cleaner look as
opposed to going for convenience I do
like the placement of the mic setup on
the left side of the desk
however the PC location kind of worries
me not only is it directly on top of the
carpet without anything in between but
it's right next to his legs this means
you won't be able to stretch them out
and relax while gaming editing or even
watching videos
it bothers me just by looking at it I
get that there is no space on the desk
for the actual PC but another thing you
can do is actually pick up a drawer or a
nightstand or something similar and
place the PC on the right side of your
entire desk or better yet if you can
move your xbox 1s on the other side and
remove the middle piece of the shelf
underneath your desk you can actually
place your PC right there on the bottom
assuming you can even take that piece
it actually might be supporting the desk
but those are just some options out
there
despite the placement of some items that
I don't necessarily agree with I will
give you points on the cable management
you kept everything very neat and
organized using a cable sleeve to hide
the wires behind the monitor is a great
idea however I would recommend using
cable clips to help out some of those
cables for example the cables coming
from the microphone it will help keep
them in a straight line which will look
a lot cleaner but nonetheless a very
compact setup with purpose Thank You
Elijah for entering 40s is up next from
Indonesia and this is his music studio
and the first thing I noticed is that
it's very different from other setups in
the sense that it's not the usual desk
against a single color wall there's a
lot of stuff going on here it's not that
it's messy it's just more busy it's got
a productive studio vibe going on and I
really like it he's got a 25 inch ultra
light from LG hooked up to his desk and
he's using a budget keyboard and mouse
now Ferrario is actually got a pair of
Edifier are 1600 T speakers and he
Samson are 850 headphones hanging from
the shelf next to him I really like the
microphone placement the boom arm is
long enough that it can reach over the
monitor and when he's not using it he
can fold it and tuck it behind so the
shelf next to him actually has multiple
uses it's used as a desk for his music
production gear and he also uses the
bottom portion for storage it's also
where his PC sits it's a micro ATX build
inside the elite 130 case from
Coolermaster and it's packing the i5
4460 16 gigs of ram and the galaxy gtx
750ti the cable management is
interesting because he hooked up the
power strip against the wall next to the
shelf and he kind of used that as the
main hub and then there's a ton of
cables coming from the other side of the
wall which I'm guessing is used to power
the rest of his audio gear I mean
judging by this picture most of the
cables are coming from the mixer I do
like the way he wrapped the cables
together using zip ties and he managed
to keep the wires underneath the desk
nice and organized as well I'm not sure
what those two planks of wood are used
for but it looks like the bottom portion
used as support for the table but what
about the rest of it above the surface
I'm wondering why fur leus didn't cut it
past the table top because it kind of
just sticks out like a sore thumb music
production setups are almost always on
the expensive size so I'm glad to come
across a budget focused version on setup
Boris thank you for Ali as for entering
wrapping up the episode as Jack and his
first ever budget focused PC desk mod
which I never thought I'd see on the
budget edition of setup wars so on the
surface it's pretty straightforward
he's using fairly outdated monitors and
a budget keyboard and mouse combo for
audio he's got the Logitech z3 23
speakers and a gaming headset from San
Heiser and that's pretty much it for the
setup the MVP here is obviously the
custom-built desk and the PC that he
built inside it jack is a mechatronics
engineering student and the purpose of
this setup is for studying programming
and the occasional gaming the PC is
using an AMD x4 955 CPU which is a quad
core and he's using four gigs of HyperX
Ram yes that's two gigs each and a gtx
950 so the story behind the setup is
that having a desk pc was a dream for
jack but he didn't really have the
budget to build it after graduating IT
school he started working as a web
developer and started saving money for
the build it took him six months
throughout the weekends to create the
setup and even now he's still not done
as a lot of things he wants to upgrade
well you know where to find me once the
upgrades are here and you're ready to
resubmit once again a very impressive
custom-built setup while sticking to a
budget thank you jack foreign terrain
and then pretty much wraps up this
episode of setup wars as always make
sure you guys drop your comments down
below and vote on who you think has the
best budget set up and I'll announce the
winners on my Instagram account so make
sure you guys are following me there
thank you so much for watching as always
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
