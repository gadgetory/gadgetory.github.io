clicking on the link below so before I
begin the episode I do want to address
the inconsistency of setup wars I don't
haven't been launching them every other
Monday and to be honest the truth is I
just been very lazy I've been working on
other projects and I've been
disregarding the show which is actually
the most popular show on the channel so
I'm gonna try and bring it back every
two weeks again every other Monday but
if you guys want to see setup or has
done every single Monday just like
before you gotta let me know and the way
you let me know is by dropping a like if
this video gets 10,000 likes I'm gonna
work really hard and bring back set
upwards every single Monday because I
have so many submissions and they keep
piling on so I need to I need to do
these series more often so let me know
guys just drop a like it's very simple
if you guys want to see it every single
Monday so yeah
with that said let's dive right in
starting off the episode is Jing from
Cambodia he's a photographer and seller
and this is his gaming and editing setup
I gotta say does look very busy there's
a lot of stuff on the desk it's not
necessarily messy it's just he doesn't
keep things stored away like the remote
for the speakers and the Smart Watch on
the right side I'm guessing he prefers
convenience over aesthetics and you know
what that's completely
he's using a single 4k monitor from LG
that's sitting on the Alex Anan unit
between a pair of Kanto yu6 speakers
it's interesting that he went with the
white color instead of the black
considering the rest of the setup is
black I mean there's technically no real
color scheme but I feel like the color
white feels out of place he's also using
the cursor k95 RGB keyboard with the
Logitech G nano treehouse and the RGB
Polaris mousepad from Corsair one thing
you can do for your mousepad wire is run
it underneath your keyboard and tie it
together with the keyboard wire using
some velcro so that way it looks like
there's only one cable running across
the desk for a cleaner look speaking of
a cleaner look I would say you did a
great job with the cable management
underneath the desk hooking up the power
strip close to you underneath the desk
was a great choice however the cables on
top of your setup can use some work
first up I'm not sure what's going on
with the power strip behind the PC I'm
pretty sure you can find a better place
for that so it's not that visible second
there is a much better place to keep
your charging cables instead of laying
them flat on the surface you can grab
these magnetic cable clips that come
with adhesive tape and you can connect
them to the right side of your desk and
attach the cables to them that way when
you're done using them you can attach
them back to the side and since they are
magnetic they will simply snap and hang
from the side away from site also a side
note I love what you did with your fan
up top looks like you have your very own
air conditioning units so the PC is
using for book gaming and work has a 70
900 X 32 gigs of ram and the asus strix
1080 TI
definitely a beefy computer but he also
has a MacBook Pro touch or when he needs
to be on the move overall it's a great
setup for both gaming and editing Thank
You Jean before starting up the show
mark is up next from Canada and his
gaming and editing setup so he mounted
both of his Asus monitors against the
wall and used a wall Raceway to hide the
cables running down
to his setup very nice for the actual
desk it looks like he's using an IKEA
kitchen countertop with for individual
legs for peripherals he's walking the
cursor k95 platinum RGB keyboard and the
Logitech g43 Mouse and I gotta get props
to mark for routing the mouse wire
underneath the keyboard actually he even
connected it to the keyboard itself for
audio he's rocking the national a forty
gaming headset and he's even got a mic
setup that he uses with the behringer
audio interface he's definitely not
messing around when it comes to audio
the PC is using has a 6700 K a gtx 1070
Strix from Asus and a fluid gaming kit
from ek which consists of a three sixty
millimeter radiator a CPU block and a
pump reservoir combo it's not the
prettiest soft to build I've seen but it
does get the job done excellent work
with the cable management it looks like
everything is hooked up behind the desk
and kept off the ground
so there are a few things you can do on
the surface to clean it up a bit first
off I do recommend routing the headset
wire the opposite direction towards the
back to eliminate the wire going across
your desk instead of having your igv
remote just sitting there you can easily
grab a piece of double sided velcro and
attach it to the back of your remote and
the other piece underneath your desk
that way you can hide it when you're not
using it other than that it's a solid
setup for a student thank you mark for
entering and good luck with school a
number three we have Michael who's an
assistant branch manager for a trade
kitchen supplier from the UK and this is
the setup for gaming and watching movies
the desk was actually custom built using
kitchen cabinets and it sprayed with
high-gloss coating we gotta give it that
nice shine so he hooked up his ultra
light to his desk and he mounted his
speakers against the wall I gotta say I
really like that wallpaper texture and
the color also that Deadpool mural you
have up there is pretty badass I would
say Deadpool is mostly black and red but
you did a great job keeping the color
scheme consistent even though it isn't
black and red
I do see a good amount of black and
white with some red accents like the key
caps from the keyboard the red trigger
button from the mouse and even some red
accents from the SSDs inside the piece
TK's I mean they're very subtle but they
are there I don't know how I feel about
the brown Ram sticks though it kind of
looks out of place in that build great
work with the cable management I can see
that he grouped up the wires together
for his PC and his keyboard and mouse
one thing I would change from the set up
is the placement of the headset it looks
weird putting that on top of the PC and
I feel like it's also out of reach when
you're sitting down if it was me I would
pick up a headphone hanger and mount it
on the right side of your desk it's not
a big deal but if you're looking for a
slightly cleaner look that would be my
recommendation but anyways thank you
Michael for entering more eats is up
next with a triple monitor gaming and
editing setup so he's rocking one Acer
predator in between two Asus mutters and
below them we got some Razer gear the
BlackWidow chroma keyboard mama Mouse
and the Firefly mousepad he does have a
set of speakers as well as the Razer
Manowar wireless headset that's resting
on the table along with a few
miscellaneous items like the ps4
controller and the Titan X GPU block
I'm guessing it's an extra one because
his PC is rocking two of them now here's
a disappointing part he's using these
6700 CPU which is a lock CPU by the way
why would anyone do a custom loop on a
locked CPU is just such a waste not to
mention those ugly naked Ram sticks I
mean it just doesn't go with the badass
water-cooled PC I'm also curious as to
why you have your microphone all the way
on the left side it's not even connected
to anything at least he redeemed himself
with his cable management everything is
grouped up together and held up against
the desk using some 3m tape and cable
clips he even drilled a hole in the desk
to have his keyboard and mouse wires
good job there's definitely some
questionable choices when it comes to
maurices setup but he's only 16 so I
can't be too hard on him
Thank You Maureen's friend train
wrapping up the episode we got Nico and
his interesting setup that he uses for
gaming editing and
Media consumption it's obvious this man
has no interest in symmetry I think the
first thing that came to my attention
was the soundbar that's mounted
underneath his TV
that's an odd place considering the
angle of the TV I do recommend getting a
soundbar mount and hooking it up
underneath your TV for the best sound
experience that way no matter what angle
your TV is aimed at you're gonna get the
full experience from the sound bar the
other monitors is using our ultra whites
both from LG but in two different sizes
the 34 inch one is used for gaming due
to the hundred forty four Hertz refresh
rate while the other is for editing
because of the color accuracy the
keyboard and mouse are both from
Logitech and is interesting that he
snuck in a smartphone stand underneath
his mousepad that's actually pretty
clever and I've never thought of that
before Ferrario he's got the Philips
Fidelio headphones hanging from the
inside we also got the Leviathan sound
bar from Razer like I mentioned earlier
and a microphone setup using the popular
at2020 tequila management on the other
hand could definitely use some work I do
recommend a few cable raceways to hide
the wires running down the walls
especially the cables underneath the
sound bar other than that the signal
rack took care the rest of the cables so
good job there the PC powering the setup
which is sadly hidden behind the
monitors is rocking a 7700 and AC Strix
10 7 8 it's such a clean and sexy bill
but it's being blocked off by one of the
ultra lights I mean at this point you
might as well just put it right
underneath your setup at least that way
you can still see it I don't see any
other option I mean if that TV wasn't
mounted there I would say you can move
it to the left side but you don't really
have any desk space the only other way I
can think of is by stacking your
monitors which I don't think you want to
do and the other option is by mounting
it on the wall using a wall shelf
either way it's a pretty beast set up it
just needs some minor tweaks Thank You
Nico for and train and that does it for
this episode of setup wars as always

below and vote i'm hugh thing has the
