welcome to another episode of the best
tech deals of the week but Before we
jump in I want to ask my UK followers a
question if you guys have a specific
source or a website that helps find UK
deals make sure to send it to deal
source at gmail and if it's a really
good source I will send you guys fifty
bucks also more info will be linked
below but with that said let's go ahead
and start this off so first up we have a
nikon d 3333 hundred and eighty dollars
it's currently sold over eighty four
percent of stock so if you guys are
looking to start a YouTube channel or
want to get into photography this should
be on your list keep in mind that this
is for starting out and I have included
a link to some samples using the exact
same setup down below speaking of
getting into YouTube the shure sm58
handheld microphone is going for a
hundred dollars and it also comes with a
twenty-dollar ebay gift card you can use
the gift card and buy an extension boom
on to mount this on your desk or
voiceovers but once again I will drop a
link to some samples down below if you
want to hear what it sounds like if you
own an iPhone 6 or 7 and wants to
protect the screen from being scratched
here is a four dollar and 39 cent
tempered glass screen protector a legit
scratched my iphone 7 plus screen
already all of you guys can tell but is
a scratch mark up there just from having
it in my pocket so I'm pretty I'm pretty
pissed this next one isn't really tech
but it holds tech so yeah the samsonite
laptop bag not only looks hella clean
but you can grab it for only 53 bucks it
also hooks up to your luggage so you can
take it with you on flights last item on
ebay is this 34 inch ultra wide monitor
with a resolution of 3440 by 1440p that
sold over eighty percent of stock it's
perfect for media consumption editing
and casual gaming JP to Amazon we have a
gaming headset that's going for only
sixteen dollars by using the code listed
on the screen is available in red and
blue and it's also compatible with ps4
xbox one and pc speaking of ps4 the 500
gigabyte uncharted 4 bundle is on sale
for two hundred and eighty dollars keep
in mind that the regular ps4 without any
games go for three hundred dollars so
this is actually a really good deal the
zotac gtx
1080 amp edition is at six hundred and
four dollars which is one of the lowest
that I've seen on a GTX 1080 but check
this out guys the gigabyte gtx 1080 g
one is down to only six hundred dollars
after a male and rebate this is
currently the cheapest 1080 you can find
online if you're shopping around for a
new flagship smartphone and consider
taking a look at a few reviews of the
honor 8 because it's currently dropped
in price by 50 bucks you get flagship
specs and a budget device it's
definitely worth taking a look at the a
CEO backlit mechanical gaming keyboard
is currently at 60 bucks but this cell
does and then five hours so by the time
you're watching this video it won't be
available this is why checking back with
the website deal source tech is
important because we do have deals like
these all the time that come and go
every single day but for you guys I was
able to find it on amazon for a few
dollars more however this one is out of
stock until the 14th the last deal on
amazon has blood-borne for the ps4 all
late it's going for thirteen dollars
which is a pretty stupid deal a few
deals on newegg include the deep cool
janome cooler organelle cooler that
comes with an integrated three sixty
millimeter cooler the white and blue
along with the black and green cases are
going for two hundred thirty dollars but
the black and red option is going for
two hundred we also have a 1000 watt
power supply from courtside going for
110 dollars after a mail-in rebate and
finally a 27-inch 3k widescreen IPS
monitor for two hundred and five bucks
this is actually the first time I'm
hearing about a 3k monitor it's a 2880
by 1620 resolution so it's the perfect
sweet spot between 4k and a 2k monitor
so that is it for the video as always my
UK and Canada followers make sure to
check out the links down below as always
make sure to check out the old source
tech where we upload deals daily then
you guys so much watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
