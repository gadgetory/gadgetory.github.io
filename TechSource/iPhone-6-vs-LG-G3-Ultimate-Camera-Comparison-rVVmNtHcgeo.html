with another camera comparison this time
we are facing off the iPhone 6 with the
LG g3 so let's jump right into some
specs before we take a look at some
samples so the iPhone 6 has an 8
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.2 the maximum resolution
it can shoot in is 1080p and SEL notable
camera features include cinematic video
stabilization 60fps while recording in
1080p exposure control and slow-motion
video at 240 FPS the g3 has a 13
megapixel camera with an aperture of 2.4
and can shoot in 4k resolution some
notable camera features include
autofocus during video mode ISO control
optical image stabilization and dual LED
flash lastly the iPhone 6 has a 1.2
megapixel front-facing camera while the
g3 has a 2.1 megapixel camera and with
that being said that sit back relax and
take a look at some samples I hope you
guys enjoy the video

what is up you guys it at from Texas and
this is a video test between these two
phones there will be an audio icon here
on the top right or top left of the
screen notifying you which phone's being
used at the time also all phones are
strapped to one device so they are
equally balanced if the phones have 4k
capabilities then it is enabled for the
test after all that is a video
comparison and the point of this video
is to show what each phone is capable of
which means putting them on its highest
settings
you

when it comes to autofocusing the iPhone
6 does a phenomenal job it uses
something called focus pixels and it's
super fast as you can tell here not only
is it fast but it is really accurate too
it can detect the object quickly and
hasn't stuttered once yet I'm definitely
impressed with the speed and I wonder if
2 G 3 can
three and I can already say that it's
not as fast as the iPhone 6 though it
does come pretty close it looks like it
goes in and out a little bit to find a
perfect focus point whereas the iPhone 6
hits it directly on spot the g3 also has
some trouble focusing after a while it
would have some problems noticing the
object without a doubt I have to say
that the iPhone 6 has a much better
video camera when it comes to auto
focusing
I concludes the camera test between the
iPhone 6 and the LG g3 this was
definitely an interesting test first up
I want to talk about the day shots
looking at the pictures I took compared
to what they actually look like I have
to say definitely that the iPhone 6 is
much truer to life than the g3 the g3
has a bit more contrast for every
picture I took and looks more vibrant
the grass in this picture is not as
green as the picture in the g3 it looks
just like the grass in the iPhone 6
picture so if you're looking for more
realistic pictures the iPhone 6 is the
way to go for indoor shots the g3 wins
hands down the pictures are just more
sharp and look better overall night
shots without question have to go to the
g3 I mean look at the difference here
the dual LED flash from the g3
definitely works to bring you guys
stunning pictures and low-light
conditions when it comes to video
however both did a great job during the
day I couldn't decide a winner there but
the g3 definitely wins in the audio
department it's much more louder and
clearer than the 6 when it comes to
low-light video the iPhone 6 takes the
crown there's a lot less noise in iphone
6 video and you can see a lot more than
you can in the g3 so it's pretty hard to
declare a winner here when both phones
are great and bad at certain things but
I wanted to hear your opinion what phone
did the overall best and which phone
will suit you more let me know in the
comments section because I will be
reading all the comments this is ad from
tech source and I will see you in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
