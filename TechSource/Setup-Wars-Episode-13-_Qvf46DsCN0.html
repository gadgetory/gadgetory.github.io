Transformer laptop overnight so it's
basically dead now and after film setup
wars so I'm forced to use my smartphone
and look at the setups on there so yeah
it's gonna be an interesting episode
what's up guys its that back again from
tech source and welcome to setup wars
episode 13 where you submit your desk
setup to get featured on the channel and
a chance to win a prize if you guys are
new to the series I want to submit your
setup then you need to watch the video
linked down below without wasting any
more time
let the setup wars begin
this episode of Star Wars is brought to
you by g2a
never pay full price for a game ever
again g2a offers the best deals on CD
keys for practically any platform click
on the link below to see for yourself
by the way all the products I mentioned
in this video will be linked down below
in the description section as well as
any products I recommend as well but
with that said the five chosen for this
week are Cameron Logan Nelson Steve and
Val congrats for making it to this week
of setup wars so starting off the
episode we have Cameron Diaz with his
floating ultrawide monitor setup and
that looks pretty sweet I'm not gonna
lie so we have an LG 34 you see 97's
ultra wide curved monitor attached to
the Ergo Tron MX monitor arm and then
right next to that we have the 15 inch
retina MacBook Pro on a very popular M
stand so this is basically a
Productivity type setup a really clean
productivity setup I should say on the
table we have the Logitech k7 e solar
power keyboard Magic Trackpad and the
best productivity wireless mouse any
human can buy I was just about to
recommend that if I didn't see it on
your desk some other items on the desk
include the focal XS speakers and a
Costco LED desk lamp I also noticed that
you have the IKEA sitting stand esque
and underneath it you installed your
Apogee one I actually mentioned this
many times in my setup boards episodes
but this is a really great way to hide
stuff that you don't use often and keeps
your desk looking clutter free I would
recommend either some 3m tape or welco
scraps for something a little less
permanent I also noticed your a pair of
a THM 50 X's you really did pick all the
right stuff for your productivity setup
I'm really impressed water management is
also fantastic it seems like all the
cables are inside that pouch which I'm
assuming comes with the table I first
thought that you had your very own
teleportation device on that cabinet of
yours but after reading the notes I
discovered that it's only a 3d printer
overall I'm really loving your setup
easily one of the best productivity
setups I have seen on setup wars Thank
You Cameron for entering setup Wars next
up is Logan with his awesome custom-made
wooden table setup he's walking to 22
inch monitors one from Samsung
the other is actually a TV from insignia
on the table we have the ever-so-popular
Black Widow ultimate keyboard and in
Logitech M 705 wireless mouse
there are also some insignia speakers on
the desk also a Razer Kraken gaming
headset hanging from the side kale
management is not bad I guess but it's
not great either
so I recommend picking up some cable
management stuff I link down below to
clean up that a little bit the fact that
you built this desk all by yourself as
awesome and I'll give you points for
that but you also have some extra stuff
on the desk here's a really awesome and
easy way to fix that since it will work
with your desk so well you can add a
tray on the bottom of the desk and
actually install one myself
for one of my ikea tables that holds all
of my smart phones it's great because
it's hidden and it provides a lot of
space for your extra stuff that you just
don't need like a tiny laptop some power
banks or in your case the xbox
controllers your extra Mouse and even
your keys it's super easy to install I
didn't even need a power drill I just
use my screwdriver and installed it
within a minute I know it's not made out
of wood but it's not visible so it won't
mess with your fame I also notice you
have a block of wood to hold up the
small TV well adding a dual monitor desk
mount will not only eliminate the need
for that but it will really clean up the
overall look of your desk but a not
really great job on a table Thank You
Logan for entering setup ores of course
next up is Nelson and we have an
all-white theme first off I gotta say I
love the black in white contrast that's
going out over here one color doesn't
overpower the other and it's nicely
balanced so we have to Samsung 24 inch
wide monitors a Logitech a 750 wireless
keyboard and the performance MX Mouse so
I'm guessing this is another
productivity setup by the way I have no
control in the order of these setups I
just feature them in the order that I
received them if they pass the
requirements of course also on the desk
we have a pair of Logitech z6 23
speakers a bluebird condenser mic with
the Focusrite audio interface combo i
also notice the eth m50x is hanging from
the audio-technica hanger did you get
that idea from watching one of my cool
tech videos either way that's a really
great buy so good job there key
management is also invisible I don't
know what you did with them but it sure
as hell working since I can't see them
so great job there as well I'm honestly
really digging that glossy table you got
it works so well with your setup and I
wish you mentioned it in the notes but
if you're watching this video let the
whole world know where you got that
table by leaving a comment down below
because I'm actually interested in it as
well so just a few minor recommendations
the mic you have is pretty far from you
and I know you put it there when you're
not using it but it'll be a lot
convenient for you to pick up an
extension boom arm to make your
recording sessions a lot easier it'll
also help keep the surface of your desk
from scratching since it's lifted I'm
not a minor thing I would suggest is
maybe adding some 3m tape underneath the
Kingston memory card reader so that it
doesn't move when you're constantly
inserting GST cards but that's basically
it you got a killer white deep setup
Thank You Nelson for entering setup Wars
next up is Steve and his multi gaming
setup on the Left we have two Asus
24-inch gaming monitors a Razer
BlackWidow ultimate stealth Edition
keyboard and a Death Adder Mouse on the
right side we have a console gaming
setup with a single 27-inch BenQ gaming
monitor hooked up to the Xbox one cable
management is really solid as well I see
that you tie them all together with the
omnimount cable system so I'll give you
props there you have a pretty badass PC
as well let's rockin an Intel 4790k
paired with an EVGA GTX 980
but yeah I'm really digging the glass
desk setup you have the only thing I
would recommend is maybe a gaming
headset that I'll link down below since
I don't see any in your setup but thank
you Steve for entering setup words last
but not least we have Val and his
awesome setup from Narnia I'm definitely
feeling that relaxed vibe and I'm diggin
that awesome wallpaper you have the
wallpaper on the actual wall not on the
whatever so we have one asus 24-inch pro
art monitor and another 24-inch from
dell also on a desk we have a corsair
k70 RGB keyboard and a Razer Naga epic
chroma Mouse I love that you kept your
green bean consistent and solid choice
on the K 70 and raise your mouse by the
way some of the stop you have on a desk
are Logitech z5o 6 speakers Gredos
headphones on the mov headphone hanger
and the very popular ikea mom desk that
has made a few appearances here on setup
wars KO lanta german is immaculate and
you have a pretty awesome custom PC as
well that matches your overall theme I
mean what can I say everything from the
wallpaper to the Russian ninja dolls on
the desk and your cable management just
works so well together definitely one of
the more unique setups that I've seen on
the show and I'll see I just want to say
great job on everything there's really
nothing I want to recommend other than a
pair of really cool green headphones
from Razer to match your theme but other
than that you have an awesome set of
Bell thank you for entering setup wars
