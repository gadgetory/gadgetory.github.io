unlocking company the fastest and most
affordable way to unlock your phone hey
guys it's ad from Texas and I'm here to
unbox the brand-new surface pro 3 from
Microsoft I went ahead and picked up the
high-end model that has an i7 processor
however there are other models available
for purchase like the i3 and the i-5 you
can also choose the amount of space you
want from 64 gigabytes all the way up to
512 the model I picked up is the i7
processor with 256 gigabytes of SSD
space along with 8 gigabytes of RAM so
without further adieu let's unbox this
bad boy and see what's inside
for those of you that don't know what a
surface pro is it's essentially a tablet
running Windows 8 it is supposed to
compete with the MacBook Air so I'll
definitely to know if this is a much
better alternative at the end of the
video so the first thing I see inside
the box is the surface pro itself and my
first impressions on the tablet is that
it's superlight
it has a premium feel to it although I
would have liked to seen thinner bezels
on the tablet but anyways moving on with
the unboxing they do provide a quadruple
a battery for the surface pan and there
are some paperwork including a
QuickStart guide which I won't go over
this year is an aluminum surface pen and
it actually has some pretty cool
features which I will go over later in
this video
removing a flap on the right side of the
box or where the charging cables are
included the AC adapter cable followed
by the power brick which also has a
built-in USB port that I thought was a
pretty neat implementation the charging
is done by inserting these magnetic
prongs on the side of the tablet and it
is really convenient because you can
insert it either way so before I turn on
the device i'ma quickly go around it and
show you guys the buttons and ports so
starting on the bottom you can find the
port's needed to connect an accessory
such as a detachable keyboard which is
strongly recommended when using the
surface pro 3 moving towards the right
side of the tablet we can find the
charging port USB 3.0 and display port
on the top of the tablet is where the
power button is located and on the left
side you can find the volume buttons and
the headphone jack there is also a micro
SD card slot hidden under the flap on
the front of the tablet we have a 5
megapixel front facing camera that can
shoot in
1080p along with the front mic and an
ambient light sensor and the same camera
specs go for the backside as well with a
rear-facing microphone the surface pro 3
also offers amazing versatility you can
go from tablet to laptop and a snap with
the multi position kickstand and it's
also designed to work well with their
detachable keyboard so the screen on the
surface pro 3 is a 12 point 2 inch IPS
display with a resolution of 2160 by
1440 which supports multi-touch the
battery is also supposed to last up to
nine hours of web browsing I don't
really want to waste time talking about
the operating system because most of us
already know about Windows 8 so there
was really nothing new to talk about
when actually using the tablet it is
essentially a Windows 8 laptop without
the keyboard the i7 processor definitely
shines here as I have not yet
experienced any lag when navigating
through the tablet and the videos play
very smoothly even at 1080p
since the stereo speakers are located on
the side the sound does not become
muffled and instead you get crisp audio
another thing that I was impressed that
was the usage sheet I played with the
surface pro for about 2 hours straight
and it only got to a point where it was
warm
there was no fan noise that I could hear
and no excessive heat that would ruin
the experience of holding it on my lap I
was definitely impressed with that now
the surface pen does have its benefits
as well most of the time it isn't used
but when it is I found it to be
integrated very well with the tablet you
can use it as a mouse and you can even
program it to launch an app with a click
of a button
accuracy wise it is probably the most
accurate pen I have used to date given
my drawing skills are horrible I think
that this is probably the best drawing
of Vegeta that I've ever done using a
tablet pen one of my absolute favorite
features of Windows 8 that works so well
with this tablet is the split screen
option I can easily multitask and get
work done while at the same time
watching a video you can even adjust the
window size for the appropriate setting
that fits you if you want to swap to
previous tasks to simply swipe from the
left horizontally and if you want to
close the tasks then you can swipe
downwards from the same location so the
surface pro 3 does have a camera and
this want to be a review without me
testing them out so here are a few
sample pictures I took with it it is
obviously far from the best camera but
for a tablet I think it did a pretty
good job
here's a sample of the video that I took
with sound
overall I would say the surface pro 3 is
a hell of a tablet that can do so many
things the i7 processor definitely makes
sure that you get the best experience
and the size and weight factor of the
tablet makes it a very convenient device
to carry around with ease all that's
missing is a detachable keyboard which
can be purchased separately of operating
systems aside I definitely think that
the surface pro is a great investment to
have if you are constantly on the move
and the price is fair to me that being
said personally I would consider buying
one if it came with Windows 7 otherwise
I'm going to have to hold off anyways
that is it for the video I hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did please leave a
like and if you didn't you can leave a
dislike and let me know why also what
did you guys think about the surface pro
3 if you had to choose between this and
the new MacBook Air which would it be
let me know in the comment section down
below this is that from tech source and
I will see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
