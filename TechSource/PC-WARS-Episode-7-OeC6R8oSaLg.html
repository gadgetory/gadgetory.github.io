contestants for this week you have Adam
Benny
Jacob Mabus and Theodore congratulations
for making it to PC wars episode 7 first
up is Adam with his PC named majestic a
4770k overclocked 24.6 16 gigabytes have
dominated Platinum's and a single GTX
780 Ti in a gorgeous modded Corsair
Carbide air 510 case can we just please
take a moment and appreciate the
high-quality pictures that Adam has
taken for us thank you
excellent work with cable management
this is by far one of the cleanest
builds I have ever seen on the show the
color coordination the handmade acrylic
pieces and the custom painted parts
really go beautifully together
I like how you didn't stick with
all-white sleeved cables and decided to
add some beige in there to mix it up a
bit it definitely stands out but not
enough to take away from your aesthetics
of this build for benchmarks majestic
scored a 12,000 105 for fire strike
which gives it a solid place up top
amazing build Adam thank you for
entering Benny is next up with flight
sim rig a 4790k which is overclocked to
four point eight paired with two asus
strix gtx 980ti is in sli it also has 16
megabytes of Corsair Vengeance program
and an H 105 CPU cooler great work with
cable management that I'm really digging
that asus rog enthusiast sli bridge for
benchmarks at scoring 19,000 303 taking
the lead there is a slight GPU sag which
is to be expected with such heavy cards
but other than that it's a pretty
straightforward build Thank You Benny
for entering jacob is next up with a
sweet black and red build inside the
graphite 780 t case we have a 4790k OC
to 4.4 gigahertz and is paired with an
msi gtx 980ti we also have 60 megabytes
of engines program and an H 100 i GTX to
keep things cool I'm really digging the
red custom sleeves from Corsair and the
armor on that mother
for four benchmarks that scored a
fifteen thousand eight ninety six which
takes second place for this episode but
very clean bill Jacob thank you for
answering Mavis is next up with Mavis
Box 2.0 when until 6500 and a GTX 780 Ti
inside the air 240 case we also have 16
gigabytes of Dominator Platinum's which
are custom painted white and a stock
cooler I'm not sure what's going on with
the LED strips around the case or the
deal with that fan just lying down there
but the wiring job can definitely be
better
last but not least we have Theodore and
his saffron which is a black and blue
build inside the h4 40 case it's rocking
a 4790k and a GTX 970 GPU with custom
sleeve extensions from BitFenix it also
has 8 gigabytes of Ripjaws X RAM and an
H 100 ICPO cooler for benchmarks it
scored a 10000 96 barely losing out
against the 780 Ti and taking last place
for this episode nonetheless it's a very
clean black and blue build thank you
