I'm going to be releasing two episodes
of setup wars episode 32 that you are
watching now and then episode 33 will go
live this Thursday so keep an eye out
for that the reason why I'm doing this
is because I am buried in submissions
right now the current wait time to get
featured on my channel is about four or
five months and I get like 200
submissions at least per week so it's
really hard to keep up with you guys
honestly I'm getting so many submissions
so hopefully I can try and do two
episodes per week if it's too much for
me I'll go back and just do one episode
a week so yeah it's kind of overwhelming
with all of these setup submissions so
I'm trying to figure out a way that I
can get these out faster because I know
a lot of you guys have been waiting for
months and you're wondering why your
setup hasn't been featured well that's
why I think I'd like over 250
submissions as of today and I'm getting
more and more every single day anyways
without wasting any more time let the
setup wars begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below so our
five lucky contestants for this week are
Leonard Luke Mike Ricardo and Stephane
congratulations for making it to setup
force episode 32 first up is Leonard
with a 24 inch LG monitor a steel series
apex keyboard and a speed link thickest
Mouse also let us give a pair of trusts
5.1 surround sound speakers at an Asus
laptop off to the right side excellent
work with cable management all the wires
are off of the table and neatly resting
on top of the IKEA Signum rack with the
power strips attached to the right side
of the desk I do like the addition of
the LED strips behind your monitor but
maybe hide the LED remote somewhere so
it's not visible perhaps trapping it
against the roof of your desk close to
you so you can access it easily also
since you have a desk mat already you
don't really need a mousepad the setup
would look a lot cleaner without it but
that's just my two cents
Thank You Leonard for entering setup
Wars Luke is next up with a single
27-inch Samsung monitor we also have a
Logitech G 510 keyboard and a Logitech
g9x call of duty modern warfare 3
edition mouse on top of the glorious
extended mousepad we also have a pair of
Swan speakers and some miscellaneous
stuff in the back for added personality
decent work with cable management I mean
I do see that driving a lot of cables to
work with and you did your best to clean
them up as much as you can I do love the
addition of the headphone hanger for
your M 50s and the SD card reader that
you attach to the roof of your desk
very nice mod and a very clean setup if
you're looking to spice things up a
little bit I would recommend a monitor
riser to keep that display off of the
desk and that way you will have some
space under for your router and if you
do that you can get these speaker stands
and lift the speaker's up that way it
will match the height of the monitor and
give a little spice to your setup but
once again these are just my
recommendations
obviously I'll link everything I
mentioned down below but other than that
thank you Luke for entering for number
three we have Mike with a game room
setup technically he has two displays
but on his actual desk setup we have a
single 27-inch Acer monitor also notice
we have a Razer BlackWidow Ultimate
keyboard a
take g400 gaming mouse and after the
left side we have a steel series 5hv 2
gaming headset resting on a hanger of
some sort off the right side we have a
small table with a few stuff on top a
15-inch MacBook Pro Retina Xbox one
console with a pair of San Heiser
urbanite headphones and a logitech k400
wireless keyboard which he uses to
control his PC from his bed cable
management is really great and
everything is organized really well I
especially like the spiral wrap that you
use for the TV cables my OCD levels are
very calm so far in this episode this is
one of the very few setups that I've
seen that do a great job on utilizing a
gaming PC for watching videos just grab
the wireless keyboard sit back in your
bed and use it to play videos on the
massive TV excellent setup indeed Mike
thank you for entering Ricardo is next
up with a green themed setup which
surprisingly has nothing to do with
Razer we have a 27-inch Samsung monitor
Corsair k70 RGB keyboard and a Logitech
G 303 gaming mouse
even the Mackie CR 4 speakers have a
green outline on them to match the set
up audio point for the color
coordination already cable management is
great although I noticed you use the PC
case box to keep the parish tip above
the ground
I guess I'm have to take that point back
to the left of the setup we have a pair
of M 50s on the text source approved
headphone stand from MOV which I only
feature like a thousand times on the
channel and behind that we have a custom
PC excellent choice going with NZXT nock
to a 450 case inside this beautiful case
we have a 4790k paired with a gtx 980
with some green LEDs by satochi
which are actually RGB this setup kind
of seems cramped and I get why you have
your PC faced to the side like that so
the inside is visible but what did it
look a lot better if you move the PC
case to the right side of your setup it
would not only make the cable management
job a little easier but you can also
move your entire setup to the left and
have lots of more room to work with at
least that's what I would do if I had
that setup but either way it's a pretty
sweet green setup Thank You Ricardo for
entering last but not least we have
Stefan with a very interesting setup a
23 inch LG monitor a Mad Catz strike 3
gaming keyboard and a rad 3 Mouse on top
of a very tiny circular table on the
left side we have a Logitech g27 racing
wheel set
and a pair of logitech z2 13 speakers I
gotta hand it to you deal with such a
limited space to work with you sure as
hell made the best of it I'm guessing
you just rotate the monitor to the other
side whenever you need to use the wheel
and you are basically good to go the PC
that's powering all of this has a 46 70
K and a GTX 970 packed inside the
awesome H 440 case kale management can
definitely be improved just grab some
velcro straps and at least tie the
cables together but yeah not much else
to say pretty sweet setup considering
what you have to work with Thank You
