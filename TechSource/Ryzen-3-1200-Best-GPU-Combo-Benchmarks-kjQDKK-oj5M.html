r3 1200 but don't know what GPU to pair
it with in the fear of bottlenecking
well that's what this quick video is
about I'm a test a variety of GPUs and
1080p and quad HD to give you guys an
idea of the performance you will be
getting and the reason why I'm making
this type of video is because the r3
1200 is going to be one of the most
popular AMD processors out there because
you get a 3.1 gigahertz quad core CPU
weighted with a 65 watt TDP that comes
with it's very own cooler for only 109
dollars I was also able to overclock the
CPU to 3.8 gigahertz at one point three
five volts using the stock cooler I'm
even confident that the CPU can hit four
gigahertz using an ail cooler so the
1200 is aimed to compete against the G
45 60 and the core i3 70 100 but what
sets the CPU apart from them is the
price and core count but anyways it's
always thinking over time here are the
benchmarks
so the only bottlenecking that I
experienced was in gta5 we can clearly
see the GPUs above the RX 580 throttling
and capping at 113 fps and HD and 111 in
quad HD resolution the rest of the games
didn't experience any major bottlenecks
and this isn't to say that the r3 1200
won't bottleneck on other games so
please keep that in mind this video is
just to demonstrate what performance you
will be getting combining the r3 1200
with one of the GPUs shown in this video
the truth is you can game comfortably up
to 2k resolution with a capable GPU and
not worry about too much performance
loss you can do this with a CPU that
cost around $100 with its own stock
heatsink that's what's so impressive so
if you're looking to build your next
budget PC for Strictly gaming and lights
tasks the r3 1200 should definitely be
on your list I'll drop a link if you
guys want to check it out so now this
video was helpful feel free to drop a
