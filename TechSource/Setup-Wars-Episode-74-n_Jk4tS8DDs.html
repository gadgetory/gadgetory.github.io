pretty close 48,000 likes out of 60,000
at the time of this recording so
unfortunately we do not make the 60,000
like go so I won't be destroying my
brother's PC a lot of you guys don't
like destruction instead of destroying
the PC you guys kept writing the
comments section that you wanted to do a
giveaway it doesn't work that way guys
either I destroy it or I don't so I'm
sorry I do have other giveaways
obviously on the channel but these are
just challenges so I'll be back next
week with another challenge so with that
said welcome to setup wars episode is 74
let the set up wars begin
if you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2a
comm because they have the cheapest CD
keys available for pretty much any game
I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out as always you
guys can find a gear for everyone setups
link below in case you're interested but
here are your five contestants for this
week we have penguin Danielle Ritchie
Rick and Ryan let's start the show so
first up is atomic penguin and it looks
like we have a fairly simple triple
monitor set up the center being a
24-inch IOC and the side to our 24-inch
band cue monitors on the IKEA rig astad
table I think that's how you pronounce
it is the Corsair Vengeance k-6 t5
keyboard paired with the logitech g502
and both are resting on the glorious
extended mousepad I love the clean
wireless look of these setups so
drilling a hole in the desk to run the
wires through is always something I love
seeing hanging from the brainwaves
holder is the m50 X's and finally we
have an audio technica mic cooked up to
a boom arm it appears that he's a
streamer cable management looks pretty
good at this angle although there are
some additional wires visible usually
people send me pictures at the bottom of
the desk to see how they did their cable
management but I'll have to just deal
with these pictures instead I would
recommend putting a piece of wood or
something underneath your PC instead of
leaving it on the carpet like that which
attracts more dust but it looks like you
have a 49 30 K and an msi gtx 1070
seahawk grab as card this is a great
setup I like the placement of the boom
arm off to the side which doesn't get in
the way of the monitors when you are not
using them I also like how clean the
surface area is not a single wire in
sight but it's lacking some personality
and seems a bit too plain if I'm being
Frank it's also missing some consistency
I mean we have two different monitors
different color accents it just doesn't
blend well together but don't get me
wrong this is a very clean setup it just
needs some spice I guess is what I'm
trying to say thank you penguin for
entering next up is Danielle with an OCD
anti scene setup so we have three
different monitors 27-inch Ben Q which
is the main monitor a 24 inch Asus as an
overhead and
finally a 22 inch dual monitor to the
right side on the desk we have a habbit
keyboard and another logitech g502 mouse
on top of a really badass looking an
extended mouse pad I'm not sure if you
move the keyboard off the mousepad on
purpose just to show it off but I'm glad
you did
for those of you who are wondering this
is actually a custom-made a mousepad
from a website you can basically upload
your very own image and they print it
out and send it over very nice to the
left we have a pair of Harman Kardon
headphones hanging from the wall but
that's not the only thing that's hanging
from the walls and Daniels room nope we
have a 50 inch LG TV hanging right above
his ps4 we also have a wall shelf
holding up to the best superheroes in
any comic book yes I did go there and
two freaking crossbows it's hunger games
up in this piece I'm not gonna lie this
is far from the average boring setup
there's plenty of personality and color
yes
color the custom PC has all sorts of it
it also has an i7 930 processor paired
with the GTX 970 I can't really see much
of the cable management other than some
wires on the left side but overall
nothing too bad it may be lacking some
organization and consistency but it's
definitely a cool setup but an even
better man cave Thank You Daniel for
entering richy-rich is next up with a
very clean ultra wide setup I'm starting
to see more ultra light setups on the
show I'm not really sure why anyway so
Ritchie is rocking the a soup editor x34
which is sandwiched by two audio engine
a 5 plus speakers and also on the desk
he has the K 70 keyboard from Corsair
and the SteelSeries rival 300 Mouse
finally something that isn't Logitech on
the wall shelf to his left is a pair of
handcrafted pistols and oh you know just
a casual EBG a 1080 just chilling there
not much to show for cable management
since the backboard is pretty much
covering everything but there is a
HyperX cloud 2 gaming headset hooked up
on the side which I like to see and
finally we have is very stunning white
and blue water-cooled PC rocking these
6700 K and a GTX 1080 this is a very
clean build and I'm digging the
Adventure Time wizard that's chilling on
the top of one of those fans this is
definitely a clean and organized ultra
light setup no doubt Thank You Richie
for entering
speaking of ultralight setups we have
another one from Rick so we have two 29
inch monitors from LG mounted against
the backboard and just look at that
speaker placement that is music to my
ears
so symmetrical and so beautiful there's
definitely not a whole lot going on here
I mean the only thing that's on this
massive custom desk is the Logitech J
810 keyboard and MX master mouse
I feel like this setup belongs in an art
museum speaking of art take a look at
that cable management God Daniel
we have several power strips that are
powering everything for the setup and
then there are also four LED RGB strips
that run along the edge of the backboard
that kind of give it that glow effect we
have a cable drop on the left side
holding up his charging cable and a few
more cable clips underneath the table
that help with routing the wires we also
have the PC down here which has an i5
750 and a gtx 550 ti running in tandem
with the Radeon HD 5 770 overall the
cleanliness of the setup and the cable
management blew me away but I feel like
it's missing something the item - the
empty space ratio is way too large and I
feel like something needs to be done
with the surface of the desk regardless
this is one of the cleanest setups that
I've seen on the show thank you Rick for
entering last but not least we have
Brian with a killer blackened red gaming
setup he's rocking a 29 inch LG ultra
white in between - 24 inch Acer monitors
the keyboard of choice is the fire
dancing first player and he also has
these Lotus gaming mouse on top of the
Swift gaming mouse pad I just love the
consistency of the setup and to have a
matching chair is the icing on the cake
also on a desk key as the some vision
gaming headset resting on a headset
stand and above his setup is his PC I
really hope that shelf doesn't break off
because that would be traumatizing but
inside here is the 6700 K and a gigabyte
gtx 1070 another thing i noticed is the
USB hub that you hooked up against the
wall which is a very unusual spot most
people keep that under the desk I would
personally pick up a flat design USB hub
so that you can add it under your desk
because it's a lot cleaner than sticking
it on the wall but that's just me cable
management on the other hand is pretty
good the IKEA backhand desk comes
a net underneath which is excellent for
storing cables and I like the fact that
you wrapped up the PC wires together
using some velcro straps it also looks
like we have another Star Wars fan from
the posters to the collectables and then
we have this thing other than the
relocation of that USB hub I see that
this is a very badass color-coordinated
gaming setup Thank You Ryan for entering
so that is it for this episode as always
