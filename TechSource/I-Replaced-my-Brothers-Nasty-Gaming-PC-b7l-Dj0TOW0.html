years ago I've given my own PC to my
brother
big red which is sitting right over here
it's packing the 49 30 K we got 32 gigs
of ram and the msi gtx 980ti and it's
time to show its age and I kind of
wanted to build a my new or PC something
with more the latest specs so we're
bringing up to date with the kb lake
platform I didn't give them a Christmas
gift so this will technically be his
gift even though we're shooting it at
the end of December better late than
never I suppose but let's go over some
parts real quick starting with the cpu
we are going with the i7 7700 K even
though we are downgrading from a 6 core
to a quad core this actually has a lot
better gaming performance especially
once you overclock it to 5 gigahertz
speaking of overclocking you wouldn't be
using the coarser h100 IV - I actually
had two of these laying around so we're
gonna be using this and I'm actually
going to swap out the two stock fans for
some LED ones what else for ram we are
actually done rating 32 gigs of ram 216
viper actually sent this over recently
these are our GB RAM sticks 16 gigs at
3200 megahertz which is more than plenty
for what he uses the PC for now for
storage or keeping it simple we're
giving them an mp5 10th of course sir
this is an m2 SSD 480 gigabytes of space
and he downloads a lot of porn and
videos so we're gonna give him my 4
terabyte hard drive from Seagate so I
finally the GPU that we are upgrading
from the 980ti
is the asus strix RX vega 64 the monitor
is currently using supports resync so
it'll take advantage of that it will
help reduce screen tearing as well as
stuttering powering the entire build was
supposed to be the C Sonic 5 20 watt but
I just realized this is not gonna be
enough power especially we're gonna be
overclocking both the GPU and CPU so
luckily coarser Sun one of these a few
weeks back we're gonna be dropping in
the HX 850 so this is gonna be plenty of
juice for it I did order some mods to
split up the build I picked up some
custom sleeve extensions from Amazon as
well as this dope RGB backplate from b1
Tech since he use into Warcraft I
thought I put in a horde symbol in the
middle there and that's the everything
is going
the beautiful coarser crystal 280x our
IDP case this is a micro ATX case with
two included RGB fans I personally think
it's gonna look awesome once everything
is put together the whole theme of the
bill is supposed to be mostly white with
black accents but we'll see how it turns
out guys these are pretty much all the
parts I'm gonna be using in the build
but let's take a closer look at big red
and see how he kept it for the past two
years so I drove over to pick up the
piece in the morning and I kid you guys
not when I look through the side panel
the first thing I noticed well than how
disgusting a PC is is that there is a
fan blade just chilling on the floor
over here and not only that but it's
missing two blades which are nowhere to
be found I can safely say that this PC
has not been touched since I gave it to
him I love my brother to death but he
cannot take care of anything if his life
depended on it I don't even know what
this white pieces are on the top here
like where is this coming from
let's pop a front cover here you guys
ready for this oh my god yep look at
this this is disgusting oh my god
surprisingly there's no issues with the
PC is winning fine no lagging no
crashing stuff like that the only issue
he has is with the software there was a
virus in there right now I don't know
what on earth he downloads every single
time but there's always a bunch of
popups coming up and it's freezing his
screen but it's not it's not related to
the actual hardware so that's good so
what I'm gonna do with this PC after I'm
done wiping off the operating system and
doing a deep cleaning which it
desperately needs is I want to give this
away to one of my Instagram followers
I'm iguana Instagram account I'm gonna
make a stories basically saying that I'm
giving this PC away and whoever lives
close by can come by and pick it up
there's gonna be a catch though the
person that I selecting the DMS has to
answer five questions that only
loyal subscriber knows got to make sure
that the person wins is what are the
enough that makes any sense so yeah
with that said go um IG can right now
and see what I can find
hi guys listen up closely if you're in
the LA area and you want to take home a
gaming PC specifically this one over
here
it's my old PC it's got a 4930 k-6 core
processor 32 gigs of ram and the msi gtx
980
yeah i'm giving this away to one lucky
Instagram follower that lives in the LA
area
GME if you're interested alright I'm
using my main phone to record audio so
which is why I'm using Bob's phone to
look through my Instagram account we
went to grab an air duster and I
meantime we got a bunch of DM so I'm
gonna scroll through them real quick and
pick one lucky bastard
that person actually has to answer five
questions and then you'll be the winner
of the PC so too bad I live in the UK
okay thanks good to know not even lives
in expensive LA area you need to start
doing all around the u.s. giveaways I
think this person forgot doesn't doesn't
realize the point of it it was kind of
like on-the-spot giveaway I'm sorry
candy half these people are just like
upset because they're not it's not local
yeah I'm once doesn't okey-doke I live
in Canada thank you for letting me know
you live in Canada okay putting the
peace I sell you don't live in LA but I
would really want and need that PC you
have I believe me guys believe me hi my
name is Jess I live in LA I would love
to enter and try to win a PC but do you
really live in LA hey where do you live
exactly but I thought my justice and get
it ready because I stopped to restore
windows on here give him what like an
hour or two good good I hope it's seen
it you've seen it he's active
I just realized yes answer five
questions and then if it doesn't work
out we have to pick somebody else's this
might take a while guys
I probably even put this part in the
video until I find somebody that answers
all five questions at the Abbey the
easiest way so I live in your trance
worth in my Winnetka it's a small city
okay I used to live in Chatsworth oh he
lives near Chatsworth I'd rather call
him and just get this over with
can I call you what's your number
oh here we go
hey is this Jesse King Jesse yeah what's
going on man yeah this is that from
Texas what's happening nice alright man
well here's the thing man
one thing I didn't tell you is that you
have to actually answer five questions
and then if you answer them all
correctly then you got yourself a new PC
are you down for that oh cool nope no
sweat by the way if you know if you know
when nothing happens so you you move on
with your day
all right so first question is what is
the name of my PC specifically the PC
I'm actually giving away take okay all
right that's I think that's an easy one
okay next question I recently picked up
a Tesla do you know which model it is
next question what are the last three
videos on the channel or you can name
any of the recent videos you've seen on
the channel any any of the three videos
by G pcs can you be specific on that one
not like that okay the configuration
that the three different budgets yeah do
you know the amounts by any chance damn
you're good Jesse the second last
question what is the person's name for
season two of setup makeover damn that's
good okay last question what is a theme
of my last water-cooled build on the
channel I guess that kind of goes handin
if he knows the name of harry season
season two then it probably knows but
all right Congrats um
damn okay you just won yourself a a
beast gaming PC huh I could come to you
as long as you want to pay hundred
dollar delivery fee I'm just kidding man
yeah I'll tell you what man I'm gonna
come up I'll dust this for you I'm gonna
wipe off the Windows operating system
if you can get here within the next few
hours come pick it up well I'm at the
office I'll text you the address
how's that okay no worries man I'm just
glad he knew all the answers instead of
going through like a bunch of other
people alright so I'm going to go in and
clean this thing up and get it ready for
Jesse and then we can move on to
building my brother PC feel like we
should've done this two to two separate
videos but whatever it is what it is
let's do this
I'm wanting a jacket by the way cuz it's
freezing outside
don't mind me
I just realized I got a replace that
broken fan - before I give it to him god
damn look at you gone
this is why ladies and gentlemen you got
to make it a habit to dust your PC at
least I mean what two three months I
would say if you're really lazy do it do
it every three months you know but don't
let it get this bad
good as new
all right Papa's gonna take care of you
think we're good actually while I'm
doing that let me get rid of this fan
and this broken fan blade this is what
it looks like without the blade ladies
and gentlemen all right so I'm actually
gonna swap it with this fresh new 140
millimeter fans plug this in the
motherboard real quick all right so the
only thing left to do is install a fresh
copy of Windows and then wait for Jesse
to arrive so that I can give this to him
step on over here put on the camera
don't be shy take a look at you what's
up my husband
nice to meet you nice to meet you so
here it is man big red in the flesh have
you seen the original video when I built
this PC which is our almost four years
ago it's been a while all right get out
of here that's it you're done let me
open this up for you so did a lot of
cleaning in there of course I replaced
the top fan it was actually broken I
don't know where it is now but doing a
brand new course er ml 140 fan it's
white LEDs
got the gtx 980ti femicide 4930 k-6 core
processor 12 creds and you got 32 gigs
of ram so this is gonna be set for you

jump from from from ps4 yeah do
congratulations again thanks for coming
out here enjoy a PC do not break it you
can sell it if you want I won't make a
video on or anything but it's it's yours
take your camera man this has a lot of
sentimental value it was passed down for
me to my brother which did not take good
care of it I'm hoping take good care of
I think I'm giving you an air duster
anyways yeah that's pretty much it for
me guys I'm gonna go back to building
the PC for my brother
so after two weeks the build is finally
complete and the reason why I took two
weeks is because I to leave for CES and
then when I got back I got the flu I'm
still recovering by the way so I just
take another week off and in the
meantime I got a haircut new background
so a lot of things that's changed from
the beginning of this video in case you
guys are wondering but Eddie who's I
think the build came out beautifully
what do you guys think I think there was
a good balance between white and black I
didn't do my best to try and paint as
many parts in the case as I could to
make it mostly white you know like the
radiator the pump bracket thumb screws
even the PCI brackets near the back and
the mesh filters for the top and the
front I did try to paint the grommets at
one point and realized how stupid I am
after the paint cracked while I was
putting it back inside the case lesson
definitely learned you got to use a
different type of paint for rubber but
honestly I think it looks better this
way anyways that way keeps the white on
black contrast consistent graphic build
so there were two snags that I came
across while building this PC the first
one being that the motherboard does not
have a USB 2 header why asus I don't
even know how I overlooked that but
because of it I wasn't able to hook up
the pump and the Corsair note pro to
control the RGB lighting for the front
two fans and honestly it's kind of
stupid not to include at least one USB 2
header on a motherboard I don't care
about the mini ITX I've seen it on a lot
of mini ITX boards but for some reason
this board does not have one kind of
disappointing but anyways I wanted
Amazon and I found a solution so I
bought two of these adapter cables it's
basically a way around not having any
USB headers on the board so you plug one
end of it to an actual USB port and the
other end to whatever you need to
connect the downside to this is you have
to use up your USB ports in the back of
your PC I actually got lucky with this
case because instead of having to drill
a hole on the side panel throughout the
cable back inside the PC all I did was
just remove the hard drive cover in the
back and sneak the cable inside other
than those two minor snags it's been a
very smooth build and the 77 decay has
been overclocked to 5 gigahertz on all
cores temps are really cool and it's
very silent it's actually wedding heaven
benchmark right now and you guys can't
hear anything like it's it is dead
silent right now and not about those are
for this video I do have a buttload of
PC bills coming up guys
I'm actually be upgrading my PC back at
home I'm gonna be giving big red the
r-tx treatment it's gonna be a
water-cooled epic bill you guys don't
want to miss that I do have some bill
guides coming up as well and other water
cool projects as well I gotta catch up
on PC Bill's on that channel I know I've
been slacking guys my apologies if you
guys enjoyed this video and want to see
more types of this content make sure to
smack the crap out of that like button
and please don't feel bad by disliking
if that is what your heart desires
I am completely fine with that I'll drop
a link to all the parts used in this
build I think my brother's gonna like it
it's gonna be psyched when he sees this
and if you guys want to see a time-lapse
video of this PC from start to finish
I'll also drop a link to that as well
there's a lot of stuff I've done to it
that I've been include in this video
because it would be a very long video
it's actually still pretty long video
and I apologize for that
I don't know why I'm still rambling Oh
guys hey guys thank you so much for
watching as always I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
