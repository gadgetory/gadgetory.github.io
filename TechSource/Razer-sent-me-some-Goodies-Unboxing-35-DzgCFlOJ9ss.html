stories welcome back to another what's
in the box episode a series where I
figure out what's in the box we only
have four boxes this time so might be a
short episode but this is the box that
I'm most excited about guys this is from
Razer and he told me they're sending me
some goodies to review on the channel so
I'm excited I don't know what's inside
here but we're gonna keep this to the
end because you guys know how we do it
we start with the small boxes and we end
up with the big ones so with that said
ladies gentlemen let's start up with
this okay so this one is actually from a
coolermaster oh it's a bag inside of a
bag okay okay what is this
Wow guys I got a shirt from coolermaster
and I'm actually excited because I'm
tired of wearing the same shirt over and
over again you guys probably saw this
Game of Thrones
shirt so many times in the video so
finally got something to change it up so
Thank You coolermaster I was actually
too Bob there's one for you also in the
bag we've got some stuff some storage
from xpg you have an SSD and an MDOT -
this is actually going into the build
actually I can't say it's a secret guys
I can't tell you what Bill that's going
into but it's going to a bill obviously
also from a data we've got some RAM
sticks ooh we got two red ones and two
black so these are 3,000 megahertz eight
gigabyte sticks so a total of 32 gigs
okay not bad and it appears that there
are GB judging by the white plastic
piece on top so hi guys let's move on to
the next box which is from eeek actually
no I lied it's also from Coolermaster
this is a smaller box so check this one
out
okay this is just a cooler master power
supply this is the V 750 so yeah nothing
too exciting just the power supply
s is the box from ek I wonder what's
inside here I did request a few things
from them I'm curious if this is one of
the items or all of them in one box
we'll find out I guess
oho they sent in - wow that's insane I
don't know that we're gonna send both of
them so guys this is the new ek RGB 360
kits it's an all-in-one liquid cooling
kit for your PC and they sent over the
360 version as well as the 240 I did
post a poll on Twitter and asked you
guys if you wanted to see a water
cooling build guide so that's what this
is for I'm gonna be using the 360 kit
from ek and do a step-by-step build
guide on how to use this kit on either
up getting your PC or starting a fresh
water cooled build so yeah very excited
about that guys if you want to see that
make sure you stick around I don't know
I don't know why I did that so okay
there's a bunch of stuff in here but
essentially this kit comes with a CPU
block you have your pump reservoir combo
as well as a 360 millimeter radiator or
if you guys pick up the 240 kit you will
get a 240 millimeter radiator instead
and of course its RGB not only defends
but also the pump and the CPU block
itself can be lit into whatever color
you guys want let's put these aside
and get to the main event of the evening
guys I'm so excited
Oh razor what do you have for me
let's check this out baby okay you ready
Bob you he's smiling - you get a smiley
oh my god okay okay
that goes my knife so smooth box there's
nothing on here so I don't know what the
hell is that whoa what okay this a bunch
of stuff in here this is the first thing
I've noticed actually it goes the knife
again got then the first one is
obviously a GPU they sent over a
founders edition 1080 tae TI guys okay
actually I lied it's not a TI why why
did I say - yeah it's a 1080 but okay
they sent it why did they send me a GPU
what's in this one oh this is another
GPU this is a sapphire I'm guessing 570
or 580 it's a 570 it's a 578 gigabyte
graphics card which I'm guessing that's
something to do with this box let's open
this up
all right oh dude this is the new razor
corex
oh my god so guys this is the new razor
corex it's an external GPU solution
which uses Thunderbolt 3 and you can
connect that to you anything that
supports Thunderbolt 3 so it's at your
laptop or MacBook and you can hook up a
GPU to it and use a GPU so if you want
do gaming or any GPU accelerated
programs that's what this is basically
for we did pick up a 2018 macbook
recently so we're gonna be hooking this
up to it and do some testing so yeah
alright guys moving on to this box over
here which I think I would have an idea
what this is oh my god it's so thin I'll
make the box is thin like you imagine
the laptop oh my god
I want you guys to hear this
you

2018 razor blade I believe it's the 15
inch model let's pop this open look at

gaming of course in terms of
productivity the whole shebang we're
gonna cover everything between these two
laptops so if there's anything specific
