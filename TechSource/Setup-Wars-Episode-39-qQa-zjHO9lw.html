inside will quick and what the hell
what's up guys it's tech from Texas and
welcome to setup wars episode 39 where
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel if you want to
submit your desk setup make sure to
watch the video linked down below if the
video is private I am no longer
accepting submissions because I am
jam-packed in submissions so yeah let
the setup wars begin
as always everyone's gear for the setups
will be linked down below if anyone is
interested but here are your 5 lucky
contestants we have Jack Justin Martin
Ming and Ryan congratulations for making
it to setup wars episode 39 so first up
is Jack with a compact black and red
setup we have a 22 inch tail touch
screen monitor ATT esports mecca g-unit
keyboard m SIDS 100 miles on top of the
SteelSeries mouse pad also on the desk
we have a custom modded xbox 360
controller a pair of those companion 3
speakers and a red lamp to stay
consistent with the theme mounted
against the wall on some ghetto raked
hangers we have some headphones the p12
s from Turtle Beach and AKG K 99 s hey
at least they are in ready to mattress
setup
fantabulous job with cable management
all the wires are resting neatly on the
ever-so-popular IKEA Signum rack that I
am sick and tired of seeing and powering
this set up is a badass PC inside the
stunning NZXT s340 case we have an AMD
a10 78 50 K paired with an r9 390 GPU
which is being cooled by the Triton core
CPU cooler I know it's not my place to
comment on PC builds for setup wars but
you might want to update your CPU
because you're most likely experiencing
bottlenecking
on CPU intensive games like GTA 5 ARMA 3
and others if I can upgrade an FX 6300
or an 80 320 is what I would recommend
but yeah overall a very clean and
straightforward setup nothing I would
really recommend thank you jack for
entering okay so this next desk is I
don't even know what to say it's kind of
like a fortified battle station so it
took him ten weeks to build it and it
cost around 1100 bucks worth of material
so we have chrome diamond platings
around the borders the table top and
side panels are made out of MDF wood an
entire thing was hand painted black so
on this battle station we have three
Asus 23.6 inch monitors a courser K 65
RGB keyboard
Logitech g6
mouse and Logitech z3 23 speakers the
main purpose of this desk was to
eliminate the sight of all wires
according to Justin and I think he
succeeded no wires in sight it looks
like everything was hooked up against to
move the desk and we got a bunch of
clips and tape holding up the cables and
power strips job well done this must
have taken a long-ass time I especially
like the modded USB hubs you have
implemented on the monitor riser - in
fact which is awesome you know for a
giant desk like this you definitely
don't have a lot of stuff on it and it
just feels kind of empty normally I'm
trying to keep things off the desk for a
more clean look on setup wars but in
this case put some more crap on your
desk man it's a shame to have all of
that space go to waste but very
impressive setup Justin thank you so
much for showing off your battle station
finally away from that dark cave and
into something a little brighter
we have Martin's a single display set up
a 24-inch Dell monitor CM storm
suppressor keyboard and logitech g502
proteus core Mouse also on the desk we
have a pair of Logitech z5 23 speakers
and a HyperX cloud gaming headset
resting on top of the PC I kind of like
the angle of this setup it's not your
usual flat and parallel setup you have a
bit of attitude so since the PC cover is
open let's dive inside will quick first
up I like to mention that the old white
build lets do you have a white frackle
define our for case a white power supply
black and white cables Ram sticks and
even the CPU cooler is black and white
it's running on a Xeon e3 12:31 v3
processor an Asus GTX 970 Strix gravis
card 60 megabytes of RAM and goddamn
that cable management very very
impressive I feel like if you can cable
manage your PC that well you can cable
manage your setup pretty clean for the
most part but if you really want to hide
all those cables you can use some 3m
tape and stick it on the back of that
power strip and hook it up to the roof
of your desk also plus one on that tray
under your desk that's holding up your
laptop looks like it was custom made by
Martin himself the only obvious thing I
recommend is a headphone hangar for your
hyper X's and you have just a spot for
them right there next to your PC you can
think
later very clean and sexy setup Martin
thank you for entering and before we
have made with another single display
setup we have a 22 inch AUC monitor on
top of a riser and below that we have a
whoa whoa whoa is that an alienware pc
I'm sorry I'm throwing this setup in the
trash that is unacceptable get out of
here I'm just kidding relax so on the
desk we have the stock Alienware
keyboard a razer deathadder mouse on top
of the courser extended mouse pad we
also have a pair of Logitech Z 200
speakers which are hooked up to the
denim DJ headphones what is it with all
these Logitech speakers I don't get it
holding up a ton of 3bs is the Geisel
phone stand and wow look at that samurai
sword that's hiding over there in the
corner that's pretty cool kale
management is pretty good it seems like
you tied everything together and just
toss them in the corner behind your desk
not a bad way to save some time so that
wire just hanging down from the desk is
kind of bothering me so why not hook it
up to the back of your PC regardless
it's a pretty cool setup Thank You Ming
for entering this last setup we'll take
your OCD levels to the next level not
only do we have two different size
monitors which are not aligned perfectly
but we have a rainbow-colored set up
purple LEDs orange salt lamp brown
headphones green keyboard and mouse pad
and last but not least a black and blue
dxracer chair first ever seal of
disapproval congratulations
why am i such an asshole in this episode
so one of us we have a Razer BlackWidow
Ultimate keyboard a Phoenix na c2 mouse
on top of the Goliath this extended
mousepad some other things on a desk
include the sennheiser HD 598 headphones
on the Kosmos headphone stand and a pair
of cliffs pro media speakers finally
speakers that are not Logitech so the PC
that's powering this setup is running on
a 4790k and a gtx 980ti not bad cable
management is flawless we have the power
strip attached to the roof of the desk
with some velcro straps and the IKEA
Signum rack once again
holding up all of those cables other
than some minor OCD issues I have with
the set up I think it's great and hey if
it works it works Thank You Ryan for
entering sets for this week's episode of
setup wars you guys know what to do drop
your comments down below and vote on who
you think has the best desk setup as

wars and I'll see you in the next
