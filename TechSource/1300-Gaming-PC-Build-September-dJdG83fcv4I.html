and this is Phoenix the gaming PC for
the month of September now normally I
would do PC builds that give you the
most bang for your buck but this time I
wanted to change things up a bit and
build you guys a very good-looking PC
that's upgradable in the future I also
want to give huge thanks to gigabyte fan
Tex and crucial for setting these parts
in and making this build possible and
also drop a link to all the parts
mentioned in this video
link below for you guys now if this
price point is a bit too much for you
guys and you don't plan on upgrading in
the future then i've put together
another list using most of these parts
that will cost you around $800 instead
and you can find the links to the parts
for that down below as well so starting
off we have the i-5 6500 a very solid
quad core processor that will handle any
game you throw at it now because this PC
is upgradable in the future I did go
with the fantex
TC 12 DX CPU cooler and also the
gigabyte z170 and gaming 5 motherboard
this will ensure that you will get the
highest overclock on your CPU if you
decide to go with an unlocked processor
z170 n gaming 5 motherboard has a very
appealing black and red color scheme
with some white accents and it features
two DIMM slots with support of up to 32
gigabytes of ddr4 memory and it also has
two set of Express and one m2 connector
I do like the fact that it comes with a
dual band wireless connection plus
Bluetooth 4.2 and a reinforced PCI slot
which is set to be 3.2 times stronger
compared to traditional slots overall a
very solid z170 board and one of the
best that you can buy for any ITX build
so I went with the white and red fantex
cooler to keep the color scheme of the
build consistent and also because it
does a great job keeping the CPU at very
low temps while producing virtually no
fan noise in fact here's a quick sample
during full load crucial sent me their
ballistics sport LT Ram which not only
looks amazing but it's also one of the
fastest rated Ram sticks with timing
speed of 16 they are also priced a
fairly low compared to other similar
rated ddr4 Ram I did go with two sticks
of eight gigabytes each right off the
bat and
upgrading later on for storage I went to
the coarser 480 gigabyte SSD and one
terabyte hard drive space from Seagate
but there is room for an MDOT 2 SSD
later in the future for the graphics
card I opted for the gigabyte gtx 1060
g1 gaming that comes out of the box with
a boost clock of 1847 megahertz in
overclock mode which can be enabled
within the extreme engine utility also
within a software you can manually
overclock the GPU set fan curves and
even change the color of the words on
the side of the GPU it's not a bad
looking graphics card it's got a neutral
black look with some orange accents near
the front which you won't be able to see
anyway since the card is facing
downwards in the case that's a decent
looking back plate - although I do wish
the gigabyte logo would also light up
for ports you get the standard HDMI 2.0
B and 3 DisplayPort 1.4 and it only
requires a single 8 pin PCI connector
speaking of power gigabyte sent me their
new 1200 watt 80 + platinum fully
modular power supply I know
it's overkill even with future upgrades
like a Titan X the most you'll ever need
is an 800 watt power supply but gigabyte
sent this over for the build so why not
include it the power supply has a pretty
cool design with an orange 140
millimeter fan and it's also fully
modular which is great since you can
only plug in the cables that you need
I'm also very surprised that they were
able to keep the form factor very small
most other 1200 watt power supplies are
very long making it difficult to install
in some ITX or micro ATX cases the power
supply also comes with flat black cables
which is nice to see instead of the
usual ketchup and mustard cables but I
decided to go with the Fant X custom
extensions instead for a much cleaner
look and finally housing all these parts
as the fan techs and to evolve ITX case
which is not my personal favorite mini
ITX case it comes in either red and
black or white or an old black color
scheme and it features two USB 3.0 ports
in the front and a clear side panel the
chassis is made out of steel with some
plastic parts throughout the case and it
has a ton of space for cable management
and even water cooling it comes with
this massive 200 millimeter fan in the
front with room for an additional 140
millimeter fan in the rear as well as
radiator support on the top it doesn't
even stop there
near the back you get to hard drive bays
that don't require any tools as well as
a slide and lock tray for the SSD
despite its small size the Evolve ITX
can support full-size graphics cards as
well and that's because of the brilliant
design the modular tray over here simply
goes over the GPU allowing you to
install an extra hard drive an SSD or
even a reservoir right on top but you
will need to buy an extra tray which is
sold separately I was definitely happy
to see lots of space in the back for
cable management the grommets are nice
and so are the velcro straps but
honestly I would have loved to see more
cutouts near the back as routing the
cables alongside the corners proved to
be difficult since I couldn't really tie
the cables to anything the cable
management would have looked a lot
cleaner if I didn't use extensions if I
just stuck with the stock PSU cables it
would have looked so much better
adding extension simply doubles the
amount of cables you have to work with
and everything just looks more cluttered
even with the extra set of cables I was
surprised that I managed to fit
everything behind the PC without forcing
the side panel back on if you guys are
planning on a mini ITX build I would
highly recommend you to check this case
out I really love it and you actually
have bigger versions of this case but
I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to see for yourself so before
we get into the benchmarks I want to
give you huge things to videoblocks for
sponsoring this video video blocks has
the largest unlimited download library
of stock video after effects and motion
backgrounds on the web with over 10
million dollars in content with the
video blocks membership you guys get
access to over two million clips for 40%
off per clip compared to competitive
sites and over 100,000 free clips are
included with your membership as well
this is because videoblocks takes 0
percent commission on its sales passing
all the savings on to its members also
in the month of September video blocks
is releasing their new authentic
collection including over 2,000 new
videos let's face it stock videos can
look very fake and artificial at times
so video blocks is actually challenging
this with their new collection which
features real people in real videos
during your 7 day free trial you can
download 140 pieces of content for free
and you also get access to their new
authentic collection so guys make sure
to visit videoblocks comm /youtube to
sign up with a 7 day free trial and I'll
drop a link to them down
as well alright so moving on to the fire
strike benchmark fennecs got a score of
10,000 173 putting it right below the 2
our X 480 build from August and pretty
much doubling the rest of the builds on
the channel keep in mind that this score
would be the same even if you go with
the $800 configuration I talked about
earlier in this video and that's because
the CPU and graphics card are the same
for render times FedEx is the second
fastest PC compared to my other builds
barely getting beat by the FX 83-78 core
processor from red twin I so that's
enough of that nonsense how does the PC
perform while gaming in 2k resolution
that's 2560 by 1440 P by the way you
guys can find the current realtime FPS
in the top left corner of the screen or
with always taking more time let's take
a look at the benchmarks
so there you guys have it some very
impressive numbers from the gigabyte gtx
1060 g1 gaming graphics card for AA $800
you guys can play majority of the games
in 2k resolution in high settings above
60fps that's pretty impressive if you
guys have a bit more to spend I would go
with the future expandability route 2
which is basically the same PC featured
in this video which will give you lots
more room for upgrades but if you only
have $800 to drop on a PC then the
alternate build that I link below will
get you the same performance that you
saw in this video but remember that you
won't have any room for upgrades in the
future but that is it for the video as
always if you guys enjoy my monthly PC
builds please leave a like as it does
help the channel a lot and I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
