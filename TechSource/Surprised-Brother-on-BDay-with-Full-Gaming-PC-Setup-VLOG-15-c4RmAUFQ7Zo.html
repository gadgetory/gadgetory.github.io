and welcome to another vlog on the
channel this one's going to be a little
different because you see it's a very
special video my brother's birthday is
coming up on October 21st which is the
Saturday and I kind of want to surprise
them so I'm taking them to paintballing
with a few friends and my cousin's also
coming and also afterwards I'm going to
give them a surprise this is what I'm
gonna give him so I'm sure a lot of you
guys know about the big red this is the
PC I've been using for the past two
years until I replaced it with the
iBUYPOWER PC that was sent to me and
this is going to be temporary until I
build my water-cooled PC in the next I
think three or four months I want to
make any promises
but anyways I'm going to give him the PC
I'm gonna give them a keyboard a nice
gaming monitor and of course a mousepad
but there's one problem as you can see
the GPU is missing I didn't get a Titan
X in there and I sold it or something
not even what happened with it so we
have to put in a GPU but everything else
is pretty much in there you got the RAM
sticks you got the 49 30 K processor H
100i CPU cooler and that's a 1200 watt
power supply which is overkill but I'm
too lazy to take that out so I'm just
going to give them that and some paint
is chipped off from the heat spreaders
as you can see but overall it is in
tip-top shape and it works 100% the
keyboard of choice is the coarser RGB
strafe I'm giving them this as well
because he has a pretty crappy membrane
keyboard we also have a really nice
black and red mouse pad to match the
theme and of course nao C 144 Hertz 27
inch gaming monitor so 144 Hertz it's
got one millisecond response time it
does have free sync but doesn't really
matter because it is 144 Hertz so it
won't experience any screen tearing so
all I got to do is put on a GPU in there
and then pretty much clean up the dust
and it should be good to go I was on
periscope earlier today and asked you
guys what the GPU I should put in that
out what GPU I should put in there a lot
of you guys voted so let's take a look
at what you guys paid so this is my
storage unit a lot of you guys have
probably seen this out
many times either on Twitter or on my
youtube channel but let's get to the
real matter here the GPU I have a few
options to choose from he only plays
Warcraft 3 and he maybe wants to stream
so obviously I want to give them a 1080
or even a 1070 as that would be overkill
so you guys on periscope decided to go
with the gtx 980ti since I have these
laying around and I'm gonna go with the
msi option because we've got to keep
consistent with the theme of course also
let me know if you guys want a separate
video on just my storage unit I can go
over all the parts I have and stuff like
that if you guys are interested if so
let me know by dropping any like alright
so this is pretty much everything he's
getting the only reason I didn't include
a mouse because I gave him a me onyx
caster I think four or five months ago
so he's pretty much set on the mouse but
everything else is pretty awesome I hope
he's going to be stoked I cannot wait to
film his reaction
all right she's looking pretty already
it's gonna find out what I did with
those thumb screws ain't gonna I got to
make sure tighten this back up and then
it's pretty much good to go
this looks kind of empty that there's no
SSDs in here so I don't know maybe I'll
give him an SSD later but so far so good
big red is going to be back up and
running very excited to give this my
brother so I just realized that I forgot
to test the PC as I was screwing in the
final thumb screw
so I'm too lazy I'm just going to grab
the whole thing take it downstairs
dust it off real quick put them aside
tunnel and that should be it
all right so everything is done let's go
ahead and boot it up see if it even
trends on okay
we have liftoff so looks like all the
fans are spinning the GPU is working
coolers working so yeah I don't have any
storage right now so I can't really boot
up windows so we're gonna have to wait
and see all right so everything is done
the only thing left is the surprise
itself and that is going to be on Sunday
following the 21st of October so very
excited guys I hope he is happy to see
the PC and the monitor and keyboard and
last stuff so I'm actually really
excited to see his reaction so I'll see
you guys on Sunday I swing downstairs
right now taking a dump
afterwards I'm gonna come and show him
his surprise which is point head
all right open that's all yours
dig in go thick think you like this is
garbage this a monitor exactly 144 Hertz
one millisecond response time and you
get a pretty badass keyboard better than
your crappy membrane how do you feel
what are your thoughts drill this is
good too solid
I'll take it got a bomb 49 30k six core
processor msi gtx 980ti even though it's
last year's iteration still a beast and
obviously going to add your storage in
there so as you set up you can use your
other monitor for streaming so yeah when
you very much is this total total cost I
don't know like PC alone is like 1500
maybe 1800 probably $2,000 worth what
happen if you want a dollar amount but
money is not what's important it's how
you can use this baby so we're trying
out a few headsets so you 20 likes so
you got the Logitech G 230 that's the
corsair void and also gonna try out the
lenovo ygb stereo headset which everyone
up which everyone feels comfortable I
guess what do you think comfortable try
the mic pull out mic bar if you use the
mic but sometimes those get hot is good
cool
good for poor girl Michael the v-neck
v-neck Michael Christmas it's Christmas
in the middle of October that's a good
brand so well it is a budget its budget
headphones I think those are like 25
bucks okay so it does make sense I mean
the voids are the most expensive and
then comes the Lenovo and then the g2 30
so costs the most you get you pay what
you get for you know what you pay to
repeat that again
that is it so basically coarser gear I
got the coarser keyboard coarser headset
different mousepad out and the Alec and
monitor there you just say no let's say
you see so the guys have a pretty quick
video hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did leave a like and I will see you guys
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
