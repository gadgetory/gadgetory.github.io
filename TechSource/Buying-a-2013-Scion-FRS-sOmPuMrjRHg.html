film my day because it's another happy
day indeed I am selling my cyan oh seven
grade car by the way
I'm beginning a new 2013 FRS black color
oh man I can't wait to get it I'm
actually on my way to Carmack's
to sell this get a check i'ma go
straight to the scion dealer and pick it
up that have a new addition to the
family it's gonna be amazing they this
car has not given me a single problem at
all it's been perfect for me the only
thing I the change was the brakes once
and because of normal wear and tear and
just an oil change every 5,000 miles I
put the best in in synthetic oil change
I always take care of all my vehicles
and honestly I think it's time to give
it away I had it since oh 6 November 2
2007 scion tc and I just couldn't resist
the new look of the FRS so oh let me get
to my car max I'll go ahead and film
again and I'll see you guys soon all
right guys I'm here at Carmack's there
it is ladies and gentlemen and see what
kind of a deal that can give me on my
car I have a number in my mind
10200 they put any number
greater than that I'll take it otherwise
I'm selling it it's a good
credit my car and so expect a lot
more I'll see you guys soon good hey
guys I'm here to sign either they give
me a shitty lap car max they see what
they gave me he's speaking here you so
I'm here hopefully at least and off the
car
and purchased a new Horace I'll see ya
soon so this is f RS 2013 model Scion
I'm not really interested in the silver
one either black or white but this is
what it looks like it's pretty badass
car actually
they introduced this I think June of
2012 this year
Oh Punk
three years think I look pretty badass
in here huh oh I definitely feel
that the sporty look for sure feels like
I'm in a Lamborghini not that I know
where Lamborghini feels like
we're still here it's been about an hour
most thing you lose like 9,000 for
trading but I know I can get 95 carmack
so they can't match the price I'm
probably going back there and get that
instead but the long-ass process and I
hope it's over soon
all right guys come again for us come on
upgrade huh oh oh yes good I'll
with this one I got a pretty good deal
on it Oh mommy said I trained for two
years oh yeah the circuit
that's the key they still kept the same
design I guess I loved it I just
bespoke Bobby's book
spot for I am I'm so happy right
now this is ridiculous okay so I went to
got my FRS tinted yesterday I think you
can agree that it looks even more badass
a few things you'll notice is one the
camera quality I went and bought a GoPro
Silver Edition drop 300 bucks on let's
go and get better quality pics and
videos I guess I'm really doing this for
the viewers not me I don't care but I
keep getting messages saying Amen you
should get a freaking helmet camera or a
better quality video camera so you can
shoot better pics and videos like okay
so that's that I got the limo tint of
course for the passenger driver's side
and the rear and I cannot see at
night so I don't know the bad decision
or not but it looks pretty badass though
I mean I'm not gonna be driving them
most of the time anyways I have my bike
over there to drive I would say maybe
25% I'll be driving the bike the car but
just have a better camera let me show
you guys inside the only thing bad about
the GoPro is I can't really see what I'm
filming that's the big negative but
modern I'm still trying to get used to
if I don't like it I'll probably end up
returning it
the only bad thing I noticed about this
car is the rear seats the seats in the
back that's barely any room for
passengers
see that it's literally touching the
back seat so it's kind of suck ass I
have to literally pull the seat all the
way forward for someone to sit in the
back but make sure just made us a
two-seat car and why they made a
four-seater no reason on the back
plenty of room actually they should with
the trunk smaller and have some for the
back seats in my opinion that's what I
think I don't know but yeah this is it
and this is my forest a new addition to
my family this is my CBR 600 2012 Honda
I ordered so many mods on this bike it's
going to be coming in the next few weeks
our two brothers exhaust
I ordered crg levers with colours I
ordered a rear seat Cowell I ordered
rear and front tire huggers what a side
order I think that's about it I know the
one thing else but I forgot what it was
but ok too soon I'll do either
installation video on it or
before-and-after pic on how it looks
like but yeah if you notice also the new
roads almost I installed pretty cool I
think that's about it though yeah this
is it if you guys like the like that
forest I just leave a comment I guess
like this like do what you want I just
want to show you guys a few other things
before I head out was the engine it's
got a Subaru boxer engine this car has
200 horsepower at 150 150
twork it's also we will drive most of
the Toyotas if not all of them have
front-wheel drive but this one
specifically designed it to have wheel
drive which means better control at the
wheel
and you can actually feel bad but this
is it
I'm gonna do a quick test drive actually
and you guys can see how it I guess I
don't know feels like them inside in
close this so yeah let's go take this
alright
all right here we go sucks I can't pull
the windows down cuz these tins are
fresh
so that's hopeful cop doesn't pull me
over if he does I'll be interesting with
you
I want to switch the Tiptronic actually
control my own views which is pretty
awesome control
if the RPMs drop a bit too low the car
actually automatically down shifts for
you
for safety reasons I'm missing
very nice very smooth I love the
handling on this it's amazing
Toyota finally did something right
I just wish there was more legroom -
honestly I just that's a bummer but you
know I'm not complaining or anything
it's definitely fun yeah they want to be
driving to China mom send a lot of medic
so the base price of this is actually
22,000
out the door including the peaceful
audio that I got at a total grand price
of 29,000 out the door the thing about
the Scion cars is that the price cannot
be changed no matter what they do the
cells we can add or the order price for
you is a set price that's the key is is
a step slider you can really bargain the
price when you're purchasing it so
but doesn't bother me at all
I'm okay Kingdom which for a nice car
living a lot of pensioners though is bad
fairly new car there's not me English
beats right now so when people do see it
at first they wondering what the hell is
that kind of a car is that first glimpse
looks like an Aston Martin from the side
after they look at the sign logos all
the cool size tells you they're far as
that came out I guess
well that's it you guys I hope you
enjoyed the video feel free to share
your comments button below now you guys
know where I live but yeah if you guys
want to see more reviews and mic mods on
installation and stuff you feel free to
subscribe I try to upload a video once a
week on it so you guys can definitely
see what's going on but yeah thanks for
watching I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
