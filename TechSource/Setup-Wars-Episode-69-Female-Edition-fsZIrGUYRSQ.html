waiting for this episode for a long time
ladies and gentlemen welcome to setup

on the channel so if you guys want to
participate make sure to watch the video
linked below so without wasting any more
time let the set up or is begin

AECOM because they have the cheapest CD
keys available for pretty much any game
I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out as always you
guys can find everyone's gear for the
setups link below but here are your five
contestants for this episode we have
Claire crystal Joanne Olivia and Valerie
congratulations for making it on the
show so starting off the show we have
Claire and her laptop setup we have the
15-inch MacBook that's powering up
everything including the tiny Hitachi TV
off to the right side the keyboard and
mouse of choice are both from Apple of
course and we also have a drawing tablet
and I'm assuming that Claire is an
artist judging by the drawing pad and
the posters over there I was like how
you mounted both of the creative
speakers on both sides of the wall
overall the cable management is great I
didn't get a clear shot of under your
desk but from what I can see you did a
pretty good job hiding all of the wires
you also seem like a very organized
person I love that you added labels on
each drawer to separate the stuff that
you put in there take notes boys and
finally near the top we have the gaming
setup a 50-inch 4k Smart TV from Samsung
that's hooked up to the Xbox one and 360
with a set of LEDs in the back as well
as under the Shelf a very clean and
organized setup no doubt
Thank You Claire for entering crystal
meth is next up with a very sweet white
and black set of wow that is a very nice
picture let me just sew on the desk we
have a 27 inch Samsung monitor Viper
mechanical keyboard and the Logitech m1
85 wireless mouse the cleanliness and
organization continues great work with
cable management and just look how clean
the drawers are it also looks like you
added some custom fabric in each drawer
kind of similar to what I did but
instead I used velvet material instead
crystal has also added some black tape
around the edges of the Alex your units
which I think looks very nice and
contributes to the overall color scheme
there's also a BM 800 mic hooked up to a
boom arm so I'm guessing you do
voiceovers or something similar
our headphone of choice is the
Sennheiser HD 439 which is resting on a
hanger and we also have a pair of
creative t12 wireless speakers I kind of
like how you split your setup on one
side we have all work and on the other
side is all play speaking of all play
the PC that she's rocking has a 6600 and
I GTX 970 a very clean and organized set
up that has purpose Thank You crystal
for entering and number three we have
Joanne and yet another clean single
motor setup using one of my personal
favorite desks of all time the IKEA mom
desk on that sexy monitor riser you have
the 27-inch Dale gaming monitor and
below that we have a ps4 that's skin by
deep bands for peripherals we have a
Razer BlackWidow keyboard sent a
revolution Pro Mouse that's sitting on
top of the reflex lab mousepad and
finally for audio we have the pair of
Logitech Z 623 speakers and a HyperX
cloud 2 headset that's chilling on the
brainwaves trust hanger excellent choice
on the gaming headset by the way cable
management is great utilize the rack to
keep all the cables and parish ships on
there and you know what actually notice
something very familiar now that I look
at it a bit more the bottom portion of
this desk kind of looks like my perfect
desk setup from episode 1 we have the
headset hanger on the left and a USB hub
on the right with the cloud to remote
extension I also give you props for
keeping the miscellaneous items and a
drawer and away from sight the PC does
powering the setup has a 6700 K and a
GTX 1080 for the win that's hell of a
building out there definitely diggin the
white extensions I mean what can I say
this is a very clean organized and
symmetrical setup the three pictures on
the top are parallel with your desk and
they are evenly spaced out you even went
a step further to add a phone stand on
one side in order to balance it with the
Nathan Drake statue job well done one
thing I do want to say is be careful
with that heater being next to your PC
when you turn it on it will affect the
temperatures in your rig so just keep an
eye on the temps while gaming or doing
work and make sure it doesn't get too
hot in there overall excellent work and
Thank You Joanne for entering all the
way from the UK we have Olivia and
another single display set up so you
have a 27 inch Samsung monitor as
being sandwiched by two Mackey cr3
speakers and then below that we have a
steel series apex 350 keyboard and
cursor m65 Mouse I guess I'm a little
confused on the color scheme I see that
you are going for some green accents but
the LEDs on your keyboard and mouse are
red which kind of throw it off a bit
kale management does look okay at least
all the cables are on the rack but you
might want to add some more adhesive to
that LED strip because it's starting to
peel off currently she has an HP laptop
that's running a set up but she is
planning on building a new rig which we
can see over here she said it's going to
feature a 6700 K and a GTX 970 there's
definitely some personality present over
here from the coasters on the riser to
the random bike parts on the wall or
whatever that is a pretty cool setup
Thank You Olivia for entering last but
not least we have Valerie and the first
dual display setup for this episode
she's walking in a series 24 inch on the
left and a 22 inch on the right that's
paired with the Razer BlackWidow chroma
key board and Mamba Tournament Mouse
definitely digging the color scheme and
right off the bat I can tell this is
well coordinated judging by the wall
shelves on the top and the red LED lamp
personally I would have gone white
shelves and painted them red to give off
a nice contrast because the black
shelves kind of just blend in with the
wall but that's just my two cents
cable management is excellent nothing to
criticize here it looks like we have an
IKEA shelf holding up everything and I'm
not sure how I missed this but there's
another shelf behind the monitors that's
holding upper ps4 and HyperX cloud 2
gaming headset again I would slap some
skins preferably black and red which
will not only protect your ps4 from
additional scratches but it will also
make it stand out a bit more the band
offers a crap ton of materials and
colors to choose from for any console
they actually have skins for smartphones
headphones and a bunch of other devices
so make sure to check them out if you
guys aren't interested I'll drop a link
to it down below and finally the PCs
pushing these pixels has a 6700 K and an
msi gtx 970 a very nice and organized
set up with some minor tweaks needed
Thank You Valerie for entering so that
is it for this episode of setup wars as
