welcome to the top five graphics cards
under $200 for early 2016 I might be
going over temps the benchmarks and
specs and give you guys a summary of
which of these cards has the best bang
for your buck at the end of this video
so the way sing a number time let's
begin the five graphics cards that I'll
be testing in this video are the
following the zotac gtx 750ti gigabyte
r7 370 msi r9 380 EVGA gtx 950 and an
EVGA gtx 960 by the way you guys can
find all of these cards linked below if
anyone is interested to keep the
comparison fair I picked up the 2
gigabyte variants for all of the cards
but you guys are interested in the same
exact video for the 4 gigabyte variant
make sure to drop a comment down below
letting me know the PC that I'm using to
run the benchmarks is man tix that has a
6700 K which is overclocked to 4.5
gigahertz to ensure that there is no CPU
bottlenecking it also has 16 gigabytes
of RAM a dark rock pro 3 CPU cooler and
an MSI z170 i motherboard the smallest
and cheapest of them all is the zotac
gtx 750ti coming in at 104 99 on Amazon
and please keep in mind that prices do
fluctuate depending on when you're
watching this video if you just say 10
33 megahertz base clock with a 128-bit
memory bus and features one HDMI one
DisplayPort and a single dl DVI port the
gigabyte r7 370 goes for around 150
bucks and has a base clock of 975
megahertz but a 256-bit memory interface
it also features one HDMI one
DisplayPort and both DVID
and I ports it also comes with a dope
looking backplate the msi r9 380 goes
for around $180 and has a base clock of
980 megahertz 256-bit memory interface
and features these same ports as the r7
370 the EVGA gtx 950 goes for around 160
dollars and has a base clock of 11 90
megahertz a 128-bit memory interface and
features three display ports one HDMI
and one
bullying TBI and finally the EVGA gtx
960 goes for around $190 and as a base
clock of 1279
and a 128-bit memory interface with
these same ports as the gtx 950 before
we jump into the benchmarks let's take a
quick look at the temps as you can see
the two coolest cards on idle goes to
the zotac gtx 750ti and the gtx 950
coming in at just 30 degrees Celsius
followed closely by the r7 370 and the
hottest card goes to the r9 380 please
keep in mind that these temps may vary
depending on your PC case airflow room
temperatures and a few other factors I'm
just showing you these for comparison
reasons during full load the 750 Ti is
by far the coolest card and the r9 380
is the hottest followed closely by the
gtx 960 the r9 380 is also the loudest
card and you guys want to hear sound
comparisons in my next video make sure
to leave a comment below for 5 spec
benchmarks the r9 380 takes first place
with a score of 78 45 followed by the
gtx 960 then we have the 950 and third
place r7 370 and fourth and lastly the
gtx 750ti
running the Unigine Heaven benchmark we
can see that the 750 Ti had the lowest
average fps whereas the r9 380 took the
lead at 60 6.9 followed closely by the
gtx 960 similar results were shown
during the Metro last light benchmark
with the 380 being on the top and once
again closely followed by the gtx 960
and then the 750 Ti all the way on the
bottom but when it came to GTA 5
surprisingly the gtx 960 took first
place with an average FPS came out of
106 with a 380 coming in second with 105
instead once again the 750 Ti stays in
last place so based on these scores and
the current price of the graphics cards
here is your price / performance scores
the best bang for your buck graphics
card goes to the zotac 750 Ti with a
score of 1.93
and the second best graphics card for
the money goes to the EVGA gtx 950
surprisingly the r7 370 and the gtx 960
are a little too expensive for the
performance they are
are compared to the other cards if you
want to gain a noticeable amount of
performance and games and have a little
more to spend
then the gtx 950 is the obvious choice
in terms of budget however if you guys
want the best possible performance under
$200 the r9 380 is the obvious choice
over the gtx 960 if you guys enjoyed
this video or if it helped you out make
sure to leave a like to show your
support and let me know what type of
GPUs you want me to do in my next top 5
GPU video you guys want me to compare
all of these 750ti variants like the
EVGA Asus ZOTAC and all those all you
want to see a high end GPU comparison I
can type the next 980ti the r9 theory
and all of that whatever it is let me
know in the comments section down below
and as always thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
