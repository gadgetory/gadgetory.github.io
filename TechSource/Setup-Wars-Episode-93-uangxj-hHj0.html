and welcome to setup wars episode 93
where you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel if you want to
participate make sure to watch the video
linked down below you know the drill
let the set up for is begin if you guys
are shopping around for your next game
make sure to check out GQ AECOM because
they have the cheapest cd-keys available
for pretty much any game I'll drop a
link to them down below if you want to
check it out
Marcus first up with a pretty
straightforward and clean ultra light
setup he's using the 29 inch LG monitor
Corsair k70 keyboard and Logitech 502
Mouse it doesn't look like he drilled a
hole for those cables however bra do
he's rocking a sound bar from Samsung on
the top shelf
a pair of Sennheiser HD 4:29 hanging
from the side and an insignia microphone
right under the monitor the s340 case on
the table has an i7 870 inside that's
paired with an Asus GTX 950 Strix that's
been painted white to match the color
scheme very nice
cables are off the ground and on the
Signum rack so I can't really complain
here I mean realistically no one is
going to bend over and look on the your
desk so as long as the cables are not on
the ground I really can't say much
overall this is a very organized setup
thank you mark for entering next up is
TOWIE with a very nice iMac setup I'm
actually thinking about doing an apple
edition of setup wars where it's only
Apple product so let me know what you
guys think about that in the comment
section down below I think it'd be
pretty cool but anyways this setup is
running on the late 2013 27-inch iMac
and the Apple wireless keyboard and
mouse he also has a piano keyboard as
well which hints that he might be into
producing music
he's got the 8 ehm 50s and MX lv6
microphone and a Yamaha guitar to help
with that the two massive studio
monitors are the yamaha HS 7s and they
are sitting on top of custom made fans
excellent work with cable management
they are hidden very well and I like
where you mounted your focus right audio
interface the setup is put together
nicely it's just really cool to look at
but the thing that caught my attention
was the wall of devices it looks like he
framed all the Apple products that he
owned before which is pretty damn cool I
feel like every setup needs something
YOUnique like this to distinguish it
from the rest something creative that's
kind of the purpose of set up Wars to
spark your imagination and maybe give
you guys ideas on how you can improve
your setup or maybe just spice it up a
bit
Thank You pally for entering at number
three we have Ralph and his very clean
white and black set up between the s340
from NZXT that's equipped with a 6700 K
and a GTX 970 oddly enough he's walking
the same color scheme and GPU brand as
Mark from this episode he's also using
the BenQ 27-inch gaming monitor Kisa and
magic forest keyboard and SteelSeries
rival 100 RGB mouse he does have a vm
800 microphone for voice overs and 2
pairs of headphones the Sennheiser HD
201 hanging from behind a monitor and
the Sony NPR's under the desk but can we
please command the gentlemen on his
cable management you can already tell
you spend a lot of time organizing all
of this even though I was coming out of
his PC all wrapped together
Bravo well done a pretty straightforward
but clean setup nonetheless thank you
well for entering shifting gears a bit
we got Shane and his beautiful triple
infinity display setup he's walking to
27 in stamps and monitors that are
sandwiching the LG 34 inch ultra light
in the middle clean is the best word to
describe this he drilled a hole for the
Logitech G 410 keyboard and g502 Mouse
and that's pretty much all the stuff
that's on the desk other than a pair of
t full speakers you know taking out the
road empty USB microphone off the stand
to make your setup look a lot cleaner it
was a bit slick but I can obviously see
it in other pictures but regardless this
is a very clean setup and that wasn't
really necessary phenomenal job with
cable management everything is neatly
tucked inside the raceways and not a
single wire is in sight
to the router to set up are a few
drawers one of which is holding up its
PC it's built inside the fantex revolve
case with dual tempered glass side
panels and 6600 K and an Asus GTX 970
Strix what is it with asus strix cards
in this episode that's like we already
and overkill yet beautiful setup
Thank You Shane for entering speaking of
beautiful setups check this one out from
Tommy I'm personally not a fan of wooden
table tops but for some reason I like
what I see here
and that view though right in some of
the ocean could get any better
so Tommy has 227 inch curved monitors
from Samsung and a zio RGB Mex keyboard
with Logitech MX master mouse it doesn't
look like he uses headphones so instead
he relies on me Logitech G 623 speakers
and his 15 inch MacBook that powers his
setup excellent work with cable
management everything is hooked up on a
table and even his drawers are neatly
organized that's what I love to see also
props on hooking up your USB hub and SD
card reader on the desk and away from
sites so what can I say a very clean and
organized setup Thank You Tommy
