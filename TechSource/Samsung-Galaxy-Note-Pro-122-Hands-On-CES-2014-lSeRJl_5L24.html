Squarespace the one tool needed to
create your very own website or
portfolio for free trial or your first
purchase use the Kotex source one for
ten percent off what's up guys we're
back at the Samsung booth again here at
CES and today we're gonna look at
another samsung galaxy tablet this one's
called a Galaxy Note pro 12.2 as well as
the new magazine UI that comes bundled
with the tablet the only real software
change here is with the addition of the
magazine you I other than that the new
tablet is still very touch with Z you
can still write on the screen and open
window applications all with the swipe
with the included s-pen multitasking
however has improved with a new layout
which makes closing all applications and
accessing the task manager much easier
the home screen kind of reminds us of
Windows 8 with its big rectangular tiles
and glanceable information and the home
screen also does look more fuller on
this tablet as the whole screen is
taking up information instead of small
icons the tiles also can be filled with
decorative images or useful information
like emails and calendar appointments
the app drawer can still be accessed
with a toggle that is located on the
home screen the hardware is nothing new
from Samsung the materials and design
are identical to that of the note 3 with
a fake leather backing and plastic sides
making it appear like it's chrome the
only surprise here is the missing menu
button and the addition of a recent apps
button the display is also excellent
it's one of the best I've seen with
vibrant colors and pin sharp detail and
the specs are what you expect from a
high-end device you have a Snapdragon
800 for 4G access and Samsung's own
Exynos octa core chip for international
countries the tablet also comes with
three gigs of RAM and 32 or 64 gigs of
internal storage that's expandable by
microSD of course camera wise both front
and cameras are decent for being a
tablet device so nothing really
impressive there however the software is
the real star of the show here with
Samsung trying something new and tossing
out the regular android home screen in
favor of their new magazine UI which
samsung states is better for larger
displays that wraps up the video thanks
again for watching there's still a lot
to cover here at CES so make sure you
guys hit that subscribe button so you
don't miss out
so before I go I want to thank
Squarespace for making this possible and
show you guys our website yeah we do
have one in fact we had it for a while
now for those of you that did not even
know it existed we built it using square
space and it was extremely easy for us I
think we got it up and running in less
than a day everything is drag and drop
which makes it super easy to configure
and there's a bunch of awesome templates
you can choose from or you can even
start from scratch like we did this
isn't just a website you can do a lot
more with squarespace you can build your
own portfolio create an online store and
sell stuff and also scales to look
beautiful on any device the support team
is also available 24-7 if you have any
questions or run into any problems and
they offer live chat and super fast
email responses the best part about all
this is that it's free to try there's no
credit card required to sign up if you
guys do the set is set up an account use
the offer code tech source one for ten
percent off their already low prices so
that wraps up the video thanks again for
