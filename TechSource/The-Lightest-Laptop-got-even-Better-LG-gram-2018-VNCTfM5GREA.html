the lightest most powerful laptops on
the market and if you're an avid watcher
of the channel then you already know
that I reviewed the gram lineup highly
in the past and spoiler alert this new
model improves on some of the
shortcomings I noted in my previous
videos but is it worth it let's jump
right into the review so the 15-inch
model I have here features an eighth gen
Intel processor 16 gigs of DDR 4 RAM and
a total of one terabyte m2 storage with
a 1080p touchscreen IPS display with the
retail price of $2,000 it's definitely
aiming for a certain group of
individuals however they do have other
models starting at just $1100 the build
is comprised of magnesium alloy the same
material as last year's model but it
does feel sturdier around the keyboard
and trackpad area the display does have
a good amount of flex which is to be
expected with the gram being so thin and
algae likes to flex on their website by
showcasing the 7 industry test that the
laptops have passed and have to admit
it's pretty impressive the gram is
tested against shock pressure extreme
low and high temperatures and the list
goes on to boil the numbers down I feel
confident throwing this in a bag and
going on with my day something that is
surprisingly hard to find in any laptop
that shares similar dimensions
connectivity is an area that has been
improved when compared to last gen it's
mostly the same but they did give us an
extra USB 3.0 port up from 2 from last
year's we also got a single HDMI port
Kingston Lock an audio jack and a micro
SD card slots but this year the USB C
port is also Thunderbolt compatible
finally it works great with higher
resolution monitors but I see that
they're both really coming into play is
when you want to attach an external
graphics card it makes the laptop the
perfect solution for me when I'm on the
road and I still want to edit videos and
even put on a few games another area of
improvement is the battery life they've
increased the battery size from 60 watt
hour to 72 watt hour which gave me a
considerably higher score and the
see mark workbench when compared to the
last year's model my typical day with
the grammar will start at 9 a.m. and
consists of a lot of emails where
documents media consumption and web
browsing at the end of the day around 9
p.m. is when I would usually run out of
juice
the screen is the same as last years but
that's not to say it's bad it still gets
bright at around 390 minutes which I
also found was good enough to use
outdoors it also has great viewing
angles with no noticeable color shift or
banding the display is also touchscreen
which is a great addition the touch
screen feature is really nice and I
still prefer it over the trackpad
because of its accuracy I find myself
using that a lot more when scrolling
through my Twitter timeline and long
pages the 1080p resolution is nothing
mind-blowing but for the 15-inch panel
it's plenty sharp and when it's
moderately vibrant colors I found it
great for enjoying content but I
wouldn't rely on this for any
professional photo work unless you
calibrate it the camera gets you 720p
recording at 30fps and finally LG has
moved the camera from the bottom to the
top of the screen and because of this
you get a normal viewing angle compared
to what I like to call the up the nose
angle from last year's grab
unfortunately though the speaker's take
away from the whole media consumption
aspect as they are located on the bottom
and they're firing downwards
I'm guessing they went with this design
because of the constraints due to how
thin and light the laptop is but
unfortunately the end result is subpar
audio quality its tinny and doesn't have
much of a sound profile it does get
reasonably loud but again it's impacted
by the surface so if the laptop is
laying on anything that isn't a flat
surface for example like a carpet then
the sound that just gets more muffled
however the headphone jack does have DTS
which stands for digital theater system
and it sounds so much better when
listening through headphones it's really
a must when you're using a laptop in
noisy environments or if you just want
better sound quality the keyboard is
mostly the same as far as I can tell
it's still backlit which is great the
keys are spaced out evenly for comfort
and there's very
travela stands with great feedback there
was also a numpad cramped to the side
which as they must have for me I don't
care how cramped or tiny the numbers are
as long as there's a numpad on the
laptop I am happy now the trackpad uses
Windows precision drivers so it's very
accurate
one thing they did add is the
fingerprint reader that's located
underneath the power button which I
absolutely love logging in has been a
breeze and it's very accurate as well I
think it didn't recognize my finger just
once out of the entire time I've been
using it this past week and finally
let's get into the performance given the
size of the machine I was surprised it
was able to run games at 1080p at decent
frames I did have to use low settings
but still for something this small it's
impressive
lowering the resolution down to 720p
made the games more enjoyable
with higher frames but with that said
this laptops main purpose should not be
for gaming we've also included Premiere
Pro rendering test and here if you guys
plan on doing light video production we
rendered out a 1 minute and 5 minute
1080p files for your reference in case
you want to compare them to your current
laptop or PC the fans rarely kick up and
when they do you can barely hear them LG
owes in a fine job on the cooling
solution for the Graham lineup the LG
Graham has a lot of things going for it
it's thin and light all while packing in
some decent performance and a full day
battery life but with that said the
price is a little steep for what you are
getting especially if you get the max
that one that I have in the video for
$2000 if you don't plan on using the
touchscreen or don't care about the
fingerprint reader then there are more
affordable options starting at just
eleven hundred dollars and honestly that
would be my personal recommendation for
anyone looking for a powerful thin
laptop with incredible battery life LG
is currently running a campaign where
you can enter it for a chance to take
home a 13-inch lg gram or a $50 Amazon
gift card and all you guys have to do is
participate on any of their social media
channels you can increase your chances
of winning by participating in all three
but the choice is yours I'll drop a link
to their socials down below as well as a
link to the laptop if you guys want to
check it out thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
