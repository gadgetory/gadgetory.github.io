and welcome to another episode of the
best tech deals of the week as always
all of the products I mentioned in the
video will be linked down below and I
mentioned before I won't be going over a
UK and Canada deals in the video but you
guys can find the links to those
products down below as well just so the
video is short but without wasting our
time let's go alright so let's start off
with some Newegg flash deals first up is
a g35 surround sound gaming headset by
Logitech that's going for around 75
bucks and then we got the pulk and one
gaming sound bar which is currently 75%
off one for 90 bucks which will expire
on Wednesday by the way this next deal
ends on Sunday it's a 480 gigabyte SSD
from SanDisk but to be honest it's only
like 5 bucks off from the Amazon price
of $130 so it's not really a big deal if
you don't care about refurbished items
then this deal might be for you if
you're looking for a monitor it's going
for 75 bucks but keep in mind that this
is a 1680 by 1050 resolution instead of
1080p shifting over to ebay real quick
you can find the popular Logitech
performance mouse MX going for forty six
dollars compared to the Amazon price of
$60 there are many deals on Amazon this
time around we have the Logitech
surround sound Z 506 speakers going for
around 50 bucks a Samsung 40 inch 4k
smart TV going for almost 600 and a
27-inch Pankiw gaming monitor for 360
dollars you have the best specs for a
gaming monitor aside from the resolution
a 144 Hertz refresh rate with a 1
millisecond response time now let's
check out some games GTA 5 for the PC is
at an all time low
coming in at 40 bucks and that's
available for the ps4 and Xbox one as
well hitman blood money is going for two
dollars and twenty four cents and I
could have sworn I had one more game on
here but anyways I guess the AMD a10
7850 ka-piu is also on a discount but
not by that much compared to new egg
speaking of new egg we have an msi r9
380 that's $25 off that also comes with
a $10 mail-in rebate if you're
considering building the $350 gaming PC
that I did for a February or if you're
building yourself a piece
you might want to consider picking up
the EVGA 750ti
instead of the zotac one that I used in
the build since this one comes with a
mail-in rebate and it's 20 bucks off if
you don't care for open boxes you can
snag a 25 inch ultra wide LG monitor for
around 145 bucks which is a pretty good
deal and lastly on Newegg a 600 watt
power supply from be quiet that's going
for 50 bucks
this last deal is pretty crazy there's a
27 inch AUC widescreen monitor that's
going for only 130 bucks but
unfortunately it's only available
through Best Buy it has a two
millisecond response time and a 60 Hertz
refresh rate so not bad for gaming so
that's for the best tech deals of the
week as always if you guys enjoy these
make sure to leave a like and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
