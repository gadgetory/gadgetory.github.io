today we're going to be comparing the
brand new Playstation 4 pro against the
PlayStation 4 slim the main difference
between the two consoles is the specs
the ps4 slim is powered by an 8 core AMD
Jaguar CPU clocked at 1.6 gigahertz a
1.84 teraflop AMD GPU eight gigs of
gddr5 vram and it comes with a 500
gigabyte hard drive the ps4 pearl uses
the same eight core Jaguar CPU but this
time it's overclocks - 2.1 gigahertz a
more powerful 4.2 teraflop AMD GPU eight
gigs of gddr5 vram plus one gigabyte of
ddr3 memory and also it has a one
terabyte hard drive
this gives the ps4 pro a 30% boost and
CPU performance at 100 percent greater
GPU performance over the ps4 slim the
extra one gig of ram is used for
background apps allowing games to have
extra memory to use as expected power
consumption is quite different between
the two systems the ps4 slim uses up to
165 watts of power while the ps4 pro
uses almost double at 310 watts the
stock hard drive on either system can
easily be replaced for a higher capacity
one the ps4 slim uses SATA 2 which will
limit the transfer rates at up to 300
megabytes per second the ps4 pro uses
the newer SATA 3 connection which ups
the maximum transfer speed up to 600
megabytes per second this allows the ps4
pro to take advantage of the speed
increases provided by most SSDs both
consoles feature a blu-ray disc drive
plus Ethernet Bluetooth and a 5
gigahertz Wi-Fi connectivity the ps4
slim features 2 USB 3.1 gen2 on ports
and is HDR capable the ps4 pro adds an
extra USB port an optical audio port and
can support 4k in addition to HDR the
DualShock 4 controller included with
each system is also slightly upgraded
the controller can now be used over USB
to reduce lag and the touchpad can now
display a portion of the light bar as
well each system shares a similar
layered design with the ps4 pro being
larger in every dimension the ps4 is
slim measures about eleven point three
by ten point four by 1.5 and weighs
approximately four point six pounds
while the ps4 pro is about twelve point
eight by eleven point
six by two point one and weighs upwards
of seven point two pounds
the clean design definitely stands out
but the only color option as a right now
is black but if you want the option to
customize your new ps4 you can always
put ad ban skin on it I will drop a link
down below in case you guys are
interested so moving on to the games the
ps4 pro shows a noticeable difference
compared to the ps4 slim the ps4 Pro was
designed for 4k and games such as Skyrim
special edition and the Last of Us
remastered can be played in native 4k
other games that have been updated for
the ps4 Pro such as in chart at four
will run at 1440p up from 1080p on the
ps4 slim games on the ps4 Pro also look
better even on a 1080p display in this
case any game that receives a pro patch
will downsample to 1080p some games will
even get you extra visual advantages
such as improved textures and better
frame rates any game that has not been
updated will play the same as it does on
a ps4 slim with the exception of being
up scaled to 4k the first game is
infamous first light this game is
already very dark in contrast II but HDR
mode definitely changes that for the
better the game shows more overall color
and detail in the shadows and highlights
on the ps4 pro version as opposed to the
brown look on the ps4 slim the particle
effects are also given a visual upgrade
on a ps4 pro now the game can run at
1080p on the ps4 Pro giving it a sharper
image the second game is uncharted 4 on
the ps4 pro the game is sharper due to
it being rendered at a higher resolution
of 1440p the multiplayer mode runs at
the same 60fps as it does on the ps4
slim but at a resolution of 1080p
instead of 900p just like infamous first
light
uncharted 4 supports HDR as well certain
areas feel more lifelike in HDR mode
especially thanks to its lifted shadows
and controlled highlights the ps4 slim
and pro also allow you to capture your
gameplay on the ps4 slim screenshots are
limited to a resolution of 1080p and
videos are recorded in 720p at 30fps now
on the ps4 Pro screenshots are now in 4k
and recordings are in 1080p you can also
stream gameplay to youtube and 1080p
60 FPS streaming quality over remote
play or share play is now 1080p as well
an increase from 720p on the ps4 slim on
top of all that the ps4 Pro will render
the operating system in 4k so even apps
like the web browser will remain crisp
in conclusion the ps4 pro is the console
to get if you only 4k TV or want the
best graphics possible from a console
system it is also an appealing upgrade
to current ps4 owners at the price of
399 for anyone that doesn't own a ps4
and wants to get one at a lower price
then the ps4 slim might be a better
option costing less at $2.99 it is a
good value that still offers a great
gaming experience as always I'll drop a
link to both of these down below if you
guys want to check it out if you guys
enjoy these comparisons want to see more
like these in the future be sure to hit
that like button as always I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
