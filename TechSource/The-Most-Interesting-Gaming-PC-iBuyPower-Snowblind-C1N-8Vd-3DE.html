this video what's up guys it's a from
tech source and welcome to my full
review of the ibuypower snowblind PC the
configuration I have features the new
8700 k-6 core processor we got 16 gigs
of ram from a data and the gigabyte gtx
ten atti
my first impressions were wow that's
actually a pretty good-looking PC
despite them using the stock PSU cables
it's well lit the cable management is on
point there's consistency with the color
scheme and the case itself looks super
clean really the only difference between
the snowblind and their element is the
color of the case and the side panel
they are still using a modified version
of the s3 40 elite however this time you
get a clean looking white and black
version of the case with white LED fans
the main selling point of the snowblind
PC is the side panel which has a
built-in display that's right guys this
isn't just a clear side panel it
actually has a transparent LCD display
built in with a resolution of 1280 by
1024 and I'm gonna talk more about it
later in this video the motherboard
that's inside here is the gigabyte Z 370
XP SLI which is one of their low-end
boards but it does support overclocking
and support for XMP profiles up to 4000
megahertz it also comes with two MDOT
two slots and a few parts of the
motherboard can be lit up using their
RGB fusion software personally I like
the motherboard choice it fits nicely
with the rest of the build with its
black and white stripes gigabyte was
also kind enough to provide a gtx 980ti
with a custom white backplate okay so
before I jump into the benchmarks and
performance I do want to say a few
things about the PC there are things I
like and there are things I don't like
and just want to get those off my chest
the things I don't like so first off I'm
not a fan of the RGB RAM sticks because
not only are the colors not accurate
or bright enough but the entire design
of the RAM stick is horrible if you're a
manufacturer out there that wants to
make RGB products please for the love of
God and I feel like I speak for everyone
when I say this
keep your main color or the base color
or whatever product you're working on a
neutral
color don't go with random colors like
red or pink or blue I mean that the kind
of the feasts the purpose of going with
RGB these adata xpg Ram sticks have a
red base color not only on the sides but
on the top as well which is the part
that's visible in the PC black white
silver or even gray or neutral colors
any of those colors would have been fine
with those RAM sticks why on earth would
you go with red it just doesn't make any
sense
another thing I don't like about the PC
is the fact that it came with a single
120 millimeter fan now if this was a
locked CPU obviously I wouldn't have
mind but this is an 8700 K that runs
pretty hot once overclocked especially
in a high-end bill like this a 120
millimeter radiator just seems a little
comical I was expecting at least a 240
millimeter rad and this beast and
because of this I was only able to push
the 8700 K to 4.7 gigahertz at 1.3 5
volts which is what you would get on the
turbo clock anyways if there was a
beefier cooler I would have gotten it to
at least 4.9 maybe even 5 gigahertz if
I'm lucky enough however this isn't
really a big deal now before I continue
guys I do want to give a huge thanks to
the sponsor blue apron for making this
video possible blue apron allows you to
create delicious chef design recipes at
home and they deliver all the farm-fresh
ingredients you need right to your
doorstep the best part about this is
that they send you the exact proportions
you would need to create your meal which
is awesome because you won't be wasting
any food near the end blue apron offers
a large selection of recipes and they're
always adding new dishes to their menu
every week my personal favorite so far
is their fried chicken and kale slaw
recipe all the ingredients are fresh and
sourced from quality local suppliers and
artisans and the recipes are so easy to
read even someone like me who doesn't
know how to cook can do it right now the
first 50 people to sign up will get $30
off their first blue apron order so

there is no commitment and cancelling is
free so if you don't end up liking it
you can always cancel so these next few
things are just me nitpicking so please
don't take them seriously it's not a big
deal I'm just mentioning them for the
sake of the video
I noticed that there were bubbles on the
screen near the bottom portion but you
can't really tell unless you look at it
in the light and finally the cable on
the fan attached to the radiator is
visible whoever put this PC together
didn't put too much thought into it
considering it's not a huge deal for
most people but I noticed it and it
bothers me I'm weird guys I've accepted
the fact I get picky at the dumbest
things possible and there is no
explanation I just feel like it's a
disease that I have luckily this was an
easy fix all I had to do was remove the
four screws and rotate the fan over to
hide the cable on the other side alright
let's talk about the things I like about
the PC I loved the case design the black
on white contrast is really nice and the
side panel opens up very easily
all I have to do is press down on these
two tabs and it slides right open I
personally don't like when cases have
thumb screws on the sides because it's
always a hassle when I need to go in and
out of my PC the lining of this case is
fantastic and I don't think I've ever
seen something this bright before and
that's because there are three really
bright LED strips behind the side panel
that light up the inside and it looks
really good at nighttime of course there
is a switch in the back to turn it off
if it's bothering you I do want to point
out that iBUYPOWER specifically built
this configuration for me using the 8700
k but if you were to buy something
similar on their website using these
skylake X platform instead it's gonna
cost you around 20 950 and to compare
prices I put together a list using the
same exact parts in this build and it
came out to a little over two thousand
dollars so you're basically paying an
extra nine hundred dollars if you were
to buy the snow blind with these specs
so what does that get you well first of
all you get their three-year warranty
which consists of three years of labor
and one year of parts should anything go
wrong with the PC and also along with
that you get a peace of mind
something you will never get building
your own PC and you guys can trust me on
that one you also save time and
frustration from building your own PC or
learning how to build a PC and running
into problems along the way
you also get exclusive access to there's
no blind chezy's which isn't available
anywhere else ultimately it does come
down to your decision if all of that is
worth an extra nine hundred dollars on
top of the original price for those
parts okay so let's take a look at
performance this configuration is
obviously built for 4k gaming and
productivity with a six core processor
and a 1080 Ti it just doesn't make sense
playing in 1080p I mean if that were the
case the i3 8100 what I've been the
better option as far as overclocking I
was only able to push the 8700 K to 4.7
gigahertz at one point three volts using
this tiny cooler and the thermals
weren't bad either I stress tested the
PC using either 64 and the temps were in
the low 80s which is actually really
good the noise also wasn't that bad I
loaded up GTA 5 and the final is cranked
up a bit on the GPU which was audible
but it wasn't too distracting especially
if you have headphones on
for gaming I was able to play over 60
fps and 4k settings maxed out on GTA 5 I
was getting around 100 FPS and maxed out
settings north modeling or lag what
soever very smooth gameplay during story
mode switching over to destiny - I was
easily hitting an average FPS of 84 and
4k resolution on high settings I did
join an event with several other players
and even would all that chaos that was
happening
none of the frames dipped on their 60
overall very smooth gameplay very happy
with that
and finally for pub G I was hitting
slightly over 60 fps in high settings
once again in 4k resolution I mean this
game is horribly optimised
so I didn't expect any triple digits for
editing 4k video I was able to render
out a three-minute 4k file in exactly 14
minutes on the dot so productivity on
this thing is a beast I was able to
screw up to the timeline and the video
playback was extremely smooth maxed out
in 4k resolution so overall very smooth
experience using Vegas Pro 15 the final
thing I want to talk about is their side
panels so as I mentioned before it has
its own built-in display and it comes
with a DVI cable which you will need to
plug into the GPU and in the back of the
enclosed unit that's connected to the
side panel so on this display you can
set live wallpapers which is what I've
done here there are many ways of
obtaining live wallpapers for free but
actually purchased wallpaper engine
through the steam store for only $3.00
and it actually gives you access to
thousands of users submitted wallpapers
ranging from anime all the way to
abstract art I mean there are so many
options out there it's ridiculous but
some of my personal favorites are the
abstract ink wallpapers I think there's
like three different ones that I really
liked and I downloaded also anything to
do with Dragon Ball super I had to
download those I'm a huge fan as you
guys know there's a bunch of different
ones out there with Vegeta as well as
Goku and there's a pretty cool matrix
theme one that I found there's also a
bunch of anime dancing girls apparently
that's very popular for some reason
there are two negatives that I found
while using this feature so first off
the wallpaper has to have bright colors
the darker and less transparent that is
the harder it's going to be to show up
on the side panel I mean there's a
reason why the inside of the PC is
mostly white
and it's also well lit so the image on
the panel can easily be seen and the
second negative is unfortunately it does
consume additional GPU power from what
I've noticed it's around five to ten
percent from the GPU that goes to the
live wallpaper and the number can be
higher or lower depending on the
resolution of the wallpaper and also how
demanding it is this also affected FPS
unfortunately I tested GTA 5 with and
without the live wallpaper enabled and I
saw an average 3 FPS difference with
that said it's not a huge deal I mean
you can always disable that while you're
gaming if you want every single precious
fps
so my final verdict on the iBUYPOWER
snowblind PC it's definitely not for
everyone especially considering the fact
that you're paying almost $1,000 more
than what the PC would normally cost you
if you were to go out and buy the parts
- the exclusive case I'm not really sure
how much it would cost I buy power to
build a side panel like that and also
why they're charging such a high premium
for it and with that said if you're not
impressed with the side panel and you
can live without it then I would not
recommend snowblind because there are so
many other alternatives out there that
will give you more bang for your buck
instead I would recommend checking out
the iBUYPOWER
element series considering those are
more fairly priced I feel like snowblind
is priced this high because of the
display itself and because there isn't
anything out there quite like it however
if you don't mind paying the high
premium and you're absolutely sold on
their amazing side panel display and
can't wait to have this PC next to you
in your setup then I see no reason not
to buy it especially considering that
there is nothing else quite like this in
the market keep in mind that you also
get their three year warranty you get
peace of mind knowing that the PC is
stress tested and ready to go and should
you run into any problems customer
service is a phone call away after MIT
though I was pretty impressed with the
snowblind I've been playing with the
display for a couple hours finding some
pretty cool wallpapers to use and it's
gonna be kind of boring to go back to my
original PC after all this I might even
actually switch to this until I build my
custom water-cooled build but anyways
that wraps up the video I hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did feel free to toss
that you like to show your support but
if you guys didn't like it please leave
a dislike I encourage you
huge thing so I about power for setting
this and as always and thank you guys
for watching I will see you in the next
one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
