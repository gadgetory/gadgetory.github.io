parsec is an application that lets you
stream your PC games from your
smartphone or laptop as you can see I'm
streaming for tonight on my laptop that
can't even handle games and the best
part about this is that there is very
low latency this means you can play from
anywhere within a thousand miles and not
worry about it affecting your
performance as much parsec streams games
up to 1440p and 60 FPS you can stream
from your desktop PC or if you don't
have a PC powerful enough to play games
then you can rent one of their clouds
for cheap and stream games from that
instead so you don't technically have to
buy or build a PC yourself you can
stream games from your Mac PC Android
phone or even Raspberry Pi at 60fps and
get this it doesn't matter what GPU you
are using it supports Nvidia AMD and
Intel as well another cool feature is
that you can invite your friends to play
on your computer for co-op games that
don't support online multiplayer for
example cuphead overcooked and more if
you guys are interested to check it out
it's completely free doubling down below
and I know you guys are gonna love it
what's up guys it's a from Texas and
today is a very exciting day I'm finally
gonna build my custom PC I've been
waiting for this for over two years now
but alas everything is coming together
and have all the parts right in front of
me as I mentioned before I'm gonna be
doing an air cooled version first or I
should say non water-cooled version and
I'm gonna swap it out and do a full
custom loop PC to compare the
differences coming from an air cooled PC
to a custom loop so yeah but that ways
to get more time let's go over some of
the parts here the AAP of course is the
79 80 XE e 18 a core processor holy crap
but this is actually d lidded I sent it
over to Stephen at gamers Nexus and he
deal in the processor for me that's
gonna have better performance I think 14
degree difference coming from the stock
79 80 XE which is going to be better for
thermals and of course I can even
overclock it further because of that so
very excited about that we also got 32
gigs of ram 32 hundred megahertz from
coarser this is the vengeance or GB RAM
sticks I'm gonna be putting in 32 gigs
of course we're gonna go with SLI it's
not a tech source build without putting
in two GPUs even though I'm not gonna
probably use as much power and I went
with the EVGA 1080 TI 4 that FTW three
edition the motherboard I'm going with
is the MSI x2 99m which if you guys saw
my previous video I explain why I
swapped from the EVGA x2 99 micro to
this this is actually the best mother
more micro ATX motherboard you can buy
right now and one of the reasons I
actually switched over is because this
has an optical port whereas the EVGA
micro did not it also has two m dot two
slots which means I'm gonna be hooking
up two of these bad boys in raid 0 this
is the samsung 960 pro m dot 2 512
gigabyte and 2 SSD actually I have one
more on the way so once that gets here I
can hook both of them up the only other
storage device I'm gonna be going with
are to s as these again the other one is
the way this is the WV blue to terabyte
SSD so I'm gonna be hooking two of them
up into raid zero as well so total 4
terabytes of SSD storage and some insane
speeds the power supply I'm going with
is the HX 1000 from Corsair which is
going to be plenty but of course I have
to go with custom sleeping this is a
white and red build with black accents
so I had to go with the best of the best
right now in the market which is cable
mod cables and of course I had to opt
for the aluminum white cable Combs is
going to be the captain 360 e.x cooler
from deep cool which is gonna be plenty
to cool the 79 80 I could see I'm
actually curious to see how much I can
overclock it using just the AI oh and I
think last but not least we have the
case itself this is a very unique case
it's not available in the US
unfortunately I was lucky enough to find
it off a website that was able to ship
to the US I think it's only available in
the UK for some reason this is the hex
gear or 40 it's a micro ATX chassis it's
a very clean looking computer case and
when I first saw it I was like I have to
have this for my personal PC alright as
a lot of parts of course you have some
minor things here like some red SATA
cables and we've got some AIO tubing for
the a i/o cooler cool cooler technically
this is compatible with the NZXT Kraken
I don't know if it's gonna fit with this
one but we'll give it a shot and we'll
see and we got some minor accessories
like red thumb screws of course I'm also
gonna paint some parts of the case
there's gonna be some slight model
whatever I need to do to make this PC
stand out and look one of the best out
there
but anyways I'm done rambling that's
going to unbox some stuff and get to
building alright skip the case out of
here this thing is actually very heavy
and there's gonna be some assembly
required because I'm not to put together
this case which
I think is the first time I've ever put
together actually know the Kruger case
is also another case that I put together
okay there's a lot of freaking pieces I
think half this video is gonna be me
assembly in a quickie case what the heck
what in the world I don't see a manual
or installation guide anywhere unless
they secretly hit it and set one of
these bags okay yeah it's like building
a rocket ship
seriously what started out as an
exciting day quickly turned into a
depressing one hence why we're here at
Fry's Electronics to pick up a backup
case I did email hex gear and I asked
them if they can send over some spare
screws so that I can put together the
parts but unfortunately it's gonna take
at least a week because there's station
all the way in UK and I don't want to
wait any longer guys i postponed this so
many times and i know you guys have been
waiting for this video for such a long
time so I'm here to pick up basically an
alternative case in the meantime just to
put together everything and then test it
out benchmark it and then once I finally
do get the screws in for the hex skier
or 40 I can go in and put that together
and continue that the old this is
literally the entire selection as fries
half these cases are junk oh my god this
is gonna be Harlan like that I just want
something it's gonna fit at the 360
millimetre radiator honesty and if it's
the color scheme other than that I don't
care because this is temporary of course
they have a bunch of NZXT s340 cases
alright so we can record here to long
they're gonna kick us out is there we
gave us a warning but I think I've
decided on the NZXT H 700 I meant our
chassis this is the one of the cases
that supports a three sixty millimeter
radiator and I've never done a build in
it so I think we can knock down two
birds
one stones yes pick it up and head back
home
I was literally thinking about this as I
was paying for the case how the hell are
we gonna put this in the car
ladies and gentlemen do not buy a
Lamborghini or do not take one for
shopping even if it is just one box cuz
you are not gonna fit what if we take
this out of the box put the case inside
here I think I'll fit oh oh oh my god
good there boy this is that we gonna get
home basically yeah yeah yeah we have no
no space to put the the case so he's
gonna have to hold it like that the
entire trip we didn't take into account
the storage space for the lab Rajini so
it's gonna be an interesting trip
ladies gentlemen we are back at the
headquarters it is 7 o'clock we started
building this at 12 which means we have
done Jack it but we do have a case now
so that's that's definitely a start and
it kind of worked out because I haven't
built in the H 700 I so this is actually
killing two birds in one stone and I
think you'll look awesome in this
beautiful case which will match the
color scheme and it fits at three sixty
millimeter radiator so I think all in
all we are finally back on track
unfortunately you have to be seven hours
later but anyways I want to shut the
hell up because I know you guys are
annoyed of me talking this entire time
and I'm just gonna start putting things
together also on the way back up here I
open up the mailbox and look our second
960 Pro m2 arrived so I think we pretty
much have everything other than the
extra SSD which is on the way but
anyways guys I'm officially done talking
let's just start the build
all right so it is now 11 o clock took
us about four hours to finally finish
this it was definitely a challenge now
the final result it's okay it's not you
know what I expected there's obviously
some things I would do differently for
example do some custom paint jobs I
would paint the PCI brackets the SSD
trays I would throw in some custom back
plates and that's the lie bridge things
like that to really customize it and
keep the color scheme consistent but
because this is not my personal PC I'm
gonna be swapping cases I'm just gonna
leave it at the way it is right now
overall experience building in the HS
700 I was fairly positive for the most
part it's $200 for this case and
honestly I think it's a bit too steep
this is not a case for enthusiasts what
I mean by that is if you're building
with two GPUs or more stay away from
this case and I'll explain why in a bit
few things I like about this case is how
clean it looks the amount of cable
management space in the back you get a
really nice cable tie down areas you got
raceways a lot of zip ties so amazing
job with the cable management support
back here storage space is also awesome
you got an SSD tray in the front also
two more trays up here and then two
additional SSD trays in the back with
three additional hard drive bays oh and
the expandability is also awesome you
get support up to three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator for the top and the
front so you guys could actually do some
pretty cool custom water cooling builds
in this PC now the one graph I have with
this case is the small cutout that NZXT
gives you to run the GPU cables from the
bottom is so tiny literally this small
that you can only fit two sets of cables
guys I'm running SLI so I got four sets
of eight PCI connectors and it was a
challenge trying to squeeze all of them
through that little tiny hole and
because of that you guys can see the
cables are looking pretty bad now if I
only had a single GPU it would have
looked nice I can you know use the cable
combs and make it look really nice but
because it's so crammed down there that
is basically what it looks like right
now so in my opinion that's a very very
bad
design on in the XTS part anyways we
hooked up the pc let's see if it
actually boots if it doesn't I probably
go insane so let's do this well I was
fast turned on and then just turned off
now there's an even boot so we're
getting basically one click and then it
shuts off automatically doesn't even
want to start so I'm going to do some
troubleshooting and see then get this
nightmare over I don't know what the
possible issue might be
sounds like a power supply issue the way
it's clicking so I picked up the EVGA
1000 g3 I got a reason to believe that
the power supply is defective which
literally never happens to me I think
it's the first time that a power supply
is defective and it's from Corsair so
we're gonna plug this one in try it out
and see if that fixes the issue because
all we're getting is a simple click
literally split-second everything just
shuts off and we even use the power
supply tester and even this is telling
us that the power supply is not
functioning the right way so so I'm
gonna connect this to the motherboard
and one more piece goes to the CPU
alright
I call it so ladies and gentleman indeed
it is the power supply Wow
everything is clearly running all the
fans are spinning we got power to the
CPU Ram graphics cards looking very
healthy so Wow okay we have a dead power
supply I don't know if it got damaged on
the way here but anyways I think that
pretty much does it for this video but
anyways I hope you guys enjoyed it if
you did make sure you guys drop a like
to show your support and make sure
you're subscribed if you guys want to
miss out on the next few episodes I
think I work on this tomorrow I'll go
