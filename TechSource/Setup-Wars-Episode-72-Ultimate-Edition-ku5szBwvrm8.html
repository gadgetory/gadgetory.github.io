thousand likes and my last set of boards
video so I won't be shaving off my hair
so I'll be back next week with a
different challenge but in the meantime
welcome to setup wars episode 72 let the
setup wars begin
if you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2
a.com because they have the cheapest CD
keys available for pretty much any game
I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out as always you
guys can find the gear for all the
setups links down below but here are
your five contestants for this week we
have Dalton hire Slee or higher clay
Shawn Tom and Tommy congratulations for
making it on the show starting off the
episode we have dalton with a triple
monitor setup and spoiler alert by the
way all of these setups do have triple
monitors Dalton is rocking three Dell
24-inch ultra sharp displays and the
desk he is using is an 8 feet Baltic
butcher countertop that he picked up
from Lowe's and for the support he's
using to Alex drawer units keyboard of
choice is the corsair k70 RGB luxe
that's paired with the Logitech g600
Mouse and both of them are resting on
the glorious extended mousepad I like
how he focused on symmetry by keeping
his ps4 on one side and the charging
dock for the ps4 controllers on the
other he also did the same thing for his
headsets we have a pair of astro a40 s
on the left and Logitech G 430's on the
right great work with the cable
management - not just with the Astro a40
s but with the entire set of cables it
looks like he hooked up everything on
the bottom of the desk utilizing tiny
cable raceways and even some zip ties
job well done
finally the pcs powering this entire set
up has an i7 3930k and an EVGA gtx 980ti
I hope you are using an X 16 PCI slot to
take full advantage of the cards
performance but overall a very clean and
badass setup Thank You dalton for
entering here Ackley is next up with
three 27-inch HP Pavilion monitor is
resting on the ikea lindeman desk with
the Alex your unit combo there's
definitely a lot going on here so I will
start off from the left side and move
towards his PC on the edge of the desk
is a strange looking lamp
I'm guessing and then we have his
smartphone resting on the e candy stand
in the center is the Thermaltake eSports
Poseidon keyboard in between the eraser
Tartarus and ghost shark Mouse judging
by the blue accents on the
pad and the blue LEDs on the keyboard I
would have imagined this would be a
black and blue setup but the red
Logitech G 230 headset kind of threw it
off a bit next to the headset is the
popular blue yeti mic and off to the
right side is his PC with a black and
red color scheme it currently has the
6700 K and a gigabyte gtx 1070 graphics
card not bad if there is a strong aspect
of the setup it has to be the cable
management I haven't seen anyone wrap
cables quite like this before it also
looks like everything is grouped up
together and neatly organized in the
back of the table I would obviously pick
up a boom arm for your blue Yeti mic and
hook that up behind your desk but that
would mean that you would have to move
the table away from the wall a bit I
would also add a hanger either against
the Alex your or under the table for
your headset because honestly you just
don't have the space to put those on the
table they are blocking the third
monitor with some minor tweaks the setup
has the potential to be an even better
setup Thank You higher Clee for entering
Sean is back at it again with his very
popular quad display setup I honestly
can't get tired of seeing this but it
looks like he has made some major
improvements since the last time he was
featured so let's just jump right into
it starting off with the main stars of
the show the monitors he is still
walking the massive Samsung TV up top
with 324 inch acer monitors near the
bottom it looks like he still has the
corsair strafe RGB with the vortex key
caps and the logitech g502 proteus core
mouse both of which are resting on the
glorious extended mouse pad which he
kept pretty clean this entire time I
seriously don't know how you guys keep
white mouse pads so clean like this mine
would be pretty much black after a week
a few other stuff on his desk include
the two terabyte Xbox 1s a pair of audio
technica m50x is white edition and an
Amazon echo which looks to be wrapped in
some sort of carbon fiber skins the
attention to detail is something I've
always liked about Sean's setup cable
management as always is flawless I don't
see a single wire in sight last but not
least we can't forget the PC that's
pushing all of these pixels and it looks
like you got rid of the dragonballs for
a more cleaner look so this bad boy is
rocking a 6700 K and two gtx 980ti is
TW edition in SLI I'm definitely diggin
the customs leaving and the paint job on
the sli bridge but I feel like if you
painted the PCI brackets white as well
it would have looked way better but
that's just my two cents
there's definitely a lot going on here
and the fact that you managed to
organize everything including the wires
is incredible
Sean you've been on the show for
multiple times and I've seen you improve
your setup over the past year so you
know what I think it's time
congratulations for being the 8th person
to receive the setup wars seal of
approval
you've been Preston as a reminder the
person who receives the seal also gets
$100 a custom-made plaque with an
optional signature and also a text
source t-shirt so if you're watching
this video make sure toss an email to
claim your prize Congrats again at
number four we have Tom with a black and
green setup rockin three 22 inch acer
monitors and if you guys are wondering
what desk this is well it's the ikea
freddy desk and as always you can find
the links to everything mentioned down
below he also has the corsair strafe RGB
keyboard and a Mad Catz rat 3 mouse I
also just noticed a giant Technica sound
bar that's sitting under the monitors
cable management is pretty good I can
see that he wrapped everything up and
stuck them behind a desk although there
are a few wires that are still visible
the PC is also down here and it's
equipped with the 4690k and a gtx 960
I'm not so sure why you would go with an
unlocked CPU with the stock heatsink
since you could have saved some money
going with a non KC PU I will give you
props for sticking some things on the
bottom of the desk like the USB hub and
remotes although instead of using 3m
tape to keep the wires from hanging down
I would strongly recommend using these
cable clips instead they do a much
better job and they are a lot cheaper
definitely some minor improvements are
needed but overall a very dope setup
thank you for entering last but not
least we have Tommy with a very badass
black and red setup he is rocking 3a
through 24 inch gaming monitors that are
overclocked to 180 Hertz what tough for
the gear here is using the coarser
strafe RGB with cherry MX silent
switches and he also has the Razer Naga
Mouse so I'm guessing he is an MMO
player if I had to take a wild guess I
must say
roll of Warcraft some other things on
the desk include his audio setup which
consists of the scarlett studio and a
boom arm as well as his note 5 that's
sitting on a wireless charger I enjoyed
the tiny figurines for the added
personality but there are some items on
your desk that can be stored away like
the glasses remote a random cable drop
and whatever that is in the middle on
the bottom of the desk we have two pairs
of headsets the logitech g930 3 and the
scarlett HP 60 and since we're down here
the cable management looks pretty good
I'm not so sure what you did with the
wires but it seems to be working I don't
know what you do for a living but god
damn this is a beast of a PC it's
rocking to GT x 1080 founders editions
and sli with the 6700 K I'm pretty sure
you didn't mod the green GTX logo for
warranty reasons but overall a very very
nice PC if this was my setup I would
have bought a triple monitor arm and
hooked up all the three displays for a
much cleaner look but that's just me a
very impressive set up nonetheless Thank
You Tommy for entering as always make
sure you guys drop your comments down
below and vote on who you think has the
best desk setup out of this episode and
as always I'll announce the winners on
my social media accounts on the weekend
then guys so much for watching as always
if you enjoy setup wars leave a like and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
