welcome to setup wars episode 139 let's
just start the show kicking off the
episode is Abdul and a tech source
inspired set up I mean it has to be
inspired by me because we got the black
and red acoustic foams the Ikea wall
shelves painted and black and red with
the IKEA table top resting on risers and
to Alex yours underneath I really love
the black and red contrast you have
throughout the entire setup but I feel
like that bamboo tabletop really messes
with it this setup is used for gaming
and school work he's rocking three
27-inch Dell monitors the g.skill
ripjaws keyboard and the asus rog spatha
wireless gaming mouse I also liked that
extra shelf that he modded on top of his
desk using some capital eggs however I
think that four is a bit overkill it
would have looked nicer with just two of
them instead of four and if you put them
in the center of the shelf it would have
been enough to support your ps4 and the
collection of games in fact it would
even probably support another ps4 on
there those things are very sturdy
excellent work with the cable management
looks like you hit all the wires inside
the star tech cable raceway and you even
picked up a matching cable box for the
power strip and access cables very nice
and finally let's take a look at his
beast gaming PC that he mounted against
the wall inside the thermaltake core p5
case it's a custom loo PC featuring
these 7700 K 32 gigs of ram and an MSI
GTX 1080 I noticed that your main color
scheme is black and red but you have RGB
colors throughout the case
speaking of RGB I do like the custom
made nameplate using the RGB strips next
to your setup I can't even see the power
cable running down so great work on
hiding that however you did that I feel
like you did such a great job with cable
management and your setup is very clean
but that one keyboard wire going across
your desk really messes with the vibe I
honestly expected you to drill a hole
and run the cable underneath your desk
but I understand that some people just
don't want to poke holes in their table
I mean sure there are some
inconsistencies but this is one hell of
a gaming setup Thank You Abdul for
starting up the show
speaking of one hell of a setup John is
up next from the Philippines with his
custom epic setup made just for peer
gaming the star of the show is the
custom-made backdrop and the desk that's
holding up as a Sur x34 ultrawide
monitor and we have another mounted PC
using the same case actually now this is
the p3 version instead of the p5 that we
just checked out I gotta give perhaps
two John for having better consistency
throughout his setup it's mostly white
and black with blue accents it's very
refreshing and can we please just take a
moment and appreciate that badass
wallpaper of Goku in ultra instinct mode
I love that it even matches the color
scheme of his setup on the desk he's
rocking the corsage crave RGB keyboard
with the m65 Pro RGB Mouse and it looks
like he's using the RGB polaris mousepad
as well I commend you for drilling a
hole in the desk to route those wires in
I mean it's obvious that you had to do
it for this setup it's such a clean
setup and having a wire go across the
desk would have just ruined it on the
Left we have a simple LED lamp with an
RGB bulb inside and next to that is the
courser st 100 RGB headphone stand
holding up the void wireless RGB headset
I loved that he kept all the peripherals
consistent as well it's all from Corsair
I can also appreciate the custom Hall of
Fame acrylic piece running across the
desk and he actually built that to hide
the cables running across the desk from
the PC believe it or not and the cool
part is that he actually hooked up
Corsair RGB strips inside that and he
synched them with the RGB strips behind
the monitor so they both glow in the
same exact color excellent work
aside from the Corsair void headset he
does use two massive bookshelf speakers
from Edifier and I just love the
symmetry up here we've got a custom
painted Gundam strike freedom figure
right in the center and two portraits
right above Super Saiyan vegeto on the
left and Super Saiyan Gogeta on the
right this guy has some taste in
Dragonball Z that's for sure
cable management is so good it's
basically classified as cable pone at
this point
beautifully wrapped up together and
routed behind his desk where you will
find an extra RGB strip for
nice low effect the icing on the cake is
that custom-built Hall of Fame gaming PC
featuring the 7700 K 16 gigs of ram and
the Hall of Fame GTX 1080
of course we got some custom mods here
as well like the beautiful psuche rad
with built-in courser RGB strips and the
hall-of-fame fan grills and a i/o cooler
my god would a beautiful PC I'm also
just realizing John was an episode 114
with a black and red gaming setup and I
think I almost gave him my seal of
approval if I weren't for some things I
didn't like
he also wrote in the notes that he was
kind of bummed for not getting it you
know what John if you're watching this
now this setup is now worthy of a seal
of approval you have made some
significant changes and I'm loving the
attention to detail and the custom mods
that you did you also got consistency
personality organization and most
importantly an artistic eye and I see no
reason not to give you the seal of
approval congratulations dude well
deserved if you're watching this video
toss an email to set up for us to claim
your prize as always you get $100 a text
or t-shirt and most importantly a unique
one-of-a-kind custom plaque oh and
before we go on to the next contestant
here's a pretty cool video that he made
just for you guys
this next set up is from Quinton who
lives in Canada and he works as a
mechanic but the reason why I'm
featuring this setup on the show is
because it's powered by a laptop this is
the first time I've seen a full gaming
setup that's revolved around a laptop
instead of a desktop PC he's hooked up
his 17-inch Alienware r4 to his Samsung
TV as a duplicate display below that
he's got the Razer DeathAdder chroma
Mouse a black out blue Yeti microphone
hooked up to the desk and a ps4 console
for those exclusive titles he did say in
the notes that he's got bookshelf
speakers coming in but in the meantime
he's using the razer kraken headset
which is hanging underneath his desk and
while we're down here let's take a look
at the wires not a bad job overall
the cables are hooked up underneath the
desk and all the wires on the desk are
organized anyways I wanted to feature
this on the show because I thought it
was unique and for a laptop setup it's
actually pretty dope Thank You Quinton
for entering a number for is Adam and
his quad a display gaming setup he's got
a 32 inch Panasonic on top with three
27-inch BenQ monitors that are hooked up
against the wall and normally I would
not accept a submission like this
because of the low picture quality but I
thought it was cool enough to make an
exception this time I really like how he
mounted both of his speakers against the
wall instead of having them sit on the
desk
speaking of wall mounting he also put
his PC on top of a shell which was a
very smart decision considering he has
no extra space on his desk or underneath
his desk the keyboard and mouse are both
eraser but oddly enough we don't have a
razor themed setup the blue outline from
the mouse pad and the RGB lighting
suggest that there is no specific color
scheme under his PC there is a
mini-fridge and on top of that is the
ps4 everything else seems to be
organized very well I can see the cable
sleeve covering up the PC wires and the
power cables from the monitors the
cables are also managed fairly well
underneath the desk looks like the rack
is holding up the power strip and all
the excess cables so I don't have any
major complaints here it's a very
straightforward and simple setup and
it's looking very bland with all that
extra space on your desk if I'm being
honest maybe you can add some stuff that
will contribute to your personality and
make your setup yours I'm not saying go
crazy and cover up
we inch of your desk but maybe two to
three props on there would give it some
flavor but anyways thank you Adam for
entering last families we got Sean who
was an operation analyst and this is his
setup for gaming he's rocking a single
ultra light from Asus the corsair k70
RGB keyboard and the eraser
Ouroboros mouse I really like the way he
routed the keyboard wire alongside the
mousepad
using some zip ties I've actually never
seen that before I mean it does look
cleaner than running the cable across
the desk that's for sure
it doesn't look like Shawn uses any
headphones so he relies on those cue
acoustic speakers for audio and the desk
itself is an interesting one so he's
using the IKEA wobbly countertop that I
see a lot of but he's using industrial
pipes that he picked up from Lowe's to
actually support it that's actually very
refreshing and clever if you ask me for
cable management Shawn picked up some
raceways to run the wires through and he
attached his parish tip against one of
the legs using some zip ties not a bad
job and finally the PC powering at all
is a custom loop featuring a 7700 K and
2 EVGA 980 T eyes in SLI I'm curious why
you upgraded your processor and not your
graphics cards a very clean setup indeed
but which one of these takes home the
crown only you guys can vote in the
comments section down below and let me
know why you guys voted for that
particular set up by the way guys I
recommend everyone to hold off on
submitting their setup until it's 100%
complete and you are happy with it if
you have stuff on the way for example
you're planning on buying new speakers
or new keyboards and stuff like that I
recommend you guys to hold off and make
sure you have everything you need for
your setup before taking pictures and
submitting them I say this because I see
it happen all the time where somebody
would submit their setup and then like
literally two weeks later they would
send in a second submission with an
upgraded monitor or speakers and stuff
like that but if I already featured
their first setup then I'm not gonna
accept their second one because the show
starts getting overflowed with
submissions so please guys this is not a
race take your time make sure your setup
is perfected before taking pictures and
submitting it as always thanks for
watching if you guys enjoyed the show
tossing a like would be awesome and if
you guys don't please I encourage you to
leave a dislike I love your faces as
always and I will see you in the next
