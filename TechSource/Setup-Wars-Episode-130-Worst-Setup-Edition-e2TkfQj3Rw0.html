and welcome to setup wars episode 130
potato Edition everyone's favorite
episode of setup wars as always the
person with the worst setup will receive
$100 and I need you guys to vote using
the straw poll link down below yeah what
that said it let the potato Edition
begin as always guys don't take anything
I say in this video seriously because it
is done purely for entertainment the
people who actually are on the show
voluntarily submitted their setup just
to be a part of the potato edition of
setup wars so yeah what that said let's
start the show
starting off the cringe fest we got
James and his gaming and editing setup
featuring a beat-up desk and two
monitors I do want to apologize ahead of
time if the quality of the pictures are
making your eyes bleed but this is the
worst setup edition of setup wars so
don't expect any great quality pictures
the first monitor is a 19 inch from Ben
Q while the second and main monitor is a
24 inch from Samsung I do want to remind
you that James is only 16 years old so
this setup actually isn't that bad he's
rocking a keyboard and mouse combo from
game X and the custom PC powering this
amazing setup has an overclocked FX 8350
and a sapphire nitro rx 460 what made me
put his setup in this episode was
because of his cleanliness I always tell
everyone it doesn't matter how expensive
or cheap your setup is you could at
least keep it organized and clean I mean
there was so much crap in his drawer and
I don't even want to get started with
that cable management what in God's name
is going on over here couldn't you have
at least picked up those CDs from the
ground before taking pictures I mean I
know it wouldn't have made a huge
difference but it's still something the
printer is looking dusty as hell and
he's even got a cracked phone and a
random xbox controller just sitting on
top of the desk I also notice that there
are even more stuff on the side of his
desk I just feel like he tosses things
in there that he doesn't use anymore
kind of like a spare trashcan for audio
he's using the Turtle Beach ear for sky
low headset but he also has a beats pill
Bluetooth speaker underneath his monitor
I mean it's not the worst setup I've
seen but it's definitely one of the
worst setups I've seen on the show thank
you James for starting off the episode
next up is Jeremiah with another bad
setup and he's coming all the way from
Philippines to show off this setup that
he uses for school
streaming videos and gaming it consists
of a premade desk that he bought from a
computer store and a Samsung monitor
that has a huge row of dead pixels on
the left side the desk is so small that
you barely have enough room for your
mouse so why would you put your laptop
on it I mean if you wanted to show us
that you own a laptop you could have too
easily taking a picture of it on a
different desk speaking of the laptop it
actually has better specs than his PC it
has the i5 6200 you four gigs of ram and
the geforce 940 MX compared to the
pentium ii 5300 CPU and a g4 730 with
only two gigs of ram a few other things
that Jeremiah has on his desk is the
Nintendo 3ds we also got the xbox360
controller a USB hub and his co loud
earphones considering he has no other
audio source cable management as
expected is atrocious I mean if your
drawer looks like this then obviously
your setup is gonna be worse it just
seems like you don't care about your
setup enough to clean up the wires a bit
but anyways good luck and thank you for
entering and number three we got Joelle
with a more presentable setup so he's
rocking two completely different
monitors but that's okay since they both
seem to work just fine however what on
earth is going on with your keyboard
dude it looks like it hasn't seen an air
duster in ages I do have to give Joelle
some credit for at least cleaning up his
cables I mean he even built his very own
cable rack using a few sheets of paper I
mean if this doesn't scream out budget
then I don't know what does after today
I don't want to hear excuses that people
don't have money to cable manage I mean
if you all can do this using a few
sheets of paper and some tape then you
should be able to do it all so he
doesn't have any speakers so the only
audio source he's got is the ozone rage
headset that he keeps in his drawer when
he's not using it and the PC powering
the set up is equipped with an i5 7500
and
msi gtx 1050 TI for being only 12 years
old this is actually a pretty good setup
I mean if a 12 year old can keep his
setup this clean then what the hell is
your excuse for sitting in a dump I'm
looking at you James and Jeremiah and
probably the rest of the contestants on
this episode but anyways Thank You Joel
for entering and good luck and number
four is Lance who lives in Florida and
this is the setup that he uses for
homework although it's not really a
setup what I found funny about the
submission is that he labeled his desk
as a granite countertop
I mean he's not wrong it is technically
a granite countertop but it's not really
a desk anyways he's rocking two laptops
the main computer is a 2012 13 inch
MacBook Air and the side computer is a
Dell Latitude efj if t 430 I'm not sure
why he needs two laptops or if this
setup is even real to begin with but
this is the submission it's obvious he's
an Apple fan judging by the iPad the
iPhone and even Apple skins on his Dell
laptop I feel like the setup looks very
cluttered because of the way everything
is so spread out and even the cables are
just hanging around in the back just out
of curiosity I want to see what your
bedroom is like and this goes for
everyone that enters were setup edition
from now on I want to see actual
pictures of your bedroom to see if
there's a desk or if there's room for a
desk just so I can confirm the
legitimacy of your setup either way
Thank You Lance for entering and good
luck
wrapping up the episode we have Ludwig
which also happens to be my favorite
setup from the episode because this dude
built a gaming PC with a monitor as a
side panel I'm not even joking he's
rocking an old Fujitsu three by four
monitor which isn't even 1080p and he
attached it to the side of his PC I
don't know if that's pre-built or
custom-built but that is one hell of a
modification maybe he saw my snowblind
PC review and wanted to build something
like that for himself but instead he
came up with something like this he even
built a custom cooling solution for the
GPU if you guys noticed the heatsink
underneath the GPU and also the front
fan that's attached to the case using
zip ties I love the fact that he has a
pretty nice collection of motherboards
on his wall that actually looks pretty
cool and the fact that he's growing a
tree in
his house like what is up with those
leaves dude if Tarzan would have a setup
I think it would look something like
this but anyways he's got a pretty basic
mouse keyboard headset and even
microphone the cables aren't really
managed but then again this is the worst
setup edition either way very impressed
with the modifications you got there
Ludwig thank you and good luck so that
wraps up this episode of setup wars make
sure you guys vote using the straw
holding down below because the person
with the worst setup will take home $100
in cash and they can use that money
towards whatever the hell they want I'll
announce the winners on my Instagram and
Twitter accounts on the weekend make
sure you guys are following me there if
you care enough thanks so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
