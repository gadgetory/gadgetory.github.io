challenges in a row that did not happen
last video that I get 60,000 likes so
I'm not gonna be covering myself in
ketchup and mustard honestly I'm very
relieved that did not happen because
that have been a very disgusting and
gross episode and I'm sure you guys
would have been disgusted as well so in
a way I'm very relieved that did not
happen so instead of me coming up with
these stupid challenges I'm gonna let
you guys decide what you want to see for
the next few episodes so go to leave me
your comments down below on what
challenges I should do making reason
make them reasonable guys and I will
pick a few of them and I'll make a straw
poll on my Twitter account and you guys
can vote on that the reason why I still
do these challenges is to change some
things up guys instead of giving you the
usual set of polls every single Monday I
like to spice some things up maybe give
a retarded intro or cringe-worthy
challenge I don't know just to change
things up just for my sake and hopefully
you guys enjoy that as well if you don't
then just are here for the set ups that
you guys can always skip the video sway
to the setup portion but anyways let me
know what challenges you guys want to
see by dropping your comments down below
I'll pick up a few of them put them on
my Twitter account and run a straw poll
for you guys to vote but anyways without
wasting any more time what episode are
we on welcome to setup wars episode 68
let's just start the show
if you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2a
comm because they have the cheapest CD
keys available for pretty much any game
I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out as always you
guys can find the gear for every one
setup link below but here are your five
contestants for this week we have Alex
Ali
Jai Jai Lucas and Sam congratulations
for making it on the show starting off
the show we have Alex and a Razer theme
this setup featuring two 24 inch dual
monitors a Black Widow ultimate keyboard
DeathAdder Mouse and an extended
mousepad from Eric's keeping the Razer
theme going we have the Razer H 440
tower that's housing the 4790k and a
gigabyte gtx 980ti
very good job with the custom sleeping
and painted fan rings Alex does have a
mic hooked up to a boom arm and I love
the fact that he attached that to the
monitor arm instead of the desk below
the monitors we have a set of Logitech Z
150 speakers and has ps4 which is
looking very bland I would personally
pick up some skins to spice it up a bit
it doesn't really matter where you get
them from but if you do add some to your
ps4 it will make your setup look Foust
cable management is pretty good I do
appreciate the fact that you drilled a
hole in your desk
throughout the keyboard and mouse wires
through it also looks like we have a
signal rack holding up the rest of the
cables and a headphone hanger that's
holding up the Astro a40 s any sound
blaster tactic 3d rage headset
definitely a huge fan of the color
scheme and I'm glad that you even have a
matching chair I would give this a solid
eight out of ten oh yeah I'm actually
doing this new rating system I don't
know if I should continue doing it or
not but basically a 10 out of 10 is seal
of approval worthy and a 1 out of 10
setup basically belongs in the worst
setup edition of setup wars but I'll
drop a shop holding down below if you
guys want to maybe vote on this and let
me know if I should continue the rating
system or not all these next up with an
ultra white is set up so we have the
acer x34 predator logitech g7 10 plus
keyboard and the razer naga mouse on top
of an Ikea table behind the monitors we
have a pair of Edifier speakers and to
the right of all this is the matte
of PC that's running on a 6700 K and 2
GTX 1084 the wins and SLI I don't know
how I feel about the blue LEDs from the
fans or the tubing but it's definitely a
beast of a PC cable management can
definitely be improved but I will give
you a point for at least attempting to
cover up the wires with those omnimount
sleeves I mean at least you have a
hanger for your headset though 6 out of
10 for the setup you can definitely
improve your cable management by a lot
and you can watch my video for tips
thank you ollie for entering at number 3
we have Jay and his jaw-dropping setup
get it because Jay and Ja they're very
live three 27-inch Dell monitors on the
bottom all of which are 1440p resolution
and on the top shelf we have a single 21
inch samsung 1080p monitor below that we
have the Razer orb-weaver chroma
keyboard courser strafe RGB keyboard and
a Logitech g600 mouse I do like the fact
that you position the audio engine a 5
plus speakers at an angle so that the
sound is directed towards you I was like
the position of the PC you have a very
clear view of everything inside it a
6700 carryin a gtx 980ti with white
custom sleeping and the s340 case
excellent choices in the parts to the
left we have a banana holder holding a
pair of sanitizer momentum wireless
headphones and I'm already gonna guess
and say that the cable management is
flawless and yep everything is neatly
tucked away and there are several holes
jeweled inside the desk that have cables
going through job well done this setup
is definitely worthy of the seal of
approval and I want to give it to you
Jay I really do man I don't think
there's been a winner since episode 49
so it's been a long time but the reason
why I can't give you the seal is because
the top monitor is not centered with the
bottom also there are a few wires
visible near the back now I know
everyone's going to hate me but I'm
sorry guys one of the criteria of
winning the seal is symmetry however I
will give this setup a solid 9 out of 10
awesome job Jay thank you for entering
and number three we have lucasfilm's
with a very clean black and red setup
did I say very clean I meant the
immaculate I don't even know where to
start
so we have two 27-inch Dell gaming
monitors hooked up to the wall-e mount
and below that we have a snowball mic
BlackWidow chroma key board and a
SteelSeries rival mouse on top of the
VIP Hamm's mousepad I love that you kept
the setup somewhat symmetrical even on
the wall shelf up there isn't directly
centered with both other monitors you
did redeem yourself by adding one CS CO
knife on each side of the desk and by
the way bravo for keeping the color
scheme so consistent throughout this
entire setup on the right side we have
is console collection an Xbox one ps4
and two controller stands holding up the
remotes all of which are skinned by D
brands very impressive and finally we
have the mov headphone hangar that's
holding up his headset and the notes it
states that it's a national headset but
these look like Triton's to me I'm not
gonna even try and guess what rifle that
is on top but I do like the custom
painted IKEA wall shelf that's holding
that up and finally in the corner we
have is PC that's powering this entire
set we river is that an alienware so
inside this overpriced piece of metal we
have a 5820k and two gtx 980ti 's I mean
what's the point of putting all this
power in here if you can't even show it
off cable management on the other hand
is perfect all the wires are off of the
ground and mounted against the roof of
the desk personally I think the LEDs are
a bit too much and instead what I've
gone with white ones and put them behind
the desk instead of the front and
because of that reason and the
misaligned shelf I'm going to give this
setup an 8 out of 10 Thank You Lucas for
entering last me at least we have Sam
and his black and yellow productivity
setup we have the LG 34 inch ultrawide
monitor sitting on top of the Rene 2
wooden office desk and sandwiching the
display we have a pair of KRK Rokit 5
audio monitors the setup is being
powered by the six core Mac Pro hence
why we have the Apple wireless keyboard
and mouse and this is actually something
I haven't seen before
Sam has drilled a hole in the desk to
route the microphone and audio interface
wires through now that's very clever
under the desk we can see that he is
using a signal to store all of the
cables along with the anchor that's
holding up the Bose Soundlink wireless
headphones oh and I almost forgot about
the massive 50 inch vizio 4k TV that's
being used as a second monitor a very
clean and organized set up no doubt
worthy of a solid score of 8 out of 10
thank you Sam for entering so ladies and
gentlemen that will do for this episode
of setup words as always please drop
your comments down below and vote I
don't know why people don't vote anymore
but please vote on what you think or who
you think has the best desk setup and as
always I'll ask the winners on Sunday on
my tweet and Instagram accounts hey guys

thing guys so much for watching and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
