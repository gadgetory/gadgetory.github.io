Texas and welcome to set up Ward's
episode who gives a let's start the
show
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always everyone's gear for their setups
will be linked down below but without
wasting any more time here are your 5
lucky contestants we have some guy the
son Jack Sebastian and taiga regulations
for making it to setup wars episode 29
first up is some guy with a try display
setup I'm sorry I'm so sorry I just had
to do it first up is some guy with a try
display setup we have three years first
up is some guy with a try display setup
3 Acer 23 inch monitors on a custom-made
triple monitor stand under the scree
have a razor tarantula keyboard and a
worldcat Kona + Mouse on the popular
IKEA linman desk we also have a row cat
headset hanging from the edge of the
desk and I'm already gonna recommend the
headset stand for those excellent work
with cable management that's what I like
to see just a wall and no cables in
sight but yeah overall a really sweet
setup thank you guys for entering
Posadas next up with a you're entering
setup wars with that so besides the
excellent cable management we have two
vizio monitors a courser k95 RGB
keyboard and a Razer Ouroboros mouse on
the eraser of a spool a mousepad
you also got a ps4 off to the side and a
pair of Sun highs a 350 se headphones
hanging from the monitors the only point
that I will award you is for going with
the BitFenix Colossus case since I used
it in my XE on PC build and that's
happened to be one of my favorite videos
on my channel but yeah pick up some
cable management stuff to fix up your
wires I also find that a headphone
hanger would be ideal for your setup
considering you don't have any extra
room on your desk
in fact the headphone hangar on your PC
case would work really well I do have a
how-to cable management video coming out
later this month that will surely help
you out so make sure to stick around
next up is Jack with an ultra-wide setup
we have
the one and only 29 inch LG monitor on
top of the monitor riser which is custom
made by using an Ikea table along with
capital eggs on the ikea mount desk we
have the Mad Catz cyborg v5 keyboard a
Death Adder chroma Mouse and a pair of
Yamaha surround sound speakers excellent
work with cable manager and it seems
like you wrapped up the cables together
with some velcro and I'm happy to see
that you have something keeping your PC
from touching the carpet speaking of the
PC we have a gorgeous black and white
build inside the NZXT h4 40 case an FX
8350 paired with a GTX 970 and I'm
really digging those custom white cables
there's definitely some personality that
surrounds your setup the Lego models and
the guitars hanging from the walls
definitely add a nice touch very
impressive and clean setup Jack thank
you for entering and then before we have
sebastian with a very clean productivity
setup we have a thunderbolt display
hooked up to a 13 inch retina macbook
pro there isn't really much on the table
we have a Apple wireless keyboard
Logitech performance MX mouse and a lamp
from Ikea we also have a pair of m50x s
hanging from the Kancha headphone stand
which is hooked up to the side of the
monitor great work with cable management
as well it's actually very clever way of
keeping the power strip off of the
ground
for those that have a very short cable
so if you guys can mount it on the roof
of your table then here is an alternate
way of doing it we are there's really
nothing else I can say it's a clean set
up a little too clean for my taste but
the only thing I'll recommend is an
extended mouse pad or even a desk pad to
prevent your desk from scratches or even
wearing out the feet of your mouse
excellent set up Sebastian I definitely
think that Justin needs to take notes
from you but thank you for entering
setup words last but not least we have
one of my homies Tyga who also has a
tech channel so be sure to check him out
so looks like we have a white black and
red set up to 27-inch BenQ monitors a
dad's keyboard with a Logitech G 402
mouse on a tiny-ass mouse pad are you
seriously okay with that mouse pad we
also have some kinivo m2 speakers the
taotronics LED strips and a pretty sweet
salt lamp all the way on the left side
Kayle management is pretty good i see
that you tried I mean the subwoofer in
the middle is ruining things for you but
I get it
excellent work with wrapping the wires
together and using
Rek to keep your parish grip on I do
like the fact that you use your Alex
your unit to put some stuff on instead
of using our desk and I'll definitely
give you a point for those miniature
figures where we clean an organized set
up Thank You tiger for entering so

setup wars you guys know what to do make
