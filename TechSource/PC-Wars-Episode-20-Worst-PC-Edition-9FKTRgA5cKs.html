welcome to the long-awaited PC wars
episode 20 worst PC Edition so I reached
out on Twitter and asked you guys to
send me your crappy pcs in order to get
featured on the channel and a chance to
win $100 actually in what the pcs are
pretty bad this episode so instead of
giving them $100 I'm gonna give the
winner $200 instead
so hopefully that can get you guys $100
GPU and also $100 cpu for whoever wins
and you guys get to vote on the worst PC
so ladies and gentlemen with that said
let the PC Wars begin
so guys before I continue this episode
I'm gonna give you huge things to the
sponsors of this video dot tech domain
if you are passionate about technology
then dot tech is the perfect domain
extension for you
dots Tech has crossed over two hundred
thousand domain registrations and I've
seen large-scale adoption from the tech
community from the big guys like CES
tech tnw Tech and even Viacom dot tech
to upcoming startups like impact tech
source tech the domain extension is
catching on strongly in fact I have two
domains with them Edgard Tech which will
redirect you to my youtube channel and
also my most recent website deal source
dot tech which is basically my tech
deals website so if you guys want to
secure your own dot tech domain at a
great price at 399 for one year or
$49.99 for 10 years then visit WWE tag
and use coupon code at Gerwin or
edgerton respectively as always guys do
not take anything I say seriously in
these videos the worst Edition style
videos are just for pure entertainment
in fact you guys voluntarily submitted
your pcs just to be in this episode so I
did of this video there will be a straw
poll make sure you guys click on the
link and vote because the worst PC of
this episode will get $200 so with that
said let's begin so first up is Alex and
his PC which is rocking an x3 460 CPU
which is paired with a Radeon HD 6450
some really old parts as you can see
there's also a bunch of hard drive units
hooked up as well which is interesting
to see I do have to give you some props
at the cable management near the back I
mean at least you try to fix it up
instead of just leaving it like that for
benchmarks that scored at 272 which is
probably the lowest score that I've seen
on these episodes if you do in adding a
gtx 1050 with bring this PC back to life
although I would replace the CPU and
motherboard soon after so you don't
experience any bottlenecking
and then he is next up with another
ketchup and mustard build but at least
he has a better GPU and processor so
he's walking the i7 860 and a gtx 660 I
would definitely remove that enthusiast
build sticker though I don't think that
up
applies to this PC I don't have any
benchmark scores with this one so you
guys are gonna have to judge this PC
based on aesthetics Damian is next up
with a 4770k and a GTX 960 so the parts
are definitely there but what in God's
name is going on with the cable
management there is a loose cable near
the bottom and the GPU isn't even
connected on the first slot once again
there are no benchmarks but I'm going to
assume it's going to take the number one
spot because of these specs now here's
an example of someone who's faking their
PC just to enter everything is perfect
except the GPU but here's what threw me
off a bit
the second pci bracket is removed which
means that there was most likely another
powerful GPU in the slot that occupied
both of the PCI slots otherwise why
would you remove the second PCI bracket
if it doesn't bother you so this PC has
an i7 6700 K and he paired that with the
Radeon 54 50 which is the GPU in the
pictures something just doesn't add up
but what do you guys think should he be
disqualified or not I'll put them in the
vote just in case after all you guys
decide who gets the $200 not me
Meriden is next with this piece of
treasure it honestly looks like
something Nathan Drake would find in a
cave or something this thing is filled
with dust it also has the aim the x264
dual-core processor and a geforce 5200
turbo caged GPU and 1.8 gigabyte of ram
i didn't even think that was possible i
mean if you have tape holding up some
parts of your case from falling apart i
think it's time to upgrade last but not
least we have tom with another
questionable build so is rocking the i3
6100 cpu with an msi z170 motherboard
and no GPU everything else seems to be
either new or recently bought but I
don't know maybe saving up for a GPU I
don't really have any proof to say
otherwise he also sent me a pic of his
entire setup for some reason so here it
is anyways so yeah guys that's pretty
much the episode that's a really quick
one make sure you guys click on the
strawpoll link and vote on who you think
has the worst PC and who deserves the
$200 so hopefully they can use that
money towards a better processor or
maybe a better GPU
I don't know and there's guys do you
guys so much for watching I'll announce
the winner and
fifteen days on my social media accounts
make sure you're following me there best
of luck to the contestants who entered
and I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
