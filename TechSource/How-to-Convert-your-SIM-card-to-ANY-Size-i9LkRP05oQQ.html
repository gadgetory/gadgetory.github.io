Texas and today I'm going to show you
how to convert your sim card to any size
if you want to convert your sim card to
a bigger size then click on the box to
the left and if you want to reduce the
size click on the box to the right all
right so you want to convert your sim
card to a bigger size what you will need
to buy our sim adapters I left the link
in the description below on where you
can purchase one it comes in a set of
three sizes that you see here and all
you have to do is simply put the sim in
the desired size that you want so for
example if you want to convert your nano
sim to a standard sim then just simply
insert the nano in the standard adapter
and you are done it is the same concept
if you want to change it to a micro sim
and you can even use adapters within
each other so if you will have a nano
SIM you can insert that into a micro dr
and that into a standard adaptor and it
will work just fine these adapters are
the best you can find and the material
is very solid and very accurate and they
only cost a few bucks
okay so you want to convert your sim
card to a smaller size you can do this
by either cutting the SIM card with
scissors manually by using a template in
the description below or using a tool to
do it safely and easily so there are two
different sizes of these one is to
convert to a nano SIM and the other to
convert to a micro SIM I left links to
both of them in the description down
below however I strongly recommend to
purchase only the nano SIM cutter no
matter what size you want and I'll
explain why in a second if you have a
standard SIM card then you simply match
the orientation embedded on the tool and
insert it sideways after it's completely
inside you have to press on it like a
stapler for the SIM card to get cut now
if you have a micro sim instead of a
standard sim then you're going to have
to use this metal adapter that comes
with the tool you simply insert your
micro SIM in there and follow the same
exact steps as before the reason why I
prefer you to get this tool instead of
the other one is because even after you
cut it to a nano SIM you can always
convert it to any other size using
adapters which eliminates the need to
purchase two different cutting tools and
you can always use this for all your sim
cutting needs for all future phones so
that's how you convert your SIM card to
any size using either adapters or a
cutting tool however as I mentioned
before if you don't have time to wait
for your order to get delivered then you
can cut it manually with scissors using
the template in the description as a
guideline if you guys have any questions
or concerns feel free to leave them in
the comment section down below and I
will do my best to answer them this is
ad from tech source and I will see you
