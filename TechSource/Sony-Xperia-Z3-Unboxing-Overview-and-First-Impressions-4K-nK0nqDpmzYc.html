cell cashew compares iPhone prices on
the internet and gives you a quick quote
and the most cash for your iphone so if
you're looking to get the best price for
your iphone definitely check them out
it's simple fast and secure what does it
be guys it's at from Texas and the z3
has finally arrived I will be doing a
quick unboxing of the z3 along with an
overview and my first impression of the
device I'll also be taking requests from
you so if there's a specific video you
want to see with the z3 don't let me
know by dropping a comment down below so
opening up the box you will first find
the z3 inside a plastic sleeve under
this flap are a few accessories that
Sony has included one of which is the
power brick and the USB charging cable
Sony was also nice enough to include an
extra USB cap in case the original one
breaks off it seems that Sony has heard
the cries of the previous experience and
decided to do something about it so plus
one for Sony there the rest of the stuff
in the box our manuals and warranty info
that i won't bother going through so the
Z 2 was released not too long ago for
other countries except the US so I was
anticipating a US model to hit the
stores soon but sony has surprised us
with a new phone entirely so the z3 has
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset with a
quad core 2.5 gigahertz Krait 400
processor else's an Adreno 330 GPU and
three gigs of ram it also has a 30 100
million battery which is 100 less than
the Z to the z3 also comes in a variety
of four colors with 16 gigabytes of
internal storage which can be expanded
by an additional 120 gigabytes via
microSD card sony has never disappointed
me when it comes to design they kept a
flat tempered glass back and front and
made the edges rounder sony also stuck
with the aluminum frame and the total
weight of z3 has been reduced nearly 10
grams to 150 to easily one of the best
looking and feeling phones that I've
ever felt when it comes to one-hand use
I find it pretty convenient to use
although I do have large hands which
makes it a lot easier however I can't
quite reach the top without tilting the
device I also noticed how smooth the
interface is there was absolutely no lag
as I was using the device then again
this isn't really surprising Sony is
notorious for having a very light skin
on Android phones and personally it's
one of my favorites when it comes to
android devices one thing i also love
about the xperia lineup and the z3
especially is the fact that it does not
have any buttons on the face of the
phone it's all touch screen so looking
at the right side of z three you will
find the camera launch button volume
rockers power button and the micro SD
card slot and underneath this flap is
where the sim tray is located for nano
SIM cards on the opposite side there is
a lanyard section a charging dock
connector and the USB charging port
another impressive feature on the z3 is
its camera no doubt with a 20 point
seven megapixel rear facing camera and a
larger wide-angle lens the z3 will no
doubt take stunning pictures we will be
doing a camera test against other
flagship so make sure you guys stick
around for that speaking of the camera
test the camera UI is very similar to
that of zitu with some new camera apps
added like sound photo which lets you
take pictures with sound in the
background which is actually pretty cool
the layout has also been slightly
modified but you can still find the
original settings in the exact same
locations so the screen hasn't changed
at all the z3 still rocking a 5.2 inch
1080p LCD screen Sony's definitely
taking its time before jacking up the
pixel count 22 k I personally don't care
much for 2k displays on phones not only
is it overkill but it definitely impacts
battery life and performance as well
needless to say i'm glad that z3 stuck
with 1080p the speakers on the z3 are
also pretty impressive although it's no
boom sound technology it still does
sound pretty damn good considering that
there are waterproof speakers here's a
quick sample with max volume the mic is
placed directly in front of the phone 1
feet away
for celebration 7 my first impressions
with the z3 is that it's definitely a
beautiful waterproof phone I do love how
it feels in the hand the interface is
super smooth and uploaded like other
android phones when it comes to
smartphones I'm really picky when it
comes to design and the z3 definitely
delivers the premium field one thing
that kind of bothers me are the corners
of the device only did this on purpose
to protect the phone if it were to drop
but I would have preferred a more
seamless design instead the phone is
also a bit taller for its screen size
but I understand that they had to do
that for the front facing speakers and
waterproof certification anyway that's
it for the unboxing overview and my
first impressions of the Xperia z3 what
do you guys think about the phone let me
know your thoughts in the comments
section down below I got a bunch of
coverage on the z3 coming up within the
next few day so make sure you guys stick
around for those if there's a specific
type of video you would like to see with
the z3 then let me know by dropping a
comment down below as well anyways this
is that from tech source and i'll see
you guys next time so before i go i
wanted to share an awesome website with
