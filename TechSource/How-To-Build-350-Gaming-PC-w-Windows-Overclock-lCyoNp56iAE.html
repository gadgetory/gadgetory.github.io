welcome to the build guide of butter on
the $350 gaming PC for the month of
February if you miss the gaming
benchmarks video you can find a link to
it in the description section down below
if you want to build the best possible
gaming PC for only 350 bucks then you
came to the right place I'll be showing
you step-by-step instructions on
building the PC installing Windows
downloading the drivers and even
overclocking the CPU all the parts using
this build will be linked down below as
well as optional parts that include an
SSD a CPU cooler and upgraded graphics
cards if you want something with a
little more power all you need to build
this PC is a screwdriver now if you're
standing on carpet just make sure to
touch the PC case every now and then to
ground yourself so that you don't build
up static and end up damaging the
components you can also buy anti-static
wrist straps which you can find linked
down below but it's not needed step one
is to lay your PC case down and remove
the motherboard from its box then take
your CPU with the pins facing downwards
and match the triangle on the socket to
the gold triangle on your CPU once you
figured out which direction is correct
gently place the CPU down and do not
apply any force and especially do not
touch the surface if you do you will
need to wipe off your fingerprint make
sure to use 75% or greater isopropyl and
a tissue or lint-free cloth like a
coffee filter if you do use tissue or
toilet paper just make sure to blow off
the remaining length from the CPU if
there are any if the CPU doesn't rest in
place you may need to wiggle it around a
bit for it to fall in place
but I mentioned before do not apply
pressure since the pins are very fragile
after that lower the lever and lock it
in place the plastic cover should pop
right off so don't freak out next step
is to install the RAM sticks release the
locks off each slot that you're
installing there is one on each side
gently lower the RAM sticks evenly and
apply firm pressure on both sides at the
same time in order to snap them in place
repeat the same process for all the RAM
sticks if you installed it correctly the
locks should be fully seated inside of
the RAM now it's time to install the CPU
cooler depending on what cooler you are
installing make sure to follow the
instructions listed on the manual if you
decided to pick up the optional Evo 212
cooler that
below they need to watch my build guide
for the Z on PC since I go over the
installation process there and you guys
can find the link to the video down
below if you're installing the stock
cooler like in this video then just
follow these steps first position the
cooler and the orientation you want and
what I usually do is I make sure to have
the least cable slack as possible for a
cleaner wiring job I was actually
running on four hours of sleep when I
built this PC so I didn't realize that
the CPU fan header was actually near the
top of the motherboard so instead of
connecting the cable to the chassis span
which is labeled C aka fan you need to
hook it up to the CPU fan instead
labeled CPU fan you can find that right
above the RAM sticks anyway so
installing the stock cooler is easy you
don't need thermal paste since it
already comes pre applied with some you
will need to match the four holes on the
motherboard with the four pins on the
cooler so gently lower the CPU cooler
down until it comes in contact with the
motherboard then simply press down on
the four tabs to snap it into place you
can look at the back of the motherboard
to double-check that the cooler has been
fully seated by looking at the four pins
sticking out once the cooler is fully
seated connect the cable running from it
to the CPU fan header on the motherboard
which I stated before should be on the
top of the motherboard near the RAM
sticks you are not ready to install the
i/o shield and the standoffs in the case
some i/o shields come with these
annoying pins that stick out and what I
usually do is remove the big one since
they interfere with installation but you
can also fold them away as well a good
way to determine if the i/o shield won't
interfere with the motherboard is to
place it on the motherboard itself and
see if there are any pins that are in
the way
if they are just simply fold them and
remove them once you already insert the
i/o shield in the back of the case with
the three circle cutouts located near
the bottom make sure to apply some
pressure on all four the corners to snap
it in place now let's install the
standoffs you will need six of these
gold screws that came with the case and
you need to install them in these exact
locations once they are nicely tightened
go ahead and gently lower the
motherboard in and while avoiding
bumping it into the case and trying to
match the cutouts of the i/o shield with
the motherboard ports you will then need
six of these silver screws with a
head and you can begin screwing in the
motherboard as always I recommend a
crisscross pattern while tightening the
screws and please don't over tighten
them only tighten them to a point where
it's comfortable you can do this by
using the screwdriver with your fingers
and not your entire hand if that makes
any sense
next up we are going to install the hard
drive make sure the exposed area is
facing downwards but the connection
ports facing outwards slide the hard
drive in any one of the racks and make
sure to line the holes with the tray
then you will need to screw it in using
these two silver screws if you're
installing an SSD instead the process is
the same next up it's time to install
the power supply so lay down your case
and insert the power supply with the fan
facing downwards towards the cutout
located at the top of your case you will
need four of these to screw in the power
supply you can use your other hand to
push the PSU against the case in order
to align the holes if you want to now
let's connect the hard drive to the
motherboard grab the black and white
SATA cable that came with your
motherboard and connect one end of it to
the back of the hard drive and connect
the other end to either of the yellow
SATA ports on the motherboard that's
located near the bottom now let's
connect the rear fan grab the cable from
the fan and hook it up to the chassis
fan header which should be right next to
the battery next let's go ahead and get
these annoying cables out of the way
let's start off with the HD audio cable
you don't need the AC 97 so go ahead and
ignore that locate the AAA PP pins on
the bottom left of the motherboard and
connect the HD audio to it make sure
that the words HD audio are facing
upwards next up is USB cable and this
one connects to either one of the pins
labeled USB which should be to the left
of the yellow SATA cables this time make
sure the words USB are faced downwards
next up are the power LED wires and
these connect to the yellow pins on the
motherboard right above the SATA ports
so the positive one goes in first on the
top left and then the negative one goes
to the right of that right next to it
just like this next up we have the power
switch and this one goes right next to
the two power LEDs it doesn't really
matter which way you insert this one in
next up is the HDD LED and this one goes
right under the power LEDs with the
words facing downwards and finally the
reset switch goes right neck
so the HDD led and it doesn't matter
which way you face this one as well
here's a quick look at what the bottom
part should look like
again the reset switch can be facing
downwards or upwards it doesn't matter
now let's give some power to the hard
drive so grab the SATA power cable from
the power supply that looks something
like this and connect it to the back of
the hard drive right next to the SATA
connection now we're going to connect
the 24 pin motherboard cable and it
looks something like this
locate the 24 pin socket on the
motherboard which is located to the
right side of the RAM sticks and hook
them up make sure the clip from the 24
pin cable is fully seated and that there
are no gaps
the next cable we're going to connect is
for the front fan so grab the female
molex connector from the front case fan
and grab a male molex connector from the
power supply and connect the two
together the last cable you're
connecting is for the CPU grab the cable
that has two four pin connectors
labelled CPU and connect only one of
them to the socket on the motherboard
located right above the CPU fan make
sure you hear it snap in place so we are
done with connecting all the cables the
final piece to this build is the
graphics card but before we can install
it we need to remove the two PCIe plates
in the back just use your screwdriver or
flathead and push them out then you can
grab it from the other end and pull them
off you may need to wiggle a little bit
for them to get loose first before you
insert your graphics card in there make
sure to peel off any stickers that are
still on it face the GPU so that the fan
is facing downwards and hook it up to
the very first PCI slot on the
motherboard for optimal performance
while holding up the GPU use one of the
same screws that you use for the power
supply and tighten it up so you're
basically done assembling your PC if you
did everything correctly your PC should
look something like this basically a
Fender were to vomit in your case take
this time to do some cable management of
elico straps and zip ties that great
what I did was wrap everything together
and store all the cables on the top
right also make sure all the cables are
connected and fully seated to avoid
budda problems now we are ready to
install a fresh copy of Windows 8.1 and
you guys can upgrade to Windows 10 for
free later on if you're putting in your
old SSD or hard drive that already has
windows on it then you don't need this
step for everyone else this is what you
do grab
I strive with at least 8 gigabytes of
space and plug it into a different
computer this is the Microsoft website
and download the installation media I
did leave a link to it down below click
on the create media button so downloads
it on your PC go ahead and install and
run the program make sure to select the
language Edition and architecture of
your PC everything should match with my
screen unless you're using a different
language and windows Edition click Next
and select the USB flash drive option
and click Next again to choose your USB
Drive that you have connected to your PC
once you click on next for a final time
a message will appear stating that the
files will be deleted on the USB Drive
so make sure that you don't have
anything important on them click on OK
to proceed this should take some time to
download depending on your internet
speed but once it's done it will stay
that your USB Drive is ready you will
need a legit Windows CD key to continue
if you don't want to pay full price for
them you can find them for around 25
bucks on the reddit CD key swapper which
is where I get all my CD keys from I'll
going to drop a link to this page in the
description section if anyone is
interested but wherever you guys get
your CD key from make sure it's for
Windows 8.1 pro Edition and not a
standard edition once you get your CD
key we are ready to install windows so
go ahead and insert the USB drive into
the PC you just built and boot it up it
should automatically detect the USB
Drive and take you straight to the
activation screen if it doesn't restart
the PC and hit the f8 key for the boot
menu and select the USB flash drive
option if the USB Drive doesn't come up
then you connected the USB cables
incorrectly on the motherboard make sure
to go back and watch that part again
once you get to the activation window go
ahead and type in the CD key and select
next accept the terms and conditions and
then once you get to the screen select
the custom option and select the drive
you want to install windows on if you
have only one like me then select the
primary partition which is usually
labeled number 2 and then go ahead and
hit next let windows do its thing and
install usually when it's complete it
will tell you to remove the USB drive
and click on OK to restart the PC but in
my case it didn't so if you see the PC
restarting on its own quickly remove the
USB Drive so it doesn't boot from it
again windows will continue to install
the files and set everything up for you
once you get to the personalize screen
follow the instructions and
all of the boxes until you reach the
home screen now it's time to install the
drivers since the PC doesn't come with a
built-in Wi-Fi adapter you can buy one
of these things that cost around $10 and
plug it into a USB port and voila you
have Wi-Fi I'll drop a link to it down
below if anyone is interested but if
you're going to connect your PC via
ethernet cable then you don't need it so
first we are going to install the
motherboard drivers so go to the Asus
website and search for your motherboard
I let the link to it down below so it's
easier for you guys to find it once
you're at the screen select the support
tab then navigate through drivers and
tools once you're over here you have to
select your windows operating system
which should be 8.1 and they need to
download the following the chipset
software Realtek audio drivers real
Techland drivers and as an optional
download that I recommend the Asus AI
suite 3 program once you downloaded
those four files make sure to extract
them and install them on your PC then
you are ready to install the graphics
card driver since we have a gtx card
visit the GeForce website once again
I'll leave a link to it down below once
you are here download the automatic
Driver updates since it will always
detect your GPU and keep your drivers
updated once it's downloaded and
installed on your PC you are done with
all of the drivers finally it's time to
do the overclocking if you don't want to
overclock your cpu you can skip this
step and you are done but if you want
increased performance then follow these
steps turn on the PC or restart it and
hit the Delete key on the keyboard to
get into the BIOS once you are here
click on the Advanced Mode tab on the
bottom or just simply hit f7 and
navigate to the AI Tweaker tab once you
are here make sure that the settings on
your BIOS match with everything on my
screen the CPU core ratio should be set
to sync all cores and the ratio limit
should be set to 43 to achieve the 4.3
gigahertz clock speed scroll down to the
CPU core voltage section and set that to
manual mode and then proceed to override
the voltage to one point three four five
once you do that hit f10 to save your
settings and then it will reboot your PC
once you get to the desktop screen you
can open up CPU Z which is a free
program and check your overclock speeds
as you can see it's showing four point
two nine nine now I did stress test the
PC for ten hours using prime95 so these
settings are stable
please keep in mind that not all CPUs
are the same and if you experience
crashes then you need to lower your
clock speed adding a CPU cooler that I
link below can definitely help prolong
the life of your CPU and get you even
higher clock speeds so that's it for the
video of this helped you out or if you
enjoy my build guides make sure to leave
a like as it does help me out a ton and
if you have any questions feel free to
find me on Twitter then guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
