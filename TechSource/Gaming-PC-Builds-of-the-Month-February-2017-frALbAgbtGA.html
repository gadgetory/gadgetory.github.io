and welcome to February's PC bills of
the month now I know I haven't done one
of these in a while but I'm officially
back on track so kick it off this
episode actually we're gonna be looking
at Intel's new 7th gen CPUs and I got
two pretty cool bills for you guys so
it's going to check them out you guys
can build a solid gaming PC for only
three hundred sixty three dollars and
forty seven cents at the time of this
video it will get you over 40 FPS and
most games and high settings in fact I
bought all the parts for this PC you
know we'll be doing a benchmark video as
well as they build guide because you
guys want to follow along and build one
for yourself make sure to pick these
parts up before they go out of stock the
CPU we are going with is the G 45 60
which is Intel's new low-end seventh gen
dual-core processor that acts as a quad
core thanks to its hyper threading
technology and actually performs better
than the G 3250 like I said make sure
you guys are subscribed to the channel
so you don't miss out on the benchmarks
we're going with usual eight gigs of ram
and crucial for only $50 and for space
we are packing it with a one terabyte
hard drive from Western Digital of
course this is optional you guys can add
an additional SSD if you choose a 120
gigabyte SSD from a data is very cheap
and it will increase your boot up and
load time we're trying to keep the
budget at a very low cost which is why
we went with the gtx 1050 from ZOTAC and
the reason why I went with this over the
RX 460 was because the temp if we
actually performed better across all the
games I've tested in my top 5 GPUs under
$200 in case you guys missed that video
I'll drop a link to it down below
definitely check it out however if you
have an extra hundred dollars to spend
on a GPU and want more performance I
would obviously upgrade this to the GTX
1060 if you want to game over 60fps and
high settings powering the entire build
is the 430 watch power supply from EVGA
which is all the juice it needs and
finally the case you are going with is
the DIY PC that goes for only 21 dollars
which is perfect for this budget it even
features a front panel USB 3.0 port now
this case is out of stock the next best
option around 20 dollars is the Zeon 310
that currently has a $5 MLM rebate so
technically you would be paying $18 only
if all the parts are in stock you are
looking at a total of 363 and 47 cents
to get you a solid budget
rig once again all the parts will be
linked below now if you have a bit more
to spend for a better performance then
this is the build I would recommend
especially if you want to upgrade down
the line it's only going to cost you
around $850 and it features the new 7600
K quad core processor which is easily
overclockable once you hook up the
architects freezer seven coolers of
course this is impossible without a
solid z board so we're going with the
new Z 270 chipset to take advantage of
the extra four PCI Lane support and
Intel's new obtain technology which
essentially gets you a faster PC with
shorter boot times and load times
whether it's for gaming or productivity
for RAM later starting with two sticks
of four gigabytes each which is plenty
for gaming however there is room for two
additional sticks down the line for
storage we are using a 128 gigabyte SSD
as the main drive for the operating
system and of course a few other
important programs while the one
terabyte Western Digital hard drive will
take care of everything else
I did start to build out with a gtx 1066
gigabyte variants from EVGA which will
easily get you 60fps and high settings
in most triple-a titles but you do have
the option of upgrading to a gtx 1070 or
even a 1080 if you like the 500 watt
power supply from EVGA will be plenty
even for a GTX 1080 and that overclock
see you finally storing everything is
the courser 100 our mid tower case that
features a clear side panel two USB 3.0
ports in the front and a tool-free hard
drive bay for easy installation
everything at the door will cost you
eight 44 and 72 cents from the time of
making this video and as always all the
parts will be links down below if you
guys are excited about the budget build
coming up on this channel make sure to
leave a like to show your support and if
you guys have a specific price range in
mind for my next month's PC build let me
know in the comments section down below
I always read them and take ideas for my
next episode thank you guys so much for

down below and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
