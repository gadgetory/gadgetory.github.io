to season three of setup or is the show
where you submit that setup to get
featured on the channel if you guys want
to participate you know what to do make
sure to watch the video link down below
but with that said let the set up wars
begin kicking off the episode we have a
very clean set up from Blue Mill coming
from India and there's an interesting
story behind this setup so apparently
boom mill was planning on building a PC
but he hesitated because he wasn't
confident enough to build one but after
watching my build guides he decided to
go for it and build his very first PC
and I gotta say this is your first build
you did a fantastic job putting it
together
I love how clean it looks great work
with cable management and extra points
for going with the custom sleeve cables
the only thing I would change in this
build is moving the GPU to the top slot
so that you're getting the most
performance out of that PCIe Lane but
other than that it's a beast PC and the
specs are insane as well this goes to
show that anyone can build a PC if it's
your first time do not get intimidated
there are so many helpful guides out
there that can help you out whether it's
YouTube videos or other websites and I
even have a bunch of videos on my
channel that can guide you from start to
finish
even for overclocking and installing
windows and all that stuff but actually
I have another build guide coming up
very soon so stick around alright so the
setups purpose is coding graphic design
and gaming and he's walking a gaming
ultra light from LG that's sandwiched by
two Presonus speakers and I love that
you picked up some stands for them
believe it or not tilting the speakers
even just a few degrees so that their
position at your ears makes a noticeable
difference keeping with the minimalistic
theme we got the surface wireless
keyboard and mouse although I'm very
curious how you gain with those
especially with that tiny mouse pad
actually as soon as I said that I just
noticed the gaming keyboard and the
mouse in the other drawer so I'm
guessing he swaps these out for gaming I
do like that little shelf he installed
next to his desk to hold his Octus seven
wireless gaming headset and the samson
microphone I probably would have painted
that shelf in white though so it matches
the desk but it's not a big deal right
next to his PC setup is his console
setup with a 43 inch Samsung
TV na JBL cinema soundbar and we also
got his ps4 pro console I would try and
mount the sound bar on the wall above
the TV if you want the best sound the
cable management is very clean but it's
interesting as well so instead of
leaving the cable box on the ground he
actually mounted it against the wall and
he used a channel Raceway to hide the
cables going down but looks like he also
covered the bottom portion of the wall
with some paper and some tape it looks
like I'm not really sure what's going on
down here
the wires behind the PC are neatly
wrapped in a spiral sleeve and the
cables behind the desk are managed well
the LED lighting with the nettle leaf
panels up top give the setup just enough
spice to stand out and I think it did a
great job putting everything together
Thank You Bluebell for entering next up
is Kristian aka crow man who broke the
Internet on December 28th after he
uploaded his mancave for the world to
see apparently someone to the math and
everything in here costs over a hundred
and fifteen thousand dollars I featured
him on my IG page on the 29th and people
went crazy so I decided to bring him on
setup Wars where it belongs
let's not if I'm looking at both of his
setups over here in the corner which is
powered by one ridiculous water-cooled
PC the setup on the right has a 31 and a
half 8k monitor from Dell and know that
is not a mistake it's an 8k display
Jesus
it looks like he's using the same course
or keyboard for both setups and only one
Mouse that he swaps between the two of
them which makes sense I mean why spend
another $70 on a second Mouse when you
can save that money although I would buy
a mousepad for the other setup with the
49 inch super ultra ride from Samsung
Christian definitely knows a thing or
two when it comes to good audio this guy
is rocking a pair of keV LS 50 wireless
speakers and for those of you who are
not familiar with these these speakers
go for around $2,000 and they are well
known for their excellent music
reproduction as well as burning hall and
wallets but it doesn't even stop there
he also has high-end headphones
we got the Sennheiser HD 800 s which he
claims are the best headphones for
gaming due to their stellar soundstage
and imaging now if you think $2,000
speakers are expensive then you don't
want to look up how much has focal
utopia headphones cost I'm just glad
he's using a really good DAC an amp for
both his headphones
he definitely knows what he's doing here
you know one thing that caught my
attention was the desk that he's using
it's the IKEA lemon tabletop and it's
interesting to see a cheap $150 desk
when everything else on top of it is so
expensive personally I would have gone
with a much nicer countertop like the
egg backend or even the Lille Trask
because I say it they're built better
and will look way better in this setup
the pc powering both of these setups is
a beast so check this out the cpu is the
79 80 XC which is bend and be lidded and
it's also overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz
on all 16 cores he's using the asus rog
rampage 6 motherboard with 128 gigs of
ram and not one or two but four Titan
XPS in SLI truly an overkill beast right
over here and this is just one corner of
his insane man cave on the other wall we
have his productivity setup which
consists of a 10 core iMac pro we got a
dell 5k monitor and a 2018 eye 9 MacBook
Pro with a pair of those keffe speakers
and the Sennheiser HD 800 s headphones
I'm not sure if that's the same pair or
an extra one but who cares at this point
personally if my office was in that room
I would not get any work done we
wrapping up this insane mancave we have
the home theater set up on the other
side of the wall powered by Dolby Atmos
he does have a massive 78 inch curved 4k
TV from Samsung
however he uses a hundred twenty five
inch projector sometimes to game on his
consoles but let me tell you why this
console setup is so awesome first off
he's using $10,000 floor speakers from
vocal combined with a bunch of keffe
speakers and subs but the icing on the
cake is Dolby Atmos which really changes
the way you experience sound I actually
had the chance to experience this at CES
and I even made a video on it and it's
kind of hard to explain it in a video
format this is one of the things you
have to experience it yourself at least
once to know what I'm talking about
but really those feel like the game
comes to life or what kind of sucks you
in the game it's very immersive and it's
definitely an experience I've never had
before
this guy is truly gaming the right way
but sadly Dolby Atmos isn't supported on
a lot of games yet but once it does he's
got the perfect setup for it a side note
I do like the custom made NES coffee
table in the center I mean what can I
say it's an epic
man cave and it's pretty much everyone's
wet dream to own something like this is
it overkill obviously but in the end if
it brings happiness who cares
next up is James from Washington State
and it's perfectly executed dual setup
there's a lot of planning and wiring
that went into this which I'll explain
in a bit but he's rocking to 27 inch HD
monitors that are mounted against the
wall and it looks like the cables are
routed through the wall itself the
keyboard mouse and keypad are all from
Razer and he has oldest connected to a
USB switch which allows him to swap
between his PC and the laptop on the
left side he also installed two HDMI
switches which allows him to swap
between the monitors and the TV so that
he can use his racing rig he even went
the extra mile to include a wiring
diagram to show how everything is
connected I really hope he didn't make
this diagram just for this show because
that looks like a lot of work and it was
definitely not necessary I don't want
you to waste your time but regardless I
do appreciate the effort
Bharati oh he's got a few headsets
hanging from the wall we got the action
of a 50s for the PC the astroid 20s for
the Xbox one and the Bose AE twos for
listening to music in addition to
headphones he does use speakers from
Logitech for his setup now on the other
side he does have another monitor with a
keyboard and mouse so that he can use
the PC from this location as well
speaking of it's a blacked out clean
build equipped with the rising v 1600 X
we got 32 gigs of ram and the EVGA 1080
FTW inside the air 540 case from Corsair
the rest of the cables from the set up
are managed well but I'm more impressed
at the wiring and having everything set
up in a way to make things convenient
like swapping between multiple sources
adding a wall shelf to hold up your sub
is actually a clever idea and so is
using the wall mounting brackets to hook
up the desk to the wall instead of using
actual legs you know it's very
impressive to see the transformation
from your previous setup in just a few
months of planning and it makes me happy
that my channel gave you some
inspiration excellent setup and thank
you James for entering at number 4 is
Bryce and his super ultra white setup
that he uses for gaming and graphic
design I do like the tricolor scheme of
this setup white red and black which
kind of reminds me of my setup colors so
the desk is being held up by some
capital legs and then we got the Alex
drawers as support and
that we got the razor chromakey board
with the m65 RGB mouse from Corsair for
audio he's using the white at blue yeti
microphone and a pair of Kanto speakers
I was going to say something about
putting the speakers on its sides but I
do see that you put pads underneath it
so I'll let that go
I do like the custom backboard that you
made to cover up the messy Signum rack
behind it but the wires from the PC can
use some work
I do recommend a braided cable sleeves
to wrap the cables so it's not as
noticeable finally the PC part in the
setup has an 87 2k 16 gigs of ram and
the MSI GTX 1080 there's not much going
on here it's a pretty straightforward
setup Thank You Bryce for entering
wrapping up the episode is a very clean
and minimalistic setup from row he'd
coming from the Netherlands this setups
purpose is simple gaming and it's pretty
straightforward
we got a 27-inch Samsung monitor mounted
against the wall and below that we got a
z77 eagled mechanical keyboard with the
Razer abysus Mouse I really love what he
did with the PC mounting it on the wall
shelf is a clever way to deal with space
limitations and avoid leaving the PC on
the floor I'm just not sure how secure
that shelf is without any support
because it kind of looks like it's
tilting down a little bit so I would be
careful it doesn't come slamming down
speaking of which it's actually a pretty
beefy build it's got the 4790k 16 gigs
of ram and the GTX 10 atti it actually
fits beautifully with the entirety
mother setup with the exception of the
monitor there is a much cables to manage
over here a simple Raceway coming down
from monitor and we also have one behind
the set up the only thing I would have
done differently was use a white raceway
instead of a black one for the monitor
cables nonetheless it's a very
interesting compact setup you got here
Oh he'd thank you for entering and that
wraps up the first episode of season 3
of setup wars as always makes you guys
drop your comments below and vote on who
you think has the second-best setup
because obviously Christian takes the
crown on this one let me know if you
guys enjoy the new season or if you guys
enjoy the intro let me know feedback in
the comment section as well and try new
things obviously but as always leave a
like if you enjoyed and a dislike if you
didn't and I will see you guys
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
