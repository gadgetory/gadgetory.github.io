temporarily to one hundred dollars and
this is pretty much a wireless and
portable version of the Amazon echo over
the weekend I did pick up a copy of the
last of us since I have yet to play it
on my ps4 and also because it's only ten
dollars sometimes it pays off to wait a
while before buying a game rather than
buying it at lunch the m40 exes have
also dipped in price to eighty dollars
and some might even argue that these
sound way better than the m50x s which
are actually the pair of headphones that

inch quad HD display going for only 219
dollars now although it's from an
