inch gaming monitor from benq 144 hurts
one millisecond response time for three
hundred and twenty dollars now you can
use the built-in stand or mounted
anywhere that is Vesta compatible the
popular amazon tab has dropped in price
temporarily to one hundred dollars and
this is pretty much a wireless and
portable version of the Amazon echo over
the weekend I did pick up a copy of the
last of us since I have yet to play it
on my ps4 and also because it's only ten
dollars sometimes it pays off to wait a
while before buying a game rather than
buying it at lunch the m40 exes have
also dipped in price to eighty dollars
and some might even argue that these
sound way better than the m50x s which
are actually the pair of headphones that
I'm using every day nonetheless for
eighty dollars you guys can get a very
solid all-around headphones for gaming

movies if you're looking for a solid

good deal on a 24 inch to millisecond
response time monitor only for a hundred
and twenty dollars that is also vase a
compatible not bad $65 for 240 gigs is
currently one of the cheapest prices you
can find on any SSD especially from a
reliable brand dropping to newegg flash
you can find a pretty solid deal on a 27
inch quad HD display going for only 219
dollars now although it's from an
unknown company I can vouch for the
quality as I've bought one a few months
back it is a bit difficult connecting
via displayport to due to compatibility
issues which is why they recommend using
a DVI port instead the cooler master
half x power is going for a hundred
sixty dollars with a male and rebate and
this thing can support up to four Way
SLI and comes with a side panel fan for
better airflow judging by the reviews on
this case it's definitely a solid one so

gtx 1070 is going for 410 dollars after
