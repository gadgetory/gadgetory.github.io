Soros so this is gonna be an interesting
and boxing episode you might be
wondering ed why are we in your living
room the simple answer is because of
this this was delivered from digital
storm yesterday on a pallet and it is
obviously you can tell it's really huge
and it's very heavy I tried to lift it
by myself I broke off the tabs there's
no way I can move this thing to my car
and take it to the office so I thought
you know what let's unbox it over here
hopefully and wait a lot less after the
unboxing and then I could take it to the
office benchmark and play games and
stuff like that so yeah with that said I
think let's just open this box and see
what we're dealing with I have no idea
what the specs are and I don't know what
it looks like so I'm very excited to
check it out let's just do this
I don't even know how I'm gonna get the
pc out of this box to be honest but
let's just let's take it one step at a
time all right so this is pretty much
the bag with the extra accessories I
didn't and abusing and the extra cables
from the power supply we also got this
box over here which I'm guessing or the
manuals of course you got the remote for
the RGB lights and the power cable so
every time you buy a PC from digital
storm they include this binder and
inside here you'll find well of course
your certificate of ownership you gotta
have that and then as well as some quick
startup guides on how you can connect
your PC and stuff and near the back is
the CDs which I don't think anybody even
uses 2018 who still uses CD drives
yeah there's no way I can lift this by
myself outside of this box and I'm the
only one here so I'm gonna have to
figure out a different way to get this
thing out of here you know what I have
no choice I'm not to destroy this box
that was a little anticlimactic yeah I
can't really see from that because of
the tempered glass panels and it looks
like it's an inverted PC because this
side is where the components are and
this is the backside and I can see some
foams in there as well so I'm gonna take
this to the office and take a closer
look
hi guys we're back in the office finally
let's open up the side panels and take a
closer look inside this is actually the
back panel so we'll start off with this
side first let me take off these thumb
screws
I wish the side panel was on a hinge
though that way you'll be a lot easier
to open up but I'm screws are okay that
is the cleanest cable management I have
ever seen
whoa look at this block over here that's
crazy all right guys now it's time for
the other side oh I'm so excited let's
take a look at this baby and that is why
I don't like thumb screws oh I gotta say
something on the packaging I don't know
if you guys ever shipped a water-cooled
system but it is not easy there's a lot
of components in there that can bend or
crack
I'll get loose so the fact that they did
such a great job in packaging and they
included this foam thing inside which
helps keep all the components together
look at that it's outlined for the
tubing here whoa
so here it is ladies and gentlemen the
Aventa max water-cooled gaming PC
designed from the ground up by digital
storm this thing costs eight grand and
it's rocking a new 8086 k64 processor 32
gigs of ram from g scale at 3000
megahertz and not one but two geforce
gtx ten ATT is in sli using the stock
sli bridge
so the storage in here is also pretty
beefy not only does they have a six
terabyte hard drive but it's also using
the Intel obtain 960 gigabyte pci based
SSD which i'm guessing is what the
operating system is installed on i want
to talk about the cooling and airflow
for a bit because this is some crazy
stuff if you guys haven't noticed
already take a look down here there is a
five sixty five sixty millimeter
radiator going across from one side to
the other with quad one forty millimeter
fans as intake and in the back there was
an additional two eighty millimeter
radiator and we're not even done yet
guys there's another three sixty
millimeter red on the top i mean the
back of the pc looks just as good as the
front
thanks to these dope looking fluid
distribution blocks and check this out
guys there's a custom made power panel
above which helps out with the cable
management so instead of running the
cables through the back and into the
power supply you can just connect them
to this panel and you're done it makes
the system look so much cleaner and it
minimizes the clutter of cables in the
back another thing i notice is that the
tubes in the front actually have a quick
disconnect fitting attached to each one
of them so if you ever need to remove
the motherboard for upgrading parts or
maybe you want to clean your system
instead of draining the entire system
you can just pull these out but anyways
I'm done mumbling guys it's actually
hook this up turn it on and take it for
an actual test drive
you
all right so we're playing pipe G right
now to test out the beast and see how it
handles it sadly it does not support SLI
so only the top GP was working I think
my da here actually let me kill this guy
first I'm gonna rush him real quick
oh yeah he must be really bad because I
suck at pop G and the fact that I can
kill somebody means he sucks so yeah as
I was saying it doesn't support SLI so
only the top GPU is working we are
getting around 8590 FPS indoors but for
some reason when I go outdoors the FPS
goes up a bit okay see now we're getting
in the 90s
sometimes closer to 100 FPS when we're
outdoors so it's fluctuating up and down
this is maxed out settings by the way on
a 38 40 by 1200 resolution it's a very
weird resolution on the Samsung CJ 89
monitor by the way guys both CPU and GPU
are overclocked I managed to push the
CPU to 5.1 gigahertz at 1.3 15 volts and
the GPU I added 125 megahertz on the
boost clock for both GPUs VP was
hovering around 55 56 degrees
consistently at 2012 megahertz what was
that guy doing there all he was looting
oh my god the luckiest I've ever been
what's a barrel am 760 was anything done
so yeah guys temp wise it's around 60 to
70 degrees for the CPU fluctuates
between that and the GPU is around 55 56
degrees so overall very low temps
overclocked by the way and the PC still
remains this quiet it's crazy like I
can't hear anything like I'll get close
to it guys and you can hear it's dead
silent that is crazy
when you spend this kind of money on a
PC you get also that peace of mind all
their pcs do come with our standard
warranty which is one year parts and
three year labor so if anything were to
go wrong on a high-end water-cooled PC
like this then you're gonna be covered
okay so the Aventa max comes with an RGB
remote and this controls the RGB strip
around the case so if I want to change
the color for example the green I just
said green and blue you could even
select a few modes so here's a pulsating
one you got the seizure one oh whoa what
is that
that looks cool so yeah a bunch of
options on there which is pretty cool
and very convenient actually now if you
want to change the colors on the actual
fans and the RAM sticks and the
motherboard they need to have to
download the courser app and the Asus
are a sync if you want to control the
LED lights on the components itself all
right now let's try csgo this is
obviously a less demanding game does
support us a lot it looks like because
both GPUs are running nicely curious to
see how many frames we get though I
wonder if there's a cap in this game
what's a good gun is the m4 good so max
settings at 38 40 by 1200 resolution I'm
getting around to 54 to 59 it's going
all the way to to 60 fps what does
camper
I don't know BOTS could camp so yeah
over 20 of FPS has to lie both of the
GPUs are Jesus how many so both GPUs are
at a constant 2012 megahertz
it is not dipping at all
thank God temps are also still low we're
looking at under 50 degrees for the top
GPU we're looking at under 50 degrees
for the top GPU and around 40 degrees
for the bottom GPU CPU were looking at
around 70 or or less so overall very low
temps again guys they are overclocked to
its maximum obviously you don't need me
to tell you what performance you can
expect from a PC like this
eighty eighty six K at 5.1 gigahertz
with two 1080 T eyes you'll be able to
gain comfortably in 4k resolution
without a problem I think this has been
the coolest PC that I've unboxed on the
channel so far but what do you guys
think let me know what your favorite PC
is that you've seen on tech source by
dropping a comment down below I also
want to thank digital storm for sending
this out for me to unbox if you guys
want to check out the event MX and make
your PC stand out from the rest I'll
drop a link to it down below now even if
this PC is out of your budget digital
storm does have on tree-level builds
starting at $6.99 I always tell people
in the end it's up to you whether you
want to buy or build your own PC if you
do build your own PC you're gonna have a
lot of fun doing it you're gonna gain
knowledge from building a PC and you're
gonna be saving money at the same time
now if you don't want to deal with any
of that and you want a professional to
build your own PC or have them build
something epic like this then you can't
go around going with digital storm just
know that you will be paying a little
more in exchange for peace of mind the
system is stress test for you to make
sure it's running perfectly and should
anything go wrong you will be covered
according to your warranty but anyways
