welcome to Joon's PC builds this time
going to be looking at three different
builds and focus more on the new GPUs
like the AMD are x 480 gtx 1070 and the
1080 so with that said let's begin
so our first build is a $500 budget
gaming pc featuring the new RX 480 for
the cpu i went with the FX 6300 6 core
processor which is excellent for any
game and also pretty good for editing as
well since we're sticking with a budget
of under 500 bucks we're not going to be
picking up a cooler or a more powerful
motherboard capable of handling
overclocking so instead I picked up the
asrock 970 m pro 3 which has all the
features you would expect from my budget
board including an onboard USB 3.0
header for ram i went with two sticks of
4 gigabytes of 1600 megahertz from
crucial we also have one terabyte of
hard drive space from Seagate and an
EVGA 430 watt power supply to juice
everything up
and finally the our X 480 graphics card
which is going to be priced at $1.99
which is set to have enough power for VR
and of course I will be doing my usual
benchmarks when I get my hands on one so
make sure you guys stick around for that
housing all of these parts as the Xeon
xon 310 micro ATX tower that goes for
only 22 bucks after shipping I mean it
definitely doesn't look dope but I went
with it simply because it has a USB 3.0
port in the front of the case and it's
incredibly low price you could even get
the case for $18.00 after a five dollar
bail in rebate so this entire build will
cost you four eighty four and ninety
five cents before tax and shipping and
this is a solid PC for gaming and high
settings over 60 fps for most games as
always please keep in mind the prices
always change so depending on when
you're watching this video this build
may be cheaper or more expensive also go
and leave all the links to these builds
down below if you guys want to check
them out
now let's take a look at a mid-range
build with a single gtx 1070 so for this
we're going with the i-5 6500 and the
gtx 1070 which is said to be 380 bucks
MSRP depending on which brand you go
with but for the sake of pricing I will
stick with the cheapest option we're not
gonna be able to clocking which is why
when to be 6,500
and H 110 motherboard so we didn't need
to spend money on a cooler I also went
with 8 gigabytes of RAM from g.skill
ripjaws 2 terabytes of hard drive space
from Seagate and a 500 watt power supply
from EVGA to power everything up and
finally for the case I went for
something a little nicer the cooler
master and 200 with a front USB 3.0 port
as always the case selection is
completely optional and you guys can
swap that out for something that fits
your needs the total cost of is built is
eight hundred eighteen dollars and forty
nine cents before tax and shipping and
will get you a very solid gaming
experience over 60 FPS on most triple-a
games and high settings it will also
handle editing and rendering very well
and finally let's go a little crazy and
build an ultimate gaming machine with
210 ATS now if I want to build myself a
PC it will look something like this a 59
30 K paired with the Asus x99
a motherboard and a be quite a dark walk
pro 3 to keep the temps low and the PC
very quiet after overclocking I would go
with the Asus Strix GT X 1080 because of
the awesome cooler design and the more
performance it offers compared to the
founders Edition for RAM 16 gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance will do the trick and
for storage I would go with dual 2
terabyte hard drives from Seagate and an
Intel 750 series pcie-based SSD for my
operating system juicing up everything
as the cursor our FX 850 watt power
supply and it's all packed inside the
fractal define s case this entire build
will cost you 28 95 and 16 cents which
is pretty steep but you are building
something that will last you for years
this PC is also great for editing and
gaming in 4k and VR as well so that is
it for this month's bill did you guys
enjoy these videos make sure to leave a
like and let me know what other builds I
should work on from my next month by
leaving a comment down below hey guys so
much for watching and as always I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
