with a look at Apple's long-anticipated
Mac Pro this year is the three thousand
dollar base model and you can customize
it to your liking up to a cost at ten
thousand dollars making this one serious
workstation so the base model comes with
a 3.7 gigahertz quad-core Intel Xeon
processor which can be turbo-boosted up
to 3.9 gigahertz if you choose it also
has 12 gigabytes of ddr3 memory - AMD
FirePro d300 graphics with 2 gigs of
memory each a 256 gigabyte the pci flash
storage which is faster than an SSD and
for the operating system it already
comes pre-installed with OS X so the Mac
Pro weighs that 11 pounds which is
pretty heavy when you're looking at such
a small product but it's nothing
compared to last generation Mac Pro
which came at a whopping 40 pounds the
size is also significantly smaller
coming at nine point nine inches for its
side and six point six inches in its
diameter comparing to the old Mac Pro
which is that twenty point one inches
for its height and 8.1 inches for its
width so definitely there is a huge
improvement there alrighty so enough
about that let's move on to the unboxing
portion so we can take a closer look at
the Mac Pro I really like how Apple
packaged the Mac Pro is very simple to
unpack all you have to do is remove this
tape on the top portion in order to open
up the flaps inside you will find a
standard Apple paperwork first up is the
Quick Start Guide and hips followed by
the warranty information and two black
Apple stickers which is a pretty cool
change from their regular white Apple
stickers and under this white styrofoam
is the Mac Pro we are actually going to
make another video on the Mac Pro
comparing it to a custom built PC that
costs the same as well as deciding
whether or not you can build a better PC
with the same cost lastly on the bottom
is the power cord unfortunately they
didn't provide a keyboard or mouse so
those would have to be purchased
separately the Mac Pro is unlike
anything the PC industry has ever seen
Hardware wise if you would argue that
Apple's design for the new Mac Pro is
not unique some even call it a trashcan
but when you look at the Mac Pro on
desk it is a very different story if you
look at the back side of the macro you
will find all the necessary ports you
will need you have your audio out and
headphone jack four USB ports six
Thunderbolt two slots which could
support the latest 4k displays followed
by two gigabit ethernet ports and one
HDMI 1.4 port there is also a switch on
the top left if you wish to remove the
case like so
I think Apple really took a big leap in
a design department here as the new Mac
Pro is a monument to the desktop
computing it looks like a future age and
it breaks the norm of big heavy chatzi's
that sits under one's desk the reason
they made the case removable is in case
you decided to upgrade any components
like the RAM CP or even GPU as of today
Apple has not released any kits to make
this happen but we can say that the CPU
is the only component that has confirmed
upgradable by the user so those of you
that want to start off with a base model
now and in the future upgrade your CPU
to something faster than you can so
before we end the video we're gonna turn
on the Mac for a quick and show you guys
how quiet it really is we were forced to
bring the microphone really close and
increase the volume a little bit
otherwise you wouldn't hear anything at
all so that wraps up the unboxing and
quick overview of the Mac Pro there will
be a few more videos in the Mac Pro
while we play with it so make sure you
guys stay tuned for that
you'll be comparing this to my custom
made PC which cost about the same and
figure out which one wins so before I go
