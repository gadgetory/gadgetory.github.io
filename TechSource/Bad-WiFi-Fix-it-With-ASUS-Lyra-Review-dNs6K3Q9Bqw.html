source and today we're taking a look at
a smart router so this is the Asus Lyra
and not only is this tri-band router
easy to set up but actually solve my
connectivity problems everywhere in my
house
the Lyra uses a mesh network which is a
bit different than a standard home
router system because it pushes out
multiple data streams to its three
receiver sets this allows for a great
Wi-Fi range across your house extending
out to six thousand square feet this
will be great if you have multiple
floors in your house like me or have a
backyard and would still like to have a
great Wi-Fi connection everywhere on
your property and my testing this router
has worked far better than a traditional
hub-and-spoke setup due to its 5
gigahertz backbone network it also does
the job of a Wi-Fi range extender but
far better since all three receivers are
connected onto the same smart antenna
system this allows the hubs to always
test signal strength against other hubs
and connect to the strongest node this
will ensure a great and stable
connection another great feature about
the Lyra system is how its configured
and controlled all through the mobile
app which we will talk about shortly the
AI protection messaging feature protects
all connected devices by showing
security reports on the screen unlike a
lot of competing routers the lera does
this without the need of a paid
subscription service alright so in the
box you'll receive three Lyra receivers
a power adapter for each one as well as
a high-speed Ethernet cable setting up
the Lyra is actually very quick and
simple just download the app on your
iPhone or Android and from there just
follow the simple instructions to
configure the first lateral receiver and
set up the network name and password
from here the process is very simple
once you have found the place to put the
other two receivers select the plus
button and set up the second Lyra
in my case I set up a receiver on each
of my floors and keep in mind it's best
to minimise obstacles between each
receiver for it to work at its full
potential you can actually set a
destination name for each receiver which
makes managing them super easy from the
app over here you can also monitor
connected devices and real time traffic
reports in the family members tab you
can restrict users on the net
from accessing certain sites or you can
allow guests to access the network very
simply as for a speed test the latter
are consistently I performed my previous
router and I picked up a strong Wi-Fi
signal everywhere in my house for my
time of use with the library I'm
actually pretty impressed with it I do
recommend it for anyone that's
struggling with Wi-Fi dead spots in
their house or if you just want a router
that's easy to set up and manage I do
want to give a huge thanks to Asus for
sending out the Alera and sponsoring
this video as always I drop a link to it
down below in case you guys want to
check it out if you enjoy the video feel
free to toss a like to show your support
and if you guys didn't like it feel fit
of this like as well that's completely
fine - thank you so much for watching
and I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
