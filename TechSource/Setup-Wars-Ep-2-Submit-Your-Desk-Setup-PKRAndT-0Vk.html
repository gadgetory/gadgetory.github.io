and I count the number of votes and

series and want to submit your desk
setup then you need to watch the video
linked below with instructions and
requirements but with that said shoot
all righty so the five lucky contestants
for this week are Bratton Lee janya
Manuel Pascal and culture 97
congratulations for making it to this
week of set-up wars thank you for
submitting your desk setup so basically
how this works is I'm gonna be going
through the desk setups and I'll be
giving my opinions on it some
recommendations things I like things I
don't like but my vote doesn't count
you guys get to vote on the best desk
setup so that said let's go ahead and
start off by looking at Brandy's setup
so looks like you have two 19 inch
monitors and an enormous TV which looks
like it's hooked up to your xbox 360
down below there's also huge speaker
right next to your monitor at least I
think it's a speaker but I wish that was
more light in the video so I can see
everything clearly but from what I can
tell it looks like you have everything
spaced out really well you have the PC
gaming stuff on the left side of the
desk and the console gaming to the right
also great job with the LED strips that
definitely matches the wallpaper and the
overall theme of your setup I can't
quite see the stuff you have under the
TV it looks like a bunch of headphones
and accessories but let's take a closer
look under your desk okay so not bad it
looks like you mounted the power strips
on the roof of the table which is a
great idea and definitely cleans up the
floor so great job there so a few things
I would recommend and again this is just
my opinion so don't get offended but the
speaker on the table really throws
everything off I would put that on the
floor in fact if you can move that
nightstand to the right and put the
speaker right there next to the TV it
would look a lot better because the
huge-ass speaker is the first thing I
see when I look at your setup and it
just stands out also you don't need that
many Apple stickers on your PC case you
don't want to cover up the beauty of the
gaming PC but that's just me being picky
so yeah thanks about Lee for submitting
your desk setup let's go ahead and move
on to Johnny O's setup alright so let
there be light I can see everything
thank you for a very clear video Jenna
so first thing I noticed is the H 440
Razer Edition PC Tower which seems to be
a very popular choice and as a parent
that
you are part of teamraiser with your
Naga Mouse and back with a keyboard I'm
not sure why you have two different pcs
on your desk I'm guessing one is for
gaming and guilders for productivity
reasons but the fact that monitors are
different sizes really bothers me not to
mention the extra keyboard and mouse on
your desk so the things I like the
greenlab that you use as a headphone
hanger the green ps4 controller stand
and the extended razer mousepad you'll
match your theme really well so I give
you a point there I also notice the six
dolls you have under your monitor you
actually have the same amount on each
side so thank you for being somewhat
symmetrical by the way I will leave
links to all the products I mentioned in
the video down below in the description
for those of you guys that are
interested alright so let's take a look
at the cable management all right sweet
there are no cables inside so really
great job there and wow is that a
dxracer chair you got there I wish you
would have gone that in frame but I do
give you a point for the matching theme
well done that's actually really
fantastic chair it looks like you also
included a picture of your PC
okay Wow it looks like someone watched
my big red video more than a few times
huge props on your painting skills well
done I mean you painted s as these sides
the RAM sticks and the GPU just like I
did for big red it's awesome to see that
I inspired someone else to do the same
for that PC at least I hope I inspired
you but honestly those two Noctua fans
on top really stand out since they
aren't painted but overall really clean
and beautiful PC man well done you know
what will make your setup look even
better though a glossy or matte black
table yet I'll definitely complete your
setup instead of the wooden brown table
you got going on but overall great that
setup janya thank you so much for
submitting all right so let's move on to
Manuel so looks like we have a wide
wooden desk with a single monitor set up
and look more razor products you have a
black widow keyboard and abyss mouse and
the Kraken pro headphones I'm not sure
why you didn't go with the green version
to better match your LEDs and
accessories but overall really great
gaming gear I can't quite see the brand
on the monitor but it looks like the
BenQ 27-inch gaming monitor that has in
1 millisecond response time and a 70
Hertz refresh rate so really great
choice for a gaming monitor if that is
in fact the model that you have but a
few things I would like to mention the
monitor isn't at the center of the desk
my OCD is kicking in once again you can
either bring the right speaker closer to
the monitor so that the distance between
the speakers are the same or move the
monitor slightly closer to the right
side I'm also not sure why you have your
mouse pad aim vertically I mean you have
a pretty wide monitor so it should be
facing horizontally also the LED strips
you have in the back are visible I mean
the point of that is to give you set up
a glow factor kind of like how mine is
so I would definitely use some 3m tape
and stick those to the back of your desk
so that the actual strip is not visible
but other than those minor setups I'm
really digging your setup so Thank You
Manuel for entering setup wars next up
we have pistol and it looks like you
have a black and red theme going on with
another h4 40 case my
God if I see that one of these cases I'm
definitely deleting my channel now I'm
just kidding I love this case great
choice on the color combination as well
kind of reminds me of a familiar setup I
see that you have you ever so popular
asus VX 24 inch monitor as well which
also seems to be common in these set of
videos but hey it's an awesome monitor
for gaming so it's not a surprise it
also looks like you have a second
monitor hooked up as well if you get rid
of that monitor I promise your setup
will look a thousand times better I also
like that you have a coke bottle with
your name on there that's actually a
pretty good idea I think I might get one
from my desk set up but yeah I mean I'm
really loving the keyboard and mouse as
well the designs look really sick and it
matches your theme and if I can find out
what mouse and keyboard that is I will
leave links to that in the description
section for those of you guys that are
interested I also noticed that you added
LEDs inside your case and I think that
definitely adds a level of spice to your
wig so props on that so let's take a
look under your desk so okay very clean
for the most part it looks like most of
the cables are up top behind the desk so
overall very clean underneath I don't
know why you need two trash cans but I
guess it doesn't hurt to have a spare
but yeah Pascal get what if that nasty
monitor on the left and you will earn my
vote but overall really awesome setup
thank you for submitting to setup wars
alrighty then last but certainly not the
least we have torture 97 let's see what
you got going on okay we have another
dual monitors set up so not only are the
monitors different sizes but they are
also different resolutions I mean it
might only one with this problem
honestly am I really that weird for
preferring the same size monitors I mean
I'm sure there's somebody out there that
has the same feeling as I do
expert I know you do man I could be
mistaken but I think the monitor on the
right is the Asus 4k monitor it also
looks like you have a microphone hooked
up to an audio interface and you are
rocking a Logitech G 19 keyboard with a
SteelSeries sensei Gaming Mouse so solid
choices for gaming gear I love the fact
that you mounted the speaker's on the
wall which gave you more space on the
dead
and plus one on the GTA mug one thing I
would suggest is to remove the LEDs from
the top shelf because it's visible it
will look a lot better if there is a
glow in the back of the monitor instead
of the lights if you want to keep it
that high at least get some 3m tape and
connect it to the back of your monitor
trust me that will look a lot better
let's check under the desk and it looks
like there's a panel covering the cables
I mean hey as long as they're not
visible this works just fine I would I'd
like to see what was in your PC but by
the looks of it guy liquid cooling bill
going on and that obsidian case of yours
but really nice and clean setup so good
job picture and thank you for entering
setup wars alright so that's it for this
