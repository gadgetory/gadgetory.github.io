and welcome to set up boards episode 52
where you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel so if you want
to participate make sure to watch the
video linked below bye ladies and
gentlemen without wasting any more time
let the setup for is begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always everyone's gear for their setups
will be links down below if anyone is
interested but here are your 5 lucky
contestants for this week we have Dustin
Sam Nick Kalin and Justin
congratulations for making it on the
show starting off the show we have
Dustin and his single monitors set up a
34 inch asus rog swift ultrawide monitor
hooked up to the freedom arm on the
massive desk we have the corsair k70 RGB
keyboard and a logitech g502 mouse on
top of the enormous neonics mousepad I
like how you kept the black theme
consistent across the entire setup we
got black audio engine a 5 plus speakers
black headphone stand and even a black
LED lamp job well done
cable management is excellent great use
of the cable clips routing the wires on
the roof of the desk and I even noticed
that you use a cable channel for your
wall shelves as well as in cable box for
your power strip so what's been watching
my videos for a while it doesn't even
stop there we have a cable tube for his
PC wires I have never been more proud
the PC that's powering the setup has the
6700 K overclock 24.7 and a ZOTAC
extreme amp gtx 980ti the rest of your
room is extremely OCD friendly I mean
everything is organized and very clean
what can I say a pretty solid setup to
start the show
Thank You Dustin for entering Sam I am
is next up with a try display setup now
at first I thought this was a Mac setup
from the misleading wallpaper but it's
actually a Windows PC so we have two
24-inch LG monitors and a 32 inch LG
Smart TV you right above on the desk rip
the coolermaster octane keyboard and
mouse bundle on top of the all key mouse
pad we also have a pair of je-vc
bookshelf speakers and a blue snowball
mic right there in the center I love the
symmetry but I can't say the same about
the choice of color on those speakers it
looks like Sam went with the IKEA linen
desk with some Alex drawers underneath
we do have a headphone hangar for
50 X's and a headphone amp that's
mounted against the roof cable
management looks very clean from this
angle but looking in the corner we can
see the true disaster a cable box will
definitely help keep the power strip and
brick hidden neatly away and even using
simple things like velcro straps to
tighten cables together will really
clean up the mess back there the PC
that's powering the setup has an FX 6350
that's overclocked to 4.1 and a GTX 960
besides the cable management this is a
very clean setup thank you Sam for
entering coming in at number 3 is Nick
with a very modest black and red setup
we have two 27-inch BenQ monitors the
right one being a regular display and
the one on the left being a gaming
monitor with a 1 millisecond response
time and a 70 Hertz refresh rate on the
desk rip the Corsair a RGB keyboard
saber RGB mouse on top of the course our
extended mousepad we also have the
famous cloud 2 gaming headset on the
lign headset stand and a dxracer chair
to complete setup CCG is using on the
other hand desperately needs a GPU
upgrade but it's currently rocking a 44
60 and a GTX 650 cable management isn't
really the best I mean this can
definitely be fixed by using some velcro
straps and these super thick cable
sleeves since you do have a bunch of
cables down there these are actually
better than the omnimount sleeves that I
keep recommending since it comes with a
zipper function making the job a lot
easier
you could also watch my cable laser
video if you need any tips other than
that it's a pretty sweet setup Thank You
Nick for entering now this is something
I haven't seen before on the show we
have Kalyn with dual ultra wires that
are hooked up to a monitor arm not sure
how I feel about this but it definitely
looks cool desk itself is the IKEA
linman which is actually modded to fit
his height on the desk we have a courser
keyboard and a vengence mouse on top of
the white extended mousepad and a pair
of Logitech z3 20 speakers near the back
cable management looks pretty good from
what I can see it looks like we also
have an Xbox one on the bottom and a
corsair void headset hanging from the
desk the pc on the other hand doesn't
really look at r active I mean there's a
random SSD
trying to escape have a cluster of wires
that's all over the place not much else
you can deal with the headset wire but
if you want to clean up the overall look
I would consider hanging the headset off
to the side of your desk so that way
your cables aren't visible when you do
decide to hang it a very interesting
setup no doubt Thank You Kaelyn for
entering last but not least we have
Justin with another interesting setup so
we have a giant 42 inch wasabi 4k
monitor sandwiched by 2 M audio studio
monitors which are resting on the IKEA
lack shelves it doesn't seem like a
symmetrical but it still looks awesome
on the desk we have the poker tree
mechanical keyboard and logitech g502
mouse on top of the artisan mousepad we
also have a vegeta figurine and his
super saiyan god mode keeping watch from
up there and a nice set of lenses below
the speakers now the pc here is a
completely different story this year is
a custom modded water-cooled build is
running a 5820k that's overclocked to
4.2 and it's paired with a single gtx
980ti
custom s lights panel power coated case
and brackets and finally a custom aqua
computers circuit wired to allow control
for all lights fans and pumps through
windows this is the mother of all mods
that is insane I'm fairly certain the
cable management is on point and yep it
sure is after all why wouldn't it be if
you can do that to a PC there are
however a few extra things on the desk
that kind of make a look cluttered
simply adding a stand for your
smartphone and tablet with really clean
it up and even minor things like
attaching an SD card reader on the roof
of that shelf will contribute to a much
cleaner desk
despite the alignment of those speaker
shelves I say that this is one badass
set up Thank You Justin for entering but
that will do for this episode of setup
wars as always drop your comments down
below and vote on who you think has the
best best setup and allows the winners
on my Twitter and Instagram on Sunday
basically the thing guys so much for
watching as always if you enjoy setup
boards make sure to leave a like
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
