description for more info what's up guys
it's ID from Texas and welcome to
another camera comparison test in this
video we'll be comparing the cameras on
the LG g4 and the iPhone 6 plus
in my last video against the s6 I
declared the g4 the winner and currently
has the best camera you can find on a
smartphone but how will it do against
the iPhone 6 plus let's find out so
before I jump into the samples let's
take a quick look at the camera specs
the LG g4 has a 16 megapixel rear facing
camera with an aperture of 1.8 that can
shoot up to 4k resolution the iPhone 6
plus has an 8 megapixel camera with an
aperture 2.2 that can only shoot up to
1080p 4 front-facing cameras the g4 has
an 8 megapixel camera capable of
shooting up to 1080p and the 6 plus has
a 1.2 megapixel camera that can shoot
only in 720p so that's it for the specs
let's sit back relax and take a look at
some samples
you
autofocusing is really accurate on the
g4 I don't have any complaints at all
it's not as fast as the s6 or even the
iPhone 6 but because accuracy is
important it deserves a point the iPhone
6 has arguably the fastest autofocus I
have seen on a smartphone camera right
next to the galaxy s6 no real negatives
on either phone so I will give the six
plus a point as well for focusing for
daylight video the iPhone 6 has cooler
colors whereas the g4 is more on the
warmer side the iPhone is also kept at
1080p whereas a Jeep or can shoot in 4k
which means you get sharper footage and
a wider field of view so the point goes
to the g4 for low-light video the iPhone
6 does a pretty good job holding up but
the 1.8 aperture on the g4 is hard to
beat the light sources are easily picked
up by the g4 whereas the overall footage
in the iPhone is noticeably darker so
the g4 slightly pulls ahead and steals
the point for the stabilization test
both videos were shot in 1080p so that
optical image stabilization remains
enabled and both phones were strapped on
a single device to ensure a very
accurate stabilization reading and based
on the footage the iPhone 6 plus appears
to be a lot smoother since I'm using a 6
plus it does come with optical image
stabilization whereas the iPhone 6 does
not but the point goes to the iPhone 6
plus for a more stable video what's up
guys welcome to the front-facing video
camera test and the microphone quality
test between the LG g4 and the iPhone 6
plus the g4 is being shot in 1080p and
the iPhone 6 plus is being shot in 720p
also if you are listening to this on
your headphones and you can hear the
background noise so I'm gonna be quiet
for a bit
so if I were to give a point four pixels
the g4 would easily take it since its
shot in a higher resolution however the
iPhone 6 plus has way better than imma
Grange you can actually see the clouds
in the sky whereas it's overexposed on
the g4 so i'ma reward the iPhone with a
point or front-facing video for audio
surprisingly the iPhone 6 plus has a
louder microphone however the g4 has a
more crispier audio so imma give them
both a point for the microphone test now
for the front-facing camera the g4 has a
sharper pic simply because of a higher
megapixel count it also has a slightly
higher saturation than the iPhone but
it's not really excessive so imma give
the point to the g4 for selfies moving
to daytime pics the g4 not only has
sharper and warmer colors but they are
also more truer to life
despite it having more saturation than
the iPhone 6 the red flowers appear to
be actually red in this picture instead
of having a pinkish tint to it dynamic
range is also great on both phones there
will be occasions where the g4 may
overexposed certain areas to give you a
brighter image but in the end the g4
takes the point for overall better
daylight pictures last but not least
let's take a look at low-light picture
performance everything just seems to be
more brighter on the g4 there's a huge
difference as you can see here there's
also a lot less blur and noise from the
g4 compared to the iPhone and you can
see more details so the obvious point
for low-light pictures goes to the g4
now when it comes to flash it's harder
to decide both of the phones have great
flashes it basically does what it's
supposed to but to me a flash is
supposed to work on all objects no
matter the location or object the g4 has
a more powerful flash which tends to
wash out colors if the color white is
involved since it's highly reflective
the iPhone 6 plus is one of the few
bones I noticed that has an overall
consistent picture quality while using
flash and because of that I will reward
the iPhone with a point instead of a g4
so based on my video the LG g4 is the
clear winner but a lot of you guys might
not agree with that you might say that
the iPhone 6 was outdated so it wasn't
really a fair test but if that's the
case then you guys gonna have to wait
for the 6s to be released so I can redo
the test but anyways that is it for the
video
I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did
please hit that like button and if you
didn't you can dislike and let me know
what you guys think about the camera
test results do you agree with my
verdict or do you disagree let me know
by dropping a comment down below if you
guys enjoy these types of camera
comparisons and make sure you subscribe
to the channel because I do these types
of videos for every smartphone that gets
released anyways thanks again for
watching this is that from tech source I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
