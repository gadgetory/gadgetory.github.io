welcome to setup wars episode 56 will
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on a channel and if you guys
want to participate make sure to watch
the video linked below little outside
and done but the setup wars begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always you guys can find the links to
their gears for their setups down below
if anyone is interested but here are
your five contestants for this week we
have NN antonio Chaska Colin and Devin
let's go ahead and start the show so
starting off the show is my good friend
Annan and is very clean and organized
white and black setup and apologies if I
butchered your name we have two LG 24
inch monitors mounted on a CNC T arm
which is hooked up to a modded dining
table of his and then sandwiching the
monitors are a pair of Clips Pro media
2.1 speakers and on the desk we have the
courser k7 10 plus keyboard and Logitech
G 402 Mouse on the legendary gamers
extended mouse pad a few other things on
the desk include his ps4 and a nice
lineup of headphones which include the
ATH M 30 X and 50 X and Logitech G 430
for gaming cable management is superb
and I like how even the subwoofer has a
stand the PC powering the setup has a
2500 K and a GTX 970 but you know what
the shelf on the top isn't exactly
aligned perfectly with your setup I
think it's off to the left side a bit
and it's kind of bothering me but I do
like how you kept everything else
symmetrical and a huge plus on that boom
arm holding up the blue Yeti mic overall
a very clean and organized setup Thank
You NF for entering Antonio Banderas is
next up with another white and black
theme but this time we have a semi glass
desk between the audio engine speakers
we have the 34 inch curved monitor from
Dell that's mounted on the freedom arm
and below that we have the Logitech k-8
hundred people and G 602 mouse on top of
the glorious extended mousepad
I'm definitely digging the desk design
it has a glass top with a pullout drawer
that also has a bunch of storage
compartments which is really awesome
there's even space for cable management
on the roof of the desk and it kind of
caves in a bit making it really easy to
keep the power strips and cables hidden
from view
slap on a Nike ride-on unit and you have
yourself a monitor riser with extra
storage space the PC that's powering
this setup is actually hidden away
inside the ste
we stand after the right side and it's
rocking eight 3770k and a gtx970 super
o'clock the cables are then routed near
the bottom into the cable box which is
also housing the power strip for the
entire setup
well done Antonio beautiful setup and
thank you for entering changing things
up is Cheska's black white and red set
up with 2 24 inches monitors which are
hooked up to the rows will arms and on
the desk we have the CM storm devastated
keyboard and mouse bundle which is
resting on the white glorious extended
mousepad cable management is pretty good
I can see that most of the cables are
routed near the top and against the wall
the PCs running the setup has an FX
83-70 which is overclocked to 4.8 and a
GTX 980 Extreme Edition which is sitting
inside the custom painted and the Xth
440 case I also like what you did with
your PNY power banks by creating a power
bank stand using connects pieces very
clever I'm not so sure how effective it
is mounting the blue snowball mic on the
monitor arms since it's pretty far from
your mouth instead I would strongly
recommend an inexpensive boom arm which
you can mount on the arms and I will
give you the option to bring it closer
to you while keeping it off the table at
the same time also a headphone hangar
that you can attach to the back of your
monitors would be a far cleaner approach
to keeping the Razer black shark
headphones away from sight and closer to
your reach with some minor tweaks this
can definitely be a better setup Thank
You Chaska for entering Colin Farrell is
next up with a clean set up indeed we
have two 34 inch LG monitors which are
mounted against the wall and they are
sandwiched by two sony chp 7 speakers
which are being held up by custom-made
wooden stands below that we have the
courser strafe RGB keyboard and MX
master mouse but check this out guys you
have a custom-made phone stand with a
Samsung wireless charging pad that's
built-in we also have a boom arm to the
left side holding up the audio-technica
ATR 2100 mic and a 2009 MacBook Pro
which is hooked up on the roof of the
desk by a custom-made contraption
speaking of custom-made stuff we have a
custom-made PC stand pokeball stand and
even headphone stand for the MTX Street
audios ladies and gentlemen the sixth
ever set up Wars steel
ruble goes to Colin with his very
creative and very impressive setup
congratulations Colin for winning $100 a
custom-made plaque which is hand signed
by me and also a text source t-shirt of
your choosing so if you're watching this
video make sure a mail set up words to
claim your prize so Louise in Colin got
the sixth set up Wars seal of approval
was simple symmetry cable management
creativity presentation and most
importantly this is a very unique setup
hopefully the hundred dollars will go
towards a better PC because this simply
won't cut it
especially with a beautiful setup like
this Thank You Colin for entering last
but not least we have Devon with our
first triple monitor setup for the
episode three ACS 24 inch monitors
courser strafe RGB keyboard with the
eraser or Weaver and Mad Catz rat MMO
seven Mouse and that's pretty much it
that's on the desk the PC that's pushing
all these pixels has a 6600 K and a
single GTX 980 inside the NZXT phantom
case under the custom-made desk we have
a pair of em 50 X's and the Corsair
Vengeance 1500 gaming headset cable
manager on the other hand can definitely
be improved
I mean routing the purple wire across
the top of the desk along with the white
cable with definitely cleanup cable
management using some cable clips will
definitely help you out but if you need
some more tips on cable management feel
free to watch my cable management video
on the channel but that's pretty much it
for this minimalistic black and white
setup
