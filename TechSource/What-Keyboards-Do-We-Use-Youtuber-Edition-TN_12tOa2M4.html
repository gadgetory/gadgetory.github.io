Twitter and asked if anyone is
interested in participating in my next
collab and I got over 100 emails within
that day so I went ahead and picked the
first 10 in stead well actually the
first 11 since I don't know how to count
very much like my previous collab
featuring Marquez and Austin and a bunch
of really cool tech youtubers this time
I'm gonna be focusing on keyboards
instead there will be many more collabs
like this so if you guys want to
participate in my next one and have a
youtube channel make sure you're
following me on twitter and be on the
lookout for my next tweet regarding
giveaways brad also you guys can find
the links to everyone's channel that's
featured in this video linked below so
make sure you check them out and
subscribe if you enjoy their content all
the ways to get more time
let's begin what's up guys my name is
Kevin and the keyboard that I use on a
daily basis is the logitech k400 it's
not for everyone but if you have a TV
bass set up or just like to keep things
minimalistic you really can't go wrong
with this what sets this apart from
others is the touchpad and with that we
have the exclusion of a number pad but I
think it's really well worth the
trade-off it connects via a small dongle
which allows this keyboard to work on
almost any device best of all you can
find this thing on Amazon for only
around $30 which is a steal hey guys
jacking your fee nothing my tag and the
keyboard I'm currently using on the
daily is a Das Keyboard X 40 the X 40 is
a mechanical keyboard from the das
ultimates gaming series line up the
version I appear offers tactile and
audible switches which is a must in any
type of gaming keyboard for me I also
really dig its customizable place and
the red backlighting it is a great
addition to my setup and a must pick up
for anyone with a red and black theme
lastly for me I hope you got you guys in
my next video thank you guys all for
watching what's up guys my name is join
Brite and my keyboard of choice is the
CM storm quickfire rapid keyboard when I
was first looking for a keyboard that
fits my super minimalistic vibe this one
definitely jumped out at me it looks
super clean and doesn't have any
unnecessary gimmicks which get in the
way and make the keyboard look big and
clunky also the keyboard is not Wireless
but I did add a hole in the desk
for the cable to route through which
makes your setup look way cooler the
keyboard is mechanical and feels amazing
when typing on mine I'm rocking the
Cherry MX blue switches over all this
keyboard feels amazing looks super clean
and if you're willing to deal with a few
small things like not having LEDs then
this is perfect for you thanks to Ed for
having me on and I hope to see all of
you guys on my channel very soon this is
a habbit HP KB 380 L keyboard it is a
mechanical style keyboard as you can see
and as these awesome LED backlit keys
and a super tough metal build I'm
obsessed with using this keyboard
because how insanely responsive it is
typing on it is super comfortable super
smooth and it's going to react quickly
to every single keystroke what's really
cool about it and what I really like is
that you can easily transition this from
a regular daily typing keyboard to a
gaming keyboard you're playing some
games on it and it's really impressive
they definitely recommend you guys check
this out hey what's up guys Dan here
back at it again with another video the
courser k4 TS been my keyboard of choice
for about the past year and a half now
and I've gotten to know it pretty well
the keys on this RGB keyboard are rubber
dome and feel very similar to MX brown
switches the slightly less clicky
it features anti-ghosting though you do
need to bottom out the keys for a
keystroke to register the keyboard isn't
too loud though would say it's a little
bit louder than average at around 70
bucks you can't really go wrong with the
k4 though there are a plethora of other
options that are much better for only 10
or 15 dollars more so if you can save a
few extra pennies I would definitely
recommend going with them hey guys my
name is anthon and to script my own tech
videos I use the Logitech G 810 the G a
10 is a gaming keyboard at heart but it
can transform into a professional and
businesslike keyboard so it uses romaji
switches which are pretty good for
gaming they kind of feel like Cherry MX
browns with a ring inside and a faster
actuation the J 10 also has RGB lighting
which definitely puts on a hell of a
show aside from fancy switches or
lighting it does do the simple things
right like nice multimedia buttons a big
scroll wheel and program will
keys but it does come at a steep 160
dollar price tag so you have to see if
it's worth it for your cause hey what's
up guys Joker here and this is my code
keyboard with cherry MX clear switches I
use this keyboard as my daily driver
because of its simple design and the
great build quality the clear switches
are also extremely satisfying to type
and game on and if you're familiar with
brown switches they have the same design
using the tactile bump but are a little
stiffer requiring 65 grams of actuation
force lastly the custom key caps and
signatures from fellow tech youtubers
that I got at LAN Syndicate really do
make this a one-of-a-kind keyboard hey
guys I'm a Somerville and my keyboard of
choice is the perixx px 3200 gaming
keyboard what I really like about this
keyboard is the twelve programmable keys
on each side as well as the lengthy palm
wrist and this keyboard is an
essentially an all plastic build but
it's very sturdy and certified rage
proof the keyboard has LED backlit keys
as well as a couple special keys
including a Windows lock button now I'm
not that big of a gamer but with a
sturdy build solid typing experience and
even a headphone jack this keyboard
suits my needs perfectly thanks again to
Ed for having me on this collab and I'll
catch you guys later what's up guys at
sudonym tech devoted in the kyboot i use
is the Devastator mb 24 this keyboard
actually comes as a part of the cooler
master storm devastated gaming keyboard
and mouse combo but since we're only
talking about key booster day let's put
the mouse aside I honestly cannot
justify spending hundreds of dollars on
a keyboard so the main reason why I got
this one is because of the value it
offers for money it comes in a $30 US
and it looks great as you may have
already noticed it's got blue LED lights
and it looks really badass the buttons
attack Thailand don't make a lot of
noise I'm not going to bore you with the
specifications of this keyboard because
honestly I don't know what a lot of it
even means but what I can tell you is
this is one amazing keyboard for the
price not to mention it also comes with
that mouse last but not least a big
thanks to Ed for having me on the show
and I hope you have enjoyed hello
everyone my name is anna-marie postbox
and i actually rock two different
keyboards so i rocked the wasd or wast
code keyboard it's an 87 q keyboard with
no number pad
on the right-hand side and it has Cherry
MX blue switches with LED backlighting
on the keys themselves my other keyboard
is the generation CP 48 48 key macro
keypad that I have fully decked out and
fully customized for Adobe Audition
Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects
in Adobe Photoshop keyboard macros and
shortcuts to do everything get basically
one button press so I've transitions
audio processing various effects and
things like that all set up so that's
all I have to do is hit one button and
apply a lot of effects which speeds up
my editing efficiency greatly you can
check out that video up on my channel
eight sex toys fans my name is Justin
and my favorite keyboard is the Apple
wireless keyboard it's not what might be
considered a gaming keyboard but it's
what works best for me what I love about
it is the design and tight integration
with OS 10 the chiclet keys provide just
the right amount of feedback for a
satisfactory typing experience not only
that but the addition of media controls
is something I cannot live without as
I'm constantly listening to music while
working the keyboard definitely
complements my setup and the battery
life is also stellar I can go for months
of use before needing to replace the two
double-a batteries thank you so much ed
for having me on this episode so that's
it for the video a huge thanks to
everyone who participated I also make
