Samsung has just released three
wearables and we will be taking a look
at each one individually so make sure
you guys stick around for those videos
that are coming up soon so we have the
Samsung gear fit which is the smallest
of the three the gear 2 neo which is the
more affordable version of the gear 2
and last but not least the gear 2 which
is a smartphone that we are going to
take a look at today now I don't know
about you guys but you won't catch me
dead with any wearable tech I'm more
into the luxury watches with a stainless
steel belt so I'm actually kind of
excited to check these out and I don't
know maybe it will convince me to switch
so the only two differences between the
gear 2 neo and the gear 2 is the build
quality and lack of a camera so if you
are thinking of purchasing an Android
wearable and don't care for a premium
build or a camera feature then you can
save a hundred bucks by going with the
gear 2 neo instead so after removing the
top we can see the gear 2 sitting right
here in the middle and I'm going to go
ahead and put this aside well quickly so
we can check out the rest of the
contents opening up the flap we are
greeted with more accessories and that
this is the charging dock that hooks up
to the watch so you can charge the
device speaking of charging the device
this is the charging cable that you will
need to use to get it done as always
there is a set-up guide along with some
warranty information which no one really
cares about so let's go around the
device real quick starting with the home
button like smartphones the home button
takes you back to the home screen and it
could also do other cool stuff which I
will go over soon the camera on the
other hand is located on the side of the
watch and it has a 2 megapixel sensor
with autofocus capabilities also right
next to the camera there is an IR
blaster which is used to control your TV
on the left side of the watch that is if
you're looking at it directly you will
find the speakers and an indication
where the charging dock would be
connected to and on the other side is
where the microphone is located for
phone calls and voice memos the belt
itself is made out of rubber but pretty
much everything else is metal including
the face of the watch and the belt is
user replaceable so if we don't like the
rubber material then you can swap it out
with a metal one
you choose so if you flip the watch over
you will see the charging pins along
with the heart rate sensor and I'm going
to show you how to connect the charger
will quick all you have to do is line up
the charging pins with that of the
charger and just snap it in place it's
actually that easy they say that you can
use the gear 2 for about two to three
days for regular usage and it can last
up to six days for low usage so the gear
2 has a one-point 63 inch Super AMOLED
screen with four gigabytes of onboard
memory which is a lot of space to store
your music in the software itself is
pretty smooth for the most part you
basically swipe to the left or right to
navigate and you can configure the home
button to perform a special command like
opening up the camera and other things
by enabling the double tap option the
gear 2 can do a lot of neat things it
can track your footstep count as well as
your heartrate it can also take pictures
and automatically send them to your
phone not only can it make calls but it
can also track notifications and display
them for you right there
on the watch and you can also respond
back which is pretty cool now the gear 2
is only supposed to be compatible with
17 Samsung devices however we have
figured out a way together to work on
most Android phones here we are using my
HTC One m8 Google Play edition and I'm
changing the watch's wallpaper through
my smart phone the camera on the gear 2
can also send the pictures that take
straight to your phone so needless to
say definitely is compatible with phones
other than Samsung is you guys want to
see more detailed video on how to make
the gear 2 compatible with your Android
device then leave a comment down below
and if we get enough requests we will
post up a video so what do I think about
the gear 2 I think that's a waste of
money
I definitely don't agree that it's worth
the $300 and here's my honest opinion I
strongly believe that we are at a point
where we have practically come up with
everything imaginable and that people
are running out of ideas I can't think
of one solid reason why I would need a
wearable tech specifically the gear to
taking pictures why would I need to take
pictures on a crappy 2 megapixel camera
when I can use my smartphone to do this
with better results why would I need a
device to listen to music my smartphone
already does that tracking my footsteps
and my heart rate I mean really Samsung
how many people actually use that like
really use that feature
on their phones or watches I can go on
and on but I'm just going to stop right
here for the sake of the video but my
final verdict is it's an overpriced
metal watch if the price was only 100
bucks maybe maybe I was considered
wearing it but if anything the neo would
be a better option for me but 200
dollars is still a steep price for
something like that I mean if you love
wearable tech then this might be
something for you if you are new to
herbal tech I'd advise you to stay away
for now or at least wait for the Moto
360 to be released if you agree with me
then leave a like if you disagree then
leave a dislike and comment down below
stating your reasons I'm actually
interested to hear them anyways that is
it for the unboxing and my honest
opinion on the gear 2 SmartWatch we
still have a few other wearable tech to
cover so if you guys are interested and
want to see more coverage on those then
definitely stick around this is that
from tech source and I will see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
