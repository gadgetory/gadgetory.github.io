and I finally back home here in
California because earlier this week I
was in Taiwan for copy Tech's which is
like the second most largest IT
tradeshow in the world there were a
bunch of new products announced a bunch
of awesome model gaming PC's and also a
new lineup of the gtx 1070 and 1080
cards from all the board partners if
you're into pcs or even gaming copy text
is definitely the place to be
in fact I enjoyed Computex a lot more
than CES now although I didn't do full
coverage on the event I did manage to
scoop up some of the highlights so here
are my top three picks for this year the
first and probably the biggest
announcement from copy Tech's was AMD's
a new graphics card the RX 480 which is
going to be retailing for $1.99 and it's
aimed at making VR more affordable it's
expected to launch on June 29th with 4
and 8 gigabyte variants I for one can't
wait to get my hands on one for
comparison reasons and benchmarking of
course asus has also launched 3 zenfone
models this year the zenfone 3 5.5 inch
standard model 5.7 inch deluxe model and
a 6 point 8 inch ultra model which is
aimed at media consumption starting from
199 the zenfone 3 is aimed to beat out
the competition with some of the best
specs available the zenfone 3 deluxe is
most likely going to be the most popular
because it's also the most powerful
$2,500 you get a snapdragon 820
processor with an Adreno 530 GPU and up
to 6 gigs of ram you also get a 5.7 inch
Super AMOLED 1080p screen with 3000
milliamp hour battery and built-in micro
SD card expansion the release date is
aimed for the end of second quarter
which is June but I think we will see
them on the shelves within the next few
months and finally I stopped by the n1
booth to see what these guys are up to
and as always they never disappoint not
only do they have a lineup of some of
the craziest modded PCs I've ever seen
but they also introduced a few new
products first up is the N Winx Frame
2.0 which is a test bench style case
that can be positioned vertically or
horizontally which can also be rotated
360 degrees it could also support up to
three sixty millimeter radiators or
three 120 millimeter fans which is
really nice this
on a test bench but what's so impressive
about this full tower case is that you
can either use this as a test bench or
an actual PC case since it looks badass
in wind also introduced the H frame 2.0
which is another full tower case which
has been redesigned from their last
model it supports two tempered glass
side panels with two LED strips that run
down the front of the case that can be
adjusted into six different colors and
brightness modes in one cases have
always impressed me and I'm pretty
confident that big red 2.0 will be built
in one of these their third and final
case introduced at Computex is the D
frame 2.0 which is basically just a
bigger version of their different cases
with minor changes a few other things
then when introduced with the world's
first remote controlled RGB cooling fans
which can also be daisy-chained with
other fans another interesting thing
here is the fact that these fans connect
via an 8 pin PG connector which means as
you don't need to waste a SATA or molex
connector just for a fan and lastly a
new lineup of power supplies which
really impressed me when you think about
power supplies you don't associate the
word beauty or aesthetics they just look
like blocks of power well and when is
about to change that with a sexy-ass
power supplies not only are these fully
modular but they also have a glass side
panel which shows all of the components
inside and it also has built-in LEDs
which you can turn off by using a single
switch on top of all that it has a USB
port in the back so if you want to
charge your smartphone or any device you
can now do that even while the PC is off
and when definitely hasn't stopped
innovating and they seem to have always
something fascinating to show off at
their booths there are also some pretty
sick model pcs that I saw so I'm gonna
end it over here and let you guys enjoy
the footage I picked up on these pcs if
you enjoyed the video be sure that I
like button and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
