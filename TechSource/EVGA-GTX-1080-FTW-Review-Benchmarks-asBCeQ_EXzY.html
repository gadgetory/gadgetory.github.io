and I finally got my hands on the new
EVGA GTX 1080 for the win graphics card
it features EVGA s new HDX 3.0 cooling
system a custom PCB with a dual BIOS
switch and RGB LEDs as well as a factory
overclock it's also going to cost you
twenty dollars less than the founders
edition coming in at six hundred eighty
dollars the GTX 1084 to win is actually
e BGA's current top and model with the
classified and few other models still to
come it also currently has the highest
clock speeds and EVGA s lineup it comes
out of the box with a base clock of 1721
megahertz in a boost clock of 1860 a
seven percent increase from the founders
Edition the memory however is untouched
and remains at ten gigahertz effective
the card also features a 10 plus to
power phase compared to five on the
reference a two gigabytes of gddr5 X
memory with a 256 bit interface and a
TDP of 215 watts which is 35 more than
the founders Edition and with that you
get an extra eight pin PCI connector for
a total of two the additional Headroom
and voltage supply should theoretically
help the card when it comes to
overclocking which we will see later in
this video for i/o you get the same
ports you would expect from the founders
Edition dueling DVI one HDMI 2.0 B and
three DisplayPort 1.4 and finally let's
take a look at the overall design of the
card to be honest at first glance I
wasn't a fan of the honeycomb mesh style
faceplate with EVGA logos everywhere and
I mean pretty much every angle of the
card but after spending a few days with
it it kind of grew on me
the only minor design flaw I noticed was
the EVGA logo off to the side once the
card is installed inside the PC tower
the lungo will appear upside down but in
most cases that angle won't be visible
anyways due to the hard drive cages but
I figured I would still point that out
other than that the card looks very sexy
EVG has opted for a fairly neutral black
and silver color scheme which will work
well with pretty much any build they've
also implemented RGB LEDs which lights
up the logo and the card name in the
front as well as a faceplate of the card
you can adjust the color and give it a
cycling effect using EVGA precision X
overclocking software huge props to EVGA
for adding this awesome feature and I
would definitely love to see this on the
other cards as well
people love to keep the color scheme in
their builds consistent I know I do and
having a GPU that features RGB LEDs is
always a plus one in my book
currently the FCW and classified
versions are the only ones with RGB
lighting whereas a superclocked and
regular a CX 3.0 have only white LEDs
instead the backplate however very nice
I think out of all the graphics cards I
have ever used EVGA has always been my
favorite in terms of default backplate
design there are also some cutouts for
ventilation which will help the heat
escape to the top of the case I mean the
build quality of the card is top-notch
and it doesn't look like EVGA cut any
corners here the new HDX 3.0 cooler
design takes advantage of its enormous
size with huge 100 millimeter fans and
these use double ball bearings which
EVGA claims lasts up to four times as
long as traditional sleeve bearing fans
in terms of temps this card stays fairly
cool and quiet considering it comes
factory overclocked for idle it would
stay at a constant 44 degrees and doing
full load I couldn't get it past 76 the
fans also switch off completely in idle
and low power situations to stay more
quiet and save energy
in fact there's a quick noise sample
during idle and full load
all right so enough of this
jibber-jabber how does it perform for
benchmarks I'm using a testbed that's
rockin a 59 30 K at 4.5 gigahertz 16
gigabytes of g.skill RAM hooked up to
the Asus x99 Strix motherboard and a be
quite dark rock pro 3 CPU cooler now I'm
going to shut up and let you guys enjoy
the benchmark
so there you have it the fortuyn card
did shows a noticeable increase in FPS
across the board compared to the stock
founders edition however when it came to
overclocking I didn't have much luck
only boosting the base clock by a measly
seventy-five megahertz bringing my boost
clock up to nineteen thirty five and
sometimes spiking past 2k I've also
managed to bring the memory up by
another four hundred for a total of 10.8
gigahertz effective not the best
overclock I've had on a GPU but still
better than nothing especially
considering that the card comes heavily
overclocked so you don't really have
that much Headroom to work with
in conclusion the FTW Edition is a beast
of a card it's well made aesthetically
pleasing extremely quiet and comes with
the RGB LED feature at this point it
doesn't make sense spending an extra $20
on a Founders Edition where you can get
a much better looking card that offers
more performance however if you don't
care much about the custom PCB dual BIOS
feature or even the customizable RGB
LEDs and the super clock version is the
one you need to check out instead it's
clocked slightly lower than the FTW but
it also costs $30 less it also consumes
less power and comes with a single 8 pin
PCI connector and whichever card you
choose you're definitely getting what
you pay for
anyways that pretty much wraps up my
review of the EVGA gtx 1080 for the win
edition if you guys enjoy the video make
sure to leave a like and make sure you
subscribe to the channel because I have
a buttload of gtx 1080 and 1070 card
reviews coming up in the next few days
and next few weeks as well then guys so
much for watching and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
