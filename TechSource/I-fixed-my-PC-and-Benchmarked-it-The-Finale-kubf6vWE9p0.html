and welcome to the final video I promise
it's the final video of a big red it's
definitely been a an emotional roller
coaster from the beginning a lot of
incompatibilities parts dying on me if
you guys saw the last few episodes then
you know how much trouble I went into
building this damn thing but alas it is
up and working I promise you guys I was
gonna work on this fix it and then bring
you guys benchmarks because that's what
you asked for in the comments section so
that is what this video is about it's
basically going over the gaming
benchmarks temperatures and of course
the overclocking and my final thoughts
on building inside this case and any
other issues that I ran into in terms of
cooling and overclocking first thing I
do what I mentioned is if I were to
build in a bigger case I would have
definitely used a different motherboard
because the MSI x2 99 micro ATX board
isn't that great when it comes to
overclocking especially since I'm
putting in an 18 core 36 threaded CPU
and I'm gonna be overclocking that the
reason why I say that is the V RMS ek
currently does not make a monoblock for
this specific motherboard I would have
loved to keep the V arms cooler which
would have helped overclocking and keep
the temps down but unfortunately they're
I think like ninety degrees Fahrenheit
right now this it's pretty hot up there
and there's nothing I can do in terms of
cooling another thing I want to mention
is the amount of power being supplied to
the CPU socket on this motherboard just
isn't enough especially for an 18 core
beast it only hasn't a single 8-pin
connector on there and I would've loved
to see an extra 4 pin for a more stable
overclock I think I would have been able
to push the CPU a little bit more if I
had that extra juice but unfortunately
only it's only got a single eight and so
with that said I was able to push the 79
80 XC to a stable 4.5 gigahertz on 1.2
volts which actually I think is very
impressive considering that I don't have
any cooling for the V RMS I don't have a
monoblock
and also I'm using a single 8-pin
connector to power two CPU sockets so
yeah but with that said it's gonna check
out some temps I'm gonna give you guys
some gaming benchmarks and wrap up the
video let's do this alright guys so
before we jump into the gaming
benchmarks let's take a quick look at
the temps the PCs been running 15 20
minutes I would say at this point and
the CPU is idling around looks like 35
degrees
it is fluctuating a little bit about 40
but for the most part yes can see most
actually all the cores are hovering
between 34 35 degrees so not bad for
overclocked CPU and no model block let
me remind you guys that the VR times get
really really hot on this X 299 chipset
so it's definitely affecting their moles
scrolling down let's take a look at the
GPU we are at a constants 33 degrees
it's fluctuating between 30 to 34 so not
bad you know since it's not doing
anything so yeah I'm gonna do a quick
benchmark Cinebench r15 take a look at
the CPU score turn this on Wow
and it's rendering insanely fast 4300 oh
my god I've never seen this test finish
this quickly before
interestingly enough the temps did
skyrocket to well if you're looking at
the package it's around 85 degrees peak
which is pretty hot I'm not gonna lie
for a water-cooled build but if you cram
so much powerful components inside in
such a tiny case and they're all
producing heat at the same time I mean
it's you know it's gonna affect
obviously CPU temperatures because hot
air does rise and you know it's not the
best air flow case by far everything is
just pretty much there and I'm only
using 6 fans so yeah 85 degrees is
pretty hot but you know
it's stable also quick adjustment guys I
did say it was overclock on 1.2 volts
which is not true it's actually 1.1 85
so I was able to underclock the voltage
a little bit more but it is stable and
that's what matters but anyways with
that said let's go to dive in to some
benchmarks show you guys how this beast
is performing in that so let's open up
GTA 5 first ISO first game is GTA 5 let
me show you guys the settings that I'm
using for this everything is pretty much
maxed out for the graphics it is in 4k
resolution of course we got DirectX 11 I
did turn off FXAA and MSA but everything
else looks like it's on very high
reflection MSA is off and I think what
else today no everything else is high or
very high I should say so 4k resolution
we are getting let's see average 160 I
would say 160 yeah anywhere between 150
to 160 very smooth gameplay as you guys
can see
not bad for not bad on 4k resolution a
dip down to 147 under sitting go
somewhere else for more action no dr.
friedlander I don't want you so I
noticed a dip down to well 133 but
you're well over 100 FPS to 1080 T eyes
which by the way are overclocked
I think I did 50 megahertz on the core
for both of the GPUs and 500 megahertz
additional on the memory clock yeah very
very smooth gameplay also guys keep in
mind that GeForce experience is
recording my gameplay and as usually I
think around 1 or 2 FPS drop when I'm
recording which isn't a big deal and the
temperature wise both GPUs are actually
fairly cool 57 degrees for the top and
53 degrees for the bottom CPU is
hovering between 60 65 degrees so not
bad at all if those two GPUs were
air-cooled I can guarantee you guys that
they would be
in the high 70s probably even 80s so
yeah very impressive all right so I
started out pop G this is 4k resolution
and already I noticed that one of the
GPUs isn't working at 100% and I'm
guessing because of the poor
optimization for SLI support or maybe
there isn't any support for SLI on plug
G for some reason because only one of
the GPUs is working interesting okay all
right let me just actually get out of
this plane first
so f psy is yeah you're definitely gonna
be dipping below 60fps then again this
is 4k resolution maxed out in ultra
settings this game isn't 100% optimized
yeah everything's ultra settings looks
like vsync is off you are not going to
be passing 60fps that's for sure I might
have to lower the settings resolution to
2560 by 1440 P so yeah let me do that
real quickly
there we go 120 Wow jumped up pretty
much double so in the low hundreds 100
600 810 FPS this is actually playable I
don't think 4k 4k is definitely not as
smooth as 2k that's for sure so yeah
depending on the area you're getting
anywhere from I would say 80 to 120 fps
so well above the 60 mark which is
definitely playable in 2k resolution
there's no starter there's no lag CPU is
hovering around 60 degrees Celsius and
then GPUs are both around 50 degrees so
not bad
I mean if both GPUs can be utilized I'm
pretty confident that even in 4k
resolution we can achieve over 100 FPS
but unfortunately only one GPU is
working Oh actually I suck at this game
so I'm just gonna quit before somebody
shoots me anyways so as we want to
another game Doom is up next we have
ultra settings under
open GL as you guys can see Ultra
settings pretty much maxed out let's
take a look at the PS we are hovering
well over 100 150 150 - I just noticed a
little bit of stutter actually it's
interesting but good news is both GPUs
are being recognized 2,000 megahertz on
the top GPU it's stuttering though I'm
not sure why it kind of just comes and
goes there we go it's happening again
that is interesting I don't know why
it's stuttering on doom when it wasn't
stuttering on other games maybe
something with the uh let's try Vulcan
actually maybe maybe one starter on
Vulcan let me switch real quick alright
so the stutter apparently came from the
API OpenGL it's for some reason stutters
and on Vulcan which is what I'm playing
on right now it's buttery smooth the
frames aren't as high compared to OpenGL
but I mean it's not stuttering which I
would take over the additional what 10
FPS I am getting around 100 it is
dipping down to mid-90s I think maybe
even low 90s but it's still playable in
4k resolution ultra settings so yeah
very smooth that's just bizarre why I
was stuttering on OpenGL that's
interesting but yeah that seemed to fix
the issue I had to do is switch to
Vulcan uh yeah okay moving on to the
next game fortnight is up next a very
popular game it's definitely one of my
favorites although I suck really bad at
it we are getting this is 4k by the way
maxed out ultra settings we're getting
slightly over 60fps looks like now we're
dipping below 60fps actually
so and oh it looks like it's not even
supporting SLI because one of the GPUs
is not even working so yeah I'm not a
game that's not really optimized and I
think I'm gonna die here yep
I don't have a gun I can't even hear
anything I'm not playing with any sound
by the way so anybody can oh you up
there's somebody in this room we're
gonna die
yes what Sonny whoa what's happening oh
my god we are so lucky there oh Jesus
what were you doing here dude Wow
all right let's try this again so yeah
we're not getting well over 60 fps and
4k I mean still very smooth gameplay but
I want to get at least in the hundred so
I think I'm not the lower the resolution
to 2560 so yeah 2560 by 1440 let's try
this we got at 143 in the sky and my
friends ditched me I'm so low right now
oh wait no I'm not I lied it looks like
we're going in a tomato town it looks
like we're going to tomato town we are
at a hundred and fifty-one fps looks
like 2k is a sweet spot most games
aren't even supporting us a lie anyway
so what's the point of having two GPUs
the reason why I have two GPUs is
because this is Texas I mean I do with
Dickie was builds but you guys already
know that lowest I've seen a dip so far
was a hundred and seven FPS so oh wait
no 101 97 97 was the lowest which
actually is really good still but mostly
it's in the high 31 30s looks like 65
degrees for the CPU and 54 or or 60
degrees on the GPU so fairly cool temps
and I don't if you guys can hear the PC
but it's actually very quiet so that's
one definitely one of the benefits of
going water-cooled alrighty that's
pretty much its I think I went over to
most popular games if there's a specific
game you guys wanted to see I'm sorry if
I couldn't get to it but long story
short it pretty much maxed out any game
if there's any support for SLI you can
play in 4k resolution easily otherwise I
think 2k is the sweet spot if you want a
game over a hundred FPS but anyways that
pretty much wraps up this video I hope
you guys enjoyed it thank you so much
again for every single one of you who
have been supporting the series
since episode 1 I know it's been a long
journey anyways yeah you can find all
the parts listed down below in the
description section if you guys want to
check it out I love your faces and I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
