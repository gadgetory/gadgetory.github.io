and I'm back today to take a look at the
blue limited edition ath m50x from Audio
Technica
now this isn't really something new it's
essentially the Audio Technica m50 with
an improved design and detachable cables
for those of you who don't know the m50
s were some of the best headphones
someone can buy for around $200 and that
still holds true today in the packaging
here we have the leather case that comes
in a color that matches the theme of
your headphones and it also has some
soft material inside the case to protect
your headphones from within when I
ordered these I didn't think I would
like the color but the more I use it
honestly the more starting to grow on me
but moving on with the unboxing the rest
of the stuff in here are basically just
detachable cables there's a variation of
one point two to three millimeter coiled
wires and there are also a few different
sizes of straight wires as well as an
adapter to be used with professional
audio equipment the m50 s have been
among the highest rated pairs of
headphones out there the question worth
of dressing here is if the m50x is worth
the price bump from the m50 s
the short answer to this is it depends I
mean if you really don't need the
removable cable then I would try to find
some discount and fifties and get those
instead but then again if you don't mind
the $30 price difference I would just go
with the m50x taking a closer look at
the m50x we can just see the attention
to detail that Audio Technica has put
into these headphones the headbands do
expand quite a bit so it should fit the
biggest of heads out there and the
stitching on the phone's just screen
quality and you really do feel like
you're getting what you pay for
I'm actually really picky when it comes
to headphones because they do hours of
editing and even gaming so I have to
have something that's comfortable enough
to wear for long periods of time without
it hurting my ears well I can safely say
that my search ends today because I
found exactly what I was looking for the
cushions on these are actually the
softest I have felt and to be honest
this is the first time I'm actually
holding a pair of audio Technica's the
carrying case is a nice touch and offers
a convenient way to carry your
headphones I just wish that they would
have included a hard case to protect the
headphones from an impact or even drops
but you know from my time with the
headphones I really was impressed like
no joke I was impressed the sound
quality is the best I've ever heard the
comfort is definitely there and the
price tag hey I think it's fair I've
been using Beats headphones for a long
time and I would definitely recommend
this product over those any day it kind
of feels like I've been missing out on
quality audio all this time but I'm just
glad to own a pair now but I mean let us
know what you guys think of the color
combination on the special edition pair
are any of you guys gonna pick some up
we'll go to leave some links in the
description if you guys are interested
but anyways that's the video thanks for
watching and make sure you guys stick
around for more awesome videos coming
really soon and this is that from tech
source and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
