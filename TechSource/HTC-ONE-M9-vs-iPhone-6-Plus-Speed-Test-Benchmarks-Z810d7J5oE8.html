One m9 is sponsored by cell cashier com
they can pair iPhone prices on the
internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iPhone
what's up guys it's ed from tech source
and welcome to another speed and
benchmark test this time we are facing
off the HTC One m9 against the iPhone
six-plus but Before we jump into the
actual test let's take a quick glance at
their specs and I'm sure you guys have
seen these specs a thousand times so if
you need more time you can pause the
video but for the sake of time I'm gonna
move on and start with the boot test
well that's it for the speed and
benchmark tests the iPhone six-plus
proved to be the faster phone mainly due
to its app optimization and the HTC One
m9 has better overall performance it's
still a brand new phone so there might
be updated in your future that will
hopefully improve its performance but
anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did please hit that like
button and if you didn't feel free to
dislike it let me know which two phones
you want to see a speed test on next I
actually got a battery test coming up
soon between the six plus and the m9 so
make sure you guys stick around for that
anyways this is that from tech source
and I'll see you guys in the next video
so before I go I wanted to share an
awesome website with you guys cell
