before and then realized when I was done
that the microphone wasn't even hooked
up so I was recording on the laptop
microphone so now that my voice is gone
let's try this again ladies and
gentlemen welcome to setup wars episode
102 when you submit your desk setup to
get featured on the channel if you want
to participate make sure to watch the
video linked down below but with that
said let the setup for is begin
Klaus is first up with a very clean and
minimalistic ultra light setup he's
rocking 34 you see 97 from LG and that's
sitting on top of the IKEA linen table
which looks like it's actually hooked up
against the wall it definitely looks a
lot cleaner this way instead of using
the legs that it comes with for audio
he's rocking a pair of audio engine a 2
plus speakers and he did go with the
Logitech G 410 keyboard and G 900 Mouse
but he did such a great job at the cable
management that you can barely see the
wires coming out of the monitor or
keyboard in fact you can't even see his
PC
it looks like it's hidden under a bed or
something but the wires aren't visible I
honestly have no clue how he did that my
only guess would be that he ran the
wires through the wall and into his PC
on the other side powering the setup is
a 6700 K and an msi gtx 1070 a very
clean setup with amazing cable work
speaking of clean cable management check
out Darius's setup you've got a 29 inch
Samsung Smart TV up top and a 34 inch
ultra light from LG near the bottom once
again the cables are not visible I don't
know how people run them through the
wall so easily it's such a permanent
solution I mean if it's your place and
you're going to stay there then
obviously that makes sense but what if
you decide to move out one day how on
earth are you going to cover up that
hole the desk is from Restoration
Hardware modern and on it we got the
Razer BlackWidow chroma keyboard and the
wireless Razer Mamba Mouse I'm not so
sure what that rectangular thing is
above the mouse maybe it's there to
cover up the hole for the mouse pad the
only audio source is the HyperX cloud 2
gaming headset that's chilling on the a
venturi solid steel stand in the corner
of the setup he does have an Xbox one as
well and a PC that's powering the set up
is actually a MacBook Pro 13 inch model
no complaints at the cable management
but what I would recommend is a laptop
stand for your MacBook instead of just
laying it on your desk like that
calabria is a really nice looking
vertical stand for your macbook that
will not only add some style but it will
blend nicely with the wooden theme you
got going on even consider getting some
skins for it because the silver really
does stick out there's a lot of options
for you out there especially with a
wooden theme
but a traveling to the MacBook stand
down below if anyone is interested and
number three we got mark and a very nice
overwatch team to set up or just a
orange and black setup whatever you guys
want to call it he's rocking one of the
best ultra light gaming monitors out
there the Asus PG three four eight Q and
four the keyboard and mouse he's using
the Corsair k70 and the Razer Mamba oh
so that's what that square thing was in
the last setup it's actually the
charging dock for the mouse obviously I
knew that I was just kidding earlier
he's got a really dope audio set up he's
using these same speakers as me but in
white these are the Edifier lunar
eclipses e 25 but he does have a Razer
Tiamat headset as well for gaming there
are a few other things on the desk like
a reaper figurine a bottle of alcohol or
cologne I don't even know what that is
but this clamp is from Ikea and it
actually has a bluetooth LED bulb which
you can control with his phone that's
pretty cool
also from Ikea he's got a nice
collection of fake plants on the top
shelf for the added spiciness excellent
work with cable management he's using
two Signum racks to hold up all the
cables and even the wires behind this PC
are nicely wrapped together no
complaints here and speaking of the PC
it's actually inspired by overwatch
hence the color scheme and that's
walking a 6600 K and an EVGA GTX 1080
for the win and a custom loop which is
built inside the Thermaltake core p5
case that keyboard wire is definitely
sticking out like a sore thumb but
regardless we don't get to see many
badass black and orange setups Michael
is next up with a more simple setup so
he's rocking a single Easter 27-inch
gaming monitor Razer BlackWidow chroma
key board and a Mamba mouse seriously
that's like three momma Mouse's in a row
already okay let's talk about the
elephant in the room before we continue
because I'm sure you guys are thinking
it too what is up with those cables bro
we got two lamps on the top shelves and
cables running down them I personally
want to put lamps up there in the first
place for this exact reason but if you
must keep it there at least use these
wall channels and hide the cables going
down for a much cleaner look cable
management under the desk however is a
lot better there's a power strip and a
Raceway under the desk holding up all
the cables and then we got a cable
sleeve and tubes curving up the wires on
the ground
that lead up to a cable box on the left
side if you spend all this effort and
money on the rest of the cable
management how come you haven't done
anything to the cables running down the
wall after all those are the most
obvious his audio setup consists of a
blue Yeti microphone and B Sennheiser GS
X 1000 headphones which are hanging
under his desk and finally we got the PC
that's powering this setup it's got the
6600 K and a gtx 980ti also props I'm
sticking with the same color scheme I
think you have an awesome gaming setup
but it's missing a few tweaks last but
not least we got Nick and another ultra
white setup he's got the 34 UC 87 C and
he set that up to a desk mount he
decided to go with the wireless router
so he's got the K 750 keyboard and m5
ten mouths both from Logitech and other
than a few props on the desk and the
audio interface there's really nothing
else on there for audio he is using the
Skullcandy aviators which are hanging
under his PC on a set of hands and a
pair of M audio bx8 studio monitors
under his desk that's a very unusual
place to put studio monitors if I'm
being Frank now if they were regular
speakers that would have been fine but
the point of studio monitors is to
monitor sound for editing or mixing
music so shouldn't you have them closer
to your ears on the top of your desk but
while we're down here cable management
seems to be under control thanks to that
Signum rack and a few cable clips the PC
that's powering this setup has a forty
seven ninety and a gtx 1070 founder's
edition aside from the speaker placement
this is a dope gaming setup so that is
it for this episode I've set up or as
