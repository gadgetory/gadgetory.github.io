today we're taking a look at the x-star
premium drone from Alltel robotics so
just from taking the product out of the
included hard protective case you can
immediately tell that this drone is the
real deal the quadcopter design helps to
create superb aerial imagery and the
bright orange finish ensures that you
won't lose sight of the drone when it's
up in the clouds
the drone uses a fully modular 4k camera
and a 3-axis gimbal system so any
necessary replacements or future
upgrades can be done with ease
you can shoot videos at 4k and 30fps all
the way down to 720p at 240 FPS for
buttery smooth slow motion the battery
is rated for 4900 milliamp hour which
will provide up to 25 minutes of
recording and allow for HD streaming to
your mobile phone at a maximum range of
1.2 miles what's great about the charger
is that it can supply power to the
battery and remote control
simultaneously
I'll tell robotics even includes a 64
gigabyte microSD card so you'll have
everything needed to get flying
immediately what's even better is that
the x-star premium drone retails for
just $8.99 USD an absolute steal for
this kind of bundle setting up your
first flight is very easy you just power
on the remote control followed by the
drone then secure your mobile device to
the remote control and then tether it
with a USB cable of your choice launch
the Starling app and you're ready to go
the remote control is extremely
comfortable and has a selection of
buttons to perform quick actions such as
preparing a Jone for liftoff the LCD on
the remote control will display messages
and real-time statistics such as
altitude and battery life for your
flight session the Starling gap is
smooth and easy to navigate it will
display a live view of what the drone is
recording and also you can playback
previous recordings as well this is how
you start and stop a recording as well
as take a picture flying this drone
proved to be a fun experience the 4k
footage was clean and sharp and I even
snapped a few 12 megapixel photos as
well with no interruptions during the
flight if you're feeling creative and
want to add slow-motion footage to the
mix go for it even at 1080p video from
the drone is crisp and doesn't take away
from the overall
the x-star premium uses dual gps and
glonass navigation to provide solid
positioning no matter how weak the
signal could be paired with these smart
flight features this shown is extremely
easy to get the hang of follow mode
tells a drone to follow you
Orbitz makes the drone circle specified
areas and waypoints allows you to create
a plan for the drone to travel auto
robotics goes above and beyond the
product itself and wants to ensure an
overall satisfying experience for every
