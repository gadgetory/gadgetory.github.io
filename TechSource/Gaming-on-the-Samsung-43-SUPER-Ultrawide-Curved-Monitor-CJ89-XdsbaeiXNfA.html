and right here in front of me is
Samsung's newest ultrawide monitor this
is the CJ 89 it's a 43 inch ultra wide
curved monitor and I'm so excited to
check it out so with that said let's
unbox it set it up and take it for a
test drive most of you longtime
subscribers out there actually know that
I currently have an ultra-light monitor
and I switched over from a multi-monitor
setup to three years ago and since then
I've never looked back I love that thing
it's great for gaming it's awesome for
productivity so when Samsung reached out
to me to sponsor this video and send
this out to me I did not hesitate at all
oh okay I think I'm gonna have to stand
up for this part there's a lot of stuff
in here so let's get all this out of the
box well quick where she is all right so
these are the accessories that came with
the box obviously got the base then you
got the neck piece this is the back
cover to cover up the ports I'm guessing
and inside this box you have the cables
got a USB type-c and this is the bracket
used to hook up the monitor against the
wall or a monitor arm itself so I don't
think we'll be using this in this video
however all right it's put together the
monitor and take it for a test drive
so ladies gentlemen here it is the super
ultra ride from Samsung this thing is
almost as wide as my wingspan it's
insane you know at one point you gotta
stop and ask yourself how wide is to
wide at what point is it gonna be enough
and I feel like we're gonna find that
out in this video so there's a couple
things I noticed in the back it's got a
base amount which is great because this
thing is massive and it'll take up a lot
of space on your desk
so having the option of mounting this
thing to a wall or a compatible monitor
arm is a great idea also back here we
have a ton of quartz we got the usual
HDMI display but we also have a couple
of USB ports and two additional type-c
ports these ports will allow you to hook
up anything that has a USB type-c
connection it could be a tablet a phone
or even a laptop and it will not only
charge the device but it can even
display content from it at the same time
as far as adjustments this can actually
rotate quite a bit to get that perfect
angle assuming you're using the base
then of course it is height adjustable
as well so this is all the way to the
top and this is all the way to the
bottom the only thing you can't do is
tilt the monitor well I guess you can
tilt it a little bit just to make sure
that the monitor is even with the desk
but you know what we should hook this up
to my PC and take it for an actual test
drive alright let's do this Oh what this
is insane
I can already see this being so perfect
for productivity there's so much space
to work with actually speaking of
productivity
let's open up Vegas Pro my editing
software and see what it looks like oh
my god this is insane I could fit the
entire timeline for one project on one
screen I don't have to scroll left and
right for it I can see everything this
is insane and I have some extra space on
there right here wow this is going to
increase my productivity flow so much
this is insane
so it's interesting the monitor back at
home I'm able to split the screen
comfortably in half so I usually have a
window open on the left and then a
window open on the right but what these
Samsung
all tried I'm able to have three full
windows open guys got my Twitter over
here I got my YouTube and an extra
window in the middle to do whatever I
want so the monitor comes with five watt
speakers located on the bottom here
let's actually test it out and see how
they sound like okay okay yeah they
don't sound bad they're nice and bacey
that got decent highs they don't get
that loud this is actually max volume on
this from the YouTube player and the
actual monitor itself but four built-in
speakers actually not that bad all right
let's see how gaming is on a super ultra
wide I'll start off with a shooter game
like csgo and I want to see how
immersive it really is and if the extra
width really gives you an advantage in
shooter games so let's load this up
obviously practicing with bots because I
cannot play csgo if my life depended on
it okay wow this is actually much wider
than I expected I can definitely see
more on my sides than before now this
can be a good thing or a bad thing
because that just means there's more
horizontal space to move left and right
so aiming at enemies for example might
take some extra time if that makes any
sense because there is more horizontal
movement but the advantage is you can
actually see a lot more so I can stand
over here and I can see from one side of
the wall all the way to the other this
is crazy
it feels like the monitor is wrapping
around my face it's really cool and I
feel like this is perfect for people
that are always looking to get that
immersive experience like this is so
trippy I can see the sides using that
peripheral vision so I'm just looking
straight and I can see what's going on
on the sides
let's give pub G a try first thing I
actually notice as my body's cut in half
I'm guessing because of the super wide
resolution they had to compress the
screen or something but that is pretty
interesting so the resolution on this
monitor is 3840 by 1200 and because it's
43 inches diagonally you get a 32 by 10
aspect ratio unfortunately it doesn't
come with neither g-sync
or free sync however to compensate for
that it has a hundred 20 Hertz of fresh
weight 5 millisecond response time panel
which is awesome for gaming on the
productivity side of things the panel
also has 8-bit color support 99% srgb
coverage and a maximum brightness of 300
nits without a doubt you're getting an
advantage playing on this super ultra
wide monitor
compared to people who are playing on a
regular one I mean just look how much
more you can see just by glancing around
you don't have to move your mouse so you
can easily spot enemies and quickly
react to them this is I feel like in a
way it's kind of cheating yeah I don't
see how this is fair compared to people
are using a traditional aspect ratio I
mean there is just there is so much more
content it's insane now you might be
asking yourself
Edie I can't do an ultra-right I'm sorry
I do need to separate monitors because I
need to separate inputs maybe you're a
screamer maybe you have an extra console
on the side and you like to switch
between both of them well the Samsung
super alt-right actually has an option
where you can hook up two separate
devices on the left is what my PC is
connected to and on the right is what my
laptop is connected to via HDMI you can
also use the USB type-c connection in
the back if you don't want to use the
HDMI
now if you go through the menu section
you can actually even resize this entire
second input so if I go on their menu
you're on their size you can set it to
two other options you can do fullscreen
you can do I think this is 25% and the
corner over there or slightly larger and
obviously you can change the position of
that as well so for example if I wanted
it on the bottom right so it doesn't get
in the way of things I can leave it
right there so for example if I'm
streaming right now this would be
perfect because now I can look at chat
and I can browse the internet I can go
on my Twitter feed whatever it is at the
same time gaming so doesn't interrupt me
so this would be like the ideal
streamers setup if they were only using
a single ultra ride instead of a
multi-monitor setup another really cool
feature about this monitor is that it
comes on I'm so sorry
oh my god so as I was saying I'm not a
cool feature is the ice saver mode and
that pretty much reduces the amount of
blue light being emitted from the panel
and it's gonna help with your eye
fatigue and of course less stress on
your eyes and you can access that easily
within the Menu button down here just
two little buttons and then you can see
a filter is being applied on your
gameplay obviously changes the colors
and stuff like that but it's gonna help
with overall fatigue so if you're
playing for long hours at a time it
might be worth it to put it on say that
guys I've pretty much played with this
thing the entire day and I've decided
that I'm gonna replace my ultra light
back at home so once I do that I'm gonna
completely redo my setup and then bring
you guys a setup tour before the see
your end so make sure that that thumbs
up on if you guys are excited and that
also does it for this video so I hope
you guys enjoyed it a huge thanks to
Samsung for sponsoring this video and
sending out the CJ 89 for me to test
that absolutely love it if you guys want
to check it out it is coming out early
September for $1000 and there is also a
32 inch version coming out late August
thanks again for watching as always and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
