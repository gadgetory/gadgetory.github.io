welcome to another unboxing episode here
on the channel so there's this company
called the Xiaomei who reached out to me
and sent over a few boxes for me to open
up and they said that there are some
cool tech inside of them and there's
extra tech for me to give away to you
guys watching so if you want to
participate make sure to stick around
till the end of the video alright so
they sent over three boxes for me to
open up there's actually one of these
and inside here there are several tech
products and then two of these big boys
this is actually the me electric scooter
so I guess we'll start off the episode
band boxing this this is actually the
first electric scooter i've unboxed on
the channel and believe it or not I've
actually never win a electric scooter so
it should be an interesting experience
to say the least alright so inside the
box you guys will pretty much get an
instruction manual I'll tell you how to
ride a scooter and the installation
guide which is actually very simple
essentially they give you some they give
you four screws an allen wrench and all
you have to do is install the screws on
the handle over here and you're pretty
much good to go I love how simple the
installation is they're also kind of up
to include an extended nozzle adapter
that way it's a lot easier to pump air
into your tire you also got your
charging adapter and last but not least
two extra tires in case the ones you
have go flats or wear down over time so
that is actually very very nice so the
cool thing what the knee scooter is that
you can actually fold it so it's a lot
easier to carry around and travel with
and even whenever you're ready to write
it bring the neck back up raise the
lever and then lock it in place it's
actually very simple so once you're done
riding the scooter all you have to do is
release the lock hold it back down and
lock it in place and this makes it a lot
easier to carry around but anyways with
that said I want to take this for a test
drive I can't remember the last time I
had this much fun riding something I
think this Segway
which was out like 2-3 years ago was the
most fun but that was really dangerous
this isn't as dangerous and it's really
fun to drive
yeah I think this will make it awesome
gift for anyone to be honest doesn't
matter what age you are from 10 to like
50
it's even got a bell so the battery
range on any scooter lasts around 18
point 6 miles obviously it is affected
by real-life situations such as if
you're going over a slope but there's a
bunch of wind or ground resistance it
does have a built-in headlight which you
can turn on and off using a switch and
as even an LED indicator on the top of
the scooter which will tell you how much
battery life is left which is pretty
cool the me scooter also comes with an
energy saving mode which gives you
longer range by cutting down the maximum
speed and you can switch to it by
tapping on the power button while it's
on I'm moving on to the final box and as
always guys if you want to check out
anything in this video especially the
scooter I'll have links below for you so
so I think there are a few products in
here let's see what they sent me first
up we got the me robot builder we also
got the me power bank Pro we got two of
those the last bell nice we got a few of
the me in ear headphones Pro so Before
we jump into the me robot builder which
actually looks very interesting let's
take a look at their power banks for a
second it's gonna take this out of the
box so this is a 10,000 million of our
power bank and it's able to fully charge
an iPhone 7 up to four times you get a
USB port over here USB type-c and a
power button over here which will
indicate how much juice is left on the
power bank it's a very clean
minimalistic design very sleek and it's
got a matte finish on there so very
clean they also included a two and one
USB cable so you got the USB C and then
if you pop open the cover you get a
micro USB cable unfortunately there is
no iPhone cable that's gonna be sold
separately with that said let's move on
to the me robot builder this is actually
an interesting product this is basically
what it sounds like you build your very
own robot
and you program it and get to control it
via the mobile app it's got over 900
pieces and it's fully customizable with
smart controls and adaptive balance
system the cool thing about this is that
you don't need to know anything about
coding it basically uses zero code
graphic programming and it's great for
ages 10 and up I think this will make a
great gift for anyone out there who
wants to get into a new hobby or learn
something new or just challenge
themselves it's definitely something new
and exciting but anyways as always I'll
drop a link below for the me robot
builder and with that said moving on to
the final product of this episode which
are the me in ear headphones Pro these
actually have a very clean minimalistic
look to them so inside the box you guys
will get a few different ear tips sizes
and the earbuds themselves so my first
impressions these are very lights it
seems to be built very well actually has
a plastic frame around it that does have
a braided cable let's see if it's
actually comfortable to wear though he's
on fairly comfortable no complaints I
don't have a lightning adapter to plug
into my iPhone 10 so let me borrow your
Android phone actually okay so for a
pair of earphones under $30 I'm gonna
say these sound actually pretty good the
aren't base heavy so this is definitely
not aimed towards the bass heads out
there but if you guys are looking for
sound overall sound quality and clarity
I think these are a very solid buy
especially since they cost around 25
bucks another cool feature that actually
adds to the overall value of these
earphones is the built in microphone
with the controls believe it or not you
have access to the volume play pause you
can even go back and skip tracks as well
and that's very hard to find on a pair
of quality earphones under $30 some of
the features for the meet in ear
headphones pro include the metal sound
chamber which is crafted a 20 step
process and the microphone also reduces
noise interference
for the price I'm very impressed I think
these will make an awesome gift for
anyone looking for a great sounding pair
of earphones especially considering it
comes with built-in controls guys this
is very difficult to find on a pair of
quality earphones less than 30 bucks but
with that said I think I pretty much
wraps up this video as always if you
guys want to check out any of these
products mentioned in this video I'll
have a link to the Amazon page below as

power bank Pro as well as the me robot
builder and of course the electric
scooter so one of each other all you
