bring you a special unboxing of the
latest imac released by apple just a few
days ago the new models come sporting
Intel's newest processors speedier
wireless internet capabilities and
improve graphical performance so this
model that we are currently in boxee
goes for 1999 and it comes with the
following specs it has a 27 inch
led-backlit display rocking on a
resolution of 2560 x 1440 it runs on a
3.4 gigahertz quad-core intel i5
processor it also has eight gigs of ram
one terabyte hard drive space and this
baby even has an nvidia geforce gtx 770
5m graphics card with two gigabytes of
memory they also have built-in stereo
speakers dual mics and a headphone port
and as I mentioned before these models
are now capable of connecting 280 to
point 11ac compatible routers which
means a much higher cap for download
speeds all right Ian up with his specs
portion let's move on to the unboxing
you
so here you have it the newest time
equities from a poor one of the things I
love about the imac unlike the pc it has
everything on display on the top of the
screen you have your 720p HD
front-facing camera along with your
ambient light sensors on the back side
you will find all your necessary ports
on the same side now I know may seem
pretty inconvenient putting all these in
the back especially the USB ports but
after using the mac for some time I'm
sure you can get used to it first off
you have your headphone jack daniel SD
card slot for USB 3.0 to tunnel bolt
ports and your Ethernet port if you
choose to connect your cable on the
opposite side you will find a power
button and in between all these is where
you plug in your power cord I also love
how they created a whole understand
making it super easy to connect its
small things like this don't make a huge
difference the imac also has a tapered
edge measuring at five millimeter at its
thinnest point giving you the look and
feel of a very thin surface also on the
back of the imac is where the two
microphones are located the first one is
located on top of the apple logo and
that's used for noise cancellation where
the mic that's on top of the displays
the actual microphone used for input
overall this seems like a really solid
desktop i love the specs on it and the
27-inch screen is ridiculous especially
with that monster resolution you can fit
a lot of stuff into that one screen
making multitasking very easy the video
card is also a huge plus and if you are
like being edit videos and you can
definitely benefit from that i have
always been a pc guy and i never paid
much attention to Apple products besides
their iPhones but after playing around
with this I can see why IMX are really
popular the price may be really high but
I assure you that you are getting what
you pay for so what type of person are
you guys pc imac or both let me know in
the comments section down below i
believe there are huge benefits from
both sides that will do it for the
unboxing and overview of the new imac
