GPUs maybe even PETA spills it gets
pretty random but anything to pay the
bills you gotta chill hit that like I'm
not a shell just doing your bike this
rap is so crazy that it doesn't even
line mister laner trying to buy more
time you gotta make that accent so I can
buy another house now let me end this
bad rap with a random mouse a huge
thanks to roll the warships for
sponsoring today's video world of

and 3 days of premium time with other
extras what's happening guys welcome
back to another episode of what's in the
box I got to give a huge thanks to
everybody who smacked the crap out of
like button on the last video guys again
we hit over 10,000 likes I love you
faces but anyways what that said let's
dive right in and unbox some stuff shall
we we actually have a crap ton of boxes
for this episode
so the first tiny box is coming from
Amazon you guys don't know how it is
start from the small work our way up to
the top so let's check this out starting
off things fairly simple we have a set
of four 120 millimeter fans from
Roseville this is going in a budget bill
they highly anticipated $500 budget
piece you guys are gonna see actually
the rest of the parts in this video so
it's kind of it's gonna ruin the
surprise but whatever this is the best
deal you can buy right now on Amazon 15
dollars for a set of four 120-millimeter
fans which is gonna help with air flow
and just overall lower de temps in your
PC well worth the investment it's not
RGB but it gets the job done for only
$15 and say this next box is my favorite
box and it's from insource mod so yes I
already know what that means these are
the custom cables for big red the
rebuild of big red oh I always want the
best of the best in my own system so
that is why I ordered cables from and
sourced mods here we go guys here we
open it up for you guys first actually
that was a bad idea
beautifully white and red sleeve cables
we even got the the white connector with
the white cable combs on here it's gonna
look so damn sexy once the build is
complete oh I cannot wait huge shadow if
I'm in source mods for setting is over
you are the MVP I cannot wait to put
these and then you build also yes guys
my voice does sound different I am
actually currently sick I do have a cold
so that is why I sound like a dying
hippo so I apologize if I am destroying
your ears oh whoa it's this okay I
remember now I should got a really good
deal on these two for gear bite sticks
at 26 66 megahertz for 50 bucks
it's gonna fit perfectly within the
budget and we also got a cloud
stinger headset it's actually open this
up real quick this is one of the best
budget headphones you can currently buy
around the $50 price tag so I can't
really tell you what this is for you
guys are gonna have to wait I don't want
to ruin this
price but it is gonna be really awesome
video alright next up we've got this box
coming from tool tul and no idea what
that is
ah wow this is a this is a super tiny
GPU box I've never seen a graphics card
get shipped into such a small box like
this so this is the rx 570 from a power
color to red dragon not a bad GPU at all
it's gonna kick ass in 1080p and I think
that actually having a sale on this GPU
currently so it's a lot less on Amazon
on you a guy'll job believe if you guys
wanna check it out or pick one up for
yourself but yeah guys definitely have
notifications enabled if you want to see
how this GPU performs in the budget go
it's open this white one over here this
actually has no name or anything on here
actually I lie this is from b1 tech I
took up the packaging slip so these are
all for the black and green razor themed
PC which I'm also gonna be building a
setup for so you got some black and lime
green cable extensions we got some black
and UV green razer logo fan grills and
are you guys ready for this oh so it's a
black GPU backplate but it's RGB so the
logo over here is actually gonna light
up green it's gonna look sick in the
build and I actually requested a few
other things as well we got our GB SSD
covers and an RGB GPU sag bracket this
is also gonna line up in green it's
gonna be epic
I gotta stop using that word I'm sorry
guys that's like the only word in my
dictionary right now so my apologies
yeah
not gonna plant really bad actually
oh we have a lot of goodies okay so
first up we've got some speakers from
Logitech Z to hundreds these two of
these there's no way I bought two of
these hold up I did buy two of these ah
we got a looks calm soft RGB mouse pad
and we also got that buy two of these
again so this is the yaki RGB keyboard
again all this is going in a special
video I can't really tell you guys much
but so I did a roundup video on the best
gaming mice on their twenty dollars in
this mouse was actually one of the best
ones in that video if you guys missed it
I'll drop a link below but for $20 this
is a solid or GB gaming mouse I guess I
can show you guys the case I mean Milo's
get out of the box but this is the super
popular cooler master master box Q 300l
a really beautiful micro ATX form factor
with an acrylic side panel and it comes
pre-installed with a single 120
millimeter fan I really good-looking
case for only $40 it's gonna be perfect
for the budget bill we actually have
three more boxes to go actually oh we
got some GPUs boys
and a cooler we got the courser H 150 I
Pro three 16-millimeter AI oh and we got
some GPUs the powder color red devil or
x5 80 and new oh this is the new Radeon
seven
whoa I got open this one up
let's see yeah I've actually never got a
sample unit so huge thanks to power
color for setting this end inside an
Amazon box I was okay now that I think
about it I've never really done a high
end all AMD build so definitely gonna
find good use for the Radeon seven once
I'm done with my other water cooling
products of course but yeah very excited
about this thank you so much powder
color for sending this over this is
awesome for those of you that don't know
the Radeon seventh game performance is
between an RT X 2080 and an RT X 27
eight one of the biggest issues right
now is the pricing this actually has
almost the same price as an RT X 2080
they both go for around $700 sometimes
even 750 but the Arctic's 2080 has
better performance than this so what
they really need to do is lower the
price of the Radeon 7 so that's slightly
more than the RT x 2070 but a lot less
than the 2080 so Razer actually sent
this over yesterday and I unboxed it
already but they sent over some extra
gear remember I was telling you guys in
the last episode we got the eraser
naari wireless gaming headset and the
new Razer huntsmen Elite gaming keyboard
I am actually be doing a giveaway on
these three we had the extra Mama League
Gaming Mouse another Gilad that's
extended RGB mousepad and of course the
black but I will eat mechanical keyboard
that I unboxed in the last episode these
three items are gonna be in a giveaway
for the black and green gaming
that's coming up I think in a few weeks
so if you guys want to participate make
sure to watch that video as far as the
rest of this gear it's gonna be going in
the epic black and green themed gaming
setup that I teased about in the last
episode but yeah I'm gonna keep these
sealed as of now so many awesome
projects coming up guys I cannot wait
okay well at least we have this massive
box from Amazon okay this is technically
the last piece of the budget build eh 3
10m from gigabyte and we also have a
budget 24 inch curved 1080p gaming
monitor from sceptre Skepta or sceptre I
don't know how you say this 144 Hertz 3
millisecond response time and if we sink
and it's a v8 panel for only $180 this
is one of the best gaming monitors you
can buy currently for that price tag and
I know I promised you guys the best
gaming monitors but 144 Hertz on there
$20.00 coming soon but I had to postpone
that for late March but I am planning on
making that video guys so yeah stick
around and that is it for this unboxing
episode I hope you guys enjoyed it as
