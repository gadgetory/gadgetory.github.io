welcome to setup wars episode 80 potato
Edition I know you guys have been
waiting for this as always please
remember that this episode is done
purely for entertainment do not take
anything I say in this video seriously
because there's always some people that
are upset for some reason I don't know
if they skip the intro or what but do
not take anything I say in this episode
seriously it's done for entertainment
reasons and these setups are actually
sent to me to be on the worst set-up
edition so I'm not even like picking
these for myself anyways uh with that
said let the setup Wars begin if you
guys are shopping around for your next
game make sure to check out g2 AECOM
because they have the cheapest CD keys
available for pretty much any game I'll
drop a link to them down below if you
want to check it out also as always the
person with the worst setup will receive
$100 and there will be a strawpoll link
down below so make sure you guys vote at
the end of this episode alright so your
five contestants for this week are Adam
Chris Viviana SH Hamza and Nick
as always guys disclaimer what you're
about to see may haunt you for weeks to
come
starting off the episode we have Adam
and his coffee table set up it doesn't
even look like he has a desk so he's
rocking a 24-inch veccio monitor which
is being powered by an asus rog GL 752
laptop and for his chair he is actually
sitting on the couch I don't even know
how this is possible I mean I get that
you put the Razer keyboard on your lap
but how do you use the Mad Catz Mouse
that looks very uncomfortable for audio
he's using a pair of razer kraken pros
which is hanging from his monitor and I
love that he tried to organize the
cables on the table by cutting a hole in
a rectangular box but the cables on the
floor are still visible now if you're
gonna be gaming on a couch I would
recommend picking up a courser lapdog or
something similar so that's much more
comfortable since you can't actually buy
a desk as far as the external hard drive
is concerned I would maybe mount that
under the desk using some velcro if this
is in fact your permanent PC setup I do
see that you have a TV back there so I'm
guessing this is either temporary or
you're constantly moving things or
depending on what you are using or maybe
this is fake and you're trying to get
that easy money either way Thank You
Adam for entering and good luck next up
is Chris and it looks like we finally
have an actual set is that a landline
phone who still uses those so on this
tiny table which honestly looks like
it's about to break any second now we
have a 19-inch Samsung monitor on the
top and underneath that is the Mersenne
tile keyboard and colors Mouse low key
the keyboard needs some serious cleaning
so other than the tech comm headset and
a ps3 controller there's really nothing
else on the desk it's actually not a bad
setup
besides the cables being all over the
place there's really nothing else that
stands out
and finally the PC that's running the
setup has a Pentium dual core with no
dedicated graphics card then again one
of the brackets are missing hmm
good luck Chris and thank you for
entering and number three is div' and it
looks like he skipped a table and a desk
altogether and mounted a TV on the wall
I guess technically he does have a table
that's holding up the Dell wireless
keyboard and mouse there is a small
stand in your left which holds a few
things like the power strip and the PC
that's on the bottom which has an AMD FX
4300 and an Nvidia GT 610 Jesus do you
seriously have a lock on your door who
are you hiding from exactly it also
looks like he has a set of sony speakers
which are hooked up to the PC a pretty
straightforward set up it looks like
other than tidying up the cables a bit
there's really nothing significant that
I would recommend good luck and thank
you for entering next up is Hamza with a
pretty decent setup actually we have a
table so that's a good start he also has
a 19 inch LG monitor hooked up to the PC
which also has an i3 550 and a ZOTAC GT
610 I think that's two in a row the
keyboard is from terabyte and the mouse
is from quantum and I'm pretty sure
that's a speaker of some sort even
though the surface of the table is
falling apart
I'm definitely digging the pink flower
theme of this setup taking a look at the
bottom we can see more flowers look at
that
and a nice clump of wires off to the
right side not the worst setup I've seen
but thank you for entering regardless
and last but not least we have Nick and
he takes the word minimalistic to a
whole new level
I don't even think this is a desk this
definitely looks like a nightstand to me
so on the nightstand he has a 19 inch
view sonic monitor and a wireless
keyboard and mouse unfortunately he
doesn't know where they are from I gotta
give credit to Nick for working on his
setup
he used a few cable clips to keep the
cables organized you can even see more
cable clips being used down here next to
the Dell PC I can tell you definitely
try to improve this setup before taking
pictures unlike some other people you
know it's really easy to keep everything
messy just to gain votes in order to win
much respect Nick thank you so much for
entering so that is it for this episode
make sure you guys click on the shop
hole link and vote on who you think has
the worst desk setup and allows the
winners on my social media platforms on
the weekend so guys I want to say
something real quick that's been on my
mind I know I've been doing these
episodes for fun but I think sometimes
we have to be very grateful to for what
we have right now there are so many
people in different countries that don't
have what we have we are so fortunate to
be where we are right now and I think a
lot of people take that for granted if
you guys think your setup is bad I mean
take a look at the ones in this episode
believe it or not they're actually
worser setups or even worse setups than
what you've seen in this video that I
did not include in these episodes I've
seen some really horrifying stuff guys
so when I see people complaining in the
comments section all you know
complaining about they don't have third
monitor for a triple monitor setup or
complaining that their PC is not
powerful enough there are people out
there that don't even have pcs to even
watch my videos or do any work or any
schoolwork so you know I just I guess
that's what I wanted to say just like be
grateful for what we have because there
are so many people out there that don't
have the luxury or what we have so I
think we are very fortunate to be in
this position so so I wanted to say
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
