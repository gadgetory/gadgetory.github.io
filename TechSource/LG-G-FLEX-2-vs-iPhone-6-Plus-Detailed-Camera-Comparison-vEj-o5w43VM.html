hey guys it's ed and welcome to another
camera comparison video this time we are
facing off the LG G flex 2 against the
iPhone six-plus but Before we jump into
the samples let's take a quick look at
their specs the G flex 2 has a 13
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.4 that can shoot up to 4k
resolution and the iPhone 6 plus has an
8 megapixel camera with an aperture of
2.2 that can only shoot up to 1080p 4
front-facing cameras the Flex 2 has a
2.1 megapixel camera that can shoot in
1080p and the same can be said about the
1.2 megapixel front-facing camera on the
6 plus I set set for the specs that sit
back relax and enjoy the show
the continuous auto focusing on the G
flex 2 is surprisingly really good and
its really quick and accurate and
actually have no complaints at all
the iPhone six-plus also does a great
job the sensors in both of these cameras
do a great job when it comes to our
focusing so I will give both the Flex to
and the iPhone six-plus a point
when it comes to 4k video the flex to
takes a point by default simply because
the iPhone six-plus can't shoot in 4k
1080p just doesn't compare to the amount
of detail and sharpness from 4k footage
the flex 2 also has a much wider field
of view for low-light video I think the
flex 2 has the edge even though there's
a lot more noise in the Flex 2 video at
least you can see things more clear
compared to the iPhone 6 plus
so the point goes to the flex 2 for
low-light video what's up guys welcome
to the stabilization and microphone test
portion of the video we are comparing
the 6 plus against the G flex 2 and
there will be an audio icon somewhere on
the screen and that will basically tell
you which phone's audio is being used
both phones are strapped onto one device
to ensure a very accurate stabilization
reading and also both phones are being
shot in 1080p to ensure a to ensure that
the optical image stabilization is
enabled for microphone quality the Flex
2 delivers a more loud and clear audio
compared to the iPhone 6 plus is very
low in muffled audio so a point there
for the Flex 2 however the 6 plus takes
the point for being more stable even
though both phones feature optical image
stabilization moving to daylight
pictures the G flex 2 does a really
great job capturing true-to-life
pictures the iPhone 6 plus tends to have
a bit more contrast in most shots and a
good example of that are these purple
flowers the one on the left actually
represents more accurate colors in other
shots the 6 plus is a bit more on the
warmer side however overall I think that
the flex 2 does a much better job not
only providing sharper pictures but also
having a much better dynamic range
although the front-facing cameras on
both phones are subpar the Flex 2 takes
the point for overall better daytime
pictures moving to the light situations
the 6 plus does a much better job than
the flex 2 the images have less noise
and they're just much more sharper than
the Flex 2 so the 6 plus takes the point
for low-light pictures the flash on the
Flex 2 is also too much I had to take at
least 5 different shots using the flash
on the Flex 2 in order to get a decent
picture it definitely takes a lot more
work to get a good shot whereas I can
get it perfect the first time
using the six plus in some cases the
flex to does a great job using the flash
and other times it's just plain sucks
producing too bright and even sometimes
blurry pictures so I'm gonna have to
give the flash point to the six plus
four consistency so which phone has the
better camera
honestly I'm split down the middle I
think both phones have their strengths
and weaknesses and it was a really close
comparison the Flex two shoots amazing
4k video has great day time pics and a
much better microphone
however the six Plus shoots better picks
in low-light situations with a better
flash and a much better video
stabilization feature so I'm gonna say
that this was a tie and let you guys
