welcome to the first episode of the
ultra wide edition sponsored by LG we
are doing episodes 103 to 106 where the
winner of each episode will take home a
brand new ultrawide monitor we're
actually doing two gaming versions and
to productivity versions as well the
links to the videos i've done on them
out down below in case you guys are
interested but with that said welcome to
set up for is episode 103 let the set up
wars begin
so this first setup is an interesting
one I don't even know if it's
technically considered a setup because
it's only a monitor and an Xbox one but
I decided to feature it anyways because
I was moved by what he wrote in the
notes he stated that he is a father of
three and he never had a gaming rig so
he's been saving his ass off for years
in order to buy his dream setup now
obviously there's a chance that this can
be all faked but I decided to go with it
anyways after all you guys get to decide
the winner not me I find it funny that
he wrote down when he is going to
purchase on a piece of paper and he
placed them in the appropriate locations
of his desk what's even more funny is
that he actually has a monitor to begin
with and nothing else and he entered a
contest to win an ultra-wide monitor but
anyways looks like he has a very solid
foundation to build a setup on and even
picked up a signal rack for cable
management very I wish you the best of
luck in your life and in this contest I
hope you enjoy your gaming PC once you
get it all together
Bruce is next up with an actual setup
he's using the news
144 Hertz precinct monitor and he lodged
ak5 20 keyboard and mouse combo that's
actually a pretty good display when it
comes to gaming and even if you do win
the ultra wide gaming monitor I think
you aren't getting a big upgrade 1/144
gaming monitor is really nice but for
audio he's got the Logitech Z 533
speakers and the monster antoon
headphones excellent work with the cable
management it looks like there's even a
custom-made shelf holding up the
subwoofer down there and finally the PCs
powering the setup has an i5 6400 and an
r9 390x which works with freesync and it
does seem like you have the GPU that can
power the ultra-right if you do end up
winning good luck and thank you Bruce
for entering and number three we got
David and what in God's name is going on
with that cable management it heard so
much how could you
could you do this to me I don't think he
even has space for an ultra-light if he
does end up winning David would need to
get a completely new desk to support it
at least his audio game is strong he's
hooked up both of his creative XM 7
speakers to the creative soundblaster
x7 deck and amp and he also has the
sennheiser 598 as well which is one of
the best reference headphones for
monitoring sound I actually have a pair
of those and black for myself the set up
is powered by a 15-inch MacBook and he
put that inside one of the organizer
bins to the side if only you could do
that with the rest of the cables I do
believe that the ultrawide monitor would
be a great addition to your productivity
setup if you do end up winning just
upgrade your desk good luck and thank
you David for Anne Frank next up is join
us with a pretty decent setup so you've
got a 24 inch Samsung monitor Logitech G
710 plus keyboard and the MX master
Mouse with a set of creative inspire a
60 speakers he also has enough room on
the desk for an ultra-wide martyr
remember you guys can actually decide
which monitor you are entering for the
productivity model or the gaming one on
the desk he's also got the logitech g930
3 headset and a baby Groot figurine
which funny enough I'm actually heading
out to watch guardians of the galaxy 2
right after I finish this video major
props on cable management such precision
this makes me a happy person and after
looking at David's cable management this
is definitely a nice change for my
eyeballs powering the setup as a number
site gtx 1070 and a 6600 thank you join
us for entering and good luck last but
not least we have Kagan and his
productivity and video editing setup
he's using the 23 inch dell ultrasharp
monitor that's being powered by his
macbook pro off to the side his audio
setup consists of the scarlett soda
audio interface bundle that comes with a
mic and headset he's also got a set of
Onkyo speakers that he hooked up to an
amplifier and then he turbine t3
headphones as well I loved that he spent
a good amount on all of this gear but he
ended up picking up a brand less
bluetooth keyboard for like 8 bucks he
also went with the wireless gaming mouse
for this productivity setup definitely
some interesting choices here
no complaints when it comes to cable
management overall a pretty solid
productivity setup despite some porch
pieces in gear good luck Kagan and thank
you for entering so that wraps up this
episode of setup or is as always the
winner will take home a brand-new
ultrawide monitor from LG you guys can
decide whether you want the gaming or
the productivity model and just to avoid
the cheating that's been going on from
scroll poll and comments section I'm
only going to count votes that I've done
with indie nice app I'll link it down
below it's completely free and also all
the voters will get tossed into a pool
and they'll have a chance to win a $25
Amazon gift card actually I think there
are four winners announced each month
from the set up pours voters if that
makes any sense anyways thank you guys
so much for watching stay tuned for
three more episodes of the ultra Lite
edition coming up every Monday thanks
again for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
