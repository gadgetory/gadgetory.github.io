and I am back again with another look at
an expensive case from gray
international now if you guys do recall
it did a similar video on one of their
cases early this year for the iPhone 6s
well now I'm back again to check out
their Advent putting new iPhone 7 this
particular version is a gold limited
edition with only 100 units being
produced ever I happen to have unit
number 61 as you can see from the
engraving on the aerospace titanium yes
that's the same titanium we use to send
things into space it's two and half
times stronger than stainless steel but
at half the weight
even the box itself is precision
machined aerospace aluminum receiving
this product is an experience in itself
now before everyone starts reaching out
to the dislike button you guys have to
understand this product obviously isn't
for everyone I mean let's face it how
many people are willing to spend a
thousand dollars on an iPhone case this
is made for a very small group of people
who value their case just as much as the
phone it's protecting and of course with
the price tag there most likely baldon
as well to install the case we simply
put on the rubber inserts it comes with
then slide on the individual pieces one
at a time I think there are several
colors for the rubber grommets ranging
from black to yellow and even red once
both pieces are on the phone and they
are pretty much secure and him isn't
going to separate from the bumper thanks
to the rubber grommets the rubber
housing also serves as impact absorption
against drops while also separating the
phone from the case so there isn't any
signal loss in the hand the advent feels
great it's cold to the touch and very
ergonomic thanks to its wide chamfers
and flat sides I can still use the phone
at one hand without any issues the
cutouts on the sides are done well and
do not interfere with the functionality
of the phone whatsoever I can easily
access the volume buttons and hit the
vibrate switch with just one finger and
also the power button is very easy to
press so the bumpers stop right before
the Lightning port which gives us an
adequate amount of space for third-party
accessories so if you guys have charging
docks or third party cables then
won't interfere with the case combine
the Advent case with a deep brown skin
and you'll be definitely turning some
heads while also protecting your phone
from scratches as you can see my case is
one of a kind with the engravings both
on the case and the box that read text
source and I guess that's what this
product is about then what the company
is striving for basically to stand out
from the rest it's a case that cost more
than the phone so it serves a very small
group of people but if you're a baller
and are willing to spend a thousand
dollars to stand out then the advent is
what you're looking for so guys I will
be giving away this exact bumper that
you see in this video to one of my
subscribers and all you have to do to
enter is just leave a like on this video
and also comments down below which D
brand skin you will use with this case
if you were to win thank you guys so
much for watching unless the winner is
on Twitter in about a week or so so make
sure you follow me there and I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
