our wallets we'll be going on a diet I
feel like it's my responsibility as a
tech channel to share with you guys some
awesome tech deals for the holidays and
since Black Friday and Cyber Monday are
around the corner why not make a video
about it
GT Way is your one-stop shop for
extremely cheap cd-keys for any game out
there never pay full price again for
your favorite games guys check it out by
clicking on the link down below so this
is a series I'm planning on hosting on
tech source every Tuesday and if this is
something you guys want to see done
every single week on tech source make
sure to backhand that like button so I
know how to continue so I'm gonna zoom
through this list real quick because
there are a bunch of items I want to
feature in this video you guys can find
the links to them down below in the
order that they are featured so it's
easier for you guys to find them oh by
the way in depending on when you're
watching this video some of the deals
below may or may not have expired
already so starting off with some PC
parts we have a 4790k processor down to
$300
that's like $50 off right now on a very
solid quad core CPU which is excellent
for gaming you also get three free games
with it csgo Just Cause 3 and world of
warships which all cost over 100 bucks
so not a bad deal if you guys have a
slightly bigger budget than the 59 30k
is going for only 460 bucks right now
which is ridiculous this processor is
usually around 540 bucks so you're
saving like $90 over here so you get 6
cores clocked at 3.5 gigahertz which you
can easily overclock and it's one of the
best CPUs you can buy for gaming and
productivity in fact this is the CPU I
use for EXCI on the $5,000 gaming PC for
August alright that's enough about Intel
for you AMD guys out there the most
popular budget CPU the FX 6300 is going
for only 90 bucks and the FX 8350 is
going for 150 all right now let's talk
about some GPUs the MSI GTX 970 is going
for 320 bucks it also comes with either
Rainbow six siege or Assassin's Creed
syndicate for a limited time and you
also get $20 in a mail-in rebate the
same games come with the EVGA GTX 980
superclocked edition - the rebate which
you can also pick up for six hundred
twenty bucks which is normally around
six hundred and fifty so you're saving
like thirty bucks over here for my
budget gamers out there there's a gtx
960 that you can buy for 180 bucks which
isn't really a big deal since the normal
price is like a hundred and ninety but
nonetheless it's on sale we also have a
Sapphire Radeon r9 290 for two hundred
twenty bucks and an r9 380 for three
hundred bucks that comes with a $20
mail-in rebate my personal favorite
budget CPU cooler the 212 Evo is
currently at its lowest price ever
coming in at just $27 if you guys want a
really solid CPU cooler for your PC then
this thing has your name on it
I actually use this in my xeon pc build
for october two Intel's newest 750
series PCIe SSD is also have a huge
discount this usually costs over 400
bucks which is weird that they have it
going for only 300 you get some
seriously crazy speeds with this up to
2200 megabytes per second read and 980
right that's ridiculous
if you're looking for a gaming laptop
then you won't find a better deal than
the Asus DB 71 listing rocks and i7 4720
HQ 8 gigabytes of ram and a gtx 950 m on
a 15.6 inch 1080p display it's currently
$200 off the retail price and you also
get an additional $20 off via rebate
card so you guys are looking for a
gaming laptop for a holidays honestly I
don't think you'll find a better deal
goodness
Samsung's 500 gigabyte 850 Evo also has
a huge price cut $240 and the same goes
for these SanDisk's 480 gigabytes for
only 110 bucks next up is the coarser
carbide series 200 our case which is 62%
off now
a very solid ATX pc case with lots of
room for cable management fans and even
the biggest GPUs it also features two
USB 3.0 ports in the front and comes
with a side window option for 26 bucks
more so remember the top five gaming
headsets under 50 bucks I did a few
months ago while the G 430 headset is on
sale now for only 40 bucks it's very
similar to the g2 30 in terms of this
but this is the newest version and also
has Dolby 7.1 surround sound
this is for my multi-monitor setup
people if you guys thought ultra wide
curb displays are too expensive then
now's the time to make this switch we
have a Samsung 34 inch curb monitor
going for only 700 bucks now guys that's
like over 50 percent off and as a 34 40
by 1440p resolution 4ms response time
with a 60 Hertz refresh rate if you like
gaming for fun and all you need a great
display for productivity
honestly bust out your wallet right now
and get this because it's the lowest you
will ever see if I don't have my LG
ultrawide monitor behind me this is
definitely in water I'll be picking up
seriously those 70 bucks that's crazy
now let's talk TVs we have an LG 43 inch
1080p 60 Hertz TV going for 285 bucks we
also have an LG 49 inch 4k smart TV
going for 504 the big boys out there a
samsung 50-inch 1080p smart TV also for
500 bucks for console gamers you guys
get 50 bucks off an Xbox one and 50
bucks off of the ps4 Uncharted bundle
lastly here are some really great deals
on other tech we have the NX 80
earphones that I've featured before on
my cool tech videos and they're actually
going for a little over twelve bucks now
and these are the best earphones I have
ever used and even still used today that
costs under 50 bucks
hell even cost under 20 bucks we also
have one of the best and most affordable
gaming mechanical keyboards that comes
in at just 30 bucks normally this is $50
but the price has been lowered again as
you can see for Black Friday
it features 26 keys for anti-ghosting 7
LED backlit options and the keyboard is
water and dust proof for mice we have a
badass one from have't that comes in
under 10 bucks it features 4 dpi
settings 7 different LED options and 6
buttons but if you guys must go wireless
then the Eagle tech mg0
10 is definitely the one you should
check out coming in at just 11 bucks so
that's basically my top picks on the
best Black Friday deals so far but I go
ahead and leave a link through a full
page down below you guys when I check
out other cool tech deals that I've been
a cover in this video
Amazon is also having a Black Friday
special they're calling it the deals of
the week or
something like that and they're
constantly adding items every hour on
the page so what I did for you guys is I
left a link to the Black Friday page for
Amazon that you guys can bookmark and
constantly check throughout the week
because they always add some pretty cool
stuff on there anyways that's it for the
video if you guys enjoyed it make sure

other tech products I should mention in
