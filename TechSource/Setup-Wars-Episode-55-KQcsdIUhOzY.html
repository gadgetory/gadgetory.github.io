check that out but here are your five
contestants for this week we have Adam
Allen Brandon Ethan and Huff feeds
congratulations for making it on the
show so starting off the show we have
Adam and his minimalistic productivity
setup we have a 25 inch tail monitor
logitech MK 270 keyboard and mouse combo
and a pair of krater speakers on the top
shelf we have a pair of SMS headphones
resting on the anchor hook and it's
trusty old rifle to shoot trespassers
very impressive work with the cable
management it appears that he not only
wrapped the cables using omnimount
sleeves but he also mounted the entire
thing along with the power strip on the
roof of the desk using some 3m tape
that's pretty much it for this setup
very simple and clean Thank You Adam for
entering next up we have Alan with a
white themed setup you know it's been a
while since I've seen an all-white
themed setup so I'm glad I came across
one you have a Samsung TV up top with a
34 inch ultra wide monitor on the bottom
on the desk is the Philco majesty board
and a me onyx caster mouse on top of the
glorious extended mousepad and in the
back we have the bose companion 3 series
speakers keeping the theme consistent we
also have a black and white dxracer
chair at Jesus Christ all of those shoes
so apparently Alan not only collect
sneakers but also action figures as well
that's pretty dope we also have the m50
X's and Beats studios resting on the
elevation labs hanger cable management
is pretty good all the wires are resting
on the Signum rack and add a single
wires on the ground the PC that's
powering the setup has a 4790k and a gtx
980ti with that sweet looking custom
backplate from v1 tech a very clean
build and a beautiful setup no doubt
Thank You Alan for entering at number
three we have Brandon a 34 inch ultra
wide from Dell on the
left and a 24 inch Acer on the right
with the cursor k70 and logitech g502
mouse on top of another white extended
mouse pad from glorious also on the desk
we have a pair of Logitech z6 23
speakers a blue Yeti Black Edition mic
and a super luxe HD 681 headset I've
said it before and I would say it again
having an ultra-wide next to a standard
monitor just doesn't seem effective not
only is it too wide but it takes up the
entire width of the desk almost to the
point where the speakers are in the way
I would much prefer having the smaller
display mounted on the top and having
the ultra white centered down below I
don't see any wires so I can't judge on
a cable management but as far as the PC
that's pushing all these pixels we have
a 4790k pair two gtx 980ti is inside the
fractal define our four case so the way
you hooked up the headphones won't make
sense going with a headphone hangar
under the desk so instead I would pick
up a simple hanger like this one and
hook it up to the back of your monitor
not only will it clean up your desk but
you won't end up scratching the surface
of the table or the headphones itself
but other than those minor tweaks this
is a pretty dope setup Thank You Brandon
for Internet next up we have Ethan with
a gold and white productivity setup
check this out guys we have an iMac on
top of a steel monitor riser which is
sandwiched by two Yamaha hs5 speakers
which are sitting on top of the RLX
acoustic pads on the ikea karlby
countertop we have the wireless Apple
Mouse keyboard and trackpad along with
the gold limited edition Presonus audio
box and gold smartphone stand from ela
go and finally off to the left side we
have a pair of white m50x is resting on
the just mobile headphone stand as
expected the cable management is
flawless all the cables are resting on
the Signum without any wires on the
ground I'm not too sure what's going on
with that curtain or blanket in the back
or even the cement wall it's kind of
creepy to be honest not knowing where
this setup is but overall it's a very
clean and OCD friendly setup Thank You
Ethan for entering last but not least we
have have feeds with a black and rainbow
setup so we have a 27-inch Q Knicks
monitor on top of a smart monitor stand
that has bill
the USB ports we also have a SteelSeries
apex M 800 keyboard with these sensei
Mouse and after the left side we have
his steel series apex headset resting on
a hanger it seems like someone's a huge
fan of Steel series that's for sure
we got the white ps4 underneath the
monitor with his two controllers on a
charging dock and a white snowball mic
hooked up to the newer arm the PC that's
powering the set up as a 6600 K which is
paired of the gigabyte GTX 970 inside
the NZXT Noctis 450 case I'm really
diggin those custom fan grills and back
plates from v1 Tech I keep using them
for my PC builds and they never
disappoint cable management on the other
hand is pretty clean we have a cable box
on the floor which is holding up the
power strip and the excess cables this
setup may seem cramped but at least
everything is neatly organized and
everything has its place a
well-put-together black and white theme
setup with no complaints think you have
feeds for entering so that is it for
