from tech source and in this video I'm
gonna tell you guys why you should
consider buying a curved monitor instead
of going flat but before that we're
gonna box this msi mag 27 CQ it's a
27-inch 1440p curved monitor with a 144
s refresh rate any one millisecond
response time msi is also giving out
five of these monitors to five
contestants as part of their tester
program for more information on how to
enter stick around to the end of the
video
so I'm going to go over three reasons
why you should pick a curved monitor
over a flat monitor reason number one
immersion it's no secret that a curved
display offers gamers an immersive
viewing experience with flat monitors
you look at the visual in a
two-dimensional way but with a curved
monitor the arc design both horizontally
and vertically makes whatever display on
the monitor into your peripheral vision
area which offers a wider viewing angle
hence you get a more realistic gaming
experience also if you're running a
multi-monitor setup you get that
seamless curvature compared to flat
displays reason number two comfort a
curved monitor helps reduce eye fatigue
for its curvature physically matches
your eye shape so your eyes tend to feel
more relieved when you're constantly
looking at the screen in short distance
MSI gaming monitors use curved display
panels that have the curvature rate of
1800 R which is the most comfortable and
suitable for a wide range of
applications from general computing to
gaming and last but not least it's more
affordable than you think a lot of
people think that just because the
monitor is curved it's more expensive
than flat gaming monitors however the
truth is curved monitors have become
more and more popular and prevalent in
the gaming market MSI for example has a
wide range of curved gaming monitor
options for people with all types of
budgets from attainable ones to premium
4k UHD monitors and even e-sports levels
g-sync monitors now then for the tester
program MSI is looking for a total of 20
individuals to unbox and review their
curved gaming monitor of course they get
to keep it afterwards out of that total
twenty people I get to pick five from
this channel if you're interested in
participating make sure to click the
link below and fill out the tester
program application I get to pick the
five most creative responses on how they
will unbox the monitor using this
eyeball mask and those five people will
receive the monitor from MSI so that
they can unbox and review it and post it
on their social media channel good luck
to whoever enters thanks for watching
and I'll see you guys around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
