the unlocking company comm hey guys
instead from tech source and we are at
the LG booth here and CES and it's safe
to say that LG has stolen the show this
year with some pretty cool announcements
like their LG G flex 2 smartphone
they're flexible curved TVs and the
world's first ultra wide 21 by nine
gaming monitor LG is notorious for their
innovative displays and this year is no
different
stepping up the game they have
introduced their first flexible curved
OLED 4k TV that you can control with a
remote we all know that curved TVs
provide an immersive experience whether
you are playing a game or watching a
movie
so a flexible curved TV gives you more
options when viewing TV the curved
option if you're watching a movie alone
or even playing a game by yourself and
you can also flatten the TV if you have
the family or guests around and the fact
that it's an OLED TV means you get
amazing viewing angles anyways LG did
announce this as one of their prototypes
so an ETA or retail price is currently
unknown LG also revealed their world's
first 98 inch
8k color prime Ultra HD TV and words
cannot express how amazing it looks in
person this is 16 times the resolution
of Full HD and that's just insane color
prime technology allows for a wider
spectrum of colors making it possible to
reproduce deeper and more dynamic colors
such as ocean blue emerald green and
richer reds you can see every bit of
detail in these images
unfortunately 8k content it's years away
I mean 4k content is barely available so
I doubt seeing any 8k content anytime
soon which makes this TV unnecessary
unless you have extra money to burn last
but not least which is also my favorite
product from LG this year is their
world's first 21 by 9 ultra wide gaming
monitor powered by free sync so this 34
inch monitor has a 2560 by 1080 p
display with a response time of 9.5 m/s
and it has an answer to screen tearing
with free sync technology powered by AMD
gamers will no longer experience screen
tearing without the usual lag and
latency it will also greatly reduce
input lag there isn't an ETA of
and this will be released or an estimate
price tag but I will definitely do a
review on it once I get one for myself
anyways that wraps up our coverage for
LG here at CES 2015 we did cover the G
flex 2 from LG as well in a separate
video which will be linked below if you
want to check that out we do have a few
more days here at CES so make sure you
guys stick around for more coverage on
awesome products this is at thumbtack
source and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
