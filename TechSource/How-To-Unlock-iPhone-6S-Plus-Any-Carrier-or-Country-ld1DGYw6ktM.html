I'm here to show you the process of
unlocking your iPhone 6s plus so you can
use it with any GSM carrier in the world
for this demonstration I will be using
my locked t-mobile iPhone 6s plus and I
lock it so I can use it on my eighteenth
network but it's the exact same process
for any carrier so first off we need to
get the unlock code to start the
unlocking process the place where I get
all my lock codes is the unlocking
company comm because they have the
cheapest prices online and I get my
codes much faster than other websites so
head on over to the locking company
comma select your phone manufacturer and
the phone model from the drop down list
and on the next page go ahead and select
the country the phone was originally
purchased from and the carrier of the
phone so in my case I purchased it in
the United States and the original
carrier is t-mobile before we continue
we do need the IMEI number of the iPhone
and the way you look that up on your
phone is to open up the dial pad and
enter in star pound zero six pound once
the phone displays the IMEI number you
have to go back on the website and enter
that in now once everything is filled
out select get a locking code and I'll
take you to the final screen where you
have to check out after checking out the
locking company will remotely unlock
your iPhone and the only thing you have
to do is finish the unlocking process so
here's what you have to do power off the
iPhone and remove the SIM tray which is
located on the right side then go ahead
and insert the SIM card you want to use
with the iPhone now I want to use the
iPhone on my 18 T Network so I'm putting
in my AT&amp;amp;T SIM card if your SIM card
does not fit you have to adjust the size
in order for it to work there is a link
down below to show you how that's done
once the SIM card is inside the phone go
ahead and power it back on once the
phone boots up you might get a SIM
invalid message which is perfectly fine
next step is to go ahead and plug in
your iPhone to your PC and open up
iTunes it will automatically ask you to
login using your Apple ID and password
so once you enter that in and click on
continue a message will pop up
congratulating you on unlocking your
iPhone so as you can see I'm using my
t-mobile iPhone 6s plus on my AT&amp;amp;T
network so that's how you unlock your
iPhone 6s plus for any GSM carrier in
the world if this video helped you guys

problems ask me in the comment section
down below and I'll answer you as soon
