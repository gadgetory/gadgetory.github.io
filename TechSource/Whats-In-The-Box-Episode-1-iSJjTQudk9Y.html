I'm very excited to announce my new
series on the channel called what's in
the box
why basically unbox stuff in front of
the camera but there is a twist I don't
know what's in these boxes I know I'm
getting some packages from a few
companies but I don't know when they're
sending them to me
so my excitement is real when I'm in
boxing these and you guys might be
wondering well I could just check out
the sender's address and figure out
where it's from but most of these
actually have person's name and then the
address for example this one says Chris
Baker from Texas I don't know who Chris
Baker is and I don't know what the hell
he's doing in Texas so yeah I don't know
what the items are in these boxes so
let's go and start and I forgot my
freaking knife again all right so let's
go ahead and start off with the small
package and then we will move our way up
to the bigger boxes so like I said
before guys these are all unmarked boxes
I don't know what's inside here so I'm
very excited to check these out so first
box and also let me know if you guys
enjoy this content this is something new
I'm doing so let me know in the comment
section down below if this is something
you want to see done on the channel so
first up whoa
we got Dominator Platinum's from coarser
these are the new ROG red edition let me
get actually open this up for you guys
so these are the Dominator platinum ROG
edition as you can see they are painted
red up top and then they got the ROG
logo there so DDR Ford is on 16 gigs ram
16 gigs of ram and already starting off
with a great episode Thank You chorus
representing Zen tea Zen
God I can't speak today these are gonna
be going on my test bench actually
so yeah very excited let's go ahead and
move on to the next biggest box which is
from FedEx let's see uh I don't even
open this up there we go hmm let's see
what the Chris Baker sending us from
Texas okay so looks like we have an AMD
processor alright so this is the AMD x4
845 CPU and I think I have a good idea
what's what's in that box or in that one
so it's gonna open it up a little quick
I'm finally glad to be working with AMD
so actually sending me a few processors
and I'm gonna be doing a video comparing
them and I think it's in this one
actually
oh I was right so is actually no I was
wrong
actually yes yes who is this so we got
the AMD FX 8350 with the new wrath
cooler pretty sweet and then two
additional CPUs from AMD
we got the c63 50 and the 83 70s so yeah
this is all going into one video I might
be separate videos I'm not sure and I'll
be doing a CPU comparison to kind of
figure out which gives you the best the
best bang for your buck so and now these
us to our final box if I got my AMD CPUs
there I don't know what's in here so
check this out
lots of packaging oh this is a cooler a
lot of PC parts this time so this is the
dark rock another dark rock Pro three
cooler from be quiet this is actually
going in the case review I received from
them like a few weeks ago so yeah I
think that's pretty much it so you got
some RAM sticks you got a cooler and we
got some processors
and that pretty much wraps up the video
I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did if
you want to see more of these unboxing
videos done every single week or maybe
once every two weeks make sure to leave
a like and let me know your feedback
down below because this is a new series
so I still have to tweak it and stuff
it's not perfect so don't bash on me
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
