hours I don't want to take pills what's
up guys it's ed back again from Texas
and welcome to setup wars episode 19
simple monitor Edition where I'll be
featuring only triple display setups for
this episode to try and change things up
a bit from the usual episodes but
anyways let me know how this goes by
leaving your feedback down below and
with that said you guys know what I'm
going to say let the set up Wars good
enough alrighty let the set up wars
begin
so GTA offers a bunch of really cheap
cd-keys for a bunch of games out there
including Windows seven and eight CD
Keys only for a fraction of the retail
price but I'm going to drop a link down
below if anyone is interested as always
all of the gear for the setups as well
as anything I recommend in this episode
will be linked down below for anyone
that is interested but here are your
five lucky contestants for this week
Alex Benedict Destry Eric and Yazzie the
congrats for making it into setup wars
episode 19 so first up is Alex wood is
beautiful and clean triple display setup
we have to a cert wente two inch
monitors sandwiching a Samsung 22 inch
display in the middle hooked up to the
mounted triple screen desk stand on the
desk we have the Logitech G 19 keyboard
and a trust GTX mouse on top of the
courser gaming mouse pad on the left
side of the desk we have the Plantronics
game con 788 headset and some LED strips
to spice up your setup superb job with
cable management I couldn't have done it
any better however the orange cables
from the headset and mouse movie throw
off your black and purple theme I also
like how you built a custom PC inside an
iMac tower that's definitely something I
haven't seen before on the show but
other than picking up a headset stand I
say that you have an extremely clean
triple display setup thank you Alex for
entering Benedick cucumber is next up
with two setups but for my sanity's sake
I will focus on the triple displays for
now so we have three Samsung 32-inch
monitors on the desk and we have the
Logitech G 19 keyboard and a Mad Catz
rat gaming mouse or I should say three
Mad Catz gaming mice because why not
so the other setup has to 32 inches
Apple Cinema displays a G 15 keyboard
and another Mad Catz Mouse this is
obviously a Productivity type setup and
like most productivity setups the wire
management is great
oh my heart
alright so Kayla management aside I have
to say that you have a monster
productivity types set up check this out
guys this PC is not only running an
Intel Xeon 12 core processor but he has
two of those in his PC for a total of 24
chords that's just ridiculous
on top of that he's running three Titans
II Black Edition graphics cards in a
custom loop I can now see why the cables
are how they are it's probably not worth
your time to fix it up
but anyways killers that I've been at
the cucumber thank you so much for
entering setup wars and number three we
have Destry with 324 inch asus monitors
hooked up to the Ergo tech monitor stand
and on the desk we have the logitech
solar power keyboard and a g502 gaming
mouse on the razer Kabuto mousepad also
on the desk we have a nice collection of
Xbox and PlayStation controllers both
companion 20 speakers and a bose
soundlink mini speaker on the edge of
the desk we have the audio technica m50x
azan the sine Heiser headphone hanger
cable management can definitely be
improved with some zip ties 3m tape and
a surge protector every time I see a
messy cable management like this I refer
them to my desk setup because in that
video I go over a really great way to
clean that up so definitely check that
out if you haven't already plus one on
the mini-fridge down there and also
another plus one on using the ROS will
arm to hold up your 27-inch iMac to the
side I also see a USB hub on the desk
which is a great way if you have
multiple devices to charge or even
connect to your PC conveniently I do
gotta say that there are a lot of
unnecessary stuff on the desk like the
UI system the controllers in that extra
Mouse what I would do is maybe move the
Bose speaker under the Center monitor
and clean up the controllers and maybe
put them in a drawer or something but
that's just me you have a potentially
great setup Destry once you clean up a
few things
but regardless thank you for entering
Erica's next up with three LG 23 inch
monitors on yet another ergo tech
monitor stand on the desk we have the
corsair k70 keyboard and razor mama
mouse on the left side of desk we have
the number one console the PlayStation 4
of course along with the PlayStation
charge
duck and a pair of astro a40 s mounted
on a wall hanger this is a true gaming
setup I'm digging the dxracer chair red
LEDs and did a splendid job on cable
management
well done routing the cables along the
arm and under the desk powering all of
these displays is his custom PC rocking
an Intel 4790 and a GTX 970 honestly job
well done he really impressed me with
your cable management skills I give you
set up a solid two thumbs up last but
not least we have Yazeed and holy mother
of everything black and red now this is
my kind of setup this is how a black and
red setup is done
very impressive Yazeed so we have three
asus 27-inch rog swift monitors a
corsair k70 keyboard raptor m40 mouse on
the extended mousepad from x co which
actually was using previously before i
swapped it out to something more cleaner
we also have a pair of JBL speakers on
the desk and also a dxracer to complete
a set up cable management is fantastic
and I really like how you wrap them
around the monitor mounts to keep them
from touching the table I just can't get
over this beautiful setup I mean
everything from the symmetry to the LEDs
and even the custom black and red PC you
have is absolutely brilliant he actually
sent me a picture of what his setup
looked like before and it's really
inspiring to see how much he has
improved in the three years your hard
work and dedication definitely paid off
