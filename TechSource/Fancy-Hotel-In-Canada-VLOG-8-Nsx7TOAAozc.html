the mail the dream set apart in Canada
starts at 7 p.m. and right now it's
12:30 too so I'm waiting on the go with
the sponsors see if you can get me a
ticket and a flight to Canada before the
party starts let's see what happens just
got confirmation from LG we're going to
Canada baby so we got 30 minutes to pack
before we rush to the airport I'm gonna
be packing lightly only other things
they need LG laptop some clothes power
bank wall charger of course I gotta take
my 50 X's got out some deodorant and
body spray I've had our two just in case
I get bored on the flight and lastly
this wireless mouse I picked up for like
5 bucks
alright so finish packing mom is waiting
on Brianne to finish her pampering and
then we're gonna call it uber go to the
airport and then the fun begins it's
actually my first time flying out of the
country actually that's not true first
time I flew to the u.s. from Moscow
Russia was when I was like 2 or 3 so I
don't really remember a trip this is
actually my first wheel flight that I'm
actually excited
uber drivers here still waiting on
Brianne she always does this
we've got our boarding pass at security
now we're waiting at the lounging area I
guess
and so our flight gets called in right
now we got about 40 minutes before our
flight 32 bucks for two burgers two
cokes and a cup of french fries
Airport food
Meeta too dramatic about a digit code

in the mirror that looks pretty badass
I'm not gonna lie Thank You LG for
hooking this up
just go back from the dream set a party
LG definitely knows how to throw a party
chatter you guys awesome job
we went downstairs afterwards to the bar
at the Fairmont Fairmont Hotel had a few
extra drinks I'm not gonna lie I'm a
little tipsy now go back at the hotel
I'm gonna chill and then get on our
flight tomorrow morning at one o'clock
our flights out one o'clock so I'm gonna
book it go back to California such a
short trip but definitely worth it I'll
see you guys in the morning

time to check out and head back home
hello turkey now yes

chicken teriyaki is here fishing Jim Ida
tuna for Marty tells not able up her
friend not to farm these functions
pleaser divided
I saw back at the headquarters as you
can see as past 12 hours has definitely
been the craziest from getting my
passport the last minute and an LG
rushing me to the dream set a party it's
been just it's been a crazy experience
for sure Kara was awesome definitely
want to go back there during the summer
and really explore the place because I
haven't had really a chance to step
outside the hotel but from what I've
seen it's a beautiful country and I
cannot wait to go back I'm sorry I
didn't get any footage of the dream set
a party the sony mark 4 i've been using
to record my vlogs actually died as soon
as we got to the hotel so that's why i
didn't bring it with me to the party but
lewis was there austin dom from mac
mixing and the Linus crews there too
really an awesome party huge thanks to
LG for bringing me out there you guys
are the best
anyways I'm gonna go ahead and end this
vlog thank you guys so much for watching
I know this is probably the longest vlog
I've done just because I I
cramped up the entire two days into one
vlog but anyways guys so much for
watching again if you guys enjoyed use

gonna get back to work I'll see you guys
