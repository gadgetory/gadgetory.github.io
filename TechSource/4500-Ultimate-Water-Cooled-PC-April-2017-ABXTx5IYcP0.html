all been waiting for the completion of
Electra box my first water-cooled custom
PC on tech source now if you guys have
been following the build log at all then
you know how much sweat and tears and
suffering went into building this thing
but alas after four months seriously
almost four months it's finally complete
when I started the build originally the
77 GK and GTX 1080p I would not even
announce hence why I was stuck with the
6700 K and 2 GTX 1080s in SLI I do want
to give a huge thanks to mod my mods for
supplying me with all the alpha cool
water cooling parts because honestly
without their support this build would
not even be possible I'll go to drop a
link to their website down below they
pretty much have everything you possibly
need for any water-cooled PC and also as
the thanks are actually given six
percent off their entire website using
the code text source I believe and I'll
leave that down below as well also
they're actually doing a giveaway on
their anti-static maps that I've been
using for this build since the beginning
and all you guys have to do is let me
know the comments section if you're
interested in winning that and I'll
randomly picks the one next week but
anyways back to the build so we also got
16 gigs of Triton Z RAM sticks from
g.skill which go beautifully with the
build and the EVGA z170 FTW classified k
motherboard since i'm going to get rid
of this pc i didn't put much storage on
here other than a 500 gigabyte SSD just
so I can run some benchmarks on it
powering this beast is a 1,000 watt
power supply from EVGA and the case that
I went with was the Lian Li PCO 9 which
may seem like a giant case but honestly
I had a lot of clearance issues I wasn't
able to fit a second radiator in here
and I had issues installing the first
three sixty millimeter rad that I
received unfortunately I was forced to
go with a single rad but had to switch
to a different design so it would fit in
the top neo Sesay I wouldn't recommend
this case for water cooling with the
giant footprint I expected lots of room
to work with but sadly this wasn't the
case I did do some slide model the PC as
well I used some black electrical tape
to cover up all the ugly blue alpha cool
logos that were on the GPU blocks the
pump bracket and
even the radiator itself of course I had
to put in the usual boss ass looking
back plates for my boys at v1 Tech and
they're also kind enough to throw in a
few grills to cover up the fans as you
can see I kind of stayed consistent with
the Nvidia claw overall the build came
out beautiful and I'm 100% satisfied I
mean I'd rather take a few extra months
to make my first ever water-cooled PC
turned out perfect rather than make a
water-cooled PC that not only doesn't
turn on but also leaks just saying I was
want to give a huge shout out to
insource mods for being so clutch and
sending me these amazing custom cables
literally one day after I ran into some
issues with the ones I was originally
using that's definitely the last time
I'm working with a small cable company I
mean the frustration had to go through
was just if you guys are into cable porn
or just looking at some really sick
modded PCs make sure to follow Joey at
in source mods I'll leave this Instagram
account somewhere on the screen and also
link below check him out guys so despite
having only one radiator the temps are
actually not that bad I even overclocked
my 6700 K to 4.6 gigahertz at 1.3 5
volts and it barely hit 44 degrees on
max load so everyone that's been
grilling me about temps you can calm
down now same goes with the GPU the top
one maxing out at 49 degrees while the
bottom one maxes out at 46 and just to
give you guys a comparison these cards
hit up to 80 degrees on their stock fans
could I have gone better temps using a
second radiator absolutely but honestly
my position I'm not complaining it's
kind of pointless benchmarking this PC
since you can already tell how it would
perform but let's just say I was able to
run almost every game in 4k resolution
maxed out like butter and I'm talking
about that vegan butter that doesn't
have to be in the freezer getting frames
well over 60 with no stutter or lag this
machine is a beast so now that I know
how to build a water-cooled PC you guys
can expect more of these and then your
future hopefully you won't take months
to complete so if you excited and want
to see more make sure to leave a like
and let me know what color scheme you
guys want to check out or want to see in
my next water cool project let me know
in the comments section below as always
we give huge thanks to everyone who made
this video possible drop a link to all
the parts used in the build below I love
you guys I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
