and welcome to another episode of what's
in the box the reason why I'm smiling so
big is because I have a very special box
again with that word special but I have
a very special box on the side it's too
long to fit on this desk so again I'm
saving the best for last but I can't
waste any time let's go and drop into
some fan mail and it will unbox the rest
of these and it will get on to the main
event also I'm using a new level ear mic
I don't know you guys can tell from that
distance but hopefully the audio sounds
a lot better than before I have an
editor video so I can tell just yet but
hopefully it does if there's another
unboxing knife in here I swear I'm gonna
come up with a new series called name
that knife because it's gonna get out of
hand
another beautifully wrapped package
let's check this one out hey ed I hope
you enjoy your gift from Mario Perez
Maya Perez I love your face let's check
it out dude
is this a kingdom or it's two shirt it
is a kingdom hearts 2 shirt I freaking
love this game I'm guessing you've seen
my ask me video because in there I've
actually answered someone's question
that this is my favorite game of all
time holy crap
dude thank you so much this thing is
sick and here come the cops I can't wait
to move out of here
Mario dude thank you so much I'm
definitely gonna wear this for my next
episode I promise you this this thing is
insane thank you so much for the gift we
do have a few letters so let's go and
open these up will quick we've got more
RAM sticks hi ed my name is Anton and I
love your videos keep on doing them
you're really inspirational and I like
watching you greetings from Sweden by
the way here's to RAM sticks that are
useless man it's so fun to troll you
thank you thank you very much I will
cherish these RAM sticks I'm gonna get
these laminated maybe put them on my
setup or something all seriousness thank
you so much for setting decent
Ram sticks why not have a dead GPU or
dead motherboard Wi-Fi RAM sticks well
this was kind of useless this one's some
sort of a newsletter nothing important
so this one's a pretty long letter from
limes Gaming looks like he has a
question about his desk setup so I'll go
in and answer this question and get back
to you on Twitter thank you for sending
this in so this is the last fan mail for
this episode and I will get to the boxes
afterwards guys again if you want to
send me stuff the PIO box is linked down
below thank you guys again so much it
really means a lot to me Game of Thrones
coasters I wonder if I have this one
already cuz I am rocking a game of
Thrones a Targaryen coaster for my
current setup so let me see oh these are
new I've never seen these before oh wow
looks like these are all of the Narus
Daenerys is did I say that right but
these look pretty sick all four
different coasters I'm definitely gonna
use these in the living room coffee
table thank you so much dude is there a
name for this oh it looks like there is
a note here Adam thank you so much for
sending these and it's actually a little
questionnaire question on your $1500
build why do the PCIe drive as why did
you put in a pci drive as well as two
SSDs in raid 0 that's just the
configuration the person wanted it the
build was for a subscriber of mine so
that is why I built it that way so I do
high-end builds for subscribers if they
send me an email usually anything over
$4,000 I would build on a custom PC
custom paint job all the height and
stuff but if you guys are interested
shooting an email but that is what the
configuration he wanted so that is what
we went with so that is it for the fan
mail thank you guys again if you sent me
something honestly these make my day
it's one of the reasons why I love doing
what's in the box but let's move on to
the other stuff so we've got quite a few
goodies from anchor dot-com looks like
we got some screen shields we got some
power banks we got some bumper cases for
the new iPhone 7 and 7 plus it looks
like they're doing cases now so if you
guys want to check them out I'll drop a
link to it down below
they even have a dashboard mount whoa
looks like anchor is venturing off into
other things very nice Thank You anchor
for setting this and hopefully I'll do a
video on these sometime soon so it looks
like this is lenovo's a new wireless
touch mouse and the yoga mouse which by
the way won a CES Innovation Award of
2016 let's check this thing out looks
pretty sick whoa is this seriously a
mouse check this out guys this is a very
oh well I guess you can fold it and then
it becomes flat check this out guys and
then you can fold it again and it
becomes a mouse so it looks like you
guys can hook this up via bluetooth or
with the receiver that was that came
inside the mouse I've hooked it up to my
laptop let's check out and see how
accurate this really is all right so now
that I got this thing charged let's
check it out and see how well that
actually performs it's actually very
accurate surprisingly I'm not even using
a mouse pad and I'm using it on a glossy
surface so it's it's very responsive
there is no lag so far it's very
accurate oh that's really cool the
middle button which is actually a
Windows logo opens up the Start menu so
that's pretty cool but the downside is
that you don't have a middle mouse
button unfortunately so that kind of
sucks I'm not gonna lie this is a really
cool Mouse it's 60 bucks so it's kind of
steep but honestly this will be perfect
for travel just fold it up doesn't take
up much space pop pop it in your pocket
or laptop bag and you're pretty much
good to go so yeah this thing is pretty
sick if you guys are interested in
checking this out I'll drop a link to it
down below but I'll probably make a
video on this later on - if you guys are
interested but in the meantime I will
leave a link down below if you want to
check it out all right so this next box
is from NZXT it looks like they came up
with some new products let's check it
out and see what they sent me
oh man this is such a beautiful sight
check this out guys they got the NZXT X
52 and the X 62 CPU coolers we also got
some other goodies guys we have a triple
pack of their new 120 millimeter
coloured ring fans I also have the
hundred forty millimeter version of
course and two different types of color
to trim for their fans I'm very psyched
to check this out specifically the
cooler is actually because these have
some pretty cool effects on here of
course they are LED as well RGB LED to
be exact but can I wait to put these in
build Thank You NZXT so much for sending
these in so we got one more box guys
before we get on to the main event of
this evening this one's from MSI and it
kind of looks like I don't even know
what it is it's it's too big for to be a
GPU and it's too small to be a laptop
but I don't know let's let's check it
out oh the picture is right on the box
so looks like this is their Trident ah
looks like it's some sort of a gaming PC
if I'm gonna guess here it says gaming
desktop I need to read I need to read
these things boom this thing looks sick
it looks uh it's small enough to be a
console kind of minds me of the UH I was
gonna say Xbox one but looks nothing
like the Xbox one okay looks like this
is the vertical stand I'm assuming oh
look at that that is the mafia 3 edition
this looks sick what kind of a graphics
card is that got a 1080 in there how
does this thing even work oh just like
that well that looks pretty that looks
pretty sick much cooler than the ps4 I
think I don't know about this whole
mafia 3 graphic thing here but the
design itself looks pretty sick actually
I'll definitely love the the angles here
futuristic look got some ports in the
front USB 3 USB C HD
my oh holy crap there's more ports in
the back here if you have another
display for it HDMI crap ton of USB so
yeah this is a very portable very cool
looking console I can't call I said
console you're an idiot
very cool looking PC I can't wait to
check this out do some benchmarking
figure out what kind of specs are even
in here
I'm sure msi sent me something I haven't
even checked the email but yeah let me
know what you guys want to see here
maybe I should do a comparison to the
ps4 or Xbox one is that something you
guys want to see with this if so let me
know in the comment section alright guys
it's time to get serious now
I'm gonna be unboxing something that
we've been all waiting for I've been
waiting for I'm sure a lot of you guys
have been asking for constantly every
single day I see the comments I see the
tweets I see the email so it is time
it's time to take tech source to the
next level and whatever's in that box is
gonna make it happen yeah it's gonna be
too heavy one sec a very special care
package from mod my mods thank you guys

honestly so psyched to do this I'm gonna
stop talking let's just let's just dive
in my not just broke familiar faces worn
out places oh my god I thought I broke
