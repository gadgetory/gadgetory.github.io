welcome to another episode of what's in
the box now obviously I lied about the
last episode being the final episode
here in this apartment but I did not
expect to get this many boxes within
like two days so obviously I have to
finish these up before I move and also
before I begin the episode guys I want
to address something that I've been
reading in the comment section of the
last episode so it's come to my
attention that some people think that
I'm ungrateful for getting these
packages and products from companies now
obviously my longtime subscribers have
been watching me from the beginning and
the earlier episodes of what's in the
box you guys already know that that's
not the case it's more of the new
subscribers that are joining in and
watching the more recent episodes of
what's in a box now I know that actions
speak louder than words
so obviously if I grab something and
throw up halfway across the room that
kind of comes off as rude and being
ungrateful but that is not the case guys
I'm always thankful of everything I get
on this channel guys whether it's from
companies that are sending in products
for me to check out or whether it's you
guys sending in gifts or even letters to
read I truly appreciate everything even
though I don't say this as much in front
of the camera I'm very thankful for God
for giving me the ability to do this
every single day this is my dream job
guys I mean I am so grateful to be in
this position honestly having amazing
subscribers like you guys watching my
content and I think companies send me
boxes like these every week I mean
seriously I am like the happiest guy
ever so the reason why I throw boxes
across the room it's because of
entertainment reasons now I don't
doesn't really make sense to most of you
guys but let me give an example
what is more entertaining grabbing this
and gently placing it on the floor or
this obviously I knew what was inside
there I know it's not going to break
that's why I tossed it but you guys kind
of get the idea what I'm trying to make
here but anyways I'm not trying to make
any excuses I will try and be more
appreciative on camera just to not
offend anybody that's watching the
channel because I do appreciate your
feedback and obviously if you guys don't
like the stuff that I do I will do my
best to try and work around it but
anyways I love reading your comments
honestly continue to let me know your
feedback in the comment section whether
things you like whether things you
like and I'll do my best to change it
for future videos alright so with that
said let me go get that package and
begin unboxing alright so we don't have
any letters this time so we're going to
go straight into the package and
vaccines so about 95 percent of these
boxes are PC parts and they're going to
be part of my PC build for July I'm
going to be doing two builds hopefully I
have enough time to do it but let's see
so this is from scud USA I'm not sure
what this is let's go ahead and open
this up I'm guessing this is a brand
that's sending you other products for me
to check out so let's shake your down
whoa what the heck oh so this is a
charger for the echo dot the Amazon echo
dot so instead of plugging the echo dot
straight to a wall you can put it on
this and it's going to charge the device
and you can take it with you wherever
you want so basically this charging hub
makes the echo dot portable that is
pretty cool so this portion plugs in
here and the microUSB portion connects
to the back of the echo dot that is
pretty cool it's called fremo I'll drop
a link below if you guys want to check
it out thank you guys so much for
sending this out alright moving on let's
open up these small ones first
speaking of the echo dot they sent this
to me and I guess to use with the
charging app so again I want to thank
fremo for setting is in I'm not thinking
a future this and my cool tech for
August I promise you that
alright a few more tiny boxes and then
we get into the good stuff oh-ho we got
some courser fans so yeah guys in case
you have noticed courser is definitely
one of the sponsors for the pc build I'm
doing for this month huge thanks to you
guys out there for sending these parts
and honestly with that view
most of my bills we're not will not even
be possible you guys make it happen I
love you guys so much thank you
this one's BHO I think this is cable mod
this cable mod I love cable mod so much
these guys at cable mod have come such a
long way before when they started out I
did not like their products the quality
check was not great but they have
honestly stepped up the game and that is
why I'm using cable mods for most of my
bills now you got some white and silver
sleeving over here we got some silver
some screws for the case got some RGB
LEDs of course and in here we got memory
modding kits for the dominator
Platinum's I'm going to be using the
white color and it's going to look
really nice with the silver heat
spreader on a Corsair platinum so very
stoked to be modding the RAM sticks on
my bill thank you so much cable mod for
sending use then honestly your cables
are some of the best out there and that
is why I keep coming back to you
so Thomas if you're watching thank you I
love to one more final package and then
we can move on to the other stuff
actually there's one more tiny box up
here but we're getting these let me do
this pretty quickly I think I know what
this one is this is from my boyhood son
from v1 tech I love your product I love
the custom work that you guys do you
guys are probably sick of me talking
about v1 tech but I pretty much use most
of their products and almost every
single one of my high-end builds the
tacky Jing is always incredible are you
guys ready for this should I reveal then
fangirls in the back plates on camera
right now why not why not how much show
you guys a fire sli bridge real quick
one eternity later ok that took a while
to peel off normally they don't come
with these stickers on top of it but I
guess that's something new that they're
doing and that's cool check out this
dope msi custom sli bridge that i'm
gonna be using for the build guys how
sexy does this thing look seriously I'll
show you guys one back plate I'm not
going to show you the fangirls you guys
we're just gonna have to wait for the
video but let me peel this damn thing
off and I'll show you one god damn you
you guys never cease to amaze me check
this backplate out guys that is sick now
that is how you do a custom backplate
honestly I feel like your back plates
I've gotten better as well all of its
different material you guys are using
but these look freakin amazing
the precision on these honestly the
cutting the details is perfect obviously
I got some fangirls as well I don't know
if I'll use them but I got them just in
case it all depends on how the build
turns out near the end but again thank
you so much Hassan at v1 Tech for
sending then you guys are always killing
it in the custom game thank you guys so
much
alright moving out go candy headphones
these are the crusher wireless
headphones from skull candy I'm supposed
to do a video on this so you guys might
see it at the end of the video sometime
on the channel then you guys so much for
setting this then I can't wait to check
it out
let's open next oh my god I'm so excited
it's like Christmas morning for me right
now you got none other than the courser
h100 IV - this is personally my favorite
CPU cooler right now in the market it's
a little on the pricey side but honestly
does a phenomenal job keeping temps low
I can overclock the crap out of CPU
that's super quiet I means anything else
to say really Corsair you guys do
amazing job thank you again for setting
this end I can't wait we've got the GPU
for one of the build this is the msi
armored GT X 1080 PI or ti whatever okay
I know it's called ti I don't know why I
thought it was called tyne at one video
but this is the armor OC version which
means it's the black and white color
scheme obviously at this point I'm sure
you guys already know the color scheme
I'm going with on one of the builds it's
going to be actually going to be black
and white with silver accents it's going
to look really sick I promise you guys
have I ever let you guys down when it
comes to PC builds so this is the
motherboard I'm going to be using for
one of my other bills that's coming up I
think this is going to be the first
build on a channel unfortunately the
other one might have to get pushed for
August but we will see how timing is
because right now is a bit crazy here at
the headquarters but I go with this
motherboard so many times if you're
going with the rising build by the way
this is one of the best boards you can
buy for the money for 80 bucks you get
so much more compared to other
motherboards within the same price point
so I think it's like the third one I've
bought and by the way I bought this with
my own money
but anyways I'm done rambling I wasn't a
huge fan of asrock before but recently
they've been killing it in the
motherboard game so continue to do what
you guys do at as well thank you for
making some boss ass motherboards
so this one's from Amazon I'm not sure
what on earth is in here that's why it's
called what's in a box
duh I don't know what is in most of
these boxes it looks like we got more
sigue tribes we got two four terabytes
Barracuda from sea gates oh this is the
Intel obtained memory stick that I'm
going to be plugging into one of my
upcoming builds
basically the idea behind this is I'm
going to combine this with one of these
hard drives and it's going to give me
very fast speeds compared to SSDs it's
not faster than as these and the point
of this is to give you guys more value
this combined with the hard drive
you guys will actually be saving a lot
more money any beginning speeds as fast
as SSDs and that's kind of what I'm
trying to prove in my upcoming video but
anyways more info on that once the video
launches of course I think we are
halfway done I feel like a bit unboxing
for days
got another coarser h100 v2 cpu cooler
and in here ladies and gentlemen if I
can get this damn thing open how do they
bag this damn thing got the one and only
I 970 900 x10 core processor from Intel
that I pretty much revealed the
processor I'm using in the build
obviously it is a high-end build and had
to go with the new skylake X platform so
obviously as you get the best of the
best and currently that's what the best
one is right now unfortunately the 12
core processor is not available just yet
but if it does get out I'll definitely
do a build on that as well why we got to
this is the second gtx 1080i for the
build here's the thing msi sent me one
and they couldn't send me a second one
because they were out of stock so I'm
like well what's more badass one gtx
980ti or two gtx 980ti so so yeah i'm
sure a lot of you guys already deduced
earlier by looking at that celebra gen I
am going to be using two GPUs but both
of em aside the armor series 1080p I I
got to go all out if I'm not going all
out it is not a tech source build you
guys know that already and this is the
memory for the build we've got an MDOT
to 480 gigabytes from corsair the MP 500
and then we got a single line 60
gigabyte SSD from the force LS series
three more boxes left
I'm not a package from Corsair I think I
know what this is actually I have no
idea let's check out oh my god yes oh
hello taught me smile thing
how do I keep dropping things but here
we go guys 64 gigs of RAM the Dominator
Platinum's of course one of the speed on
these so these are thirty two hundred
megahertz and I believe there are eight
sticks of eight gigs of RAM so it's
going to occupy all eight slots up the
motherboard I think I got all the parts
already I'm not sure what the rest of
the stuff here is for what else am I
missing I'm missing a power supply and
motherboard okay there's a FedEx
envelope and some of the ports in here
all right so we got a samsung 960 Pro m2
SSD this is the 520 521 512 gigabyte
version I like one 521 so yeah this is
going to be the memory of one of the
builds this is for the second build guys
you got a power supply from Seagate this
is a modular version this is the most
affordable when you can buy that's also
brown certified and it's fully modular
because I'm going to be doing a mini ITX
build obviously I don't like all the
cables so that is why I picked this
power supply from C sonic and the GP we
are using is the nitrile plus rx 580
from sapphire the overclock the crap
editors so that is one of the reasons
why it went with this one yeah Thank You
Sal for sending this thing last but not
least we got a lot of bad baggage
package from MSI
oh okay so technically I'm not supposed
to show this on camera because it is
under NDA until Friday so if you guys if
this is not blurred that means it's
passed on the a and I can show this but
this is emphasized new X 299 X power
gaming motherboard it's a very high-end
X 299 chipset motherboard hmm yes ahead
wow this thing is heavy
take a look at this beauty I don't know
what the heck this is but it definitely
looks cool as the ly matters but it's
cool it's got some great slash silver
accents I think it's going to go really
well with the black and white with
silver accents build I'm going with it's
got a really interesting looking m dot
to shield without first whoa like a
transformer thing here this is crazy
it's got four PCI slots eight DIMM slots
I mean this is seriously the ultimate
motherboard how many ends out two straws
is missing have one two three is
everything the back definitely can't
wait to test out the overclocking
features of this as well as dual buildin
and thank you so much I'm aside and
Corsair honestly for sitting this person
you guys always work so close with me
make these builds possible on the
channel that is why I'm wearing one of
the shirts by the way you guys are
awesome thank you so much for your
support I cannot thank you guys enough
so definitely my wraps up the video hope
you guys enjoyed it the case I'm using
is actually down there there's no space
for me to bring it up here but is the
coarser 570 X crystal Newegg exclusive
PC case it's only available on Newegg
it's I looked at it I'm like I had to
have this but anyways I'll put a picture
of it somewhere on here you guys when I
check it out you guys interrelate what's
in the box series make sure to leave a
like to show your support if you didn't
like it feel free to dislike as well
