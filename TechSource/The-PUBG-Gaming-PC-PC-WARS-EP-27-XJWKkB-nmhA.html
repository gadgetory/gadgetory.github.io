welcome to PC Wars I've officially
relaunched the series so if you guys
want to participate and have a dope
looking a custom PC make sure to watch
the video linked below
with that said let the set that's what I
say let them set up words let the PC war
as it begin
the first two bills are from quarry and
since I haven't done any episodes in a
while his crazy custom pcs that he
submitted has been piling up in my
folder so with that said let's take a
look at project pirates which is a
Pirates of the Caribbean themed PC
it's built inside the tower 900 from
thermaltake and it's packing the 7700
carry and a single Asus GTX 1060 but the
start of the show is obviously the
custom modification of the case itself
the attention to detail is something
I've grown accustomed to from Cory's
previous build the chains hanging from
the top of the case to each individual
suckers on the tentacles and just the
overall paint job of the case really
gives it that rusty buried treasure vibe
that fits perfectly with the theme the
actual parts of the PC aren't modded
aside from the backplate from what I can
tell which kind of distracts me from the
rest of the build but this is definitely
a masterpiece I can see why he went with
black and blue cables but honestly
they'll stick out to me the most I think
that a mix of brown and beige colors
would have blended with the build even
better but overall a fantastic job as
always thank you Cory for submitting
this PC
now if you thought the last build was
one of the coolest pieces you've ever
seen well you haven't checked out the
pub GPC that's why guys APC built with a
player unknowns battlegrounds theme in
fact most of the PC is actually the
cosmetic work you can barely see the
rest of the components if I didn't tell
you this was a computer you probably
wouldn't have noticed it's packing the I
580 600 K 16 gigs of ram from a pacer
and 2 NVIDIA GTX 1080s and sli I don't
know where to start on this build
I thought the attention to detail on the
last PC was insane but this one takes it
to the next level just look at the
detail of the furniture they built a
table with a pad on top then we got the
red bricks on the wall which have a very
realistic texture on them and even the
hard line tubing has a rusty look to it
that resembles old pipes beautiful work
from quarry and the GeForce garage I
didn't expect anything less from those
guys knocking down the fire level a
little bit we have project Z on which is
a beautiful white and red custom loop PC
now the parts may be a little outdated
since he's rocking the e5 1660 Xeon
processor and a GTX 780 Ti but damn does
this look awesome some custom mods
include a custom painted backplate we
got the custom made power supply cover
custom painted front grille of the case
and custom made bracket to hold the
reservoir and pump I gotta say the color
contrast in this build is perfectly
balanced the red is being used like an
accent color inside the case while there
is more white but that's easily balanced
with the red case if I'm being really
anal and critical some of the bends
aren't perfect but I do have to give you
props on that crazy loop that you made
near the bottom I'm sure that was harder
to pull off but thank you very much
custom gtp for entering Eric is up next
with a very clean hardline build
featuring more darker and neutral colors
he's calling the build adamantium you
know the stuff that Wolverine claws are
made out of it's packing the i7 6800 K
which is overclocked at 4 gigahertz we
got 32 gigs of ram and a gtx 1080
founders edition i gotta say it's very
refreshing to see a bill like this
something that is impact with RGB lights
or LED fans that you see in pretty much
every single build it straight to the
point very clean and aesthetically
pleasing to look at
the bands are done very well and I just
love the overall theme of the build some
of the custom mods include a custom
built and painted PSU shroud by him we
also got a custom reservoir mounting
plate to hide the drivetrain mounting
holes and some more custom paint jobs on
the front and the top grills with the
dust covers very very clean PC and
excellent choices on the parts
Thank You Erik for entering last but not
least we have hamster teacher and his PC
that is calling white cube at first
glance it definitely looks very cramped
and also what's up with the sli bridge
just hanging from the GPU I mean what's
the point of that if you don't have
another GPU it's packing a 4790k that's
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz and the
galaxy gtx 980ti hall-of-fame graphics
card the pc also has 24 gigs of ram two
sticks of eight and two sticks of four
so there's that one thing I really like
about the build is the CPU block and the
reservoir it actually looks really cool
when it's turned on and glowing white
regardless of the few minor gripes I
have with a PC I think it actually looks
pretty cool Thank You hamster for
entering so before I end this video I do
want to give a huge thanks to Skillshare
