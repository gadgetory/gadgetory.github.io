interesting unboxing experience here on
Tech source on the table we have some
goodies as you can tell we have when the
latest generation Z 170 motherboards
from Asus some vdr for ram from corsair
with a new airflow feature and lastly
this mysterious box from Intel which I
have no idea what's inside so just out
of curiosity let's go ahead and start
with the mysterious Intel Box Master
System
it looks like a retro themed box
something straight out of the 80s on the
side of the box it appears to have some
of the games highlighted and it really
reminds me of the time where I got my
first original Nintendo system I
specially like the last game office hero
sometimes the best way to unwind after a
day at the office his with a day at the
office I gotta say that Intel has a
sense of humor alright so let's go ahead
and continue on with the unboxing
opening up the flap we are greeted with
the Master System that's a plastic cover
with a wooden style finish for the base
it appears to have two latches on the
front and popping those open we are
immediately greeted with some sort of a
control panel with a message that says
experience what's inside until has
definitely put some thought into this it
appears to be some sort of a puzzle
we're hitting the right notes will
unlock the cover it will display which
notes aren't correct by lighting it up
in red and after many attempts I finally
managed to get it right
so there it is ladies and gentleman
laying neatly inside one of the newest
generation Intel Core processors popping
this tiny box open we are greeted by the
one and only i7 6700 K processor and is
surprisingly smaller than I would have
imagined this is a quad core LGA 1151
socket CPU with a clock speed of 4.0
gigahertz that features an integrated HD
graphics 530 chip the processor will
also give you up to 16 PCIe lanes but
I'm definitely curious how well
overclocks and I might be doing a build
with it soon but for those of you that
are interested in checking out the
processor for yourself I'll go and drop
it link down below so there appears to
be a second layer underneath until has
also included their amazing 750 SSDs
which is a PCIe based solid-state drive
and you can get speeds of up to 2200
read and 900 write that's insane
let's go ahead and move on to the other
two parts I received starting off with
the RAM sticks so this is the new
Corsair Vengeance airflow ddr4 Ram
sticks and we have four sticks of four
gigabyte each with a memory clock speed
of 32 hundred megahertz opening up the
boxes we can see the included fans and
the sticks of RAM these are extremely
fast Ram sticks and I cannot wait to
test them out so underneath the flap are
two additional colored brackets that you
can install if you want to go with a
color to match your build and we do have
blue and silver with the red already
installed by default so the idea behind
this fan is to cool your RAM sticks for
extreme overclocking and I'll go ahead
and show you what it looks like when
it's installed later in this video last
but not least we have the amazing asus
z170 deluxe motherboard the latest
generation boards compatible with the
new six generation skylake processors
this motherboard comes with a ton of
awesome features like five-way
optimization turbo land crystal sound 3
and more but if you guys want to see a
full review of this board be sure to let
me know in the comments section so this
motherboard has 4 RAM slots that
supports up to 64 gigabytes of ddr4
memory on a dual channel with speeds of
up to 34 66 megahertz
it also features 3 PCI Express 3.0 slots
and 4 pcie 2.0 slots for the i/o the
motherboard features a total of 8 USB
port so the combination of USB type-c
3.0 and below along with an HDMI IN
DisplayPort in terms of SATA ports you
a total of eight but that's basically it
for the overview of the motherboard so
besides the amazing features the board
itself looks stunning with the white IO
covers and it will definitely go well
with any setup by the way this is what
the Vengeance airflow Ram sticks would
look like with the fan installed it
definitely adds a unique look to your
build but if you don't plan on
overclocking the memory then you don't
need to use it but anyways that's it for
the unboxing and overview if you guys
want to see a PC build with these parts
then be sure to smash that like button
and I'll get started on it right away as
I mentioned before if you guys want info
on pricing and availability on the Intel
processors then you should check out the
link down below but anyways thanks again
for watching I will see you in the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
