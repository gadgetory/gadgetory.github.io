144 hurts refresh rate but also has a
2560 x 1440 p resolution on a TN panel
oh and it also features invidious g-sync
it's currently two hundred thirty bucks
off which makes it an amazing
deal now if you don't care for g-sync or
have an AMD graphics card instead then
the asus mg 279 q is the one for you
it's a lot cheaper and has the same
specs except that it's not a TN panel
instead you get an IPS display which
means that you might experience a motion
blur and as a 4 millisecond response
time instead of one from Dell but with
an IPS display you do get vivid color
and great viewing angles so that's for
this week's best tech deals of the week
