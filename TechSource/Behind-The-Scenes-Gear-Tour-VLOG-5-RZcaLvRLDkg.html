tech source and welcome to cool tech
under 50 for the month of December
anyways that's up the video I hope you
guys enjoyed it and as always I'll see
you guys in the next video so yeah
that's basically my entire life about
five days at least at an entire week
alright so after filming the video and
recording the sound it's time to pull
out the SD cards from the camera and
then pull out the SD card from the h5
zoom so both my audio and video files
are now basically you coming to the
computer when I plug them in and then
extract the files and put them in a
folder so it's easier to organize so
here are my two video files over here
and these are my two audio files before
I sing them together I need to remove
the background noise and just adjust the
equalization and base on my audio files
so I'm using audacity it's all boring
stuff really I'm not gonna go detailed
step-by-step on what I do but if you
guys really want to see a specific
separate video on how I edit my videos
and how I edit my audio make sure to let
me know in the comments section down
below also the program I'm using to edit
my videos in the Sony Vegas Pro 13 and
Ibanez since the beginning if I can go
back in time and change my mind I would
definitely start off with Adobe Premiere
but since I'm so used to Vegas 13 that's
the program I've been using this entire
time
and honestly it works well it's an
awesome program and I have no complaints
alright so I just finished editing the
top 5 gaming mechanical keyboards on the
50 bucks if you're watching this vlog
the videos only up on the channel as you
can see it's currently rendering slowly
but surely in 4k resolution utilizing my
780 Ti
I've been meaning to upgrade my PC to
the Titan build which I've talked about
a lot in my other videos but I have so
many other bills to get through first
before I can work on my actual personal
wig so I want to get those out of the
way before I work on my own so yeah
that's basically what I do every single
here at home I'm actually at least five
days out of the week if you guys think I
sent a front of a camera and talk you
are sadly mistaken there is so much more
work that gets put into these videos
from brainstorming to scripting to
voiceovers to shooting the video color
grading and just getting the perfect
shot I mean just it's I can go on and on
but for those of you that actually want
a tech channel you know exactly what I'm
talking about
but it's stressful there's a lot of work
to be put in but at the end it is
rewarding because you know it's it's a
passion of mine and I do this because I
love doing this and I love reading you
guys feedbacks on my videos that's one
of the main reasons I actually do
YouTube so I guess I'll just take this
time real quick and go over some of my
recording equipment real quickly to show
you guys what I use on a daily basis to
get these videos out so yeah starting
off with my camera I'm sure you guys
already seen this setup many times this
is my camera that I use for the channel
this is the Panasonic gh4 which can
shoot in 4k resolution it's horrible in
low-light situations but other than that
it is a pretty awesome mid-range camera
it's not that expensive I think it goes
for like 1,400 bucks now by the way I'll
leave links to all this down below if
you guys want to check it out this is
the Sigma lens I'm rocking eighteen to
thirty five-millimeter really awesome
lens I have it hooked up to the meta
bones speed booster that gives me the
option to use this lens with the camera
because otherwise it won't be compatible
I also can get this thing down to one
point for writing 1.2 aperture which is
insanely fast and super crispy up top I
have the autonomous Shogun that I've
hooked up to the gh4 at 6:00 it's
basically an external monitor the
viewfinder and it has a 1080p display
and it also records externally and
10-bit color and using this SSD so yeah
this tripod setup is called my mobile
tripod setup and reason why it's mobiles
because there's really not much on it
it's very light I can grab a little one
and and I can move it around it's got
the camera slider Manfrotto
fluid head and the man photo tripod all
the fluid heads and tripods I get from
man photo because the other ones I've
tried from other companies are complete
crap and man photo has gonna be best
filming gear that I've ever used so
that's kind of like stuck with them
this one is more complicated setup it's
a lot heavier this is what I use for a
lot of cinematic shots and basically on
videos I want to perfect because this
has G's organ I start okay so this is
basically the wireless slider system
from I footage I can control the speed
at which it slides as you can see and
it's perfect because all I need is one
take I don't need to use my hands which
constantly messes up the shot and you
get extremely smooth shots so on top of
the slider plate we have a another man
photo 128 RC fluid head and then under
the slider to support the slider I have
another fluid head by Manfrotto again
I'll have all this link down below if
you guys want to check it out and then
we have one of the discontinued man
photo tripods on the bottom for lighting
I have the flora easy softbox in one
corner of the room and the second one is
in the other side of the room to kind of
balance the lighting in this entire
office as you can see it's dark outside
so that is why I have my lights on but
if I'm shooting in the afternoon or even
in the morning I don't really need the
lights put my microphone that I use for
on-camera videos use the Sennheiser MKH
for 18 P 48 condenser microphone yeah
absolutely loving the quality of this
it's really crispy and I hooked this up
with an XLR cable to my zoo h5 and I
basically record the sound on here with
the SD card but this is temporary I
actually ordered a fort or Forte audio
interface that's coming up soon I'm
going to be using that to record my on
camera video so hopefully the sound
quality will be a lot better because the
h5 is just way too noisy picks up a lot
of background noise even with all the
editing
I can still hear it in the background so
that's why I kind of picked up the new
Forte audio interface and last but not
least this is my voiceover setup that I
have hooked up to my desk this is the
Scarlet studio interface package that
came with the audio interface and then
came with the Scarlet cm 25 condenser
microphone it also came with a pair of
headphones but I tossed that away and I
was using the Audio Technica m50 X's
which are absolute beast and I'm sure
everyone has heard of that heard of
those headphones oh yeah with the audio
interface I you hooked up the XLR cable
straight to the microphone and it's a
connected with this newer boom arm
extension boom arm which I can move
around and get the perfect angle for my
voiceovers so yeah that's basically what
goes on behind the camera did I know
this vlog was kind of different than my
usual vlogs but I did it because a lot
of you guys were requesting this and you
guys kind of wanted to see what happens
behind the scenes and stuff like that so
I will resume to the normal vlog style I
should say starting Thanksgiving so yeah
it's basically if you guys enjoyed it
let me know by leaving a like and as
always I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
