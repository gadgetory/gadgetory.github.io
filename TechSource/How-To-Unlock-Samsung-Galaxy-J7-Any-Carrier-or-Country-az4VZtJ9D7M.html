here to show you the process of locking
your Samsung Galaxy j7 so you can use it
with any GSM carrier in the world for
this demonstration I will be using my
locked Galaxy j7 and unlock it so I can
use it on my AT&amp;amp;T network but it's the
exact same process for any carrier from
any country so first off I'm going to
get the unlock code to start the locking
process the place where I get all my
lock codes is the unlocking company comm
because of the cheapest prices online
and I get my codes much faster than
other websites so head on over to the
unlocking company comm slipped your
phone manufacturer and the phone model
from the drop down list and on the next
page go ahead and select the country the
phone was originally purchased from and
the carrier of the phone in my case I
purchased it in the United States and
the original carrier is t-mobile before
we continue we need the IMEI number of
the phone and the way you look that up
on your phone is to open up the dial pad
and enter in star pound zero six pound
so once you have that go back on the
website and enter that in once
everything is filled out go ahead and
proceed to the final page where you have
to check out after checking out they
will email you the unlock code the price
and delivery time of your code varies by
phone but don't worry because as I said
before you are getting the cheapest
price online with the fastest delivery
times so once you receive your unlock
code from the locking company it's time
to unlock your phone go ahead and pop
open the back cover and remove the
battery to gain access to the SIM tray
then go ahead and put in a SIM card you
want to use with the phone so I want to
use the Galaxy j7 with my 18 t network
so I'm putting in my 18 T SIM card once
the SIM card is inside the phone go
ahead and put back the battery and the
backplate and boot up your device once
the phone boots up it will take you to
the SIM a lock page and this is where
you input the code that you received
from your locking company after putting
in the code and hitting a lock you will
get a message stating that the unlock
was successful and the phone will take
you straight to the home screen and your
phone becomes permanently unlocked
please note that some newer devices lock
to u.s. carriers are now remotely
unlocked so if it doesn't prompt for
your code then don't worry because they
can still unlock it no problem so that's
how you unlock your Galaxy j7 for any
GSM carrier in the world this video
helps you get that feel free to leave a
like and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
