and welcome to setup wars youtuber
edition episode 5 where you submit your
desk set up to get featured on the
channel if you're interested in
submitting your setup make sure to read
the instructions listed down below the
little that said and done
let the setup boys begin
so your five youtubers for this episode
are anmar dan Barbera Scania man 93
Matthew from tactic and Tobias from tech
mean now you guys can find the links to
their channels down below in the
description section so definitely be
sure to check them out after this video
it's gonna start the show with an Mars
setup go in and take it away man hey
guys my setup is where I spend most of
my hours and since I like a very
minimalist look that is what I am
located here so that's us let's check
out my desk on either side of the setup
I have the Swan M tents and they huddle
around the 2015 5 K iMac the specs on
the sky are maxed out and overall I just
find editing on this computer a breeze
to control it I use Apple's new magic
keyboard alongside Logitech MX master
mouse I still love the minimalistic look
the Magic Mouse too presents so I do end
up going back and forth between the two
quite a bit I switch between microphones
often and that's why not ever stay on my
desk but as of now the 88 75r looks
promising
on the left side of the desk I have a
geometrically organized charging station
and that just holds my iPhone MacBook
Air Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2
cable management looks a bit better than
actually is fashion or function I guess
and the m10 subwoofer lives here too and
if simplicity ever becomes boring I can
always add a few things to keep this
setup fresh so that about wraps up my
setup tour and I hope to see you over on
my channel hey guys Dan here from CLE
tech and this is my setup for my channel
that I use each and every day starting
off with the main attraction of my desk
we have my newly acquired retina 5k iMac
now it's not fully Specht out to
anything crazy but it's still super fast
at editing rendering an exporting 4k
content which is all that I really need
while editing I tend to revisit the
Logitech MX master mouse mostly because
of the level of comfort it brings while
editing videos and I like to couple that
with the new magic keyboard and trackpad
you will also find a pair of pulk audio
Hampton bluetooth speakers that look and
sound amazing aside from a few small
miscellaneous items my desk tends to
stay pretty clean and minimalistic
underneath my desk however is a drawer
that I got from Amazon that houses
anything from my MacBook and iPad pro
smartphones external batteries camera
gear and much more
