possible by Squarespace what does that
be guys Edea from Texas and I'm back
today to show you guys how to build your
very own computer the PC we are building
today consists of workstation parts for
our Mac versus PC project but this guide
should help you out regardless of what
PC you are trying to build the only tool
you're essentially going to need to
build a PC is a screwdriver but of
course having some common sense can help
smoothen out the process all right so
let's start by placing the CPU onto the
motherboard by lifting these two latches
we release the tray and see the pins
underneath it and be sure not to touch
these as they are very fragile and can
easily be damaged
next take the CPU out of its protective
enclosure by making sure not to touch
the top or the bottom and basically just
hold it by its sides we are going to
match the golden triangle that is on the
CPU to the one that is on the
motherboard when placing the CPU down be
sure not to move it around or apply any
pressure to it as it can damage the pins
just basically set it down and it should
fall right into place if it doesn't fit
properly then you probably put it in the
wrong way so make sure you double check
everything before moving on
so after you've successfully installed
the CPU into the CPU socket we can then
secure the latches there is gonna be
some pressure here but it's completely
normal so do not freak out next it's
time to put in the RAM now is a good
time to refer to your motherboards
manual to see where you place your RAM
sticks ideally if you have more than one
Ram stick you have to place them in the
same colored slots on your motherboard
and your manual should show you exactly
which ones moving forward make sure you
release the tab on the motherboard seen
here to put in the RAM
also make sure that the notches at the
bottom of the RAM correspond to that of
the motherboard and gently press down on
the RAM stick until it snaps in place
now we are going to mount the
motherboard into our case but first we
are going to have to install the
motherboard stand ups to make sure the
motherboard is not touching bare metal
you will need to know which holes to
install the standoffs on so what we did
was basically held a motherboard over
the case for a few seconds to get an
idea of which holes we were going to use
after the standoffs have been installed
you can install the motherboard
backplate
aka i/o shield and here you basically
just align it correctly to the back and
snap it into place it's actually really
simple after that you are ready to place
the motherboard back in the case I want
to do that make sure all the connections
are visible through the back and if they
are you can proceed and after that you
continue to install the screws into your
motherboard make sure to tighten them in
a crisscross pattern to even out the
stress on the motherboard do not tighten
them too hard just enough until the
screw stop turning without forcing them
next we are going to be installing the
power supply and it's basically
straightforward all you have to do is
line it up with the holes at the back of
your case and then find the designated
power supply screws that came with your
case and just start screwing them in you
may need to hold the power supply up
using your other hand to ensure that the
screws go in straight after that we are
going to be installing the CPU cooler we
went with an aftermarket not you a
cooler for our build but they are all
usually the same when it comes to
installation however you should always
check your coolers manual for more
information make sure you are using the
correct supplies for the type of CPU you
are using and then we're going to be
screwing in the CPU cooler standoffs in
the designated areas after that we're
gonna be placing in the mounting
brackets based on how we want our
airflow and then finally we're gonna be
using the supplied bolt to secure in the
mounting brackets in place to screw in
the nuptial cooler into place we are
going to have to take out one of the
fans in order to access the tightening
points this is done by pulling the
latches on each side allowing for the
removal of the fan after that we are
ready to spread the supply thermal
compound on the CPU and depending on
what cooler you are using it may or may
not come pre apply to a thermal compound
so the coolers manual suggests only
around four to five millimeters of
thermal paste you definitely don't want
to overdo this part because it can cause
problems with the cooler so you can use
the same amount that way you
here in the video because when you place
the cooler on top it will spread evenly
covering the entire surface of the CPU
after you are done with the thermal
compound place the CPU cooler on top of
the CPU and begin tightening the screws
which will secure it in place
after that you can install the fan back
into its spot and finally we are ready
to plug the CPU cooler into the CPU fan
header on the motherboard if you guys
aren't sure where exactly to plug this
in refer to your motherboards manual and
it will show you where next up we're
going to be routing the 24 pin cable
from the power supply to the 24 pin slot
on the motherboard then we're gonna do
the same thing for the 8 pin connector
which is also from the power supply once
again if you guys can't find these slots
on your motherboard then refer to your
manual for some help
next we're going to install the graphics
cards be sure to remove the metal
brackets from the slots that you are
going to use and then slide the video
card and you should hear it snap in
place always install your video card on
the first PCI slot for better
performance and if you guys have two
graphics cards now is a good time to
install the SLI or crossfire bridge so
this is what your PC should relatively
look like once all those components are
installed correctly you can take the
time now to make sure everything is
securely fitted before moving on after
that we are going to install the PCI
card into the PCIe slot on the bottom
here if you guys don't have a PCIe SSD
card then you're gonna be skipping this
step now to get some cables out of the
way first we are going to plug in the
USB 3 cable that runs from the top of
the case and to the motherboards USB 3
header then we're gonna do the same
thing with the USB 2 cables and finally
we are going to plug in everything that
is located at the front panel including
the hard drive activity LED and the
power switch our asus motherboard
actually came with a convenient way to
plug in all of these wires to the
motherboard if yours did not come with
something like this then you are going
to have to plug them in one by one
next plug in all the cables to the power
supply including the PCIe cables that
plug into your graphics cards and make
sure you have plugged in all the fans
and that there are no more connections
left to make and that should be
everything as far as installing the
hardware
concerned one thing you should do after
installing the parts is to boot up your
PC and make sure everything is running
fine and that your bios screen shows up
after that the next step would be to
install the operating system and the
drivers which should be fairly
straightforward so I won't go through
them there's plenty of other videos on
youtube for that but if this video
helped you guys out then please leave a
like and if it didn't leave a comment
with your questions or concerns and I
will do my best to answer them quickly
this workstation PC will be going
head-to-head with the Mac Pro 6 core
model and we will be running benchmarks
rendering files and a few other tests to
see which PC performs the best with the
same cost so if that sounds like
something that interests you then feel
free to stick around so before I head
out I want to thank the people at
Squarespace for making this entire
project possible Squarespace makes it
really easy to create your very own
