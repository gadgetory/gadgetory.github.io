apologize on two things one the lighting
is really crappy here and also the audio
as you can see I've no Cousteau Chrome's
behind me this is my first official
video at my new place so there's a lot
of things I still need to put together
my windows don't have any shutters so
there's a bunch of lights coming in and
messing with the lighting of my studio
and also does a lot of echo and reverb
but because I don't have any coup stick
foams around me so again I apologize
things will get better I just need some
time give me a few weeks but anyways in
my dad wasting more time
welcome to setup wars episode 114 way
you some desks that have to get featured
on a channel let the setup wars begin I
want to give each things to Vikings war
of clans or sponsoring this episode so
the objective of the game is to capture
the place of power and the Kingdom
players can upgrade their town and
warriors for battle or even team up with
others to create a stronger clan this
has easily become the most addictive
mobile game that I've played recently
and it kind of feels similar to a
full-fledged PC strategy game with crisp
visuals but instead it's playable
anywhere on your smartphone the Vikings
war of clans is already truly popular
with over 3 million players from around
the world facing off at battles in fact
I've just started playing the game so if
you guys want to team up with me make
sure you search textures in game and add
me to your friends list I'll leave a
link below so you guys can download
Vikings were clans for yourself and
receive a complimentary 200 gold for
that competitive edge kick starting the
episode we got John and his gorgeous
ultra wide gaming setup featuring the
Acer x34 ultra light gaming monitor that
hooked up to a custom made backdrop in
fact the backdrop isn't the only thing
that's custom built we got the wall
shelves up there and the rest of the
desk that was put together by John and I
think it came out perfect
normally my OCD would kick in seeing a
smaller monitor hooked up next to an
ultra-wide but oddly enough it actually
works with this setup I think that
adding another ultra light would be
overkill and not very
practical for his setup you also
maintain symmetry the PC on the right
offsets the monitor on the left side I
also love how clean the build is with
the red LED fans from thermaltake and
also the custom black and red sleeving I
don't know what CPU cooler you're
rocking but I'm definitely digging that
heatsink design sitting on top of the
wall shelves you've got a pair of
Edifier r2 700 speakers and the popular
HyperX cloud core headset for
symmetrical purposes you've got the idea
plants on the left side along with two
framed pictures up top which happens to
have a black and red beam as well
very clean cable work with the straight
keyboard and Diablo 3 Mouse as well as
with the rest of the cables under the
desk he hid them very well behind the
desk and the LED placement is spot-on
it's facing directly against the wall
and it's very close to it allowing the
LEDs to bounce back and give off a very
nice go effects under the monitor I'm
not sure about that lamp on the left
side though I mean if you can add extra
light on the left side I would do the
same thing on the opposite side to kind
of balance it because it's kind of
looking a bit dark behind that PC adding
something like the AA key table RGB lamp
behind your PC would be really nice and
only cost around 20 bucks he even
managed to save some extra space by
mounting his router and USB hub another
desk very nice definitely one of the
better black and red gaming setups that
I've seen on the show and if it wasn't
for a few minor adjustments honestly
this would have gone the seal of
approval but thank you John for entering
sticking with consistent color schemes
then ultra wide monitors we got Nathan
and another gorgeous and clean setup
right off the bat I will give him some
credits for rocking the better ultra
light gaming monitor the AOSP g3 for 8q
with g sync and 100 hertz refresh rate
in case you guys didn't notice it he did
custom paint the bottom part of it in
white to match the color scheme flanking
that gorgeous monitor we got a pair of
Yamaha HS HW studio monitor speakers and
for the gear he's rocking the case M in
the RGB keyboard with custom white key
caps and the M 65 RGB mouse I love that
contrast between the key caps the mouse
and even a mousepad
nathan has either been watching my
channel 4
a long time always simply knows what the
hell he's doing or hell maybe both who
knows I mean this dude even food
coasters on each side of his desk for
symmetry reasons are you sure you are
not related to me because this set up is
already screaming my name so on the left
side there is the coarser void had said
sitting on a white acrylic stand and
next to that is his white printer again
staying very consistent to the white
theme I was going to say that the black
D brain scans what I've added better
contrast on your laptop but when I
thought about it a bit more I did agree
with the white skins because the rest of
the laptop has subtle black accents to
complement the white skin excellent
choice
cable management and the drawers past
cable management in the PC past cable
management behind the PC pass cable
management under the desk
goddamn pass just take it man here just
just take the seal of approval please
you get $100 cash in your PayPal
accounts a tech source t-shirts and most
importantly you get a custom-made plaque
just like the one over here on the
screen with my signature on there which
is optional if you want so if you're
watching this video toss me an email to
set up pores to claim your prize'
well-deserved man what can I say I have
a sucker for beauty and perfection
honestly I think the icing on the cake
was that badass chair and that skull
thing that's hanging from the wall
Nathan even included a video the
demonstrates has RGB light setup let's
check it out
vertical mode really dude I'm sorry I'm
gonna have to take the plaque back I'm
just kidding send me that email you're
getting the plaque I'm just joking
Mayson you beautiful bastard thank you
for blessing our eyeballs with your
amazing setup
speaking of blessing our eyeballs holy
 what the hell is going on here this
looks very busy but you gotta admit it
looks boss ass
what is it with me in cursing this
episode I'm sorry guys not normally like
this I keep this channel pg-13 but the
setups in this episode are giving me a
massive bow so he's rocking to 27 inch
ROG monitors on the side and in the
center we got the PG 3 for 8 Q once
again and right above that is the LG 34
you see 97 at first I thought there were
two more monitors near the top but
they're not truthfully I don't know what
those are maybe some of you had
subwoofers or something but I'm not
really sure there was however a sound
bar that sucked up behind the LG monitor
and he's also got the ghost companion 20
speakers mounted against the wall on
both sides of the martyrs great work
with these symmetry there in case you
haven't realized it at this point the
desk is custom built and painted to go
along with the rest of the setup and I
love how we kept the black and red
contrast consistent a fine example is
the shelf on the right side and the
cable management cut out for the razor
Deathstalker chroma keyboard any
tartarus Mouse seriously if you look
close you can see that those are red
very nice attention to detail some of
the stuff you've got laid around on the
desk is the rgg 50 750 series laptop
razer naga mouse and the thrust master
joystick that's built inside the desk
actually the base is embedded inside but
the actual joystick can be detached
which is cool under a desk is where the
party is that though we've got a cool
footrest near the back we got a
sennheiser sense gaming headset and a
beast water-cooled gaming pc rocking a
6700 K and 2 ROG Poseidon 980ti S&amp;amp;S
alive
excellent cable management skills and
props on the custom paint job as well
that's definitely one fine machine you
got there this definitely isn't a setup
it's a freaking monster battle station
Thank You Pete for a drink keeping the
train going we got will and his corner
quad display set up this episode's on
fire he's got 327 inch Samsung monitor
surrounding the Acer predator x34 and
you know that we got the Black Widow
keyboard or believer keypad and the Mad
Catz Mouse by the way those are not
painted in white they are actually
wrapped in white carbon fiber well
except the Mad Catz mouse that one is
actually painted beautiful work by the
way I also like that the entire setup
isn't just black and red he's doing some
white accents in there to change it up a
bit
I feel like painting the bottom part of
the monitors and the stands white would
look really nice and give the entire
setup more contrast but I understand
that it's way more permanent solution
and it's way more work what's really
cool about the setup is that we'll added
some black tempered glass floating
shelves underneath the monitors to keep
it level with the ultra light that is
freakin cool audio is rocking instead of
five speakers from Bose with a subwoofer
underneath and the game zero gaming
headset cable management seems to be
under control there are a lot of zip
ties being used to keep most of the
wires off the ground which I can
appreciate but what the hell is that
thing under your drawer seriously these
are kia capital legs are only like 20
bucks and they will help keep that
drawer off the ground in a much cleaner
way finally the PC that's powering this
beast battle station is kind of an oldie
it's rocking the 3930k paired with two
EVGA gtx 980ti s and sli but here's what
grinds my gears so first of all I love
how clean the build looks and I will
give you major props on painting the
back plates and adding those custom
decals the build looks sick especially
with that vinyl wrap around the tubes
for the CPU cooling but if you spend all
that time making your build look so damn
sexy you want to spend a little more
time on the sli bridge honestly you
could even take the easy way out and
just straight-up paint that whole thing
to match your color scheme you don't
even have to go out and get a custom sli
bridge done because that really sticks
out and kind of we'll just to be honest
but regardless this is one hell of
battle station I'm really diggin the
posters of Deadpool and the Punisher up
there along with the symmetry of
everything else I think you did a great
job putting everything together
thank you for intern finishing up strong
we got then and his souped up
productivity set up who says you have to
be part of the PC master-race
to have a sick
setup then is here to prove just that
the star of the show is 27-inch 5k iMac
right smack in the center between two
24-inch AOC monitors of course you can't
have an Apple productivity setup without
the almighty MacBook Pro which is
resting on a shelf to the side on the
same shelf he's got both the DJI phantom
4 and the Matic pro which arguably are
to the best drones out right now but
back to the main setup so there's
definitely a lot going on here we got
the usual Apple trackpad and keyboard
combo along with a drawing tablet on
side
he's also rocking a pair of audio engine
82 plus speakers without the beats solo
headphones on there here we also have
some external drives from lassie and
both of his cameras the Canon 5d Mark 4
and the mark 2 the cable management
isn't flawless but at least he kept them
off the ground with the help of some
velcro straps this sort of definitely
costs a lot of money but I feel like Zen
knows what he is doing this entire setup
has purpose and the productivity flow
feels very high Thank You Zen for
entering but that is it for this episode
of set of wars you guys so much for
watching make sure you drop your
comments down below and vote on who you
think has the best desk setup as always
I'll announce the winners on my social
media platforms on the weekend thing
guys so much for watching I love your
noses and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
