welcome to set up Ward's episode 101 we
used to mention desk set up to get
featured on the channel so if you guys
want to participate make sure to watch
the video linked down below also I
haven't forgotten about the giveaway
there's going to be a $1500 set up
giveaway at the end of this video make
sure you guys stick around if you're
interested let the set-up boards begin
starting off the episode we got Anthony
and his very nice white and red setup
featuring two 27 inch LCD monitors that
are sitting on the IKEA Alex add-on unit
which appears to be modded as well it
looks like Anthony Rapp the drawers and
black carbon fiber skins very nice even
a row cap is Kuki board and logitech
g502 Mouse is wrapped in matte red skins
that's actually a much better approach
instead of painting them since it's not
permanent
you can always peel them off whenever
you change your mind so that's pretty
cool
props I'm drilling a hole for the
keyboard and mouse and also the addition
of the USB hub under your add-on unit is
a nice touch for audio we've got the
Insignia sound bar below his monitors
and also a pair of some sort of headset
I'm utterly sure what it is since you
didn't write it in the notes I'm gonna
go ahead and guess that it's from Turtle
Beach but I may be wrong cave management
is done really well most of the cables
are resting on the IKEA Signum and the
rest are neatly routed into a power
outlet using some cable clips and wall
mounts so apparently wrapping things and
skins do not stop for Anthony it looks
like he even wrapped up some parts of
his PC case in carbon fiber skins and
even the inside I guess this is more of
a black red and white set up instead of
just being a white and red
but anyways inside here we got the 60 70
K and the msi gtx 980ti I like the
custom wraps in your set up the dope LED
lit millennium falcon in the background
and just the overall climbing list of
this set up Thank You Anthony for
entering next up we have bill and his
setup actually has a really nice modern
and artistic theme to it from the
popular white and black color scheme to
the giant clock on the wall and the
choice of furniture I feel like he had a
vision before he started creating this
setup and it somehow came together he's
using a Dell monitor that's also being
held up by another IKEA add-on unit and
below that we got the cherry MX keyboard
with cherry red switches and a me onyx
Nao's 8200 laser mouse the way he routed
those cables are actually very smart
instead of drilling a hole in the desk
he ran them through a small white tube
that kind of blends in with a desk
this setup definitely has some audio
game he's using the wave master cube
Bluetooth speakers and between them is a
pair of Philips Fidelio l2 head
above the headphone he's got a rode
podcaster microphone hooked up to the
road PSM one boom arm which is actually
in a secluded area in fact the entire
boom arm is mounted on his nightstand so
it's not even on the actual setup that's
pretty clever symmetry is definitely on
point we got a fake IKEA plant on the
right side to justify the headphone
location and the cable management is
also flawless although I'm not so sure
what's going on with the cables inside
his PC we also have a strange color
scheme inside here 16 gigs of red Ram
sticks
black and white PCIe cables and an
all-black 24 pin set of cables what is
going on here it's equipped with a 60 70
K and a gigabyte gtx 960 aside from the
pc this is a gorgeous setup thank you
Bill for entering Elizondo definitely
has watched matrix-12 many times enough
to create a construct room just for
himself this is the construct in fact we
built this entire setup from scratch he
first gathered all the parts that he
needed and patiently put them in one
room until he had everything together
then he slowly began to create the desk
and then he built the pc and then
painted a bunch of things in the process
looks like he built the background as
well which is holding up both of his 23
inch Dell monitors mad props on those
carpenter skills man he did go with a
minimalistic look as well the only thing
he has on his desk is the wireless
Microsoft keyboard and mouse and a pair
of turbine t2 wireless headphones on the
left side even its chair fits perfectly
in this setup although I don't know what
model this is but it definitely looks
dope and pretty comfortable the pc also
has the same white color scheme it's
equipped with a 6700 K and a gigabyte
gtx 750ti which is painted and white as
well however I do feel like white sleeve
cables would have looked a lot better
than the standard black ones in your PC
the rest of the setups cables are pretty
much non-existent and I love that even
his power cable is in white I mean this
guy did an amazing job with the entire
setup the only thing I'm not a fan of is
the keyboard and mouse selection I feel
like you have a lot of awesome options
out there and he just kind of settled
with those which aren't even white
kind of doesn't even match the setup in
the first place I did look up a few
options for you under fifty bucks and
there's even this one from Java which is
a wireless RGB mechanical keyboard and
it's actually wireless as well so
definitely check it out if you want
nothing will go great with your setup
I'll jump a link to all of these down
below for anyone that's interested had
you perfected a few things I would have
awarded you the seal of approval because
this is an amazing setup Thank You Liz
for entering at number four we got James
and his single ultra white setup that he
built inside of a wall shelf of some
sort he's rocking the corsair k70 RGB
keyboard and Razer Taipan Mouse on top
of the cursor expanded mousepad
I'm already deducting points because of
that keyboard wired up just plainly goes
over the Sony sound bar that definitely
grinds my gears he also has the blue
Yeti my coffee the right side and a pair
of m50x is near the corner for the most
part everything is organized very well
and all the cables on a desk are hidden
behind the cabinets so no complaints
here let's take a look at this PC this
looks pretty badass it's rocking a 6700
K and 2 Galax GTX 1080s in sli with that
massive sli bridge not much else to say
a very dope setup indeed thank you James
for entering Las Fallas we are Vincent
and this interesting black and red setup
so he's got a 24 inch Ben Q as the main
monitor and a philips TV right above
that which is hooked up to his ps4 the
desk is custom made and it looks like
it's hooked up against the wall but then
it stopped his cable management skills
all the wires go through a Raceway
behind the keyboard and there is another
Raceway in the corner for the rest of
the gear like the monkey banana speakers
and the aven't own microphone vincent
also hooked up a USB hub and an SD card
reader under his desk for easy access
and then he's got his void wireless
headset in the corner over there there's
definitely a lot of stuff on his desk
but at the same time it doesn't really
look cluttered everything is within
reach and I think that's what Vincent
was going for for example there's a
table beside him full of camera gear so
basically whenever he needs to shoot a
video we can just grab them set it up
and he's good to go
same with the ps4 headset and even a
microphone in a way he chose convenience
over aesthetics the pcs partner setup is
nicely built and it's walk in the 60 70
K and the Asus Strix 10 60 I think
fifth or fourth 6,700 que processor in
this episode alone a very dull black and
red setup with purpose and even some
personality Thank You Vincent for
entering so that is if its episode would
of setup wars thank you guys so much for
watching make sure you guys vote down
below on who you think has the best desk
setup and allows the winners on my
Twitter and Instagram accounts on the
weekend now then it's time for the
giveaway so this one's a little
different than the one I did on episode
100 because this one is done on the App
nice because they are sponsoring this
giveaway so first you guys need to do is
download it I'll leave a link down below
and once you download it open it up and
I'm going to show you guys how to do it
all right guys there's two ways of doing
this basically what you have to do is
add products to your wish list and
whatever is on your wish list will be
your setup it cannot pass 1500 US
dollars so make sure you guys keep that
in mind so when you get to click on
channels and you can actually click on
my channel scroll down and any whatever
product you guys see in my videos you
can add whatever you want so basically
let's for example and scroll down to
setup wars episode 99 click on the video
so over here as you can see there is a
five setups to your featured in the
episode each setup will have a list of
gear featured in their actual setup so
if you scroll down and you see something
you like for example the mouse all you
have to do is click on the Save button
and it will add it to your wish list for
example here is a set of speakers if you
like these if you want these to be part
of your setups click on save so on so
forth you guys can scroll and save on
whatever you want this actually takes a
lot longer than the previous version I
did on episode 100 but because they're
sponsoring it we actually use their app
here's another way this was actually a
lot easier if you guys click on this
arrow play button on the bottom left it
will take you to the main page and once
you click on the product section you

single product on the nice app so if you
see something you like like to do is
