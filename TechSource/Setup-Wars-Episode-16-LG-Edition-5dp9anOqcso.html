can see for yourself real quickly before
I begin the episode I want to address
some concerns you guys have a lot of
guys are wondering why your setup hasn't
gone featured yet even after me
downloading the files the current wait
time to get featured on setup wars is at
least 90 days that's how many
submissions I've been getting every
single day so for the LD submissions I
am picking them randomly as they come
but after the series are over I'm gonna
go back to my regular schedule basically
accepting them as they come em so I'm
gonna go back to accepting the
submissions in the order I received them
so I'm actually me sorry if you guys
don't get chosen there are literally
hundreds and hundreds of submissions
that I have saved up on my computer so
if you guys have patience please
wait you guys will get featured so with
that said let's take a look at the ten
contested here ten contestants for this
week's episode we have Benjamin med bill
Eber basil Jason Jose Julianne Noah and
Sol easy I don't know if Zoe Z is your
name but hey that's what I got as always
all of the gear you guys see on these
setups will be featured down below in
the description section for anyone that
is interested so with that said let's
take a look at band setup so we're
starting to step aside strong with bands
triple display setup we have three ASIS
24 inch monitors hooked up to a wall
mount on the desk we have a k70 keyboard
logitech g502 mouse on top of the course
our extended mousepad also under the
monitors we have the Razer Leviathan
sound bar cables are all hidden away on
that rack so great job on there and also
notice that you have an Ikea LED strip
installed under the desk SiC PC by the
way we have a 4770k and an Asus GTX 770
in the obsidian 450d case say what you
will about the overuse black and red
combo I still love it and it's my
favorite color
nation but yeah overall a very
simplistic triple display setup job well
done next up is Noah with a somewhat
cramped setup so we have an AC 27-inch
monitor sandwiched by two older Fujitsu
monitors honestly I would toss those two
motors aside and grab another 27-inch if
you really use all those pixels on the
desk we have a logitech k120 keyboard
and G 602 Mouse with a pair of LS 21
speakers we also have a tryin Pro
headphones hanging from the is that is
that your bed Wow okay so it looks like
you converted the bottom portion of your
bed into a storage unit with a bunch of
shelves to hold your games and other
stuff it's not a bad idea
what a good way to make use of something
you are not using I guess another great
invention you have on the top of your PC
never in a million years
what I have ever thought of this you're
actually using your PC fans as an actual
cooling fan I gotta say that is really
cool and all right
kela management is also really good and
plus 1/r mounting your router and other
stuff against the wall like that to free
up some space on your desk honestly you
have a pretty clever setup it's a bit
too cramped for my style especially with
those huge as speakers taking up a big
portion of your desk it definitely has
the potential of a dope setup if you
rearrange and get rid of a few things
next up is bill with a dual monitor
display two 27-inch Dell monitors one in
4k and the other and 1080p on the desk
we have the Razer BlackWidow keyboard
g6o to Mouse on the left side and an
Apple Magic Mouse on the right we also
have a high sense TV up top Harman
Kardon sound sticks on the desk and I
really like this setup because it's both
a Productivity and a gaming setup we
have the six core Mac Pro all the way on
the right side in your custom PC on the
bottom a beast PC I might add with a
5820k CPU paired with two gtx 980ti s i
also like the fact that you hung your
headphones on the wall but it seems like
it's a bit far from reach and that you
have to actually lean in a bit to grab
them not sure if that was a good idea
cable management is great as well I
don't really have much complaints you
have a pretty sweet hybrid setup and
number four we have Eber with a dual
display setup on the IKEA B can't desk
an acer 27-inch g-sync display and a
dell 4k display on the silverstone
monitor stand on the desk we have the
corsair Shrieve gaming keyboard ami onyx
savior mouse and the Edifier speakers
awesome job on cable management is
pretty sweet that the desk comes with a
net for cables it definitely makes
everything a lot easier also on the
bottom is the black blue and gold PC so
it's rocking a 4930 K with a gtx 960 but
yeah I mean I love the LEDs and
especially that moderate amount I think
it really cleans up the entire setup
great job dude
next up is Faisal with a simple and
clean set up we have an Acer 28 inch 4k
monitor a courser K 65 keyboard and an M
65 mouse on the extended mousepad we
also have a coolermaster scorpion Mouse
bungee which I rarely see on these
episodes awesome job keeping your ath
m50x s on the mov headphone anger and
i'll give you a point for not only
hooking up the USB hub on the roof of
your desk but also using the cable drops
to wrap your USB cables to the top of
your desk for easyacc
says fantastic job on cable management
as well now let's talk about a PC so I
won't go over too much about it since
you entered PC Wars as well but all I
can say is that you have some serious
skill my friend majority of these parts
are custom made by him and I can't wait
to show you more pics later on
honestly this setup is worthy of an
ultra-wide monitor I can really see the
effort that takes you to keep such a
clean and organized setup and if you do
win the monitor you will definitely take
good care of it Jason is next up with
his dope red LED setup so we have a
27-inch Asus 1440p monitor a corsair k70
keyboard and an Ouroboros mouse on top
of the X track record gaming mat you
also have an extract zoom mouse pad on
top of that as well but finally
something a little different from
Corsair extended mouse pads I gotta say
that these do look pretty sweet also in
the desk we have a pair of Cerwyn Vega
bookshelf speakers and sign Heiser HD
580 headphones resting on top I love the
custom painted microphone and the red
LEDs just works so well with this setup
excellent job on wire management and you
have a baller PC as well with a gtx 970
and AE 4370 a really awesome
presentation and a really clean setup
thank you Jason for entering a number 7
we have Jose and his wall mounted setup
we have an Asus 27-inch rog swift 144
hertz gaming monitor hooked up on the
wall with a Logitech G 710 gaming
keyboard and a g502 gaming mouse on top
of the Genesis mousepad also on the desk
we have a sign Heiser game 0 headset and
Logitech speakers I really think that
the blue desk makes the gaming gear pop
out especially that awesome custom
water-cooled PC you have there it's
rocking a 4930 K which is overclocked to
4.5 gigahertz and 2 GTX 780 Ti is in SLI
pretty good job on cable management
although I think you can definitely do a
better job wrapping the cables I like
how the table comes with a few holes
which helps routing the cables through
given a set up a very clean look but
overall not a bad setup
next up is julienne with yet another
triple monitor setup we have one Asus 28
inch 4k monitor and Tuli llaman
Pro lights 24 inch monitors on the right
on the desk we have a g7 10 mechanical
keyboard g700 gaming mouse and a pair of
X 41
round sound headphones from Turtle Beach
we also got a few other headphones on
this hanger sign Iser 363 DK me headset
and a pair of San Heiser momentum
headphones I'm not sure what the deal is
with the cable coming out of the
keyboard towards the front but that
would definitely bother me so maybe wrap
the cable another way if possible unless
it doesn't bother you at all other than
that the cable management looks pretty
awesome down below and this is a pretty
cool multi-monitor setup at number nine
we have med with a pretty interesting
setup we have an Asus 27-inch 2k display
and a Dell pivotable 1080p display next
door the wallpaper looks pretty familiar
I wonder where you got that from but I
will give you a point for being creative
with it on the second display though
that looks pretty sick so there's a
bunch of stuff on your desk we have an
apple wireless keyboard and trackpad
along with the Logitech G 710 keyboard
and a bunch of gaming mice a Mad Catz
rat 5 logitech g502 Razer Mamba and
finally Logitech MX Mouse for
productivity despite having all that
gear you still managed to keep the desk
very clean so props on that I love the
red tilt wireless charger you have on a
desk
and now red and black dxracer chair you
have and I think that really blends in
well with your color scheme you also
have quite a collection of headphones as
well a pair of sony pulse gaming
headphones total beach 7 headset and a
Logitech G 430 gaming headset for
consoles you are rocking both the ps4
and Xbox one but it's missing some D
band skins I see that you have some on
the MacBook Pro so you should definitely
pick up some carbon fiber ones for your
consoles as well pretty sweet PC as well
that's an MSI GTX 970 graphics card and
it's rocking an Intel 46 70k processor
you have a bunch of awesome gear but the
cable management is slacking so I would
definitely spend some time and clean it
up but overall you have a pretty badass
battle station and gaming room well done
last but not least we have Sully Z with
the very first wide dual monitor setup
we have 2 LG 23 inch monitors a Razer
BlackWidow chroma keyboard DeathAdder
chroma Mouse on the coarser extended
mouse pad also the desk we have two
beats pill speakers and a Triton kun a
gaming wireless headset on the geek reah
acrylic headphone stand I absolutely
love how symmetrical this setup is you
have the blue Yeti macro
two speakers on the bottom and the
mousepad centered directly in front of
monitors plus one for the symmetry tale
management is also a spot-on it looks
like you attach the power strip to the
roof of the desk with some zip ties and
connected all your stuff to it
pretty sweet PC as well as walking a
4790k and an msi gtx 970 GPU in the very
sexy h 440 pc case honestly i love the
setup very clean and very organized
job well done so easy so that's it for
