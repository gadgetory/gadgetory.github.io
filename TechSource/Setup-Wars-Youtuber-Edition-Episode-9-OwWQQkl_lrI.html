guys been here from BTech HD so this is
my setup that I use for my channel where
I shoot most of my videos so the biggest
attraction to the desk is going to be my
monitor now this is the LG 34 inch um 67
monitor now right below that I have my
PlayStation 4 where I can't beam shoot
some noobs on Call of Duty and to the
left of the desk I have my 2011 MacBook
Pro which is not maxed out but does get
the job done with editing and has been
loyal to me for many years as for
lighting I have some IKEA LED strips
behind the desk and to Edison bulbs and
along with that I also have a salt lamp
to the corner as for my mouse and
keyboard I'm going on Apple and to the
right of my setup is where you're going
to see the mic that I use for my videos
which is the blue Yeti and the desk
itself is also from Ikea and it's fairly
popular among other youtubers it is
called the liniment desk from Ikea and
it's sitting on - alex shores under it
on east side the monitor is sitting on
an Alex - same name just different
pieces I hope you guys like my setup and
if you would like to see more of the
setup or want to check out my other
videos go ahead and hit the link below
for my channel thanks again this is Ben
from VTech HD thank you what's good
people should buy fresh welcome to my
setup now you're probably familiar with
most of the tech you see on my desk but
let's highlight some of the things that
helped me create content for my channel
firstly the tech bringing my voice to
your ears is the blue Yeti microphone
which I've been using for years it's
definitely the go-to youtuber mic next
up my editing machine is the 15 inch
retina MacBook Pro resting inside the
vertical hinge docking station which
connects to two of my three Asus 4k
monitors the other is used for council
gaming on the ps4 and Xbox one the desk
itself is the Peconic desk from Ikea and
my go-to mouse is the Logitech
performance MX
when it comes to gaming I use the Astor
a 50s for audio and my desktop speakers
are the bose companion 20s now my custom
PC built by man gear is housing the gtx
960 with 8 gigs of DDR for RAM and the
core i7 6700 K hands-down my favorite
part of my setup are the Philips you
light strips that you see now and lastly
I'd like to thank ed forgiving myself
and the other featured youtubers the
platform to showcase our content feel
free to stop by the fresh biz and click
that subscribe button please
welcome guys I'm Joe from your herd and
this is my setup so this is my
productivity setup or I shoot most of my
b-roll and edits all of my videos so
what you'll find is aimed towards that
and center of the desk you'll find two
monitors and either one and the Phillips
one which helped a lot when editing and
a pair of Logitech and c333 speakers
which are accompanied by the subwoofer
beneath the desk on the desk itself
you're going to find my asshole's
uniform or half mechanical keyboard
together with this attached eh wireless
mouse on the left you'll usually find my
headphones done we design Heiser HD for
3:9 on top only right the blue snowball
mic for all of my voiceovers but if the
two monitors you'll find my favorite
collectables ranging from Android
speakers to Dragonball a Star Wars the
rather with my Nexus 7 second-generation
my RX 100's for my custom lighting I
have three different sources one per
spot which creates some really cool
effects when combined so that was it for
my setup
thank you for watching an ad for having
me on so what's good guys my name is
Kevin and this is my setup I like to
keep things simple and minimalistic with
no visible cables this is the IKEA
linman unit which is a really simple and
clean desk by itself but when paired
with the Alex add-on unit it serves as a
really nice riser for my monitor
headphone stand and even my desk lamp it
also features two drawers for holding my
smartphones and a couple of other
accessories so for peripherals I use the
logitech k400 our keyboard combo and the
MX master mouse here we find the 27-inch
Asus 4k IPS monitor which is hooked up
to my soon-to-be upgraded computer the
MacBook Pro I've never really been a
huge fan of Mac OS and while boot camp
is a pretty nifty feature
I'd still take a traditional
custom-built PC over this any day so
that's all for my setup I hope you guys
have enjoyed it and maybe I'll catch a
couple of you guys on my channel hey
guys this is rich P and now we're gonna
take a look at my setup that I use for
editing videos and gaming for my main
monitor I'd use the AOC Q 2770 and for
my second monitor
I used a lg IPS 2 3 6 we I'd use the
blue Yeti microphone with a standard pop
filter for my audio I'd used to Logitech
said 62 3 together with my file e-tank
ale amplifier and Dec I have a custom
built PC with an i7 5820k overclocked to
4.4 gigahertz a gtx 980ti
and 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory for my
peripherals i use the corsair strafe RGB
with brown MX sherry switches and eraser
DeathAdder Mouse when I'm gaming I'm
using my HyperX cloud 2 headphones and
when I'm listening to music and editing
videos I'm using my auto technica m50x
my laptop is the new Dell XPS 15 with an
infinity display so I'll do it for this
episode of setup wars youtuber edition
