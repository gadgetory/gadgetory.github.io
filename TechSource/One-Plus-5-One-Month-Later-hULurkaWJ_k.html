video possible the smartphone space has
seen a lot of diverse growth in the past
few years and that's great news for
consumers we can ask for the latest
technologies or go with something a
little cheaper like the newly released
one plus five
oneplus is one of those companies that
brings you the bare essentials and
packages it very well the oneplus 5 will
be the most expensive handset in the
company's history starting at $480 the
more expensive model I have here costs
five hundred forty dollars and it ups
the storage from 64 to 128 gigabytes of
space and it's RAM from six to eight
gigabytes and we're talking ddr4 here we
will get more into the performance later
but let's start with the hardware when
press renders were released the oneplus
5 was remarked as the iPhone clone and
for good reason the cameras and the
antenna lines are identical and the
screen to body ratio is very similar but
in the hand the two devices couldn't
seem more different the one plus five is
seven and a half millimeters thin with
rounded corners that conforms to your
hand they've kept a lot of the design
elements from patched models like the
port locations and the alert slider
which by the way changes the sound
profile to either silent do not disturb
or ring the fingerprint reader is not
quicker and so far I haven't had any
trouble with recognition it's in the
same spot also flanked by the back and
recent capacitive funds
unfortunately this phone doesn't have
any water resistance which at its price
we would have liked to see the display
of the resolution of 1080p and it's
AMOLED now this is where a lot of people
are swayed from this device and I know
surprised the industry standard nowadays
is 2k resolution and there's a big PPI
difference between these two numbers but
in actual usage you won't really notice
the difference unless you're holding
this side-by-side with something like
the galaxy s 8 it does get bright and
has great colors and true blacks from
being an AMOLED display and thanks to
the lower resolution we get better
battery life and of course better
performance I personally think that this
is a worthwhile trade-off combined the
Snapdragon 835 processor Adreno 530 and
eight gigs of ram in a phone which by
the way runs pretty much stock Android
and the end result is a buttery smooth
the latest games are no problem and
switching between apps and multitasking
is super smooth since so many apps can
stay in the memory without any issue we
do get a 3300 milliamp hour battery
which actually comes out to 100 less
milliamps when compared to the 1 + 3 T
but better that is about the same which
is 5 hours of on-screen time and this is
in part thanks to the Snapdragon 835 10
nanometer design that uses up to 25%
less power combined the old a battery
life with the super quick - charge and I
have no issues with battery life at all
in my benchmarks I would gain 50 percent
battery in 30 minutes which is as fast
as it gets in the industry the dual
camera system consists of a 16 megapixel
lens and a 20 megapixel telephoto lens
this is the headline feature at launch
they've even got it printed on the box
does it however live up to the claims in
short no it doesn't performance wise
that they mixed bag it was a hard time
keeping up with flagships like the
iPhone 7 in dimmer situations from the
lack of oh is it software stabilized so
the camera needs a higher ISO to
compensate for using a faster shutter
speed and then that's when things start
to get noisy but in reasonable lighting
the primary sensors aperture of 1.7
produces sharp pictures with great depth
of field the dull colors have also been
improved from the oneplus 3 the oneplus
5 producing vibrance and true to life
colors the telephoto lens gets a small
aperture of 2.6 which makes the primary
sensor the only usable one in the dark
this lens gives an optical zoom of 1.6
as well as enabling portrait mode by
combining its information with the main
sensors
portrait images are good they come close
to the iPhone 7 plus is however there is
a weird halo effect that's more
noticeable when subjects have complex
edges but over time I expect oneplus to
improve on this through updates swiping
left and the camera UI gets you into
video mode where you have the option of
recording in 720 1080 and also 1080p at
60fps and of course 4k I would stick to
1080p here as 4k video is not stabilized
at all however I did read somewhere that
this will change soon through a software
update now when it comes to autofocus
that is accurate but it's a little on
the slower side so the software is
running is oxygen OS and it's basically
stock Android with a few tweaks on top
we get added custom
like being able to switch between
hardware and software buttons we also
get to change system themes and even
enable a night mode that changes UI
elements across the system the Shelf
remains to the left of the home screen
and here we can add widgets and
information although personally I would
have liked to see an option to switch to
Google Mouse page like on the Nexus
devices also there's now a gaming do not
disturb mode that stops any notification
when certain apps like games are open
another software edition is the extended
screenshot mode it will scroll down a
page capturing it until you tell it to
stop if you can do without an infinity
display then this is a solid phone with
all of its latest specs there runs a
close to stock version of Android and
oneplus has a history of timely updates
it has a great 1080p display and an old
metal design and the camera can hold its
own against top flagships it does
however suffering low-light due to the
lack of oh is hopefully oneplus
continues to tweak its performance
through software updates so is the
oneplus 5 worth its price tag well it
depends on what you're looking for so
that does it for my review of the
oneplus 5 I will be giving away this
