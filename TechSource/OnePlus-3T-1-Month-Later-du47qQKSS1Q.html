source and today we're going to be
reviewing the one plus three T well it's
not really a full review as I've already
made a video on the one plus three which
is essentially the same phone with a few
exceptions so instead I'm going to cover
all the differences between the two
models but if you guys want to know more
about the three T that isn't mentioned
in this video then you should check out
by one plus three review and I'll drop a
link to it down below so first off the
three T is the same in every dimension
and still has the same great unibody
build though there is a new color and
personally I like it better it's darker
and more space grayish but I use all my
phones with the brand skins on them so
the new color doesn't really matter to
me but it's worth noting by the way if
you guys want to check out some dope
skins for yourselves I'll drop a link to
them down below even though it shares
the same dimensions with you one plus
three the 3t gets a bigger battery going
from 3000 to 3400 milliamp hour that is
a 15% difference and this translated to
about 2 more hours of browsing on Wi-Fi
of course we get the same great -
charging which is still the best on the
market
powering this new one plus handset as
qualcomm latest offering you Snapdragon
820 1 this is a 2.35 gigahertz version
which is clocked higher than the 820 one
in the new pixel phone's general
performance is more or less the same
however the difference becomes more
apparent when you open up a heavy game
and start to really push this device
multitasking is also excellent with its
ridiculous 6 gigs of ram which is the
same amount found on the older one + 3
we still don't get a micro SD card slot
but max capacity has been improved with
a 128 gigabyte model now being available
the rear-facing camera is still the same
16 megapixel Sony sensor but the selfie
camera has now also gone up to 16
megapixel from the 8 on the older one
plus 3 you can clearly tell the
difference when comparing the two and
you selfie lovers out there are
definitely going to appreciate this
change images are just overall clearer
with its f 2.0 aperture which helps a
ton and low-light and with its higher
megapixel count you can now get more
room to crop and zoom everything else
the display build quality speaker cetera
are the same as the 1 plus 3 and again
if you guys want a detailed look at that
make sure to check out my review linked
below with these improvements also comes
a price there
friends of $40 bring in the new cost to
$440 from 400 in my opinion this phone
is for those who like these stock
experience but don't like the direction
Google has taken with their new pixel
phones you're getting a higher clocked
phone with arguably the same performance
for a substantial price drop oneplus is
also known for their great support in
fact while using this phone for a little
over a week now I received already two
software updates which just shows their
commitment to delivering the best user
experience possible but that is if my
review of the one plus 3t as always if
you guys want to check this phone out
I'll drop a link to it down below thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
