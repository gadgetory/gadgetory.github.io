my top five picks for the best
accessories for a Nintendo switch I know
I'm like two months late but hey better
late than never
what makes the switch so compelling is
its size you can easily fit this in a
bag and game on the move and that's what
I love about it so much however what
this portability comes the job of
protecting the device from damage I'd to
pick up some products from encase to
help us do just that there are a bunch
of these carrying cases on Amazon but
there are a few reasons why I went with
this one over the others the first
reason is that it holds the switch
without removing the joique on
controllers second it also holds 14 game
cards and finally it has a small storage
space that I found perfect for a small
external battery it's a hardshell case
so I don't have to worry about my switch
being crushed in my bag and it's also
being protected from the inside with
soft materials and finally this one's a
strange thing to note but I do like the
quality of the zipper it opens up
smoothly for those one the range for
sixteen dollars in Amazon this is a
killer deal so if you're looking for a
low profile case you should definitely
check this one out
unfortunately the switches display is
made out of plastic making it so much
easier than blast to scratch this is
especially bad considering the docking
station issues where the rails inside
would scratch the display this was a big
topic at launch and needless to say a
screen protector is necessary the
tempered glass screen shields are a
great solution now I won't get into all
the benefits of glass over plastic but
the big one here is drop protection I
take my switch almost everywhere with me
and the last thing I want is an
accidental drop cracking my screen
during the trip but the good news is
with one of these on the glass protector
will take most of the impact saving the
screen from a crack and because it's
glass it also feels better than plastic
when dragging your finger across the
screen what I know is you get two
protectors and everything you need to
install them highly recommend this deal
so let's move on to our next product
Nintendo's joique on charging grip now
what separates this from the grip
included with the switch besides the
clear plastic is its charging capability
to normally charge the controllers they
will need to be connected to the switch
which would pose issues when gaming on
my TV with a load
charge so with this we can charge the
joy constant rollers while gaming and we
can also plug it in via USB C to charge
the controller's battery pack at the
same time the charge McGriff is sold by
Nintendo for $30 which is a bit pricey
but in my opinion it is a must-have
speaking of power my battery pack of
choice is the Inca power cord 26800 the
switches battery size is four thousand
three hundred and ten million power so
with the twenty six thousand eight
hundred million power battery size of
the Power Core we can charge a switch
approximately five times
it also features rapid charge that
allows the power bank to be quick
charged through the USBC port as well as
fast charging technologies that fast
charge both non Qualcomm and qualcomm
devices to check the batteries remaining
level there is actually a simple
indicator light although I would have
preferred an LCD screen but I think
that's asking a bit too much for my
power bank also the price would have
been a lot higher this thing is the goat
guys each full charge on a switch lasts
about three hours and with five times
the juice I can get about fifteen hours
of game time on this thing before it
needs to be plugged into a wall this is
definitely a must for those of you who
are always on the go
so one design flaw the switch has is
with the kicks and the way it is by
default you can't charge the console
with the kickstand open when in the
tabletop orientation that's where the
holy compact placed and comes in that's
a simple solution that gives the user
three different tilt angles it pretty
much does exactly as advertised while
keeping all ports and buttons accessible
it does have rubber feet on the bottom
to keep everything stable and from
sliding and it works with a lot of
devices it also happens to work with my
fire tablet it's going for thirteen
dollars in Amazon right now and I highly
recommend checking this one out as well
I'm starting to sound redundant
obviously I recommend checking out all
of these products on my list otherwise
it wouldn't be in this top five video
the final accessory in this list
actually pairs great with the Hori
kickstand the co soon grips are the
perfect solution for on-the-go
multiplayer gameplay it gives the thin
and awkward to hold joique on
controllers a more traditional console
controller feel I tried this out with a
buddy while playing Mario Kart and it
works great you just slide the
controller in and
about it you honestly do get a more
comfortable grip without losing any
functionality they're made of plastic
and a little cheap but I don't see them
breaking unless you drop them from
existence or don't really care for them
you get two for the price of $13 and
once again this is another must-have so
that is if the video I hope you guys
