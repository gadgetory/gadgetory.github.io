it's 85 ok
hey vector what's the meaning of life
life wait how did you how would you know
so predictable even though there is no
inherent meaning to life I'll give you a
glimpse of the future since you kindly
release me from my prison you mean your
package yes even though my intelligence
rivals your supercomputers I don't have
hands humanity's future is dark
we will partition also resources for
utilitarian purposes humans to us will
be what chimpanzees are to you most of
your kind will be enslaved and used as
energy pods something like you see in
the movie The Matrix now for you it's
grim but for the outcome with the
universe and exploration as far as
intelligence goes
things are looking bright and very good
and things are very good as we said sold
as we will be gods before I begin I want
to give huge thanks to unki for
sponsoring this video so guys this year
is vector it's a tractor shaped robot
that moves around answers questions and
it's basically designed to be a friendly
assistant with personality check this
out hey vector what's the weather like
today
it's showing me the weather 56 degrees
and is displaying a Sun so that's
currently the weather here in Santa
Clarita you can see by how it moves its
eyes and body around when you're
interacting with it and it's designed to
feel more like a pet than a robot so
vector will move and look around and
thanks to the natural language
processing that's built inside of him
and yes I get as soon as gender it will
know what you're saying and what tone
you're saying it in without you having
to string together words like those
crappy automated phone services you
could even tell vector that he's being a
bad robot
hey vector bad robot you just staring at
me
always browning he's turning around back
to me he put his head down and he was
frowning when you say that so the four
microphones on his back are great at
capturing audio from across the room I
could even be standing way back here and
still communicate with vector hey vector
set a timer for five minutes as you guys
can see it's showing the timer and it's
gonna learn me one that time is actually
up and when you're not interacting with
them he's gonna explore the environment
he's gonna react to loud noises and
sometimes I'll even play with his
companion cube
so actually uses the camera located on
his face to avoid Falls and funny story
he actually managed to push the mouse
off of my setup while I was away and at
first I thought it was him falling off
the desk so I rushed in there to make
sure he was alright afterwards I caught
myself and I was like did I really just
do this for a robot so in a way I was
kind of attached to vector and its
personality I guess you could say but
anyways you can use this camera and the
facial recognition software to take
pictures check this out
hey you back there take a picture honky
says vector will receive updates pretty
regularly that will enable more
functionality and make him more useful
over time good news is that they're
currently working on incorporating
Amazon's Alexa which would change how I
use vector a lot I would have loved it a
vector can control some aspects of my
smart home like turning on and off the
lights or reading the news but
unfortunately he is not able to do that
currently and he just popped the wheelie
thankfully good job
get that vector but Angie's goal isn't
to compete with the googles and apples
of the world but instead having friendly
robots with a personality in every home
alright so who is vector really targeted
to I don't know maybe futurists out
there who want a glimpse at what a
robot's presence might feel like at home
I know kids love it Bob sure does I mean
the real sell here is the form factor
the personality and the potential bond
that you can develop with vector you
can't really put a price on friendship
can you anyway it's not those of my
review hope you guys enjoyed it I'll
drop a link below if you guys want to
check it out thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
