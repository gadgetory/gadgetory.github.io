welcome back to another episode of
what's in the box I apologize ahead of
time if I seem a little hyper I thought
it was great idea to go to of McDonald's
and get some coffee even though it's 8
o'clock and night so it's good though I
don't think I've tried it it's the
frozen brew coffee it's awesome and no
it's not sponsored McDonald's sponsored
we got damn it anyways what that said
let's just start the video by the way
have you guys had a chance to check out
my website deal source tech which is a
site where we find the best deals and we
upload them daily notice that it has a
dot tech domain same with my other
domain Edgard tech which takes you
straight to my youtube channel
I love these domains because not only is
it short and easy to remember but it
also perfectly represents me and the
type of content that I create I think
that dot tech is the perfect online
identity for anyone looking to build a
strong personal brand or start a tech
business you no longer have to
compromise with your domain name with
dot tech you can actually find the exact
name you want in fact there are a number
of leading startups on dot tech who in
the last two years have raised more than
500 million dollars these startups are
building the future on that tech and if
you're looking to start something of
your own use a tech domain to create a
strong brand right now you can get da
tech domain at ninety percent off if you
register for one year or five years just
make sure to use the code Edgar on
www.engvid.com
ek for the water-cooling build well it's
here ladies and gentlemen EK supremacy
evo and the RGB cpu block while that is
no how does a mouthful but anyways part
is here and this is also a pump bracket
for a 120 millimeter fan so I can mount
the pump
I guess they forgot the sentence as well
nonetheless all the parts are finally
here for my water-cooled build it's
gonna be it's gonna be awesome you guys
stick around I promise you guys gonna
love
moving on to the next box this one's
from coarser see what they got over here
lots of exciting stuff happening on the
channel the guys make sure you have
notifications enabled you guys you don't
want to miss out okay we just have a
power supply here's the HX 850 nothing
exciting here moving on okay not a box
from Corsair please be something more
exciting that a power supply just fans
combination of 140 millimeter and 120
millimeter that's okay guys next one's
from you egg oh just a couple things
okay we got the Vengeance RGB RAM sticks
from course sir this is 16 gigs at 3000
megahertz actually a light of 32 gigs
these are 2 16 gigabyte RAM sticks Wow
okay and we have the popular lifx
RGB strip which one of the things I love
about this compared to the Philips one
is that they're a lot brighter and I
feel like the app is a lot more user
friendly so I personally prefer lifx
/ Philips you but that's just my
personal taste this is going in an
upcoming setup video obviously this is
going an upcoming build so yeah blue
moon oh this one over here you guys this
is definitely the MVP of this episode
now this box is from v1 tech now they
are collaborating with me when I'm
collaborating with them on a very dope
project and this is some custom work
that they've done for me that's gonna be
included in that very dope project I
don't know if I can show you everything
in here because I kind of wanted to be a
surprise
shake this uh all this acrylic artwork
that is so freakin clean whoo that looks
nice
okay what else we got an RGB backplate
for the GPU check this out guys oh my
god that is beautiful
son man you guys over there you're
kicking ass you are seriously kicking
ass all right ladies gentlemen last but
certainly not least we have this massive
box coming from I don't even know where
that's just open this up by now
okay these are speakers from Edda
firewalls look really cool this is from
this is the spinnaker spinnaker it's an
how you say it I'm actually really
interested in these let me open this up
maybe even take it for a test drive
whoa these are actually a lot bigger in
person but make it look so small on the
box what's this is a speaker look at the
shape of this thing what the heck
okay yeah I I definitely have to hook
this up to my PC and at least test out
the audio they're actually not that
heavy - interesting interesting shape
but I'm not I don't hate it at the same
time I don't love it not yet at least
maybe it'll grow on me I don't know but
design aside I think what's more
important is the sound quality so I
really want to hook this up actually
since this is the last item unboxing
might as well hook it up to my PC and
test it out and see what it really or
how it sounds like alright guys so I
finally put the speakers together
don't judge me in the cable management I
literally just put this together right
now I'm actually working on a really
dope setup video for you guys stick
around it's gonna be sick
but anyways hooked up these speakers and
check this out comes with this really
cool remote over here that lets you
control the volume so you just basically
rotate this and you can hear the volume
going up on that it's really cool you
can also pause the music by pressing on
it and you can even skip tracks and
stuff like that so there's a little
wireless remote it's charging now but
hey guys it's really cool it's Wireless
- so you can put this anywhere you want
on your desk and you can charge it
whenever you want alright let's test the
audio quality okay first I'm going to
test the speakers and then I'm gonna
switch to the speakers from the monitor
just so you guys have something to
compare against here we go
so yeah way more bassy definitely
amazing in the highs these are some
really dope sounding speakers and it
look pretty dope depending on your taste
obviously but anyways moving on yeah
guys it's pretty much it for the video I
hope you enjoyed it I know it was short
and it wasn't as exciting as my previous
unboxing videos it's not normally like
this but I feel like I unboxed
everything already in the previous
episode it was 17 minutes of I think
like almost 20 boxes that I opened up in
case you guys missed it I'll drop a link
below check that out and also drop a
link to all the parts in this video as
well down below but anyways I love your
faces thank you so much for watching
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
