back again with another contest so LG
has reached out once again and asked me
to help them promote their new ultra
light festival 2017 dream quest
featuring their new 21 by 9 ultra light
gaming monitor that I did a video on
which you guys can find tomorrow on the
channel and just like the previous ultra
whitest ovals this one's going to have
some amazing prizes as well I think the
grand prize for this one is a $10,000
worth of gaming gear which is insane so
the final three runner-ups will be
awarded $2,000 worth of gaming gear to
create their gaming setup and then one
of those three will win a total grand
prize of $10,000 towards their gaming
setup and just to clarify the final
winner will still get the $2,000 from
the runner-up prize as well as an
additional 8,000 for the grand prize so
that is totally $10,000 worth of gaming
gear towards their new setup so how do
you enter the ultra white festival 2017
dream quest the instructions are
actually very simple
I love the link down below basically the
first step is to create a video so
you're gonna have to shoot and edit your
own original video of 144 seconds or
less showing why you need the LG
ultrawide monitor be sure to show your
face and the gaming PC's step 2 is to
show it off you have to upload the video
to your preferred social media platform
to get the most likes and shares you can
choose from Facebook YouTube or
Instagram but make sure to use the
proper hashtags otherwise your
submission won't count step 3 is to
complete the application click on the
accept quest fund below to fill out the
application form and the final step is
gaining engagement what you'll have to
do is promote your video to get as many
likes and shares as possible so the
contest runs from August 14th to August
23rd so the 23rd is actually the final
day that you guys can submit your
application and the way they evaluate
the winner is by judging the top 50
submissions
those 50 contestants will also receive a
$50 Steam coupon and are qualified to
move on to
second quest on August 28th is one of
the top 50 winning contestants with the
highest combined the likes and shares
will be announced so the second quest
ones from August 29th to September 12th
and there's actually two more missions
that you guys have to participate in the
top six finalists from the second quest
will receive a brand new LG 34 you see
89 G monitor while the top three will
move on to the final quest and over here
is where you guys have to be a bit
creative so this one's from October 1st
through October 4th and your mission is
to build the most powerful gaming setup
that showcases the performance of the
ultrawide monitor once again the
runner-ups will receive 2 grand worth of
gaming gear and the grand prize winner
will receive a total of $10,000 worth of
gaming gear so that is basically for the
video best of luck to whoever enters
I'll drop a link to the application
below also leave a link to the video I
did on the UCAN G which is an amazing
ultra wide martyr guy g-sync
166 hertz refresh panel once it's
overclocked the you guys have to check
it out in case you missed it thank you
so much for watching I will see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
