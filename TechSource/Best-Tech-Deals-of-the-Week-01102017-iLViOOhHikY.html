mind waiting a few weeks and if you
didn't get a chance to grab an Xbox one
s during the holidays then here's
another chance this is a one terabyte

cool deals on ebay include a 65-inch 4k
smart TV from samsung that comes in an
HTC sound bar for thirteen hundred
dollars and then we got the Philip C
wireless LED strip that I actually use
for my own setup and this is going for
only one hundred and twenty dollars keep
in mind that i paid around a hundred and
fifty dollars from mine last year and
i'm still using it till today without
any problems you can change the color of
the LED straight from your smartphone
which is awesome it's a bit pricey but i
highly recommend it the ps4 controller
is twenty dollars off also we do have
the DJI phantom 3 with 2.7 k video going
for three hundred fifty dollars but keep
in mind that this is refurbished and
charter for is back on sale for thirty
dollars only on ebay and this deal just
popped up on amazon actually while i was
editing this video one of my
favorite budget mechanical keyboards is
going for $35 currently the downside is
that it doesn't feature a 10 key but
this usually goes for around fifty
dollars so it's hard to pass up so that
