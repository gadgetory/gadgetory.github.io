today we're gonna take a close look at
two of McDonald's newest sandwiches that
got released here in the States a few
weeks ago I'm actually really excited
these are the bacon Clubhouse burgers
and you can choose between grilled or
crispy chicken and beef I made a
horrible choice filming this before
eating anything so I'm really tempted to
just dive right in but I'm gonna control
myself and continue with the unboxing
all right so first off let's take a look
at the world-famous french fries I went
ahead and picked up the regular size and
there's some sort of writing here on the
side here but it looks too faded as
there is a lot of grease spots on it so
I can't really read it
anyways taking a look at the side of the
fries we see that this serving has a
whopping 380 calories at 48 grams of
carbs which is great for anyone trying
to gain weight taking a closer look at
the french fries we can really begin to
appreciate the quality of this food I
can only imagine the amount of work it
takes to craft such a beautiful french
fry I mean look at that texture it's
truly irresistible that's enough about
the fries let's head straight into the
main course this ladies and gentlemen is
the crispy bacon clubhouse sandwich and
as I stated before you can choose to get
a grilled as well man the possibilities
McDonald's gives us are amazing so
opening up the box we immediately see
the juicy sandwich sitting there waiting
to get eaten and on the roof of the box
there's a message saying discover what
you love I don't know about you guys but
I'm in love what I just discovered so
let's get inside this sandwich and see
what it's made of literally we got some
lettuce which is covering that delicious
Big Mac sauce and making our way
downwards we are greeted with some
tomatoes that have been executed into
two pieces and moving even further we
discovered the applewood smoked bacon
which is neatly resting on top of the
cheese and it looks like they're both
attached to the actual chicken meat
which makes it super convenient to eat
you don't have to worry about the
ingredients sliding off the sandwich
when you take a bite truly innovative
when it comes to sandwich designs I give
McDonald's a solid thumbs up on that if
this sandwich doesn't look appetizing to
you then you must have already eaten
before
watching this anyways moving to the beef
version of the clubhouse burger which is
my personal favorite we are greeted with
essentially the same burger but with
100% beef you can also see that the
architecture of the burger is the same
as the previous sandwich after all why
would you change something that works so
well last but not least what is a
complete meal without a drink refresh
yourself with a cup of Coca Cola's
finest coke and if you're on a diet look
no further because they have a diet
option that's why you guys that means
zero calories and it's basically like
drinking water with a taste of coke
rest assured you don't have to add that
to your fitness pal anyways that is our
unboxing and first look at McDonald's
two amazing and delicious burgers that
got recently released which one of these
would you guys eat let me know in the
comment section down below this is Ed
from Texas and I'll</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
