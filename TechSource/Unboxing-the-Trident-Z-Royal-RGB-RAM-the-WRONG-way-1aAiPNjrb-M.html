stepped up once again if you guys are
not wearing RGB pajamas you shouldn't be
watching this video but in this video
we're gonna be taking a look at the very
hyped RGB RAM sticks from g.skill these
are the Trident Z Royale and I think
they've been featured in last year's CES
so if I actually have the samples in
front of me will it unbox them and take
a closer look at them so yeah what that
said let's do this
so actually I'm gonna flip these over
real quick and see the backside we can
clearly see on here that we have a 32
gig kit so we have four eight gigabyte
modules at 3200 megahertz
there's really no difference between
these two other than the last two
letters there's our s on this one and
then our G on this one which I have no
idea what those mean we're gonna
obviously open it up and figure it out
so let's actually start up with this one
and take a look at the packaging from
g.skill now I don't know if this is
gonna be the actual retail packaging but
this is the sample that they sent me to
unboxing this video here yeah here we go
let's do this what these are not your
average RAM sticks ladies and gentlemen
take a look at this Wow
so we have an old silver aesthetic it's
actually has a mirrored finish down
these are blinged up this is crazy that
actually looks pretty dope I'm not gonna
lie
this house so freakin they look so dope
I just put these aside real quick I'll
point up these other ones man these are
fingerprint magnets definitely gotta be
careful when handling these you do not
want to touch the surface at all so I'm
guessing that s on the back here stands
for silver and which makes sense the G
on the other one stands for gold so
let's go to put these aside and open up
the gold one
I think Gold's gonna be my favorite to
be honest let's put this aside oh my god
haha look at this yeah I think the gold
is definitely my favorite and it's so
crazy I think my all-time favorite RGB
RAM sticks had to be the original tried
and Z from G scale but I feel like these
these are gonna be my new favorite Wow
look at that surprisingly they're
actually very lights I would think they
would they would make this out of metal
but it kind of feels like plastic so
doesn't really had any any weight to
this I'm even scared to put it to put
this on the table like I don't even want
to scratch this thing just gonna put it
I'm just gonna put it back in here guys
I'll show you some sexy b-roll as I'm
talking about it obviously but yes
pretty much not much else to it they did
send me this box as well which I'm not
really sure what's inside it's opened us
up and take a closer look at it I would
love to pop this in a system and see how
these light up on the top portion over
here but let's see what this is
there's a compartment down here its pop
this open looks like we have a micro USB
cable on a microfiber cloth that looks
like a jewelry box Oh what it just looks
like empty DIMM slots for some reason am
I supposed to I'm supposed to plug these
in hold up let me let me try something
I think I think I know what this is for
actually let me plug this in real quick
and pop these RAM sticks in here and
I'll be right back
hi guys so I plugged in the USB to my
laptop let's pop these bad boys in and
see if it lights up
I mean audacity why else would there be
a microUSB cable oh I'm so scared of
touching a service these are so damn
beautiful damn I feel like if I'll wrap
our bill the PC like it would be using
these kind of rap sticks
bling it up there they're rigged like I
guess it's not lighting up I think I
broke it
I think I'm stick wow that was easy
well I guess since we opened it up let's
take a closer look inside shall we wait
I guess you know what my issue was I
guess I'm supposed to push on both sides
I was pushing on only one side and kind
of snapped up so my fault my fault and I
don't know guys this might be the
engineering samples so this might not be
the actual retail samples so yeah just
don't don't pay attention to any of this
so this crystal piece over here just
sits on top this is all plastic by the
way then you got the adhesive script
kind of just squeezing everything
together
yeah that's let's put this aside let's
go let's move on to the gold kit
all right take two let's do the gold kit
I'm gonna be careful this is the one I
actually liked so okay I'm gonna try not
to break this one there we go for a
split second I did see the RAM sticks
light up though so it's pop this and I'm
so scared how am I gonna snap this in
where's the why isn't lighting up oh oh
that is so sweet that looks legit that
looks legit
Wow okay let's put on the other three
actually see how it looks like I'm still
scared on snapping in place you may just
got a defective Ram stick he looked so
nice though I'm not gonna lie I would
definitely use these in a build what
would you guys rather see these RAM
sticks and would you want to see the
gold sticks in an old gold /black bill
that would you like to see the silver
RAM sticks in a black and silver bill
let me know in the comment section
because I am down to use these in an
upcoming build for sure
and then I break any ramp sticks okay
we're good we are good but take a look
at this guy's isn't that magnificent
just want to learn it all the way there
we go
so it looks like juice skills sent this
kind of display box to showcase how the
RGB RAM sticks would light up in your PC
and I think right now it's only
compatible with Asus are a sync but you
guys can download the software from G
skills website so we're using a
different motherboard like MSI for
example you can download software
straight from the website and configure
these you can configure each stick
individually or you can sync them all
together whichever you prefer obviously
for your color scheme but yes pretty
much yeah what do you guys think about
these meetings too much bling or doing
is just the right amount let me know in
the comment section as well as what
build I should wear what color schema I
should be using these in yeah I mean
they look pretty dope one thing I
noticed is that the crystallized plastic
on the top here helps kind of scatter
the lighting so there isn't any hot
spots when I like I usually see on on
the ramp stick so that actually works as
evenly spread across the top here I was
just thinking what if I do like a gold
and silver build like alternate the RAM
sticks do like gold silver gold silver
and then throughout the case you would
see like gold and silver parts from the
cables to other parts of the PC I think
that will look even more unique than
just doing to alternate colors by guys I
pretty much wraps up is quick unboxing
and look at the descale Trident Zyl RGB
RAM sticks damn that's a lot of words to
say
I just really hope the final product
isn't as flimsy or fragile because I
don't think I even applied that much
pressure here we play the clip again
real quick
I just feel like the heat subscrip maybe
wasn't applied on the right way or it's
not strong enough that's the only thing
I could think of why it pops out but any
who's I'm pretty much done here I'll
drop a link below if you guys want to
check these babies out expect that in
the coming build of course that's pretty
much it I love your faces drop a like if
you guys enjoy the video and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
