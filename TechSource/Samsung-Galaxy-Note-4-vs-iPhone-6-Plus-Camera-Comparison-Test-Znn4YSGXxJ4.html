cash for your iPhone so go ahead and
check them out it's simple fast and
secure what is up you guys it's ed from
tech source and in this video I will be
comparing the cameras on both the iPhone
6 plus and the galaxy note 4 before we
look at the samples let's take a quick
look at the camera specs the note 4 has
a 16 megapixel rear-facing camera with
an aperture of 2.0 some notable camera
features include autofocus touch to
focus digital and optical image
stabilization the camera can also shoot
in 4k resolution at 30fps the iPhone 6
plus has an 8 megapixel camera with an
aperture of 2.2 and some notable
features include autofocus tap to focus
slow motion at 240 FPS and optical image
stabilization the rear camera can also
shoot in 1080p at 60fps 4 front-facing
cameras the note 4 has a 3.7 megapixel
camera that can shoot in 1440p whereas
the 1.2 megapixel camera on the iPhone 6
plus can shoot only in 720p at 30fps
okay so that's enough about the specs
that sit back relax and take a look at
some samples I hope you guys enjoy the
video

what does it be guys it's a from tech
source and this is video comparison part
of these two phones pay attention to the
audio icon on the screen and quickly
shift between both of the phones and you
can tell which phone's audio is being
also all phones are strapped onto one
device so the stability will be equal on
all phones and it will give you a much
more accurate reading when watching the
video
you
when it comes to water focusing the
six-plus excels it uses the focus pixel
feature to quickly detect the object and
it is very accurate I'm definitely
impressed I have seen most other
smartphones focus pretty fast but none
has come close to these speeds however
though Ford doesn't do such a good job
the focusing speed is extremely slow and
sometimes it has a hard time detecting
the object even though it's right in
front of the camera the clear winner
here is obviously the iPhone 6 plus
so that concludes the camera test
between the Galaxy Note 4 and the iPhone
6 plus both phones did well for the day
like pictures and even daylight video
however the note 4 has much better audio
for night shots using flash I have to
give it to the iPhone 6 the note 4 flash
is just too much and it over exposes the
shot when it comes to low-light video I
am aiming towards the 6 plus since it
does have a lot less noise and more
sharper texture than the note 4 then
again these are my observations but I
wanted to hear yours which phone do you
think has the best camera and why let me
know in the comment section down below
I'm actually interested to read them
anyway this is ed from Texas thanks for
