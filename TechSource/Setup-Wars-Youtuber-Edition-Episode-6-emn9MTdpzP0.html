Drake and today we're going to be taking
a look at my dual workstation setup I'll
show you both and I'll show you the ups
and downs and what each is meant for and
stay tuned alright so starting off with
the first and primary setup we're
rocking a Mac Mini 2012 which in itself
sounds quite lame but when bundled was a
Samsung 850 500 gigabyte SSD as well as
16 gigabytes of ddr3 RAM it can actually
work as a setup to be reckoned with as
for the first monitor we're rocking an
HP 27 XW 27-inch monitor our second
monitor is an asus color accurate 23
inch monitor as for the desk peripherals
we're using a logitech g502 proteus core
and we're using the Cherry MX brown a
Logitech g7 10 Plus gaming keyboard
moving on to the next setup we now have
an iMac 2012 with a stock configuration
and we're using all the standard Apple
accessories except for the Logitech MX
mouse which you know the same deal can
go without it once again thanks to Edgar
for putting this project on and allowing
small youtubers like us to put our
content up thank you for watching and
peace I'll read Adam ladies and
gentlemen of Texas and welcome to the
TFI cut tips set up to a so TFI cut tips
isn't a physical product centric tech
channel hence why I'm recording all this
stuff on a phone and a selfie stick
attached to an office chair but never
mind this gig doubles up as a games room
and an office at the same time it's all
perched on the alpha sonorous the Glass
Works and a couple of the tools of the
trade there's 3d connection space mouse
pro and a wireless space navigator
alongside the Razer BlackWidow
mechanical keyboard and for mice I use a
razor now
for gaming and the 3d connection card
mouse on the 3d connection mousepad I
consciously decided not to go with
workstation grade hardware so I went for
the i7 4790k 32 gig of Corsair Vengeance
round GTX 970 all inside the H 440 case
and I've got a spare w 9 100 AMD FirePro
workstation card to slap in when I need
to get serious and as a tip of the cap
to styling good looks I've tried to keep
the inside of the PC looking fresh and
creamy so we've got a few acrylic back
plates going on there and that about
wraps me up so head over to TFI card
tips if you want to learn more about 3d
CAD modeling software thanks very much
to Ed for having me on and until then
I'll see you later
toodles how's it going guys Matt here
from the toastie bros and here is my
setup my setup consists of three non
matching displays which I plan to
upgrade at some point in time however
they do the job even though it does
drive me crazy at times they are a 19
inch HP monitor a Hisense 1080p TV and
an AOC 21 and a half inch monitor as for
keyboard I have here the black little
ultimate 2014 edition and for my mice

g600 2 in Razer Naga Moulton Edition for
this voiceover I'm using the blue Yeti
blackout Edition and this is my system

age however it still does the job in
