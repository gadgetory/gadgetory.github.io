and welcome to the final episode of the
LG ultralight competition sponsored by
LG where the winner will receive a brand
new gaming or productivity ultrawide
monitor in case you guys missed my
review I'll drop a link to it down below
but with that said welcome to the 4th
episode 106 let the setup wars begin
starting of the show is a very
interesting setup from Ivan it's got a
Razer theme but what's cool about it is
that he wrapped his desk in carbon-fiber
I just got an idea for a video so on a
desk he's got the 27-inch Samsung curved
monitor and some Razer peripherals the
Deathstalker keyboard and Naga Mouse for
audio we got a pair of M audio bx5
speakers and a rode NT USB microphone
and of course you got the Razer Kraken
pro gaming headset even as PC case is
the Razer version it's got the i5 4460
and an a vga GTX 970 most of the cable
management is under control with the
Signum rack and a massive power strip
however a few velcro straps will
definitely fix up the cables on the
right side I would recommend a hanger
for those headphones and some speaker
stands so that the bass doesn't rattle
the desk maybe even a boom arm for the
microphone but all in all it's a very
nice Razer team setup Thank You Ivan for
entering and good luck next up is Jake
and his music production setup the star
of the show is the 32 inch vizio 1080p
TV that he is using as a monitor and
that's being sandwiched by two massive
genius speakers he's also using the as
vo mechanical keyboard and the MX master
mouse on top of a tiny-ass mousepad how
do you do it seriously my boy Jake is
using the pencil drawer that I featured
in a bunch of my videos major props
installing this on their desk looks like
you're keeping your Kindle a few knives
and Watchers in here very nice this is a
music production setup so he's got stuff
like an audio box interface on the top
of the speakers
we got a Line six guitar amp on the
floor and an audio technica at2020
microphone off to the side cable
management isn't that bad I mean he did
hook up the power strips on the bottom
of the desk but the cables are still
visible a simple fix to this would be a
cable sleeve and there's a variety of
options you can choose from I'll drop a
link down below if anyone is interested
and finally we got the PC that's inside
the s340 case it's rocking a 60 70 K and
an Asus GTX 1060 honestly if it weren't
for that orange paint on the walls this
would have been a cool white and black
setup regardless thank you Jake for
entering and good luck
of white and black here's another one
with some red accents josh is using the
27 inch HP monitor red dragon RGB
keyboard with a SteelSeries rival mouse
this is actually a budget set up because
he's using the standard dell a 250
speakers and the Logitech G 230 gaming
headset speaking of budget the PC has a
6100 and an MSI R X 480 I love that even
though they budget build he still stayed
consistent with these setups theme no
complaints at the cable management or
the whole setup for that matter it's a
simple budget setup that Josh managed to
keep very clean and once again a huge
props on staying consistent with the
color scheme thank you and good luck at
number four we got a pretty tiny black
and red setup from Joshua look how
smaller the monitor is compared to the
PC he definitely needs a monitor upgrade
so on the glass home desk from Ikea he's
got the cooler master Pro RGB keyboard
and the me onyx catch their mouse and
this actually is interesting the
keyboard and mouse wire are routed
towards the right side and under his PC
I feel like that was the best option
considering he can't drill any holes in
that glass desk under the desk we can
see his Sennheiser HD - OH - headphones
and a dog tents house box I don't know
I'm just going to call it a dog home
cable management is pretty decent we got
some cable clips holding up the wires
and there's also a power strip under the
desk which is actually hard to see from
the front some of the things he has on
the desk is the fake IKEA plants which
pretty much everybody has at this point
an iPhone 6 with leibrandt skins and a
Lego model of falling water for those of
you that don't know falling water is a
very popular home designed by America's
most famous architects the more you know
anyways it's a very clean and simple
setup Thank You Joshua for entering and
good luck
I just realized there are four
contestants in this episode that have
their names start with a J that was
definitely not planned anyways last but
not least we got jewel and a pretty
simple setup between you 24-inch Samsung
monitor CM storm quickfire TK keyboard
and not one but two mice the Logitech G
300 and the func r2 I don't see these
that often but when I do I question the
reasoning behind it I mean
there has to be a mouse out there that
meets both of your needs Ferrario is got
a pair of Logitech Z 333 speakers and
the SteelSeries Siberia v2 gaming
headset I can appreciate the attempt at
cable management's I mean there's a tube
that's covering the wires and the
keyboard and mouse and a few more under
the desk the Signum is holding up
majority of the wires but there's just
too many wires spilling from everywhere
also down here we got the PC which has a
6600 K 16 gigs of ram and the XFX HD
7850 user don't need to upgrade your
monitor you definitely need a new GPU
though this thing is ancient I do like
the custom one understand that you
created and the USB hub that you hook it
up under that I think that looks awesome
but that tabletop really doesn't belong
with this color scheme I honestly would
have gone with either light or black
even regardless it's a pretty decent
setup Thank You jewel for entering and
good luck so that is if it's episode of
setup wars as always make sure you guys
vote using the night staff down below
those are the only vote I am counting
just for the ultra light competition
just to avoid cheating thank you guys so
much for watching I'll announce the
winners as always on the weekend on my
social media platforms thank you so much
for watching I will see you in the next
