to my new series on the channel well
technically it's not a new series but
rather a recurring type of video we will
be checking out some pretty cool
keyboards ranging from budget all the
way up to high-end and even some of the
unique ones that I come across on Amazon
but to kick off this video we're gonna
be checking out a $25 mechanical
keyboard that I picked up on Amazon just
a few weeks ago and I want you guys to
be honest in the comments section down
below if you like this idea that way I
can continue doing it on the channel but
before we get into the video I want to
give huge things to audio blocks for
sponsoring it they're currently giving
away seven days of audio blocks for free
if you guys visit Aria blocks comm slash
YouTube and I'll drop a link to it down
below audio books of course has one of
the largest audio libraries or over a
hundred thousand clips loops and music
and sound effects some of which I've
even used in my past videos they are all
royalty-free so you won't get hit with
any copyright claims which is awesome I
highly recommend them if you're a
content creator like me and are
constantly looking for new music or
sound effects to put in your videos in
fact the background music you are
hearing right now in this video is from
audio blocks and I think it's called
old-school loving or something like that
but anyways check them out and get your
seven days of audio blocks for free by
visiting re blocks comm slash YouTube
also drop a link down below what that
said I'm done let's get right into the
video
mechanical switches used to be a product
exclusively made by the Cherry
corporation and where there is
exclusivity there is high prices but
recently the patent cherry owned on the
switch design ran out and there has been
a flood of more affordable options into
the market and that's where this jelly
comb keyboard comes in it features what
the company is calling blue switches and
it's paired with multicolored lighting
at a price of only $25 if done right
this could be a recipe for success but
let's find out if this is a flop or a
buy so the keyboard is put together very
well with a metal top plate and plastic
bottom tray I was honestly surprised by
how heavy and robust it is considering
its price tag I wouldn't be worried if I
accidentally ended up dropping it or
dropping something on it we've got the
usual rubber on the bottom so it won't
slide around while you are using it as
well as a kickstand feet for
adjustability pretty standard stuff
the USB cord is a nylon braided cable
and if you haven't noticed yet this
keyboard isn't true RGB instead each row
has its own color and that's about it
there are six lighting modes however
that the user can cycle through straight
from the keyboard we actually get some
control over the direction of the effect
on a keyboard with the function plus
left or right keys and of course we have
control over the brightness as well
unfortunately I can't turn off the jelly
comm logo but it's not really a big deal
seeing as some tape solves that issue do
the function keys we also get full media
control as well as quick access to my
computer search calculator and even a
default windows music app now it's time
to get into the switches themselves
these are definitely some of the loudest
switches I've ever used which is a good
thing if you're looking for a blue style
switch the feel kind of reminds me of
those ancient bulky IBM keyboards if
you're old enough to remember what those
were like in short the tactile feel
gives great feedback as to where the
activation point makes this keyboard
great for gaming I also found it
enjoyable while typing on it with those
satisfying clicking noises but to me
personally I much prefer brown or even
red switches the only real negative I
see with this product is that it doesn't
have a number pad but if you're looking
for a keyboard that does holding a
comparable model down below so for $25
you get blue equivalent switches and a
keyboard body that is built very well
you don't get in the RGB customization
or a numpad now also if you're a
streamer your mic will definitely pick
up the clicking noises but if none of
that bothers you and you're in the
market for a solid mechanical keyboard
for only 25 bucks you should definitely
check this one out if you guys enjoy
these quick keyboard videos let me know
by leaving a like and if you don't feel
free to dislike just so I know if I
should continue doing these I do want to
do at least once a week or maybe once
every two weeks so let me know what your
feedback is in the comment section down
below thank you guys so much for
watching I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
