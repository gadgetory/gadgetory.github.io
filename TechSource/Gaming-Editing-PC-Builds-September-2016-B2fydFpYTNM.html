and welcome to pcs of September what's
up guys is that from Texas and welcome
to September's PC builds at this time
I'm gonna be looking at two different
configurations the first one will give
you the most performance for your money
and the second one is kind of a
ridiculous build featuring two Titan X's
in SLI and also for those of you who are
new to the channel I have two different
types of PC content on tech source the
one that you are watching now usually
happens within the first week of each
month and these are theoretical PC
builds where I basically talk about the
parts that I would use for my own PC if
I were to build one and then later on
during the middle of the month is when I
actually do a physical build with the
time lapse the benchmarks and the
occasional build guide so yeah I just
wanted to clear that up because some
people are kind of confused but as
always you guys can find all the parts I
mentioned in this video link below so
without wasting our time let's start off
with the first PC so starting off we
have a bang for your buck gaming PC
featuring the i-5 6500 it's a solid quad
core CPU that'll get the job done when
it comes to gaming and since we're not
going to be doing any overclocking I
didn't pick up a CPU cooler which also
means that AZ board is not needed
instead I went with the gigabyte h1 10 M
motherboard with support of up to 32
gigs of DDR for ram and onboard USB 3.0
this motherboard gives you the best bang
for your buck on a skylake PC build all
we need for gaming is 8 gigs of RAM and
I went with a g.skill ripjaws since they
are currently the coolest and have the
lowest price when it comes to 2 4
gigabyte sticks we do have one terabyte
of hard drive space from Seagate for
storage however I did add an additional
240 gigabyte of space from a data SSD
which will be used for the operating
system and a few important programs the
graphics card we are going with in this
build is two goodbye gtx 1070 g1 gaming
this will get you over 60fps and
triple-a titles maxed out in 2k
resolution that's 2560 by 1440 P you can
also get some pretty nice frames between
40 to 70 and 4k resolution as well
depending on the settings you've used
and you can watch my gtx 1070 video if
you guys want more benchmarks
powering this entire build is the EVGA
700 watt 80 plus bronze certified power
supply and we are going
with the fantex eclipse p400 ATX tower
this entire PC build will cost you at
$1000 plus tax and shipping of course if
you have a budget of around $1000 this
is the PC I highly recommend for gaming
all right now let's get a little crazy
and build a monster gaming and editing
rig we have a 59 60 X 8 core processor
that's overkill for gaming but I picked
this up because it's amazing for editing
obviously we need to keep the CPU cool
since we are going to be pushing it to
its limit hence why I went to the
corsair h 110 i GTX CPU cooler which is
one of the best high-end a i/o cooler is
currently out in the market we are
spending quite a few pennies in this
build so we can't cheap out on the
motherboard now although there are a lot
of options out there that offer a ton of
features for a lower cost high simply
said screw that and went with the best
motherboard that offers all the bells
and whistles the rog rampage 5 Edition
10 full our RGB illumination supreme FX
hi-fi audio built-in Wi-Fi and safe slot
on all of the PCI slots which by the way
supports up to four-way SLI
I did do a review on this so because are
interested in checking this out make
sure to watch the video linked below for
RAM we are going with 32 gigabytes of
Dominator Platinum's waited at 3200
megahertz and for storage we have a few
drives a 256 gigabyte 950 Pro for the OS
and several important programs and a one
terabyte 850 Evo with a four terabyte
Western Digital black for the bulk of
the storage although to Titan X's are
completely unnecessary and you won't be
getting your money's worth by adding a
second one I decided to add one anyways
because why not this is an overkill
build after all to do sup is bad boys
and the rest of the parts I went with
the coarser 1,000 watt 80 + platinum
fully modular power supply and housing
all of these parts as the cursor 750d
full tower case this entire build will
cost you a little over 6500 but that
will do for this video as always if you
guys enjoy these videos be sure to leave
a like and also drop your comments down
below letting me know what type of build
and budget you guys want me to work on
for my next month's PC build whether
it's a $300 gaming PC or a $6,000
editing PC whatever it is let me know in
the comments below
thinking as much for watching and I will
see you
next video
