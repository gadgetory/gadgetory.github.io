impact someone's life and I get to
completely redo someone set up entirely
from scratch gonna make a nice snug fit
so the PC doesn't move around in the
back otherwise this whole trip would be
a waste it's also the biggest series
I've ever started on the channel there
is so much that went into planning this
that took more than four months to
complete
I think we got everything here let's uh
let's go change someone's life yeah I
think when I first announced the series
in that channel and started accepting
submissions we got almost a thousand
applications we got over 900
applications in and we have to sift
through every single one of them and
pick one person that not only deserved
and you set up but also needed a new set
up the coolermaster team narrowed it
down to ten finalists and from that ten
we all went through and we had to pick
one person that stood out the most and
out of that ten Philips submission was
the one that stood out
hey tech source I just saw your video on
the setup makeover so this is my video
submission applying so what inspired you
to apply for a makeover from tech source
and called coolermaster one of the
reasons was I wanted to get a new
computer to be able to give mine away to
my fiance it's not she doesn't have a
lot of money and she's needs a new
laptop so if I was able to give her mine
it would provide her with another avenue
to do her schoolwork I don't know I
necessarily deserve a makeover I'm sure
there's plenty of people who deserve it
more than I do or more needy than I do
you know one of the things that helps me
the stress from my week at work is
gaming and I really enjoy it and it
helps me just a couple of some of the
things that I have to see I would also
be working on my degree towards criminal
justice trying to get a masters in that
so that's a mission pretty much checked
all the boxes we were looking for the
first one is he has a purpose for this
setup he likes the game and he goes to
schools so he can use it for schoolwork
as well number two he has a goal in life
he wants to get a masters in criminal
justice and number three which was a
very important quality is giving it back
he said he was able to give his macbook
to his fiancee once he does get a
brand-new set up and he does have a
brother and sister so he is going to
allow them to use the setup for either
gaming and schoolwork as well which we
thought was really nice
all right so the plan for today is to go
over to his house set everything up in
one day get his reaction maybe ask a few
questions about the setup if you liked
it
what do you didn't like about it wrap it
up and then come home right now GPS is
saying that it's gonna be a little over
two hours to get there which is pretty
good actually because I think we got
lucky on the first contestant
considering that is only two hours away
I was just thinking what if somebody
else lives in a different state or lives
like six or seven hours away that would
have been even more difficult so is it
the second time we're actually going to
Phillips house the first time we went
there we told him we needed him for an
interview because we were interviewing
the last ten contestants which wasn't
true by the way and we only said that as
an excuse to go over to his house and
check it out check out his setup and
everything and we actually recorded that
entire day here's a quick flashback
alright guys so after an hour drive we
finally made it to Phillips house and
apparently he lives in the middle of
nowhere
there's like nothing inside but a bunch
of grasses and trees and his ass is
right there on the left side he still
doesn't know that we're here so I'm
gonna go surprise him let's go check it
out
that moment we've been waiting for hey
hey what's going on dude good this for
you Wow yes I've been really nice sighs
hello Edgar nice to meet you how you
guys doing good
awesome I'm sure he's uh he's told you
about us a little bit well that's the
random strangers coming in here
hi I heard about you nice to meet you
Edgar that's my camera guy Bob and
coolermaster team right there
sorry man nice to meet you finally
person you like you look just like the
just like I you are in the videos now
they haven't changed one but that's good
that's good so awesome dude I guess
we're gonna check out your setup first
in room if you want to show us you know
after that we're gonna look a quick
little interview ask you some questions
and things like that this is it yeah
awesome wireless mouse cool cool I mean
as soon as he said that he was gaming on
that MacBook I think like a piece of my
soul just disappeared from my body so
awesome cool so you got your MacBook
there what what year is that MacBook
2015 ok nice cool so yeah man this is
your setup walking a laptop basic
wireless mouse that's pretty much it
yeah that's pretty much it
not much else to decorations man it's
what's going on there this video
organized and the drawers are gonna be
missing apps like bunch of papers yeah
cool
awesome I'm gonna be as honest as
possible that setup was I was trying to
be as polite as possible in person not
to give him a hard time but if Phillip
submitted that setup to set up words
that would easily be a great contender
for the worst set up edition aka the
potato edition hands down needless to
say he definitely needed a setup
makeover so the first time we went there
we actually created this fake interview
where we were auditioning the last ten
contestants to basically choose the
final one within that ten Phillip had no
idea that he was in fact the chosen one
so we sat down we asked them a bunch of
questions and then the final question
was the big one one final question how
do you feel how do you feel being the
chosen one for the setup makeover van
you set up Mac from scratch give your
laptop to your fiance good upgrade you
new monitors everything no am i getting
pranked here anything guys I'm the same
like as you man I don't win anything out
no lottery tickets
no like those those sweepstakes they do
zero never gamble no no gambling guys
you heard up and fill up right hand
don't do it so you losers
congratulations
the next step is to figure out
we're gonna get you honestly his
excitement got all of us excited to see
someone so genuine win a huge prize from
Texas you know I do a lot of giveaways
on the channel and sadly there are
people who just subscribe or like videos
just to participate and win they don't
really care about the channel or
supporting the channel and that's fine I
get it you know there's really no way to
validate if someone is a loyal
subscriber or a supporter of the channel
that's just the nature of doing
giveaways on YouTube that's why it felt
really good to reward a loyal subscriber
that's been watching my videos and
supporting the channel for a long time
I love awarding loyal subscribers more
than anyone else people that like the
video even before it starts to drop
comments and just really support the
channel those other subscribers that I
love doing these types of videos with
the only thing I'm concerned about right
now is everything goes according to plan
I have this vision in my mind of how the
setup has to look like and I hope that
comes to life when I put everything
together I'm just hoping that the final
product matches what the design was or
at least very close to it that's that's
the only issue I'm just hoping that
Phillip really likes to setup I would
say the hardest thing about all of this
is creating a setup that Phillip would
enjoy other thing I'm concerned about is
leaving something behind
obviously we're driving over two hours
so I made sure to double-check every
single component but knowing me I always
forget something behind so whether it's
something really small or stupid like a
screwdriver or maybe even the monitor
mount RGB strips whatever it is would
you expect of course I forgot some stuff
for my interview with Phillip I've
gathered some information and what type
of setup he would enjoy and so far I
know that he likes the colors white blue
and purple he's a huge Star Wars fan and
he likes space for lots and lots of
storage and of course a badass gaming PC
because he loves the game I mean I don't
know how he would game on a MacBook in
the first place but I know he likes
again so needless to say the
possibilities are endless so we got to
work I hit
David who is the master of 3d printing
and actually helped me out with the
Wolverine setup a ton and apparently
he's great at 3d designs as well so he
decided to throw around some ideas
originally I wanted to start off with a
dual monitor setup but the symmetry just
wasn't there and the layout just looks
weird to me I mean the position of the
shelves so the speakers were in a
terrible spot and I just wasn't happy
with the first draft so I threw in an
extra monitor now it was looking like a
badass setup but I thought to myself
this guy is coming from a MacBook what
the hell is he going to do with three
monitors then I decided to add a nano
leaf on the top of the set up to you
know just add some spice and color to
this setup so David put together a few
designs and at this point I'm like what
on earth am i doing I feel like I'm
creating another ultimate desk setup I
told myself I don't want this to be
overkill obviously I do want a nice
upgrade for him but at the same time I
wanted to be sufficient you know I want
him to utilize everything in the setup
so if I give him like three monitors and
he's only using one kind of a waste and
that's kind of the wrap that I was going
with for this first setup so with that
in mind I actually decided to go with a
different route
hey guys I hope you enjoy the first part
of setup makeover the finale will be on
