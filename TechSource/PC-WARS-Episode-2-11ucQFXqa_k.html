Episode two where you submit your desk
so what the hell what's up guys is that
back again from Texas and welcome to PC
Wars Episode two where you submit your
custom PC to get featured on the channel
and a chance to win a hundred bucks if
you guys are new to the series and want
to submit your custom PC make sure to
watch the video link down below so with
all that said let the PC wars begin
this video is brought to you by GTA
where you can buy super cheap CD keys
for any game on any platform this is
where I get all my games from as well as
Windows Keys for my monthly PC builds
but I'll leave a link down below so you
can see for yourself as always all the
parts and these PC builds will be linked
down below for anyone that is interested
but here are your five contestants for
this week
Deo Han Alvin Faisal Jeff and Josh
that's for making it into PC wars
episode 2 Deo han is first up with his
NZXT build and look how handsome that
faces just look at it no but seriously I
do miss my H 440 case and it has served
me well and it's just a phenomenal case
and I will never get tired of seeing it
so in this bad boy we have an i7 4790k
processor and MSI GTX 980 and 16
gigabyte of Corsair Vengeance RAM
clocked at 2400 megahertz we also have
the H 100 i from Corsair to keep things
cool now for benchmarks it's scored an
eleven thousand six hundred eighty-two
which isn't bad considering it only has
a single graphics card on the other hand
cable management is not that bad however
I'm not really a fan of the stock PSU
cables but it is what it is next up is
Elven with his custom-designed PC all
the parts are carbon fiber venial which
are hand coded by himself so plus one
for the awesome craftsmanship I dude I
absolutely love the black and red strips
on the top and the ROG and GeForce logos
you have on the side of your case you
should honestly start your own business
and sell these because I would buy them
in a heartbeat so instead exercise the
PC is running on a 4790k processor which
is overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz and has
a GTX 970 graphics card 16 gigabytes of
vengeance program at 1866 megahertz and
an H 100 GTX to keep things cool so
apparently the custom work doesn't stop
there we have a custom cover for the PSU
GPU and even though RAM sticks job well
done indeed I also notice the two
painted PCIe brackets near the back and
it's going to take a look at the
benchmarks so got a modest score of ten
thousand three hundred eleven which
isn't bad honestly I love what you did
with the PC this is a unique build but
if you took the extra steps to do all
that custom work I would definitely
replace those stock PSU cables
that's basically the only thing you are
missing from joining your PC into one
sexy monster next up we have Faizal from
setup wars episode 16 which he ended up
winning an ultra-wide monitor for so
congrats on that man so we have another
custom-designed PC all the red covers
here have been handcrafted from acrylic
including the PSU cover the GPU
backplate and even the custom-made hard
drive cage up top with the corsair logo
honestly brilliant work the pc itself
has an i5 4440 cpu an MSI r9 280
graphics card 16 gigabytes of vengence
ram at 1600 megahertz and an H 100 ICPO
cooler for benchmarks I managed to score
a 7000 52 which is expected from an i5 I
don't know what's going on with those
twisted cables from the GPU but
everything else looks awesome and give a
pretty sick black and red PC Jeff is
next up with his air 540 build so we
have a 4790k CPU pair with two gtx 970
super clock edition graphics cards along
with 16 gigabyte of Dominator platinum
Ram and an H 55 CPU cooler for
benchmarks that scored a fifteen
thousand 425 which puts this PC at the
number one spot for the most powerful PC
so far in this episode loving the custom
cables from cable mod and the custom
painted grills on the case very clean
build and the cable management is
spot-on honestly I don't have any
complaints last but not least we have
Josh with our very first water-cooled
build we have a 4770k overclocked to 4.0
gigahertz paired with an EVGA GTX 780 Ti
and to a sli we also have 16 gigabyte of
vengence ram and water cooling parts
from ek 4 benchmarks and scored a
whopping 17 thousand 433 which ends up
taking the lead and claiming the top PC
performance spot for this episode it's a
great build but I think it's lacking
sophistication and design the tubes
don't have a unique pattern and they are
just connecting to the blocks more by
convenience than aesthetics I really
think that the potential of this bill is
being shadowed by not only the stock PSU
cables but the case itself nonetheless
that's our very first water-cooled PC
and it's a very clean build at that
Thank You Josh for entering so that's it
