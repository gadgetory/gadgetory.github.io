edges of my monitor are even aligned
with the foams damn I'm so good what's
up guys it's that back again from tech
stores and it's a new month which means
it's time for another episode of ask
everywhere you guys submit your
questions via Twitter and I answer them
in a video so I'll received a buttload
of questions from you guys so I'm really
sorry if I don't get to answer your
question in this video I'm trying to
keep this as short as possible that's
big if you had to pick between YouTube
boy your girlfriend what would you pick
they can only choose one alright
starting off with a wait wait a great
question already obviously YouTube if
you could change the theme of your
YouTube channel from text to something
else what would it be definitely I would
do a gaming channel if there was a fire
and you could only save three pieces of
tech what would they be you have to
carry them all at once let's see three
pieces attack that's an interesting
question my PC would be way too heavy to
carry
especially if I'm taking three so I
would say my phone my Sony camera and my
laptop what made you switch to PC
technically Mac's are also considered PC
I've actually used Windows PC since I
could remember so I haven't really
switched to PC I've just kind of stuck
with it and even in school I've tried
using like the Mac computers and it's
just horrible to me I can't stand that
software how do you pronounce your last
name oh gun nasty on do you think you
could do a 250-pound budget build
without an APU that's a pretty cool
challenge if I can other parts linked
down below so check it out do you
perform mechanicals or no M keyboards
and it's actually funny you say that
because on Twitter and Instagram and I
posted a picture of my new mechanical
keyboard I'm not gonna tell you what it
is you have to check it out how do you
get the names for your PC builds and get
this asked so many times the process is
simple
I sit there lonely at night thinking of
my past all the things I regret
things I love and care about what is the
meaning of life is their purpose to do
what is your favorite character in
Spongebob and why definitely Squidward
because I feel his pain every single day
goddamn annoying sponge hey ed have you
ever considered doing a custom water
cooling loop on your main PC yes I
mentioned as before when I get to it
hopefully in the beginning of 2016 which
is coming up I want to build an awesome
monster ultimate water cooling PC bill
for myself so it should be interesting
what would you do with a million dollars
buy cookies for all your subs heck no
I'll buy a mansion hire a bunch of
people who help me make videos I'm just
kidding of course I care about you guys
I'll buy every single one of you a
custom built PC how you stay motivated
to put all this hard work into making
videos that's a good question RC king
there's a reason why I put that plaque
above there just so I can look at it
every time I want and that gives me lots
of motivation to continue that's like a
symbol it tells me that I've
accomplished something and that I'm in
the right path also the feedback you
guys leave me in my videos contributes
to my motivation so thank you guys what
is your work program what's the process
for releasing your videos get the
products whether I'm buying it or
getting it for review record a video get
lots and lots of footage script for the
video voice over edit so how is the
Alexus described in one word awesome
tastic ab ulis intel or AMD haha that's
a good one how often do you buy new
parts since you have the room full of
parts that have been used before it's
quite simple really if I'm building a PC
that doesn't have the part that I need
I'll go out and buy it
can I have giveaway PC please know
what's one mistake you've made somewhere
in your youtube career that other
starting youtubers may be able to avoid
honestly I wouldn't really say I've made
any mistakes I've done some things in
the past that I probably should have
done differently but I wouldn't change
them because I've learned from those and
it
me a better person and it helped grow
the channel so the only advice I can
really give you is just go with the flow
if you do make a mistake or if she would
have done something differently then
learn from that and become a better
youtuber do you stress yourself out if
so is it the content or just in general
honestly the most stressful part about
this is trying to push out the content I
get one project done and then two more
projects pop up so it's really stressful
trying to get these videos out before it
just gets piled on are you all set on
studio gear such as lighting and tripods
or is there something you are looking
into buying honestly I think I'm really
happy with everything right now I have
all the gear I need there's nothing I
really want to upgrade I was gonna play
the camera early 2016 but you know what
the quality is perfect I don't shoot
outside my controlled lighting situation
so I'm okay
is there anyone other than Bob which was
very influential in you becoming who you
are today well if it wasn't for Bob I
wouldn't have a youtube channel but
having a tech channel I would say I was
influenced mainly by unbox therapy if
YouTube didn't exist what would you do
for a living honestly I don't know maybe
continue banking because that's what I
was doing before so maybe like a banker
or a branch manager or something your
girlfriend or your car obviously my car
do you plan on expanding tech source in
the future by getting people to work for
you or carry on individual that's a good
question Ruben I've been seriously
thinking about it with the growth of
tech stores being so rapid and not
slowing down anytime soon I kind of want
to bring in one or two more actual
people to help push content sometime mid
2016 hopefully that's the plan and then
later in 2017 I want to get an office
building and I have like two or three
people work for me full-time kind of
like a Linus Media Group and that as big
because that requires lots of
responsibility and pressure and stress
which I don't want to deal with so
something small like that just to make
sure I can push out one video a day
that's the ultimate goal right now
protects
so that's it for all the questions thank
you guys so much for sending them in
again I'm really sorry if I didn't get
to answer your questions a lot of them
were actually answered before in my
previous ask me videos I'll drop a link
to the playlist if you guys want to
check those ads well yeah make sure to
follow me on Twitter so you guys can
participate in the next month
ask edgar video just be on the lookout
for the hashtag ask edgar thanks again
for watching and i'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
