and in this video I want to be going
over five of my favorite games that I
play on my Android phone so before we
get into the list I want to show you how
I got these apps and there's actually a
way to get a lot of them for free so if
you go ahead and download the Amazon App
Store through the link in the
description you will be prompted to
enable unknown sources and install the
App Store apk file from there launch the
application and search for any app you
want the first game I'll be showing you
is called where's my water and it
usually runs for $0.99 on the Play Store
but from the Amazon App Store it's
completely free
the objective here is to simply draw a
path for the water to escape and reach
the alligator you can get achievements
by soaking the duck along the path and
with all of these levels this puzzle
game is a great way to keep yourself
entertained next up we have one of my
favorite racing games
this is beach buggy racing and for a
free game I was actually very surprised
with how good the graphics were and how
smoothly it can run on even a budget
device if racing games aren't your thing
that I got you covered with an awesome
arcade style game
this is orbital X an objective is super
simple yet addictive the goal is to
avoid hitting the increasingly difficult
obstacles as your sphere travels around
the track the fourth app is another
puzzle game called Monument Valley while
at first the concept of the game might
seem a bit strange it can quickly become
addicting and already found myself
sinking an hour into it the objective is
to help the character cross bridges and
platforms by opening doors going up
stairs or even sliding platforms the
minimalistic graphics and calm
soundtrack make this title definitely
worth checking out for casual gamers
finally at number five we have geometry
dash now many of you might already be
familiar with the game and how it works
but basically this is the most addictive
free platform game on Android the
objective is to survive for as long as
possible while your cube goes through a
crazy track of obstacles along the way
you can find spikes portals and bridges
but what makes this game really unique
is the endless level of stages coupled
with the amazing soundtrack this is
definitely a must-have game for any
Android device now normally this would
be a paid game but through Amazon's App
Store this and most of the other games
on this list can be downloaded for free
for paid games like Monument Valley all
you have to do is visit amazon.com slash
buy coins and here's where you can
really save a lot of money by buying
Amazon coins which is the virtual
so you can make in-game purchases or
even app downloads on a huge discount up
to 25 percent Amazon often runs
promotions where you can get 10% off so
buying $100 worth of Amazon coins would
give you a savings of $10 a great use
for this with be in apps like
hearthstone with in-app purchases where
you can basically save a lot of money
through buying coins instead of using
Google Play so in addition to being able
to buy Amazon coins on a huge discount
they also give up to 25% back on a few
in-game purchases which could be a great
saving by the way all of these apps and
the entire coin ecosystem works on both
Android and Android fire devices I also
want to give a huge thanks to Amazon for
reaching out and sponsoring this video
so that I can share this amazing service
with you guys that's basically the thing
guys so much for watching as always and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
