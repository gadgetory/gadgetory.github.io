eyebrows it's the eyebrows you know what
that's easily fixable I can put like a
sharpie marker on it so yeah smash
definitely at the end of this video I
want to be doing a giveaway on the
Nintendo switch for three lucky
subscribers so make sure you guys stick
around for that
what's your favorite video on the
channel so far oh what a good question
that is Ian or LAN I would say perfect
desk setup episode two
I took the longest to make by far my
favorite and I would say the best video
is buying a prebuilt gaming PC as your
first gaming PC a good idea well it's
not really a bad idea as long as you're
not getting ripped off one of the few
companies actually recommends to check
out for pre-built pcs is iBUYPOWER
because their parts are really close to
what you're paying if you were to buy
the parts yourself and build it but
anyways I'll drop a link to them down
below
yeah how do you make a microphone pick
up less sound from a mechanical keyboard
I've learned this pretty cool trick
actually a few months ago so you grab
your microphone and an industrial paper
towel is duty the blue ones and then you
wrap it around like this of a microphone
and you twist it just a little bit and
you keep twisting it until it comes
apart and then just start there's no
there's no way what was the biggest
mistake you made when you were building
a PC the biggest one I've made a lot of
mistakes but the biggest one would have
to be I left a plastic sleeve on the CPU
cooler and I basically put that on top
of the CPU and I fried my CPU so that
kind of sucked
hello Wow what made you decide to take a
leap of faith into the world of YouTube
so that's it means you want I hated my
job
and I hated my job will you ever do a
blue black PC build yes oh and actually
we are currently in the process of
making a black and white build what
black and blue build with white accent
that's coming up in March stick around
can you tell Carl ran to do the next
worst setup episode and I think it's
kind of done with this whole setup for a
thing but you guys can ask him yourself
Kyle oh you want another episode man go
how about this guys if this video hits
fifty thousand likes then he will appear
for setup wars episode 100 potato
ization of course it's actually pretty
cool best pick-up line are you sitting
on that f5 key because you asked this
refreshing you still use Internet
Explorer you still use Internet Explorer
you must like it nice and slow
girl you must be using that new AMD Shiv
because I got something rising down
below how much do you earn from YouTube
so I'll actually never been asked this
question so I never really showed how
much I earn so I'm going to show you
guys actually real quick as I got
nothing to hide
apparently it's not against YouTube's
Terms and Conditions I'll show you guys
on my app will click on my YouTube app
you know I am all videos here is my
dashboard I mean what are earning this
is how much I earn of the past 28 days
favorite PC bills besides Electra box
and big red I'm gonna have to say the
obvious one Gala Dex the green and white
bill I did check it out link below how's
the house coming along and what do you
plan on adding to it custom parking
homes either and pool house is coming
along I think they extended it one more
day which is annoying the Atome instead
of April I think it's going to be done
in June which may may comes after April
I can't do months anymore so hopefully I
can move in either May or in June custom
things no custom parking I have my two
two-car garage anyways home theater it's
not that fitting unfortunately and no I
have a space for a pool but this is my
first home purchase hopefully my dream
house will have these things but we'll
see when that happens what's your
favorite drink my favorite drink is
pomegranate juice I drink I make sure to
drink at least a cup a day especially in
the morning tunes that wake up other
than that I drink water I don't really
drink in soda or anything else unless
I'm going out they don't have like
alcohols but that's like once a month or
something what does you have a great
time for set up Wars at the moment so
the current wait time I believe is four
to five months I'm not sure here's the
list of all of submissions currently
pending I get around 50 submissions a
week so yeah it's a long wait now I hope
you guys are patient what are your tips
for success as a small youtuber click
page tricks on the thumbnails I'm just
kidding I I don't know it really really
comes down to type of content the
consistency and just finding that niche
in an oversaturated platform you call
YouTube I see a lot of people copying
others I even got some ideas from other
youtubers but as long as I'm okay with
taking ideas or inspiration whatever you
want to call it as long as you add your
own twist to it and you make it better
that's cool that's cool with me
yeah my tips I mean just find a niche I
think it really comes down to the person
making the videos the content they
produce and just a consistency that's
all it really takes to be successful on
YouTube that's just my two cents instead
upward is going to continue after
episode 100 the only time setup ORS will
stop is if I exit this world
why is my friends setup so let's
take a look why don't you tell your
friend to think of a girl burger boards
if you think that phones will have
desktop grade specs I honestly don't see
why not
it may take another hundred two hundred
maybe a thousand years but it's
definitely going to happen eventually I
mean we can fit desktop freaking GPUs
and thin as laptops now so obviously
went out who is your celebrity crush
shailene woodley is probably my number
one I don't know what it is about her he
just gets me so hot when are we going to
go eat the sushi again to Armando how
