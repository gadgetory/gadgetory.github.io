today we're going to be checking out the
smart desk - from autonomous the smart
desk - is a motorized sit and stand desk
that is claimed to be the most
affordable high quality standing desk
starting at just 300 dollars the model I
have here is the Business Edition that
features a dual motor system 24 - 51
inch height options a maximum capacity
300 pounds and a five-year warranty the
surface is constructed out of a light
oak material and measures and at 53
inches in length and 30 inches in depth
while the platform sports a white color
in total this unit retails for $450
whereas competing products with a
similar size and set of features can run
for around six hundred dollars
autonomous also offers different color
finishes and surface sizes to better fit
your personal setup as well so once I
had the desk fully assembled the first
thing that stood out to me was just how
sturdy it is it's an extremely solid
piece of kit and will be able to handle
even the heaviest of setups using a set
up consisting of a laptop monitor and
other work related hardware the desk
moves smoothly without a hitch the desk
manages to stay flat and doesn't show
any signs of bowing in the center what's
also great is the quick movement speed
of 2.3 inches per second most other
smart desk will only operate at a rate
between one to one-and-a-half inches per
second which is pretty slow the motors
are also engineered with noise
cancellation in mind operating at a you
rated volume of 39 decibels it's not too
loud and won't be distracting in an
office environment or when doing things
such as taking a conference call or a
Skype call for example the smart dust 2
also has for programmable modes that
will let you easily toggle between
different positions with the press of a
button on the smart keypad switch
normally you have to hold down the up or
down arrow until the desk reaches your
desired height but these buttons make it
really easy with just a single press
plus it gives you more time to work
instead of needing to accurately adjust
the desk each time you want to switch
between sitting and standing the display
is bright and the frame around the
controllers are illuminated so this can
be used in darker settings without much
hassle the extremely clean and minimal
design of the smart desk - is
complemented by a pair of grommets to
aid with cable management
the work as intended but don't fully sit
flush with the desk and can easily fall
out of place when getting everything up
and running
autonomous also includes a set of cable
clips to keep your setup looking its
most presentable as well my version of a
desk doesn't have a dedicated rack to
store a power strip and contain the
cables but you get to always pick up a
signal rack to help with that despite
the overall desk being very sturdy the
top surface is still thin enough to
accommodate a monitor mount as well so
that about wraps it up for this review
of the autonomous smart desk two figures
on the market for an affordable yet
highly functional sit and stand desk I
definitely recommend checking these guys
out I will drop a link to them down
below make sure to leave a like if you
enjoyed the video and feel free to
dislike if you didn't also give huge
things to autonomous for sending this in
for review thank you so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
