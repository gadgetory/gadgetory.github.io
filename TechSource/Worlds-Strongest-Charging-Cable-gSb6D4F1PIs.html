apparently strong enough to tow a
freaking car so this is anchors new
lineup of charging cables called the
power line plus it's available for both
Lightning and microUSB versions with
four different colors to choose from it
also comes with a premium pouch so that
they can be easily stored and carried
which means no tangles the cables are
made out of Kevlar fiber and double
braided nylon for that extra strength
and because of the power lines laser
welded connectors anchor claims that
these cables will last ten times longer
than regular cables with at least 10,000
plus then the lifespan all of that on
top of their awesome 18-month warranty
at this point it doesn't make sense not
to make the switch to these cables but
you know what it's really easy to claim
all of these ridiculous numbers let's go
ahead and see how strong these cables
really are alright so we are here to
test out and see if anchors new power
line plus micro USB cable is strong
enough to tow a 1.5 ton 2007 Hyundai
Accent so here it is this is the cable
we're gonna be using as you can tell
it's brand new it is 10 feet so
hopefully long enough to construct this
test
go to tie this thing up three and if
you're watching this video I'm sorry I
promise I won't crash your car in anger
we believe high so I'm gonna basically
do a little loop here make sure it's
nice and snug double knot it
good to go
yeah all right so the real question is
does it still charge so I got here an
anchor power bank and my galaxy s7 we're
going to check it out and see if it
still charges so let's do this
oh my god it is live the lights are
lighting up and we see a battery icon or
charging icon on the phone well you saw
it here folks
Anker makes the strongest charging cable
in the world yes I did say that in the
video I actually did test the microUSB
cable but the lightning cable is just as
strong and I'll drop links below if you
guys want to check them out
Ankur was also kind enough to give out
twenty five hundred of the original
powerline lightning cables starting
April second for only a penny so if you
guys need a lightning cable and only
have one sent in your pocket make sure
to check the links below I want to give
you two things to anchor for making this
video possible and as always I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
