source and welcome to setup boards
episode 95 budget edition and let me
remind you guys again every single time
budget doesn't mean poor people can have
high budgets people can have smaller
budgets but all the setups in this
episode will be not high-end setups if
that makes any sense so with that said
and done
let the set of wars begin
here's a pretty cool black and red set
up from Elias he's using a 24 inch
Samsung monitor that's hooked up to is
GTX 970 he's also got the 6600 K
processor in there as well a desk is
from ikea and it's the freddy
workstation which is pretty cool because
at the top shelf to store some things as
well as two side shelves for speakers
and a bottom shelf for a subwoofer or a
smaller pc it's also not that expensive
for $229 you get a really solid
workstation with lots of space Elias is
also rocking the Corsair strafe RGB
keyboard and an X sub L wireless mouse
and for audio is using the trust GX p38
speakers and also a pair of Beats Studio
Headphones hanging from his desk it's
actually pretty cool looks like the desk
comes with some knobs near the top for
hanging things like headphones for
example no complaints on cable
management looks like the Signum is
doing its job and I pretty much wraps up
this balanced setup not expensive at all
a fairly decent budget set up Thank You
Elias for entering here's another very
clean set up Magnus is using a 24 inch
AOC monitor cm storm quickfire TK
keyboard and the SteelSeries rival 100
Mouse he didn't use any headphones with
his setup instead he's sticking with his
creative trig for trig you three
thousand speakers and that's pretty much
it on the surface other than some crops
on the left side the PC that's powering
the monitor has an i5 6600 and a GTX 10
6p excellent work with the cable
management everything is under control
and even managed to hook up the creative
speaker controls and RGB remote under
the desk as well what else can I say a
pretty simple and straightforward setup
Thank You Magnus for entering at number
three we got Louis with an interesting
custom desk that he made himself and I'm
assuming painted himself as well looks
like the monitor stand and speaker
stands were also made by him but was
black and red a good choice for this
setup though I mean he got green accents
on the Mackie Co four speakers silver
accents on the 27-inch Dell monitor and
PC case it doesn't really go well
together at least your parts inside the
PC are black in red we got the CC 600 K
and MSI GTX 1060
and a black and red Lambo as a prop I
think at the Lambo the keyboard is using
is the logitech Orion and g6 10 and we
also have a logitech anywhere 2 wireless
mouse he's not really showing off his
entire cable management area so I can't
really judge that but from what I can
see from the holes drilled in the desk
and the cable raceway in the back of the
desk it's actually managed pretty well
other than the color scheme I think he
did a pretty good job with the custom
work in this setup Thank You Louis for
entering now here's a pretty dope
looking blue and white set up from son
he's rocking a 25 inch dual monitor
lenovo wireless keyboard and Logitech
g600 Mouse Ferrario he's using his
Logitech G 430 headphones that are
chilling on the Philips LED lamp on the
desk and he also has a pair of alright
speakers as well which apparently
doesn't exist I tried looking at
referees and I cannot find them he does
have a 13-inch MacBook Pro on the desk
for work and portability but the main PC
is calling this setup has an i5 6600 K
and an Rx 470 inside a case that I
haven't yet seen based on the images on
Google it looks like the Aero cool p7
case but this one has a full tempered
side panels and the p7 doesn't so I'm
not really sure if this was modded or
not not much going on on a desk in terms
of cable management
except that one wire running alongside
the wall now I know it's only single
wire but even adding a cable raceway
like this will clean it up a lot it's
basic art straight lines are sexy as
opposed to wavy lines
ask anyone other than that I don't
really have any recommendations or
complaints to be honest the setup is not
cluttered at all and I think it's put
together very nicely Thank You Stan for
entering last but not least we have
Valentine with a very refreshing setup
definitely a chill environment as well I
don't know what it is with brick walls
but it really changes the ambiance of
the entire room because it doesn't look
like an average bedroom lighting that's
why anyway so he has a single Phillips
monitor resting on a monitor riser which
by the way he made himself along with
the entire desk he also has the Mad Catz
strikethrough gaming keyboard and
courser scimitar Mouse I definitely
liked that he kept consistent with a
color scheme throughout he's also got
the Logitech G 230 headphones with the
red ear cups a red windscreen on his
divine microphone
and of course red LEDs to top everything
off the PC that's probably the setup has
a 57 to carry and a GTX 970 turbo
edition GPU inside the sharkpoon
case with the release of Rison I'm
hoping to see more AMD built in the
future cable management looks good under
the desk cover the headset cable is
really obtrusive and the best way to
solve that is to mount the headset on
the other side of the desk and want the
cable under the desk and into the back
of the PC it will definitely clean up
the surface of the desk a lot but other
than that it's a pretty clean setup
thank you Valentine for entering so that
is it for this episode of setup Wars
