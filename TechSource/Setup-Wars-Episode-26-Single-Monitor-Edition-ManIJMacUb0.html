setup wars because of two reasons the
living room has too much echo and two I
have way too much equipment to take
downstairs and then bring it back up
when I'm done every single week that's
just too much work what's up guys it's
that back again from tech source and
welcome to setup wars episode 26 when
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel if you guys are
new to series and want to submit your
desk setup make sure to watch the video
linked down below with that said and
done what the setup wars begin
g2a is your one-stop shop for extremely
cheap CD keys for any game out there
never pay full price again for your
favorite games guys check it out by
clicking on the link down below so I got
my iPad air to back and for those of you
guys wondering where it's been I
actually set it to the guys at color
where to do a paint job and as you can
tell there's a bomb-ass job on it it was
originally champagne and I hated that
color so they painted the back in a
matte black finish in the Apple logo and
a glossy red which looks way better and
matches my overall color scheme they
also do engravings which is awesome but
if you guys want devices custom painted
definitely check them out
they can custom paint a wide variety of
devices some consoles two smartphones
and a bunch of other stuff but I'll go
and drop a link down below so you guys
can check them out but yeah I'm
definitely loving my new iPad air 2
as always everyone's gear for their
setups will be linked down below along
with anything I recommend in this
episode but with that said here are your
5 lucky contestants we have Bobby
Shaytan Manuel Yanni and Harun
what an interesting set of names but
nonetheless congrats for making it to
set up fours
episode 26 starting at the show is
Bobby's clean all-black setup we have a
27 inch asus rog monitor a wireless
keyboard and mouse combo from logitech
on top of the ikea Galant desk we also
have a pair of audio engine a5 monitors
and wood technology speaker stands which
really go well with the height of your
monitor up top we have a samsung 40 inch
TV and a fancy yet expensive Aaron chair
cable management looks very clean but
that whiteboard makes me question what's
behind it I do love the color contrast
of your rug and a pretty sweet PC of
yours which is rocking a 5820k
and an msi 980ti definitely a solid
gaming PC although 32 gigabytes is
somewhat overkill for this bill unless
you're doing some heavy CAD design it
does look like you have your
productivity type set up judging by your
keyboard and mouse but nonetheless a
very clean and organized setup Thank You
Bobbie for entering next up is Chetan
with a single 24 inch LG monitor a
Microsoft wired
hundred keyboard and a g600 gaming mouse
definitely a strange combination we also
have a pair of Sergent headphones on the
acrylic headphone stand that I recommend
way too often in my setup wars episodes
cable management is pretty good I see
that you have the famous IKEA Signum
rack attached on the ceiling of your
desk to hold up the power strips and
wires pretty good job there some of the
miscellaneous items on the desk include
the Lenovo notebook and a pen doh tablet
I thought it's a pedo tablet at first
when I was reading it powering the set
up is this custom PC running a 4690k on
a gtx 750ti inside the popular coarser
300d case overall a very straightforward
setup Thank You Chetan or chattin for
entering setup Wars at number three we
have the manual with his clean
productivity setup you have a Dell
24-inch monitor on top of the Alex
add-on unit which also has the
taotronics desk lamp and a blue Yeti
microphone on top on the desk we have a
Logitech TK 820 keyboard and m5 ten
mouths with a Dell XPS 12 monitor
underneath the stand the IKEA might
understand is something I would use for
my setup if I didn't have my ultra wide
mounted on the desk it does such a great
job cleaning up the overall desk and it
comes with two drawers for storage you
honestly can't go wrong with those kale
management can definitely be improved I
see that you have the Kotex surge
protector so why not grab some velcro or
3m tape and mount that on the ceiling of
your desk to clean up your wires it's a
very simple task and you can check out
this video if you need more help I don't
have anything else bad to say you have a
beautiful setup indeed thank you and
Manuel for entering next up is Yanni
with an antique desk setup we have a 22
inch LG monitor Black Widow ultimate
keyboard and death adder chroma Mouse
also no desk we have some Edifier
speakers and a pair of Razer Electra
headphones cable management is great I
really like how you use the monoprice
spiral wrap to clean up the wires I
would strongly recommend a mouse pad and
what a lot of people don't know is that
not only are you damaging the surface of
your desk now that I matter is for this
desk but you're also wearing out the
feet of the mouse a mouse pad will not
only help extend the life of your mouse
and desk but also make the mouse a lot
smoother too
slide also a headphone I go to keep
those headphones on because constantly
laying them down can also damage your
desk and scuff the headphones up but
I'll go and drop a link to a few of them
down below for you last but not least we
have one of my people ha route barovik
bonus we have a 24 inch asus monitor and
a red dragon gaming keyboard mouse and
mouse pad
I definitely like your taste our route
we also have a pair of turtle beach
airforce z11 hanging from the Atlantic
gaming desk that's right guys this is an
actual gaming desk made with silver
metallic steel and carbon fiber finish
this thing has freaking cupholders a
monitor Razer headphone anger and a few
racks to keep controllers and other
miscellaneous stuff on so if you guys
want something to build your dream desk
on this is a solid desk with a lot of
positive reviews but I gotta drop a link
to it down below if you want to check it
out kay ladder is pretty good the table
also comes with a rack that you can use
to hold the power strip which I see that
you have utilized really well great
choice on your PC parts as well sticking
with your black and red theme we have a
4790k processor and an msi gtx 970 GPU
overall a very compact and dope setup
