welcome to the build guide of the $1,000
rise in gaming PC because when I check
out the benchmarks make sure to watch
that video first so the build guide will
include the step by step installation of
everything you see on this desk also
Windows installing drivers and even
overclocking the CPU and the graphics
card so it's gonna be a full in-depth
build guide it's ok if you guys don't
have the exact same parts as I do maybe
you have a different graphics card CPU
or motherboard the process of building
the PC is very similar so this build
guide will help you build your PC as
well so the purpose of this build is not
only to make a good-looking and balanced
gaming and streaming PC but also make it
a lot easy to upgrade in the future with
this configuration you're able to max
out any game and 1080p over 60fps and
once again make sure to check out the
benchmarks down below alright guys the
only tool you will need to build
yourself your PC is a screw driver I'm
gonna be using the fantex toolkit which
pretty much comes with everything you
need to build or fix a PC and one of
things I really like about this is this
portion over here which is bendable you
can attach it to the tip here and you
can get into really tight places between
the motherboard to tighten screws and
it's magnetic so that is why I love
using this tool kit I'll drop a link
below if you guys wanna check it out
things like 20 or 25 bucks but just a
screwdriver will be fine
alright so the parts you'll need for now
are your motherboard your RAM sticks the
CPU and the CPU cooler if you're using a
different cooler and if you guys are
using an MDOT to drive make sure you
guys take that out as well you don't
necessarily need a case just yet just
these parts so go to take out the
motherboard from the box what you want
to do is hold on to the box itself
gently take out the sleeve and then
you're gonna place the motherboard on
top of the motherboard box but actually
before you do that
I'm gonna put it on here just for now
you're gonna take out the IO shield from
the motherboard box and your SATA cables
also some other boards come with a tiny
screw for the MDOT two so if you guys
are using an MDOT two SSD you will need
the end not to screw for that that way
you can lock it in place
alright so once everything is taken out
of the box make sure you guys close it
and gently put the motherboard on top of
the box see every time you're grabbing
the motherboard guys make sure you're
grabbing it from the sides do not touch
any of the components on the top or
behind it alright so the first thing
we'll do is pop in the CPU we're using
the 2600 next year all CPU is are the
same there's gonna be a tiny gold
triangle in the corner so make sure you
guys locate that so what you're gonna do
is you're gonna match the gold triangle
to the triangle on the CPU socket itself
so once you find that out you're gonna
push down on the lever bring it out and
open it up and then gently lower the CPU
on its sockets do not apply any force
and do not touch the surface of the CPU
so once it's fully seated all you have
to do is lower down a lever and then
locks in place all right next we're
gonna install your RAM sticks depending
on how many RAM sticks you have there's
a certain order you have to install them
on your motherboard especially if you
have four slots and only two Ram sticks
if you have only two slots just put both
of the RAM sticks in your slots the best
way to figure out where to install your
RAM sticks if you have four slots is by
looking at the diagram on the
motherboard over here it says the first
slots to occupy are a 2 and B 2 so a 2
is the first red one and then B 2 is the
second red one over here
okay first thing you want to do is open
up the notches and you're going to
gently slide them in one by one which
want to do is lower it evenly and then
basically press down on it with both of
your hands and then you can hear it snap
in place basically do the same thing for
the other Ram stick boom once these two
notches are fully seated
that means the RAM sticks are locked in
alright next up we can install the m2
SSD so if you guys having them that to
us as the this is how to install it if
you don't you can skip this part alright
so I'm gonna grab the end out to by its
sides and with the sticker facing the
top we're gonna gently slide it in the
slot over here push it in until it snaps
in place and then lower this end my
middle school I was talking about
earlier guys that's what this is for
so this tiny screw sits right over here
and it's basically going to keep the end
out - tied down so get your screwdriver
hold this down while you screw it in
place
just like that next we're gonna install
the heatsink that came included with the
CPU now if you guys are using a
third-party cooler make sure to read the
instruction manual and that will tell
you how to install that it's very
straightforward very simple now because
there's in the same cooler or heatsink
as me this is how you install it first
thing I want to do is remove all four
screws holding these two brackets down
we don't need it for the type of
heatsink when installing all right so
once both of the brackets are removed
we're essentially going to align the
heatsink to match the four holes on the
motherboard with the four screws on the
heatsink by the way guys you don't need
thermal paste because everybody comes
with pre applied thermal paste there's
only one way actually I can install this
because I you need the cable to reach
the top CPU fan header on the
motherboard so it's gonna have to be
like this so once you align all four the
screws to the holes on the motherboard
just gently lower it down again guys
don't apply any pressure just make sure
to screw the line with the holes and
just kind of let it sit like that until
you make sure all screws are inserted
afterwards grab your screwdriver and
gently start twisting the screws not all
the way just enough so tighten it a
little bit and then we're gonna go
diagonal to the opposite side do the
same thing twist it maybe like three or
four times and they're gonna go up here
kind of like a crisscross pattern guys
and then I'm going to a diagonal here
and you just basically rinse and repeat
until all four screws are tightened all
the way all right guys so after that
you're gonna grab the cable that comes
out of the heat sink
and you're gonna hook this up to the CPU
fan header right on the motherboard
which is usually right there on the top
next to the RAM sticks so make sure you
find the right side so grab it from the
tip and then insert it inside there's
only one way you can go in so obviously
if it doesn't go in flip at the opposite
side and insert it what I like to do to
hide the cable is just kind of squeeze
it in between the RAM sticks and the
cooler so it's not sticking out like
that so something like this will do the
trick
it's a lot cleaner than just having it
stick out all right so now the
motherboard is ready to be placed inside
the case but before we do that we got to
pop in the eye every little quick so pop
this out of the motherboard box peel it
open and make sure that the the circles
over here are facing the downward
position so we're gonna position the the
skin portion outwards from the inside
again the circles facing down I'm gonna
try and pop this and make sure you guys
apply pressure on all four corners
evenly to snap in place this is actually
the hardest part of building the PC
believe it or not there you go as you
guys can see all four corners are
basically pushed out so that's when you
know it's fully seated inside now if
your case comes with pre-installed
standoffs then all you have to do is
pick up the motherboard and place it
inside now if it doesn't come
pre-installed with standoffs oh you
gonna have to look for them inside the
bag of screws which comes with your case
and then manually install them inside
your case so the way I place the
motherboard inside the case is by using
one hand on the heatsink and the other
hand on the side at the motherboard just
like this
I gently grab it and then
Lord inside you can have to tilt it at
an angle so you can match the the IO
with the IO shield so once that's
aligned you can gently lower the
motherboard down at the same time trying
to align the holes from the standoff to
the holes on the motherboard and the I
should here is to happen place just like
that all right so now it's time to
secure the motherboard inside the case
we're gonna be grabbing these m3 screws
and I'll show you guys close up with
what they look like we're gonna need
eight of these screws and here's what it
looks like they're really short screws
with a round top it's the best way to
distinguish them amongst the rest so
this is where the screwdriver comes in
handy to get in those really tight
spaces and since they're magnetic I
could just put the screw on here here we
go
all right so this is the last screw the
motherboard is now secured inside the
case the next thing we can do I guess is
hook up the power supply we're gonna
remove the PSU bracket from the back
here so you can loosen up the thumb
screws first because usually they come
in really tight and then unscrew them
we're gonna need for these screws so
they either come in with your power
supply or in the bag inside the case you
need four of these so with the fan
facing downwards we're gonna put the
bracket back on top and while you hold
it place it's kind of tricky because
it's not fully modular we're gonna screw
these in so starting from the top don't
tighten it all the way just enough until
it's holding the bracket in place and
then you can move down to the bottom
left
alright so that's in there you can
install the other two alright so once
the bracket is secured on the back of
the power supply you're going to grab
the set of cables and then grab it from
this end again make sure the fan is
facing downwards guys I'm gonna slide it
in just like this once it's inside you
have to prop up the power supply just a
little bit until you can align the thumb
screws with the holes so once you do
that just start tightening them in
I next we will install the storage so
I'll show you guys how to install an SSD
as well as a hard drive this is
technically not a real hard drive but
I'm gonna use this as an example and
show you guys how to do it alright so if
you're installing an SSD you're gonna
have to pop out one of these shields so
I'm just gonna pick this one for now
remove the thumb screw so you take your
SSD and you're gonna flip it over make
sure that the connections are facing the
opposite direction just like this and
then you're going to put it on the tray
flip it over make sure that the holes
align and then you're gonna have to
screw it and I'll tell you what screws
to use so these are the screws you're
gonna need they look very similar to the
motherboard screws they're very short
and then you have a round top you can
use for but I only use 2 4 ohm SSDs
because that's all you really need to
keep it secured so once you line the
holes on the SSD tray just screw them in
I usually do one on one corner and then
the other one on the opposite corner and
that should be enough to secure it in
place there you go just like that now
before you put the SSD back inside the
case I strongly recommend hooking up the
cables first because once you have it
secure back there it's gonna be really
difficult to reach in the back and plug
these in so this is the SATA cable you
would need guys there's two types
there's one with two flat ends and then
there's one with an L shape you guys do
not want to use this one for this
particular case this is the one we're
gonna be using you gonna flip it over
with the clip facing down and snap it in
place just like this
now the other cable you're going to need
comes out of the power supply and it
looks like this and this is what
provides power to the SSD and the hard
drive so it looks like this you can pick
any end you want again a concept is the
same
so grab one end and then just slide it
in just like this make sure it's fully
seated and there's no gap between the
SSD and the connector this both of these
cables go in only one way guys so if it
doesn't connect flip it over and try it
again just like this so now we're gonna
do is flip over the case and now that we
know which cable to use we're going to
disconnect the power cable which is this
one and we're gonna drag it from the
back through the front just like this so
we have access and then we're gonna grab
the SSD slide in the other cable and
then hook this one up where it belongs
this one's this is the tricky part guys
there you go it's connected so we're
gonna flip this over and then slide it
back on the tray just like this it
should snap in place so it doesn't move
and you guys can put back the thumb
screw
so that's how you install your SSD so
the hard drive gets installed on the
back of your case so flip it around and
with the sticker facing the top and the
connection facing outwards you're
basically going to just slide it in this
portion right over here it's very simple
the hard drives are really wide so it's
gonna slide in very easily so similar to
the SSD it uses the exact same
connections guys and use just one SATA
cable and one data cable both of them
get plugged in the back and all you guys
have to do is slide it in over here and
screw it from the sides here there's a
screw hole on the side here and there's
a screw on the other side which you can
access by popping this off once you pop
that off and then you take off the dust
shield you guys can see here there's a
screw hole right there
which will align with your hard drive so
once the hard drive is aligned all you
have to do is screw it in and that's it
you're good to go I just wish I had a
hard drive to show you guys the actual
example now the other end of the SATA
cable actually plugs into your
motherboard and I'll show you guys where
exactly so from the back you can route
it any way you want I'll show you guys
had a cable managed at the end but the
idea is - alright guys so the other end
of the SATA cable that's plugged into
your SSD hard drive gets connected to
your motherboard so these are the SATA
ports and I typically plug it in the top
one but you guys can choose whichever
one you want just slip it on its side
and then insert it again if it doesn't
go in flip it over to the other side and
push it in until it snaps just like that
alright guys we're almost done now it's
time to install the cables which is the
fun part we moved to step by step make
sure you guys are paying very close
attention because this part can get
really tricky now if you guys are
usually using extensions just like I am
this is the process for that if you're
not then you're gonna skip this part
first cable we're gonna grab is the
big cable the 24-pin it says 21 year
plus 4p this is to power the motherboard
and we're gonna hook up the extension
for that so grab the female portion of
the cable and then snap it in place just
like this
make sure both of these cables are
aligned guys before you snap it in place
just like that and make sure the clip
goes over just like that it's got to sit
flush the next cable gonna grab is for
the CPU and the way you know that is
because it's labeled on their CPU both
of the four pins I'm gonna use and then
for the extension it's gonna be this one
over here once again grab the female
portion I'll line them together it snap
it in place just like that alright so
the graphics card we're going to use
only uses a single six pin as you guys
can see you just look at the graphics
card and on the side here you can tell
how many connectors it's going to use so
for our case it's using only a six pin
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
grab a six pin cable and this one is
labeled PCIe this is for your graphics
card and since it's only using a single
six pin we're only gonna use this
portion of it so once again we're gonna
grab the extension the female portion
and snap this in place that's it that's
the only cable we're gonna use for our
graphics card if you did everything
correctly
you should have three extension cables
hooked up that has all the cables we're
going to use everything else does not
need an extension
so the first cable we're gonna connect
is the giant one the 24 pin cable you
guys don't have an extension this is
what it looks like it says 20 plus and
then 4p next to it this is the cable
we're gonna be plugging in the 24 pin
socket on the motherboard so we're gonna
go in from the back making sure the
notch on the 24 pin over here matches
with this one over here so we're gonna
bend it a little bit just like this it's
okay to bend it don't worry and then
snap it in place
delete until you hear it click you may
have to wiggle it a little bit there you
go
sometimes you won't be able to hear a
click but it will slide in now we're
gonna do the CPU cable the one that says
CPU on the actual connector itself we're
gonna run it through the back and the
easiest way to reach the motherboard is
through the top right corner there's
usually a cutout over here so drag it
through here and these two connections
go inside the eight pin the first eight
pin socket right there boom snaps in
place that's what it looks like all
right the next Cape we're gonna hook up
is the molex one and this is hooked up
to both of the fans that come
pre-installed the case the top fan and
the rear fan and this connects to the
other molex connector from the power
supply which looks like this so you can
grab any end of it and then just hook it
up like this until it snaps in place
just like that the last people we're
gonna be looking up is this for the
graphics card but we're gonna hold off
till the end because that's the last
component we're gonna install we're
gonna be working on these cables all
these cables are connected to the case
these are basically to power the front
panel we're gonna start off with the one
with the blue tip this is to power the
USB 3.0 ports on the top of the case
this one connects to the USB 3.0 header
on the motherboard which is right above
the SATA cable we just connected for the
SSDs so make sure the notch is aligning
with this gap over here and then bring
in close and gently wiggle it inside you
may need to apply some extra force to
push it in because it is pretty stubborn
but once it's fully seated it will look
like this so the next cable is labeled
HD audio and this one connects to the
bottom left side of the motherboard so I
like to bring it from the back side over
here next to the SSD and hook it up to
this pin over here on the motherboard
make sure that the holes on the
connector align with the pins on the
motherboard before you insert it in so
just a quick tip for you guys make sure
the HD audio is facing upwards so it's
gonna go like this as you guys can see
the words are facing the top and it's
fully seated inside and finally we got
these two sets of cables which are
honestly the most annoying and most
difficult ones to connect so make sure
you guys are paying close attention
we're gonna be doing the HDD led first
so make sure you guys grab this and turn
it upside down and with the words facing
down we're gonna plug this on the bottom
first two pins so the first two pins
coming from the left side on the bottom
make sure it's facing down and then
slide it in it's very simple once you
figured it out as you guys can see it's
sitting on the bottom left corner of
that socket and if you guys want a quick
tip you can look on the top of that pin
and there's a quick diagram showing you
how to connect those cables
and finally you settle a set of cables
we need to install and they actually
come in order so leave it the way it is
guys p+ p - and then power switch just
the way it is and all you guys have to
do is insert it on the top three pins
above the HDD led so these three
connectors sit right on top of the
previous one we just connected just like
that plus LED goes first - LED comes
second and then the power switch alright
guys the final component to this entire
build is a graphics card so we need
access to the top PCI bracket which is
this one which means we have to remove
the second and third PCI brackets so we
have to remove these two screws first
alright so once this stupid useless
bracket is removed we can remove the
second and third thumb screw over here
alright so grab your GPU with the fan
facing down just slowly bring it close
to the top PCI bracket and slide it in
place until it snaps just like that so
while it's in place make sure you guys
tighten the PCI bracket near the back
and also it's always recommended to
install your GPU to the top PCI bracket
for the best performance alright guys so
grab the final a 6 pin PCI connector and
I'm gonna hook it up to the GPU so make
sure the clip aligns with the notch on
the top of the GPU so it's going to go
like this
snap it in place and just like that you
finished building your very first PC but
we're only halfway done because we still
got to boot it up install windows
install the drivers and also overclock
the CPU and graphics card so I guess you
guys can take this time and work on the
cable management's now that you know
what everything connects you can
disconnect the cables and route them any
way you want for a much cleaner look so
don't be afraid to use your zip ties and
also velcro straps to tidy up the back
of your case I'm gonna spend some time
cable managing this and I'll see you
guys really soon all right guys so I
just finished cable managing the PC this
is what it looks like from the back to
give you guys some tips on Caleb
management make sure to use velcro
straps or the zip ties that comes with
your power supply also find a few routes
to route the cables don't have the
cables running down the center trying to
find a discreet pattern or route to run
the cables as you guys can see some
cables that run on the left side and the
rest are round on the opposite side any
excess cables that you guys aren't using
make sure to bundle them together zip
tie it or velcro it together and then
just push it inside the the next to the
hard drive bay down here the cool thing
about this case is that there's plenty
of space down here to just hide the
cables that you're not going to be using
and this is what the front looks like
which is the most important part as you
guys can see very clean very organized
PC from the front lots of space for
future expandability like I said earlier
there's an extra space for an SSD maybe
a bigger cooler or even a radiator to
fit in the front so yeah plenty of space
for expansion later down the line
alright so once you guys are happy with
the cable management clothes back the
rear panel and tying the thumb screws in
the back now it's time to install
Windows operating system I'm sure you
guys have to do that alright so this is
how you install windows first thing you
need is that a USB Drive with at least
eight gigabytes of space and make sure
it's completely formatted that there are
no files on here because you're gonna
have to erase them anyways go ahead and
plug this to a different PC that has
internet access I'm going to use the PC
that I built as an example but you're
gonna have to ax
a PC or a laptop that has Wi-Fi and
windows installed already so we're gonna
hook this up to the PC so you can up
your browser and visit the Microsoft
website to download and windows 10 files
I'll drop a link to it down below that
way you guys can just click on it and
download the tool you're gonna scroll
down and click on create Windows 10
installation media we're gonna click on
the download a tool now let windows
download the file it may take a few
minutes alright so once the file is
downloaded just click on it and it will
open it up it will take you to the
license terms so make sure you click on
accept give it a few seconds and then it
will tell you what you want to do we're
gonna click on create installation media
USB flash drive and then we're gonna
click on next we're gonna make sure that
the architecture and the Edition is
correct so in our case we did have
Windows 10 64 bit installed and then I'm
gonna click on next over here we're
gonna be selecting the USB flash drive
which should be by default so then we're
gonna click on next again and we're
gonna be selecting the USB Drive so if
you have multiple stuff connected to
your PC make sure to select the correct
path for your USB so in our case we only
have one thing connected so we're gonna
click on next and over here it's gonna
download the windows files and install
them to your USB so this part may take
anywhere from five to thirty minutes
depending on your internet speed so just
sit back relax and let windows do its
thing alright so we're gonna grab the
USB drive that has the windows files
installed on and we're gonna hook this
up to your PC and then we're gonna turn
on the PC it should automatically detect
the operating system from the USB Drive
and it should automatically boot from
the USB Drive
so it looks like it did detect the USB
Drive and it's taking you straight to
the Windows installation page so gonna
go ahead and click on next click on
install now
and this is where you would put in your
Windows key I actually bought mine for
only fourteen dollars you guys can save
a lot of money just go check out s CD
key com and if you put this code listed
on the screen you can actually get an
extra 3% off which is like 45 cents or
something but still you're spending $14
on a legit Windows key instead of like
80 bucks so make sure to check them out
guys so once you put in the CD key hit
next and then over here you're gonna be
selecting the operating system that you
installed on the USB Drive so in our
case it was Windows 10 Pro so I'm gonna
click on Windows 10 Pro and then hit
next make sure you guys pay attention
because by default it does show up as
Windows 10 home so the CD he doesn't
match the operating system on the USB
Drive it's not gonna activate so I
selected Windows 10 Pro because that's
the key we purchased for this build I'm
gonna click on next so on the screen
make sure you guys are selecting custom
install which is the second option over
here and here is we have to select what
drive you want windows installed if you
have multiple drives make sure you
select being the correct one but if you
have one by default for example just an
SSD then select the then go ahead and
hit next and it will automatically begin
installing windows on the drive so this
part takes a few minutes so just be
patient and let windows install all the
files onto your drive so after reboot
it's gonna take anywhere from 5 to 20
minutes to continue installing the
windows files onto your PC so please be
patient and let the computer do its
thing alright so once you get to the
screen make sure to follow the on-screen
prompts and finish setting up windows
it's gonna ask you what country you're
from if you want to set up an extra
keyboard all that jazz so I'm just gonna
go through these real quickly so we
currently don't have the drivers for the
Ethernet port so we're gonna be using
this Wi-Fi stick we're just gonna give
me access to our Wi-Fi so I'm gonna hook
this up to the PC there we go
obviously you're gonna need internet
access to download the drivers and if
you guys want to check out the Wi-Fi
stick I'm using all
a link to that down below alternatively
you can also use a different computer
and download the drivers onto a USB
stick and then bring that USB stick hook
it up to your current PC and then just
transfer the files and install it that
way you don't technically need internet
access as long as you have it on your
other PC all right so I'm gonna let
Windows install everything else on the
computer and I'm gonna fast-forward to
the end where it takes you straight to
the desktop alright so now that way here
on the desktop you can open up your
browser and you're gonna be downloading
the drives I'll drop a link to every
single Drive you would need for this
particular system so that way you guys
don't have to go to the website yourself
just click on the link and then download
them all right so before we install the
drivers what we want to do is flash the
BIOS first for improved stability for
your PC so you guys are gonna grab any
USB with at least four gigs of space and
you're gonna plug this straight to your
PC and then you're gonna go to the msi
website under service alright so one of
the service tab we're gonna click on
BIOS and then over here it says ami BIOS
we're gonna click on the plus sign and
we're gonna be downloading the latest
version so release date 510 2018 here's
the version number depending on when
you're watching this video they mock
there might be a newer version so if
there is make sure to download that one
guys it's usually on the top so I'll
click on the red arrow and download the
file okay and then we're gonna open up
the zip file so click on that open up
the folder we're gonna copy the a 30
file extension and we're gonna put it
inside the USB Drive just copy and paste
alright so once the file is transfer
successfully we can close your windows
out and we're gonna go ahead and restart
the PC alright so after we starting hit
the Delete key continuously on your
keyboard until you go into BIOS all
right we're in the BIOS down here make
sure you guys locate and flash on the
bottom left corner click on that hit yes
and your PC is gonna reboot at this
point do not touch anything on the
keyboard let the PC do its thing so now
we're going to be entering flash mode
through here you guys gonna have to
locate the system file we
should be already on here as you can see
we can see the a 30 file extension so
once you locate that just click on it
and then hit yes afterwards FiOS is
gonna be updating so whatever you do do
not turn off your computer do not touch
the keyboard and do not remove the USB
Drive alright so once the BIOS update is
done its gonna restart once again
don't touch anything on the keyboard let
it boot great to Windows alright so now
we're back to the desktop we're gonna
finish installing all the drivers so
open up your browser once again I saw
the first driver we're gonna install
this for the graphics card if you're
using an NVIDIA GPU you're gonna have to
go on the GeForce experience website and
click on download now I'll drop a link
straight to this website so all you guys
have to do is click on the link and
download the driver so I'm gonna let
this download if you guys are using an
AMD GPU I'll drop a link to the AMD
website as well next drivers are gonna
stall are for the motherboard so we're
gonna go to the x4 70 gaming plus
website from MSI and over here we're
gonna be clicking on the drivers section
we're gonna select the operating system
we're running which is Windows 10 64 bit
and these are the drives that we're
gonna be downloading so pay attention
guys we're gonna click on the plus sign
next to the onboard audio drivers we're
gonna download the realtek
high-definition audio driver we're gonna
go down to the system and chipset
drivers and we're gonna download the AMD
chipset driver which should be the first
one and then scrolling all the way down
to land drivers we're just gonna
download the PCI Ethernet drivers so
total three drivers from the motherboard
and one driver for the graphics card so
once all the files are downloaded just
open them up one by one and install them
to your PC and you're pretty much done
the next step is to overclock your cpu
and GPU but if you guys don't want to do
that you are officially finished and you
can start downloading your games and
enjoy your PC alright guys so now we're
gonna overclock the CPU and GPU we'll
start off with the CPU first but before
we get to that we have to download a few
programs to help us overclock it so I'll
drop a link to the program is down below
there so go ahead and take this time to
install all the files that you guys
downloaded
alright guys so I'm going to show you
how to overclock your cpu and grab this
car we're gonna start off with the CPU
so once you're on the desktop we're
gonna go and restart the PC and we're
gonna get into the BIOS so you have to
continuously hit the Delete key on the
keyboard once the screen goes black
alright so keep hitting the Delete key
until it gets you into BIOS all right
over here we're gonna be going to the
overclock settings now by the way guys
if your menu is different if it looks
like this make sure to hit f7 to go into
the Advanced Mode scroll down go to
overclock over here we're gonna switch
the explore mode to expert and then for
the CPU ratio we're gonna start at a
very safe clock speed which is 40 it's
gonna be 4.0 gigahertz and then
scrolling down we're gonna put the XMP
profile to profile number two this is
gonna adjust the ramps p229 33 megahertz
anything over that for some reason makes
the computer unstable so I'm gonna keep
it at 29 33 for now I want to scroll
down to CPU core voltage we're gonna
change this to one point three seven
five and then we're gonna go down to
derail voltage and change this to one
point three five now this is a very
basic overclock for the CPU I know for a
fact my CPU can go up to four point one
gigahertz but for you guys watching this
video it's always recommended to start
at a lower number
these AMD chips can overclock fairly
easily so that's how we're starting at
4.0 gigahertz you guys can come back
later down the line and upgrade this to
41 you can go up to 4.1 you can even do
4.2 if your computer is stable but just
for this tutorial I'm gonna keep things
simple and we're gonna leave it at 4.0
gigahertz
so once the settings are changed we're
gonna hit f10 hit yes and let the PC we
boot alright so once we're back on the
desktop you guys can run a quick
benchmark just to see if your CPU is
stable I like winning Cinebench r15 and
I also like to compare with the original
score before the overclock to see kind
of how much of a performance gain we got
so I like to open that up and I like to
open up HW monitor on the side just to
take a look at the temperatures of the
CPU so right now it's around forty
forty-one the
we're gonna hit run on CPU and let it do
the benchmark log quick alright so the
test is done and system didn't crash so
that's a good sign that the CPU clock is
stable once again guys you can go back
and up the frequency so you can go up to
4.1 maybe even 4.2 now let's say your
system crashes at 4.1 gigahertz after
you increase the frequency then what you
guys can do is go back and up the
voltage make sure to increase the
voltage by increments of point zero
fifteen volts you can increase the
voltage slowly until you hit a stable
clock speed now if your computer keeps
crashing even after adding more voltage
then just keep it at 4.0 gigahertz at
one point three seven five volts alright
so now it's time to overclock the GPU so
we can open up msi afterburner it is a
free program I'll drop a link below if
you guys want to download it so we're
also gonna open up a heaven benchmark
this is also a free benchmarking tool
once again I'll drop a link down below
we're gonna make sure a full screen is
checked off and we're gonna put the
resolution to 1920 by 1080 and then hit
run and then we're gonna hit f9 to start
the benchmark so while it's benchmarking
we're gonna open up msi afterburner
we're gonna close the Parliament which
is this bar up here all the way to the
max and then for core clock we're gonna
double click on the 0 over here and
change the number to 200
once you do that we're gonna hit the
check mark and then we're gonna go down
to memory clock and change this to 400
once you do that hit the check mark once
again and I do recommend clicking on
this little Windows icon under startup
basically what this means is it's gonna
overclock your GPU every time you start
your PC and you can save your profile so
click on this Save icon and then
whichever profile you want so number one
for example is what I do and it saves
this profile again guys this is a very
simple overclock but just to make sure
your GPU is stable we're gonna let the
benchmark one a few cycles so one or two
times you can run the benchmark and
if your system crashes or not so you can
keep the afterburner overlaying the
benchmark wallets running in the
background and just keep an eye on the
temperature as well and if you see any
stuttering or if the benchmarking itself
crashes then you gonna have to go back
and lower the clock speed and if that
still crashes we're gonna have to lower
the memory clock a little bit but for
this specific GPU the zotac 1066
gigabyte version i can actually achieve
the 200-plus on the core clock and an
extra 400 on the memory I can actually
push this to 250 megahertz but again
just to keep things simple and show you
guys how to overclock a GPU that is
these settings we're gonna be using all
right so you guys can see the benchmark
is done and we scored 140 for the FPS
and when you compare it to the original
score before the overclock we gained an
extra 12 fps just by overclocking the
GPU so yeah guys I pretty much concludes
the guide on overclocking your CPU and
GPU if your PC crashes then it's
recommended to go back and lower the
settings for both the CPU and GPU until
your system it becomes stable again do
this at your own risk
I don't assume any responsibility if you
end up damaging your PC as I mentioned
before guys this is the stable base
settings for both the CPU and GPU and if
you really want to get a little bit more
performance out of your system you can
go back follow the same guide but just
increase the frequency for both the CPU
and GPU just keep in mind to increase
the voltage as well with the CPU
overclock so that pretty much wraps up
the build guy I hope you guys enjoyed it
if this was at all helpful to you please
drop a like to show your support and if
you didn't enjoy it feel free to drop a
dislike I think's again for watching
I will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
