this past week I had the amazing
opportunity to check out outies
first-ever electric vehicle the e-tron
SUV which was announced in San Francisco
by the way huge thanks to outtie for
sponsoring this video and bringing me
over to cover the event the journey to
the event was something to remember we
got on board the San Francisco Bell
cruise which was packed with a lot of
people around the world with good music
and even better food we then made our
way towards the crane way pavilion for
the huge announcement but before we got
there we were greeted by the spectacular
light show in the sky what do you guys
are looking at are a bunch of drones
that are perfectly synchronized with
each other to form the Audi wings in the
sky definitely one of the coolest things
I've seen in the air so far as we
approach the dock we were greeted by
another spectacle the entire building
where the event was held was covered in
projections which gave off this awesome
futuristic theme to it it kind of felt
like something straight out of the movie
Tron it was pretty dope moments later
after entering the building
outtie announced their first-ever
all-electric SUV the e-tron it's a 5
passenger SUV that not only packed some
impressive performance but also offers
some awesome features that once again
sets out a apart from the market they
put a lot of emphasis on doing things
right the first time instead of being
the first in the market for electric
vehicles what's really impressive is
that the factory and the e-tron SUV are
both zero emission it also comes built
in with Alexa and starts at 74 800 for
that Premium Plus and it goes up from
there based on the model or upgrades now
the vehicle itself looks pretty cool
from the outside personally I'm not a
fan of the color choice but luckily they
do offer a variety of color options it's
also very spacious and comfy inside and
one of things I really like about the
e-tron SUV are the huge displays I'm
more of a minimalistic person and I do
prefer using touchscreen display so I
appreciate the fact that the e-tron SUV
has a lot less buttons the e-tron SUV is
expected to be delivered to showrooms in
the first part of 2019 and it'll be the
first of three battery electric vehicles
that Audi plans to debut by 2020 another
cool thing that all D is doing involves
their charging station so check this out
they have this vision to create a modern
charging station
users can use to not only charge your
vehicles but themselves as well whether
it's a place to sit down and relax play
with the swings or simply grabbing food
or drinks from the station it kind of
gives us an idea of what's possible in
the future of design and innovation
speed of charging outtie will be
offering complimentary electric vehicle
charging using level 2 chargers and
their charging stations can be used with
most electric vehicles
this is Audi's first ever step towards
electric vehicles and I'm really excited
to see what they can do in the market
within the next few years but what do
you guys think of the e-tron SUV let me
know your thoughts in the comments
section down below
if you want to learn more about the Audi
e-tron SUV or anything else covered in
this video I'll drop a link to that down
below thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
