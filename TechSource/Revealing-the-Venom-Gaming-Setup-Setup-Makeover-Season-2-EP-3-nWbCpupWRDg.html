Harry thinks about his setup he hasn't
seen anything he hasn't been in his room
for two days while I was building it for
him so i'ma go grab a little quick and
see what he thinks
yeah
holy crap
god damn Wow what do you think Oh
mad insane holy Wow yeah kind of lifts
up the desk we put some collectibles on
here what do you think about the wall
art dudes cross your well everything's
really amazing sweet dude glad you like
it yeah so let me go over to set up a
bit first up the monitors not only did
we upgrade your 720p monitor but I
hooked you up with three of them these
are the msi optics curved monitors and
you get quad HD resolution at 144 it's
refresh rate one millisecond response
time and as RGB at 150% so it's great
for color sensitive work as well the
monitor aesthetics also fits in
perfectly with the venom beam I decided
to keep a stand because I think it looks
cool and besides you have a lot of extra
space on the desk so the keyboard is the
bigger GK 80 it's an RGB mechanical
gaming keyboard with cherry MX red
switches any detachable rest rest
there's a few things I like about this
keyboard first of all it's built really
well the top plate is aluminum and it
comes with these really nice metal key
caps the dedicated multimedia buttons
are also nice now normally I'm against
the red accents on an RGB keyboard like
this but for this exact setup it
actually worked out because obviously I
was going with an old black setup with
some red accents so the keyboard fits
perfectly so the mouse is also really
cool it's fully RGB of course but it's
both wireless and wired oh and a cool
thing about the mouse it's modular so
you can actually swap out the parts or
the top plate depending on what your
comfort level is so the box actually
comes with the modular parts so swap
around and figure out what's more
comfortable for you okay now for audio
obviously I removed your speakers and I
replaced your headset with the msi GH
70s you already told me earlier you
actually weren't using your speakers as
much so I don't think it's gonna make a
big difference but it is your setup you
can bring back the speaker's if you want
it's all black anyway so it's going to
fit in perfectly the junior 70s are very
light and super comfy to wear go ahead
and feel the ear cups
tell me how softly filled it's really
soft feels like a baby's butt yeah and
actually they come with replaceable ear
cups I don't know if you saw the Box
earlier so if they get worn out you can
just pop them out and put the new ones
on it sounds good
all right now the PC this thing is a
beast it's a custom water-cooled PC
using ek parts it's rockin in 2700 X
that's overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz 16
gigs of ram at 3000 mega Hertz and the
RX Vega 56 so the reason why I went with
the Vega 56 so you can play in quad HD
resolution obviously you gotta take
advantage of the 2k resolution on your
monitors I don't want you gaming in
1080p anymore so now to step up so for
storage it has an m2 SSD 248 bytes of
space it has the operating system
installed there and you also have an
additional nine under 60 gigabyte of
space on an SSD as well the custom
psuche rad that says Venom along with
that badass backplate was made by v1
tech and I think it really tied the
whole PC together the PC is being held
up by a wooden plank and I had some
custom risers printed out that
contributes to the venom theme but yeah
what do you think how do they look so
yeah I like the attention to detail
there's a lot going on over here which
is really sick and this custom 3d
printed right yeah so yeah you like the
tongue house that kind so maybe you know
yeah of course I couldn't leave the
walls alone so I kind of added this dope
look in 5-piece mural artwork over here
and also put some posters and I'm not an
acrylic piece over there last but not
least the desk I really like this desk
it's built really well with a large
surface area but the things I like most
about it is that it comes with a net to
hold all the cables
I feel like this desk was made just for
triple monitor setups because there is
literally a cutout in the back right
behind each monitor so it was it was
great for a cable management last but
not least if you haven't noticed already
this whole surface area is covered by a
massive mousepad
which not only protects your desk from
getting scratches obviously but you no
longer need another mousepad and I think
got an issue too with your previous
mousepad yep it kept on bumping to my
keyboard and it was really annoying so
this
definitely helps out a lot so kind of a
two and one for you yeah
setups finally completes what is your
overall I guess if you have to pick one
thing that you really love about this
set up what would it be like one item
one item well let's say three the
monitors hit the water is okay I was
stuck with a old Samsung and 24-inch
what was it it was less than 1080p
that's all I know
so now I get three times that and
they're curved and they're curved
exactly I forgot to mention that yeah
how many sadly yes but I really want to
use and it looks actually it looks
really sick cool so the monitors are the
favorite part about the whole setup I
was gonna say to PC yeah well everybody
now the PC I just like saw the inside
out they're really gonna see until now
it's all custom inside holy crap
no yeah I mean the PC is amazing okay so
my job here is done
I'm glad you enjoyed the setup I just I
am asking one thing from you please
don't be a Phillip cuz I have some loans
we had it again enjoy your setup any
questions let me know thank you so much
I'm feeling kind of sad now that I have
to leave this but it's in good hands I
know that much you could come by any
time baby alright guys so this concludes
