and today we are comparing the camera on
the LG g3 and the HTC One m8 who will
play edition but before we move on to
the samples let's take a quick look at
some specs so the m8 has a 4 megapixel
rear facing camera with an aperture of
2.0 that can shoot in 1080p some notable
features on the m8 include auto focusing
during video mode digital image
stabilization ISO control and burst mode
the g3 on the other hand has a 13
megapixel rear facing camera that can
shoot up to 4k with an aperture of 2.4
some notable camera features on the g3
include laser auto focusing optical
image stabilization for pictures face
and smile detection as well as digital
image stabilization for video for
front-facing cameras the m8 has a 5
megapixel camera that shoots in 1080p
while the g3 is 2.1 megapixel front
facing camera also shoots in the same
resolution so that's enough about the
specs that sit back relax and take a
look at some samples I hope you guys
enjoy the video
what does it be guys it's ad from Texas
and today we are doing a video and sound
test that's going to appear on either
the top left or top right and it should
tell you which phone is being used for
its
here is a sample of me using the
autofocus feature in video mode I
haven't seen a phone that could focus so
fast like the g3 and to do it with such
accuracy I was definitely impressed with
the laser autofocus that LG has
implemented in the phone it really works
well the m8 on the other hand has a
terrible video camera I'm sorry to say
it is the worst thing I have seen on a
smartphone not only does the camera
glitch trying to focus on an object but
it has a very hard time doing so as you
can see in this video even when there's
only one object in front of the phone it
still doesn't recognize it it's obvious
that the g3 s video camera is far more
superior than the m8 s there is no
question there anyways that concludes
the camera test between the LG g3 and
the Google Play edition m8 for ma look
at these samples I will definitely pick
the g3 without question when it comes to
photos and video it just does such a
great job overall and does much better
in low-light conditions than the m8 the
colors on the m8 may seem more vibrant
and rich but the g3 has more
true-to-life colors so do you guys agree
with me or disagree let me know in the
comment section down below and tell me
why you think so I got a few videos
coming up on the g3 so make sure you
guys stick around this is Ed from tech
source and I will catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
