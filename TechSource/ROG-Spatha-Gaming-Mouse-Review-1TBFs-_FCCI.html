spend on a gaming mouse in order to get
the best
well how about $180 because that's how
much this mouse costs but is it worth it
let's find out if you guys are
subscribed to tech stores that means
that you are into tech or gaming well
check this out guys if you have always
wanted to get into the tech or gaming
industry then now's your chance
Full Sail University offers campus and
online degree programs that are designed
for the world of entertainment media
arts and most importantly Technology all
students have hands-on access to
technology from day one which will help
you through your courses whether you
want to be developing software apps for
both iOS and Android or web design the
difference between other traditional
schools and Full Sail is that their
programs are actually designed
specifically to flex as new methods and
applications unfold which in return
allows students to remain relevant and
informed throughout the entire learning
process so if you guys are interested in
getting into the tech industry make sure
to check out Full Sail University by
clicking on the link below before we
take a look at the mouse let's go ahead
and unbox it first as always ROG never
disappoints when it comes to packaging
lifting open the box you will find a
Quick Start Guide and behind that is a
message welcoming you to the rog
community so this is the rog spatha
laser gaming mouse which is both
wireless and wired it's also the coolest
looking mouse that I've ever seen it
looks like something straight out of a
Transformers movie and finally below the
mouse is a very cool hardcover carrying
case that has all of the accessories on
the left side is a Torx wrench needed to
swap the switches and on the right side
we have one braided USB cable and
charging hub that doubles as a receiver
below that we have the charging cable
for the dock to ROG logo stickers the
other two arm round switches and finally
the charging dock legs
unlike most other wireless mouse that
come with a tiny USB receiver this one
is actually built inside the charging
dock which by the way looks very dope it
has a powerful magnetic base that grabs
onto the mouse once you bring it close
enough with that being said the only
downside I see with this is the fact
that you need to have this constantly
plugged into the PC otherwise you won't
be able to use the mouse wirelessly this
can be slightly annoying if you travel
around with a laptop and are forced to
carry the charging dock as well the
mouse on the other hand features 12
programmable buttons swappable arm run
switches and 8200 dpi sensor and RGB
lighting which can be controlled with
the software but more on that later
swapping the switches out is super easy
just pop open the rubber grommets remove
the four screws with a provided Torx
wrench and pop open the faceplate you
can then simply pull out and replace the
other arm run switches which provides
more of a click resistance and factors a
quick sound sample between both of them
aesthetically this is one attractive
Mouse I'm definitely diggin the curves
and the matte black finish also the grip
material around the mouse has a Mayan
inspired theme which I thought
contributed to the overall cool look the
chassis is on the other hand is made out
of magnesium alloy which has a bit of
weight to the mouse which makes it
slightly harder when lifting it
definitely doesn't look like Asus cut
any corners here then again for a mouse
that cost $180 there sure as hell better
not be overall thus Mouse has a much
larger footprint than the me onyx caster
which is the mouse I'm currently using
so coming from something much smaller
and thinner definitely was noticeable
but after a day or two with a spatha I
got used to the size I think the easy
transition was possible due to me having
larger hands aside from that the comfort
level was mostly on the positive side
the only complaint I had was that the
grip area wasn't large enough and often
found my thumb pressing against the side
buttons during gaming I especially
noticed it while playing FPS games like
counter-strike where quick reflexes are
common pressing the side button is
almost inevitable especially when
lifting the mouse luckily I had nothing
program for those buttons otherwise it
would have interfered with my gaming
speaking of the side buttons all of them
are extremely easy to press except the
two middle ones sometimes I would
accidentally hit the top left button
instead and reaching the rear button
required me to raise my hand a bit in
case you guys haven't noticed by now the
mouse is intended for
right-handed users unfortunately however
if you're a palm or claw gripper like me
you would be pleased to find that the
spatha is ideal for both grip types so
how does a $180 Mouse in that
competitive gamers do in gaming well
good and bad to start off the mouse is
so responsive even in Wireless mode that
I often find myself looking down to make
sure it's not connected with a wire it's
that accurate the spatha has a 1,000
Hertz polling rate in Wireless mode
which let me remind you by the way is
the same as most other competitive wired
gaming mice but if you plug in the wire
you basically double that so you get
2,000 Hertz polling rate which is
ridiculously responsive now can I tell
the difference between wired and
wireless yes the difference is miniscule
but it is there to the casual player
it's impossible to detect but if you're
playing fps or games that require quick
reflexes then I'll recommend plugging in
the wire for the most accuracy with that
said I think the spatha is not made for
competitive gaming the weight and size
of the mouse puts it in a disadvantage
especially if you have tiny hands you
are forced to glide the mouse instead of
lifting it which really limits your
ability to make quick jerk movements for
fast paced action that's a huge
disadvantage in competitive RTS and FPS
games as an MMO mouse however it's
excellent having six buttons to choose
from four macros really gives us Maus an
advantage and finally let's take a look
at the software through the armory you
can change the color of the LEDs to
practically anything you can choose
different colors for each other three
sections of the mouse or sync them all
together
additionally there are different effects
that can be selected from color cycling
to breathing or even battery mode which
will correspond the color to how much
juice is left on the mouse speaking of
which the battery life is impressive
it's been five days since I started
using the mouse and it's still above 60%
there's also a power saving option which
will put the mouse in sleep mode after
being idle for a set amount of time for
even a better battery life performance
the button tab is where you can set the
action of each button the performance
tab is where you can control the DPI
setting polling rate button response and
an interesting setting called angle
snapping this allows your mouse to draw
extremely straight lines depending on
what setting you choose I'm not sure
where this would be useful but I thought
it would be an interesting option to
share and finally the micro tab up there
is where you can record and set macro
which you can then pass on to any of the
buttons on the mouse so in conclusion
the rog spatha is a well-made
good-looking and premium gaming mouse
that offers some really nice features
the RGB lighting swappable on run
switches and magnetic charging base are
all very nice to have but asking $480 is
pretty steep for a gaming mouse that
isn't great for fast paced games due to
the weight and size of course now if
you're not a competitive gamer have
money to burn and just want a really
awesome looking mouse with RGB lighting
then the spatha has your name written on
it for everyone else I would suggest
taking a look at the ROG sticker or ROG
Gladius if you're looking for a smaller
and more affordable gaming mouse but
that will do for my review of the ROG
spatha gaming mouse if you guys enjoyed
the video make sure to leave a like to
show your support and also let me know
in the comment section down below if
this is something you would drop $180 on
I'm really interested to hear your
opinions because when I check out this
mouse and other Asus mice that I
mentioned in the video I'll drop links
to them down below as well that's
basically the thing guys so much for
watching as always I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
