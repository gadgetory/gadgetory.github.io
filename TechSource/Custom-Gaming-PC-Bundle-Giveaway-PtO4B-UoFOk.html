tweet stating that if the post reaches
over a hundred retweets or a hundred
favorites that I'll go ahead and
giveaway or e on my $500 gaming PC that
I built for July I was so confident that
the tweet was not going to make it but
somehow magically it did happen so
congratulations you guys seriously
though I am a man of my word and I will
be doing the PC giveaway not only am I
going to be giving away the PC but I'm
also going to be throwing in some pretty
cool stuff the giveaway will also come
with a red dragon keyboard mouse and
mousepad bundle along with a scent a
gaming headset to match the overall
theme of this setup I'm also gonna toss
in some free games that will come with a
PC like GTA 5 battlefield 4 Crysis 3 and
a few others but keep in mind that those
games are only available offline
you can't play those online
unfortunately I want to quickly mention
that this giveaway is sponsored by the
unlocking company.com and I've mentioned
it so many times in my past videos but
they are the channels main sponsors
without them I won't be able to do PC
build videos or even the cool tech
videos that you guys see on my channel
let alone actual PC giveaways they are
doing this for you guys because the
feedback on the locking videos have been
amazing
those videos are specifically designed
for people that search on how to unlock
a specific phone they're not meant for
my subscribers so that's why you guys
don't have to watch them if you don't
but the fact that you do you wash them
and you leave comments and likes and
stuff like that that really does help
them out and helps the channel out
immensely and this is kind of their way
of showing their appreciation to you
guys for being so cool with the
unlocking videos so thank you guys so
much for that so if the awesome feedback
on the locking videos continues like
this you guys will definitely see a lot
more PC build videos like this in fact
we've been talking about doing one for
the month of October so there's only
keep that up all right so let's move on
to the requirements to enter the
giveaway so I went ahead and teamed up
with the guys at unroll me for this
giveaway if you guys receive a bunch of
spam and junk emails like I do then
you've definitely gotta love this it
basically checks your email and displays
all of your subscription
and gives you options to unsubscribe
from them additionally you can move
subscriptions that you still want to
receive to a roll-up and you will get
one single compressed email with all of
these subscriptions instead of getting
them individually so to enter the
giveaway all you guys have to do is sign
up using the link down below it's
completely free to you guys and it takes
less than a minute to sign up and this
is a really good way for me to actually
keep track on who enters the giveaway
also write down in the comments section
when one-sentence why you deserve Ori on
the gaming PC build and I will be
announcing the winner on August 20th on
my Twitter and Instagram account so make
sure you guys are following there if you
want to know who wins that's basically I
thank you guys so much for your support
because of any questions you guys can
reach me on Twitter best of luck to
everyone that enters this is at some
tech stores I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
