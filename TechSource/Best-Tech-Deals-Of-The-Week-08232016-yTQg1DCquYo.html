welcome back to another episode of best
tech deals make sure to check the
description for links to everything
mentioned in this video first up we've
got this corsair k70 running it one
hundred dollars this is a really sweet
keyboard and instead of giving a quick
talk about it I'll leave a link to a
video that EDD made of it in the
description next this LG 29 inch ultra
wide is fifty percent off right now for
two hundred dollars you get a really
sweet ultra wide which is amazing for
productivity and even gaming since you
get a wider view the Moto 360 is widely
recognized as the best SmartWatch for
android phones in this model is
currently one hundred and twenty dollars
unfortunately this deal is only running
for the 23 millimeter option but if you
have small wrists than I highly
recommend this this steam controller is
$35 right now if you aren't huge on the
Xbox controller and like what's team is
doing then this is definitely a great
buy for you especially with that price
tag for the last item on amazon this
curved ultra wide 34 inch monitor is
that the lowest price it has ever been
seven hundred dollars i have received
your feedback on not showing as many
monitors so i definitely limited them
this week but this deal was just too
good not to show on ebay this gigabyte
micro ATX motherboard is 125 dollars
compared to the normal one hundred and
fifty dollar price tag this motherboard
is of course perfect for micro ATX
builds but the color scheme on it is
gorgeous for the black and red builds
next this radeon RX 460 graphics card is
running just under $150 right now
definitely a great low budget graphics
card for your next PC build and finally
on newegg we have a few cool PC deals
starting with this high-end Lenovo
gaming laptop for more than three
hundred dollars off you get this sweet
15.6 inch laptop to play games portably

630 dollars you get

or whatever you want to use it for the
last product on this list is the EVGA
GTX 1070 graphics card not a huge price
drop but for those of you who have been
considering getting the sweet new card
