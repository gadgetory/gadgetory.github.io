bring you guys a close look at the new
HP Chromebook 11 from Google a
Chromebook is basically a laptop that
runs Chrome OS as its operating system
and the device is designed to be used
while connected to the Internet and
support apps that reside on the web
there are many different types of
Chromebooks available starting at $1.99
from different brands like Acer Samsung
and HP the HP Chromebook 11 that we are
unboxing goes for 279 units available in
black or white with four accent colors
that you can choose from and they come
in very simple packaging and a charger
as you can see here Google does give you
100 gigabytes of free Google Drive
storage for two years when you purchase
this Chromebook and the amount of
storage and time vary depending on which
Chromebook you purchase the HP 11 has a
plastic body that sits on top of a
magnesium alloy frame which kind of
makes it feel more sturdy than most
plastic laptops and it does offer the
same specs as last year's model it has a
dual core Samsung Exynos 50 to 50
processor two gigs of RAM and 16
gigabytes of internal storage the screen
is an 11.6 inch IPS display with a
resolution of 1366 by 768 with 339
pixels per inch which is pretty
impressive for something this small but
for the short time that we use the
machine it offers poor performance
navigation on the web page will be
really laggy and an even lags when
watching HD video here is a sample of
the movie Transformers in 1080p and if
you listen very carefully you can hear
and see the lag
the webcam also isn't that great since
the quality is VGA but honestly what do
you expect from a $300 Chromebook here
is a sample picture that we took of our
camera and you can see that it's enough
to tell what you're looking at I did
like the keyboard the keys have plenty
of space in between them and it felt
really comparable typing the only
downside is that there is no 10 key the
Chromebook 11 also boots up in less than
10 seconds and it is very light and thin
measuring at point 69 inches in 2.3
pounds comparing to the MacBook Pro
which is at 0.7 inches and 4 point 46
pounds because it runs Chrome OS you
have access to your favorite google apps
and there are tons of other apps also
available for free on the Chrome Web
Store it also gets you 6 hours of
battery life if you are traveling and
with its simple clutter free layout the
ports are all located on the left side
which includes 2 USB ports one headphone
jack and your micro USB charger they
made it a micro USB port because it is
the same port used to charge most phones
and tablets so you can use the same
cable making a really convenient
although the Google colors do light up
on the lid of the Chromebook there is no
backlighting for the keyboard so if you
are using it in very low light
conditions it can be really inconvenient
as I mentioned before you can choose
from up to 4 accent colors which include
the colors blue red yellow and green
which are the Google theme colors if you
haven't noticed and these are the parts
of the Chromebook that change as well as
the outline of the keyboard that you saw
earlier so that wraps up the unboxing
and overview of the new HP Chromebook 11
