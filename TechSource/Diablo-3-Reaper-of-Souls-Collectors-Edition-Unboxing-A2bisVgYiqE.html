source premium an unboxing of the new
diablo 3 reaper of souls collector's
edition so this is the expansion set for
the popular Blizzard game Diablo 3 and
it goes for $79.99 and it comes with a
bunch of cool stuff that I will go over
soon now the price difference between a
regular disc and the collector's edition
is only 30 bucks which means that there
isn't a ton of extra stuff that comes
with the game but what that said let's
get this unboxed and check out the
contents the first item I pulled out is
the Reaper of souls soundtrack and it
basically has all of the music from the
game including the boss battles and
cinematic cutscenes all packed onto the
disc for your enjoyment that is if
you're into that kind of stuff moving
right along we have the behind the
scenes to the set which you get to see
what goes on at Blizzard during the
making of the a blow three it's got a
bunch of cool stuff like interviews and
commentaries and if you're a huge fan of
the elbe like me then this should be
pretty cool experience next up is the
actual game disc itself you can choose
to install using the disc of course or
you can just download it straight from
be net nothing special there they also
included a regular sized mousepad which
was kind of disappointing I wish it was
a bit larger I personally use extra
large mouse pads for gaming also the
mousepad does not have a smooth cloth
surface instead it has that textured
hard surface so if you guys don't mind
the texture or size then it should work
well for you lastly we have the art book
featuring all of the artwork that went
into this expansion from early sketches
to final 3d renders and you get to see
it all in this hard book cover what's
also cool is that you can bring some of
the images of the art book to life with
a downloadable reality viewer app using
iOS or Android so you can see the actual
image in 3d I have yet to try that out
but it actually does sound pretty cool
as with most games Blizzard always
tosses in some free guest passes so you
guys can try out there are thousands of
games I'm showing you guys the CD keys
because I want you to have them I won't
be personally using any of these so the
first person actually wants them they
can have them with that said that
concludes the unboxing of the diablo 3
reaper of souls collected
addition I will be reviewing the game
myself and sharing my thoughts about it
in the next video I'm a huge diablo 3
fan and i was extremely disappointed at
how they ruined the game for a lot of
people so i will be playing expansion
and sharing my thoughts on the game but
before i start i want to know if there
is something you guys want me to cover
specifically in the game or not let me
know in the comment section down below
and i will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
