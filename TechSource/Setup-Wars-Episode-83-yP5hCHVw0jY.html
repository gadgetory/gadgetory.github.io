a.com because they have the cheapest
cd-keys available for pretty much any

if you want to check it out so kicking
off the episode we have a ridiculous
overkill setup from John I have no clue
why he needs 340 inch Samsung TVs on his
desk
but hey it's his setup not mine he's
also rocking the Corsair Vengeance k70
an MX master mouse I'm just surprised
this table hasn't cracked in half
already with those giant displays on it
for audio he is rocking the razor Man
O'War wireless headset which is resting
on top of his PC which by the way has a
Zeon X 5650 CPU and a GTX 1080 needless
to say this has plenty of juice to power
those pixels I also like the placement
of the PC it's off to the left corner
and it's not hidden at all in fact it's
more visible this way by the way I'm
definitely digging your style this room
is giving me a very chill vibe cable
management has also done really well it
looks like John has drilled a few holes
in the desk one for the keyboard and the
other two for the phone dock and a Sound
Blaster audio module even though I is
behind the PC are managed very well all
the way to the back of the setup
job well done John is also a console
gamer he has the ps4 hidden in one of
the drawers for when he is not using
them I'm very happy to see that instead
of keeping it on top of the desk like
most people definitely a very impressive
setup I just don't know how you're able
to sit so close to those giant displays
but hey if it's working for you then
more power to you thank you John for
entering keeping the momentum going we
have Luis and his quad display setup so
he has three Asus 24-inch monitors and a
32 inch UMC TV up top which is hooked up
to his ps4 I don't know if I agree with
the placement of the actual a 40s it
kind of seems a bit far from reach
perhaps a hangar you can hook up under
the desk would be much more convenient
the keyboard of choice is the Razer
BlackWidow tournament
and he's paired that with the razor
destructor to Mouse I like that he
drilled a hole in the desk for cable
management and speaking of which it's
nicely contained with the Signum rack
and a few cable clips looks like Louis
has hooked up both a charging and an
anchor hub for easy access so down here
is the PC as well as a 6700 K and a GTX
970 tricks inside the course er air 540
case I pretty straightforward setup
Thank You Louis for entering a number
three we have Oliver and his white and
orange ish setup so we got the IKEA bed
Kent desk holding up the 28 inch 4k
monitor from Samsung and right above
that he has a 32 inch monitor as an
overhead looks like he is walking some
razor gear as well he has both the
BlackWidow chroma and a Mamba tournament
edition mouse on top of the SteelSeries
extra large mouse pad
looks like he drilled a hole in the desk
as well for cable management and I've
started to notice a lot of these now and
I feel like everyone is getting the idea
from setup boards which is awesome for
audio he has a pair of audio Pro
speakers and two headphones we got the Q
H 90s and a Bowers and Wilkins p7 both
of which I haven't even heard of cable
management is excellent it looks like
everything is hooked up underneath the
desk along with a USB hub and audio
interface which is also hooked up to the
ADK microphone I like that you keep that
hidden behind the monitor when you're
not using it good work the PC does
probably the setup has a 6700 K and an
Asus GTX 1080 a very clean and organized
setup Thank You Oliver
for entering here is another badass
ultra light setup so black and red is
the name of the game and this dude is
rocking the Acer predator Z 35 ultra
wide and a badass custom PC the tower is
from parvum and they make some really
sick custom cases out there but this
beast is rocking a 4790k and an ACS GTX
780 for peripherals he is using a custom
painted Logitech G 710 keyboard and a
custom painted logitech g502 mouse which
are resting on the habit MP 830 mousepad
once again we can see drilling in the
desk for both wires and the cable
management is awesome as well all the
cables are resting on the rack and down
here he also has the popular HyperX
cloud tunes on a hanger and finally for
audio he is rocking a pair of Edifier
our 1800 speakers
a black and red setup done right this is
what I love to see thank you Richard for
blessing my eyeballs with your setup
last but not least we have little Timmy
and his awesome white and black setup up
top is a 42 inch samsung TV and below
that is a 34 inch LG ultra wide being
sandwiched by a pair of KRK Rokit
speakers
I'm definitely diggin the little
modification you have on your Gray Goose
vodka bottle over here with the LEDs
illuminating from the bottom that looks
pretty dope finally we see someone
utilizing skins for his console the
brand is where it's at I'm sure you guys
already know this by the way I'm very
glad that you kept very consistent with
the overall setup steam on the opposite
side is the Bose QuietComfort 15
headphones resting on the mov headphone
hanger and underneath the add-on unit is
the m-audio interface for peripherals he
is using the skilar pro shark une
keyboard and the popular MX master
excellent work with the cable management
the IQ Signum is once again the MVP over
here as well as some 3m tape that's
holding up a few power strips and USB
hubs and of course the PC departing the
setup has an AMD 6300 and then r9 380
finally some love towards AMD I also
want to give you some props I'm sticking
with matching furniture for the rest of
your room overall a very beautiful
symmetrical and organized setup thank
