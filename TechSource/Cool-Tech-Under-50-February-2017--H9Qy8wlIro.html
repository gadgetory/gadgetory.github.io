this video fandom is a very fun app that
lets you compete to be the number one
fan of your favorite celebrities or
brands it's kind of like the Mafia Wars
of the Millennial Generation you
basically use a digital point system and
purchase the number one spot of your
favorite account it's very addicting
they're also kind enough to give away
$1,000 in cash to one lucky subscriber
more info at the end of this video and
I'll drop a link to the app down below
also guys is that some text or is that
welcome to another episode of cool tech
under $50 less begins to kick things off
we have the B Sport 3 from new force
I may be bending the rules a bit because
these are technically a little higher
than $50 but it has to make the
exception because these are some quality
earbuds in fact if you guys put in the
code Tech tech as check out the price
will drop down to around 60 bucks so in
the box you get various ear tips as well
as these things whatever they're called
that wrap around your ear and give you a
more secure fit they also come with a
carrying pouch that feels premium so
these aren't your typical cheap
Bluetooth earphones aluminum and
polycarbonate housing gives the B sports
a premium feeling and besides that it's
also IP 55 certified you won't be able
to completely submerge these in water
but heavy rain or sweat will be no
problem it does have inline controls
with the typical buttons for music
volume and calls and it also has a
pretty decent microphone this is a
microphone test of the optimum new flush
headphone people were pleased to find
that Peter Piper have picked a couple
pages for fable fans I usually don't
have my phone on me when I'm home so I
found the ability to pull up Siri or
Google now wirelessly to be very
convenient in terms of sound quality if
you're not an audiophile
you won't be disappointed you can pretty
much blast fees in max volume and there
will be no distortion and that's not
something I can say for most Bluetooth
earphones in this price range the bass
and treble are well balanced with a kick
in the low ends and the vocals also come
in very clear once you get the correct
ear tips on the sound isolation is
surprisingly decent at about 30 percent
volume I could block out all ambient
noise and around 70% as where you'll
have trouble hearing a police siren they
are that good and finally the battery
life on these will last you around 10
hours on a single charge
well $60 is a very solid pair of earbuds
ask any video producer and they'll tell
you smudges on displays are the ugliest
thing that easily gets overlooked the
thing is it's not that easy to clean
especially to try and wipe away or you
leave smudges and that's where
microfiber cloths also fail and that's
where I roller comes in they claim to be
the best solution in this problem I can
vouch for them and say it's not only
better it takes cleaning your device to
another level what I mean by this is
that the roller also removes bacteria
now I know what you're thinking one of
the bacteria on the roller just go on to
the next surface you apply - well yes
and now clean it with hot water and you
are ready to reuse it without any
worries in fact you can keep using the
product your entire life to test this we
use a smudged up iPad and try to clean
the surface with a microfiber cloth as
you guys can see here it's spread around
the smudge rather than removing it with
the eye roller here we can see an
immediate difference
it's practically night and day it works
with any display and its compact size
make it a great accessory for my camera
bag comparatively the eye roller is $20
price tag is a lot more than a
microfiber cloth but considering how
much better it's performed and its
lifetime of use this a clear winner
let's switch things up and talk about
the velocity our 10 keyless mechanical
keyboard its price of $30 makes it one
of the cheapest mechanical keyboards
available in the market and for its
price this actually builds really well
there's very little flex to the body
you got well-built legs with rubber for
anti slip and a no flex and the keys
while typing the blue lighting is very
subtle but still stands out there's also
some lighting effects that come built-in
so Zora Brown switchers have little
tactile feedback they felt like a
crossover between the red and brown
switches to be honest I found this to be
great when gaming but typing on long
documents weren't as enjoyable compared
to a keyboard blue switches the keys do
feel plasticky but solid as well with
good travel you can fool me the controls
on the function keys quick access to
search calculator and a windows lock e
as well if you don't need a number pad
you won't find a better led back with
mechanical keyboard at $30 the sim peak
is a premium Docs made from
it's minimalistic and supports USB speed
devices I have a silver model here but
they also sell one in dark blue and rose
gold as well its construction is very
solid and has a surprising amount of
weight to it it actually feels like
something Apple would put out the
rubberized feet keeps it from sliding
around my desk but I did find myself
using both of my hands when disconnected
from the dock so I strongly recommend
either using some velcro or maybe even
3m tape to secure this on your desk
the only negative I found is that
instead of using a USB see pass-through
cable which is what they should have
done they actually included a micro USB
cable that attaches to the back instead
a few problems come from this one it
maxes out at USB 2 speeds and second it
doesn't support quick charging he's
looking for quicker transfer and
charging speeds then look elsewhere
otherwise if you're looking for a cool
dock to overnight charge your smartphone
or keep your phone off the desk on your
setup then you're getting a solid
product for 16 dollars last and
certainly not least in price is the
magnetic cable clips from geek pal it's
a very simple concept that saves me time
and keeps my cables working and
organized the buckle has different sized
grooves which support cables from 2.7
millimeters to 3.5 millimeter in width I
can fit charging cables without a
problem and with some force I was even
able to put a sticker cable from my
Audio Technica m50 X's into the buckle
however I do wish they offered a model
with support for cycle cables instead of
looking around to find cables I have all
of my charging cables in one place the
magnets are pretty strong I didn't have
any problems with cables randomly
falling off obviously if something
accidentally pulls on it then it won't
hold for $8.00 this is a great addition
to any desk setup if you guys want to
