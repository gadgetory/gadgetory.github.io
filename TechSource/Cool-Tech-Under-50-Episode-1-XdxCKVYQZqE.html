comm and they having a pretty cool
special where you're going to be
rewarding 50 random users that sign up
$50 towards their account and they can
buy whatever they want but more info on
that later in this video
what's up guys is mtech source and
welcome back to another episode of cool
tech under 50 I know it's been a while
but we are back and to kick things off
we are going to check out this awesome
travel water bottle it may seem like an
ordinary odd shaped water bottle but
what makes it cool is that you can make
it collapse by pushing down on it from
the top it becomes way more compact and
can easily fit inside your pocket or bag
and doesn't take up any extra space
compared to a full-size water bottle
when the lid is closed that prevents the
air inside the bottle to escape making
it impossible to collapse but once you
lift the lid up you can easily collapse
it it's perfect for on-the-go and it's
100% bpa free
and taste and odor free as well it comes
in a 21 or 12 ounce capacity and it's
available in a variety of colors also
guys I do want to emphasize that none of
these products were sponsored I bought
every single one of these with my own
money and if there is a product
sponsored I'll let you guys know always
in the video as well as the description
section but anyways moving on next up is
quite possibly the coolest card wallet
out there now I realize these first two
items aren't really tech but they are
cool enough to feature in this episode
so this is called the tribe card wallet
and it's made out of two Tex ilium
plates that are aluminum weaved and
three k12 patterns that kind of gives
off this cool carbon fiber look and
silencing everything together is these
two stainless steel plates if you're
like me and hate carrying full-size
wallets then this might be something
you're interested in it's definitely one
of the coolest card wallets I've used so
on the website it says that it can hold
up to ten cards but I found that
anything more than eight becomes very
cramped how it works is very simple just
slide your cards inside and when you
need to pull one out you simply hold the
wallet with two fingers on its sides and
push all the cards out from the bottom
once all the cards are pushed out you
can pinch the bottom portion of the
wallet in order to fan out all the cards
then you can simply pull out the one you
want to use once you are done with the
card you can squeeze it back inside the
normal way or use the same fan method
which is easier
as a bonus it can also hold cash you can
either keep it inside between the cards
or slide it behind this field belt it
starts at $49.99 on their website and
goes up depending on what material and
color you go with if you're looking for
a cool minimalistic card wallet then
this is definitely something I recommend
a check out next up is the jelly 5 port
charging station now what sets this one
apart from other charging hubs is mainly
the design I couldn't help but realize
that this looks very similar to my luma
a cliff speakers from my setup so it has
four regular three amp USB ports and the
bottom red one supports Qualcomm 3.0
quick charge meaning it will charge
Qualcomm compatible devices like the HTC
10 LG g6 from 0 to 80 percent in just 35
minutes do keep in mind that this is
only a charging up so you can't connect
this to your PC for data transfers for
only $13 I think this is an awesome USB
charging station that fits well with any
desk setup speaking of desk setups this
next one is a great way to manage your
earbuds so these are both from
brainwaves and they basically give you a
place to hang your earbuds and manage
its cable so the first one goes behind
your monitor like this and the hook part
sticks out from the side the benefit of
this is that you can conveniently access
your earbuds whenever you want however
with this approach the earbuds and its
cables are visible from the front
something I'm obviously not a fan of the
second option is using your we're
mounting version where you would stick
the hanger right behind your display and
hang your earbuds that way the benefit
of this however is that the earbuds and
its cables are hidden but it's less
convenient to access them because you
have to reach over your monitor to get
them all so you don't have to use the
monitor to mount these you can pretty
much use anything you want you can even
hook it up to your wall on the side of
your desk or even on your PC it's only
nine dollars and you guys do get both of
the hangers which is a pretty cool deal
last but not least we got the kylo Ren
3d wall decal this is a really cool
piece of tech that you can hook up
against your wall for decoration
purposes the eyes light up in red which
looks really cool at night and
installation is very easy once you set
the level of the poster peel off the
sticker and place it against the wall
and then apply pressure so that the
vinyl sticks against the wall then you
can start pulling it off and
okay it doesn't work with my wall but
it's supposed to look something like
this
basically after you speak the vinyl
against the wall you'll just need to
drill two screws and hang the mask on it
honestly if you guys have a Star Wars
being set up then this would fit
perfectly in it I think they have also
Darth Vader r2d2 and a few other Star
Wars characters just make sure if you
guys are interested in buying it that
you have a flat wall to install this on
otherwise if you have a wall like mine
which has bumps on it it's not going to
work as always you guys can find all the
products mentioned in this video links
down below but before I end this episode
I will tell you how you can enter to win
one of these products and that's by
signing up for a free account at privacy
comm slash tech stores they will
randomly select 50 users that sign up
and award them $50 credit towards their
account and you guys can use that $50
towards whatever you want you can either
buy anything on Amazon or you can buy
anything that's featured in this video
so for those of you that haven't heard
about privacy calm then you're missing
out because one of the best ways to
protect yourself from online fraud so
one of the features I like about the
privacy app is the fact that it can stop
free trial subscriptions without having
to worry about manually cancelling it
yourself and I'll show you guys an
example so I'll go to audible.com and
sign up for a free 30-day trial and I'll
show you guys how exactly the privacy
extension helps you in terms of
remembering when to cancel so I click on
try audible for free I'm going to sign
up and create a new account okay so now
I have to put in my credit card number
and here's what the privacy app shines
so you'll see a privacy icon right over
here next to your credit card number so
once I click on it I have the option to
use any of the cards I created on the
account again just to remind you guys
that all these cards use a made-up
account number and also a made-up
billing address so if the car does get
confiscated or if you can't detect the
person that hacks your account does not
get your actual information so I'm going
to click on the subscription card that I
created and messy $1.00 total limit so
click on this make sure all the
information is correct on here
and then I'm going to click on use card
so automatically includes in
a fake number on here and then a
facility west of information all right
so I'm gonna click on start a free trial
I can then go to the privacy home and
check out my cards as you can see here
audible already shows up on my card okay
and here's how you automatically cancel
a subscription without having to
manually do it
so I'm just going to put $1.00 so
obviously the subscription of audible is
around fifteen or sixteen dollars so if
it tries to charge this account it's
obviously going to get rejected so once
it gets rejected it's going to
automatically cancel the subscription
alternatively I can always go back on
the card and manually delete it as well
by clicking on this trashcan icon very
easy anyways guys is an awesome
extension if you don't already have it I
highly recommend it to anyone who wants
to add an extra layer of protection
unfortunately online fraud happens when
you least expect it so it's really nice
to have that extra layer of protection I
mean it is free to sign up and you guys
got nothing to lose as I mentioned
before fifty new users that sign up will
get a chance to win a fifty dollar
credit towards their account and they
can use that 50 dollars and buy whatever
they want but anyways make sure you guys
visit privacy comm slash tech stores and
protect yourself starting today thank
you so much for watching I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
