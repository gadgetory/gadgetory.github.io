and welcome to another detailed camera
comparison test this time we are facing
off the iPhone 6s plus against the LG g4
but Before we jump into the samples
let's take a quick look at the specs the
iPhone 6 plus has a 12 megapixel rear
facing camera with an aperture of 2.2
that can shoot up to 4k resolution and
the LG g4 has a 16 megapixel camera with
an aperture of 1.8 that can shoot up to
4k resolution as well for found basting
cameras the iPhone 6s plus has a 5
megapixel camera that can shoot up to
720p and the g4 is 8 megapixel camera
can shoot up to 1080p so without wasting
any more time let's sit back relax and
take a look at some samples
you
you
you
when it comes to autofocusing the 6s
plus does a great job no matter the
situation it's quick and very accurate
and honestly I have no complaints the g4
on the other hand isn't as consistent as
I would have liked depending on how well
lit the background is the phone will
have trouble focusing at times it's
really consistent and gets extremely
annoying at times however both phones
shoot stunning videos the g4 has a much
wider field of view but both shoot with
cooler colors however it looks like the
g4 is more on the cooler side compared
to the 6s the g4 is also notorious for
having oversaturated colors and you can
really tell by looking at the reds it
definitely makes the colors pop out more
but it's at a point where it doesn't
remain true to life the iPhone 6s still
is the color accuracy King the actual
real life colors of the purple bars are
the exact same color as you see in the
iPhone 6s video on the g4 they appear to
be more violet than purple when it comes
to the low-light video the g4 takes the
crown everything is just more clear and
visible I also notice that the lens
constantly tries to refocus and the
edges of the video have the swaying
effect while moving the phone which is
noticeable and kind of annoying for
stabilization both phones were shot in
4k resolution and were snapped on a
device to ensure a very accurate
stabilization reading and from the
footage it's evident that the 6s has a
much better optical image stabilization
there's just too much swaying from the
LG g4 what's up guys and welcome to the
front-facing video camera test and
microphone quality test between the
iPhone 6s plus and the LG g4 it will be
an audio icon somewhere on the screen
and I'll indicate which phone's audio is
being used
and also both phones are being shot in
its highest resolution for pro facing
camera the g4 has sharper footage due to
the higher megapixel count and as he
much wider field of view however as I
said in the video the dynamic range is
completely unbalanced as well the
background is completely over exposed on
the g4 whereas the foreground is
slightly underexposed the iPhone 6s does
a phenomenal job on balancing the
correct amount of exposure now let's
take a look at the daylight pics
sharpness goes to the g4 hands-down no
matter how you look at it the 16
megapixel camera really shines through
providing extra-crispy photos
consistently and as always it has a much
wider field of view in terms of
true-to-life colors the iPhone 6s takes
the cake on that one I mentioned earlier
in the video that the g4 s images are
slightly oversaturated throwing off the
color accuracy and a good example is the
red slide in this picture the actual
color of the polls are in fact purple
and the 6s represents them the best
dynamic range is another thing that the
g4 struggles with in almost every shot
the background is completely overexposed
even with HDR enabled the success does a
much better job even with the phone
facing camera the exposure is nicely
balanced on the 6s
however the sharpness and wider feel the
view pictures you get from the 8
megapixel front-facing camera on the g4
is unparalleled and is easily one of the
best front-facing cameras out there for
low-light pictures I'm gonna have to
give it to the g4 the 1.8 aperture is
really tough to beat pictures are just a
lot more clearer and sharper the success
also has a lot more noise in the g4 and
you guys can tell if i zoom in closer at
bob's car the g4 also does a better job
capturing motion and low-light you can
really see the difference between motion
blur on both of the phones I also like
the flash on the g4 better it's more
powerful so when you need to take
pictures from a distance it lights up
the object you are aiming at as well as
its surroundings whereas the 6s has a
more softer flash so there you have it
both phones have their strengths and
weaknesses
I'm honestly torn between the two of
them I do love the true-life colors and
stabilization from the iPhone success
but the g4 shoots stunning crispy photos
and has amazing low-light performance so
I don't know guys what do you think let
me know by dropping your comments down
