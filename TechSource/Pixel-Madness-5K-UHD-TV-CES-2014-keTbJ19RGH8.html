more CES coverage today we're gonna look
at some incredible TVs that we thought
were the most interesting at CES there
were so many companies at 4k displays I
mean Samsung had some toshiba had some
and even companies that we never heard
of had 4k TVs so instead of just showing
each one that we found we're gonna show
the ones that we thought were the most
interesting the first interesting type
of display we came across were the
curved TVs and the main reason why
they're curved like these is to provide
the user with an immersive experience we
were pretty close to the TV here as you
can see and we were able to view the
entire TV without moving our heads and
it's all about the perspective when
you're looking at the space like these
and the new curved TVs provide a much
better viewing experience
the only possible downside I see is the
viewing experience from the corner I
mean let's say you have a bunch of
people come over at your house and some
are forced to sit on the edge of the
room well because the display is curved
you won't have the full viewing
experience compared to someone sitting
directly in the middle again that
depends on the layout and seating
arrangement but for the most part I
think that the curved display TVs will
enhance your viewing experience we found
that most affordable 4k curved TV that's
currently available and left a link in
the description below if you guys want
to check it out but usually these prices
range up to 9000 and beyond depending on
the size and brand the next interesting
4k TV we discovered was a TCL 84 inch
ultimate TV we have never seen anything
quite like this before not only is this
an 84-inch 4k TV but it has touchscreen
capabilities it comes with a stylus pen
which you can use to turn the TV into
your very own canvas apart from all that
this TV is also a smart TV with Wi-Fi
capabilities so you can transfer files
between your devices there is no news on
a release date nor a price tag on this
since it's still a prototype the next TV
we were impressed by was from Samsung
this is the 110 inch 4k TV and we were
simply stunned by the quality of the
display I would imagine the price tag on
this baby better yet imagine inviting
guests over and they come in and see
this mounted on your wall what I would
like to see is a drop test on this thing
so if you guys want us to pick this up
when it's available and do a drop test
and hit that like button
lastly we came across
Beauty this is Toshiba's extra-wide
ultra-hd 5k TV a true CinemaScope
experience in your home the aspect ratio
on this beast is 21 by 9 and it
optimizes image textures edges and death
for incredible realism this is a true
definition of overkill when it comes to
UHD TVs however if money isn't a concern
to you then I don't see why you
shouldn't have these in every one of
your bedrooms the display is simply
stunning I mean it would be amazing to
play a game on something this incredible
given that they make the games
compatible with 5k in the future so that
wraps up the video on the coolest TVs we
saw at CES we definitely have a lot more
to cover so make sure you guys are
subscribed so you don't miss out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
