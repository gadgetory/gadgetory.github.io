welcome to episode two of what tech we
use which is basically a series I
started on a channel to help smaller
tech channels succeed in this very
oversaturated platform so in this video
we'll be focusing on what camera they
used to shoot their YouTube videos and
also why they picked that camera and as
always guys if you enjoy what you see
consider checking the channels that I'll
drop a link to them down below and maybe
even consider subscribing I know it will
mean the world to them
but anyways I'm done talking I'm gonna
pass it over to ash Taylor the legend
himself
take it away man hey guys Asha so the
camera I'm using these days is the a7s2
from Sony it's been a gradual
progression from where I originally
started and the main reason I decided go
with the camera is because it suits my
style of shooting of the work and tend
to do both the YouTube and externally so
that's things like the internal
stabilization is fantastic it works
better than many of the lens
implementations I've used and as an
added benefit it gives me the ability to
use is with lenses that don't have it
then you have all that obvious stuff
like the low-light capability which is
nothing short of awesome but also living
in a really small space having a
full-frame sensor can also help as I can
get a wider field of view when it comes
to work outside of YouTube it really
varies on the job but I've had the
pleasure of using a wide range of
cameras ranging from the super 16 to the
bollocks to Red's epic W but I have to
say the camera that impressed me the
most is the Ursa mini from Blackmagic
like all that stuff that had a very
rocky start but the potential but this
camera is truly truly insane from what
you pay I love the image it's beautiful
it has an organic texture to it the
flexibility of recording straight pro
res is a huge benefit and the menu
system oh what a joy is it to use I
wanna see if I needed a camera for
professional work this would be it it
has everything that a professional needs
and does it in a way that just allows
you to get on with the things that
matter and focus on the content
okay that's it for me Thank You Edgar
for hitting me up there thanks to all of
you for listening take it easy I'll see
you soon what's going on text source
viewers my name is Hamza and the camera
that I used to film my YouTube videos is
the sony a6300 and this thing is insane
so by far the main feature about this
camera is that practically films 6k
video downscale to 4k internal recording
which is crazy due to how compact the
camera is the reason that I did pick up
the a 6300 was in fact that if films in
slow motion at 120 fps which means I can
be creative and film some really cool
cinematic shots using the specific mode
and the results have been phenomenal I
have taken this thing on various shoot
tested it's low light mode and also
tested its autofocus which is one of the
fastest in the world on any camera this
thing can get pretty powerful as you can
pick two focus points while filming so
overall it's an insane camera and you
can't go wrong but that's about it from
me I hope to see some of you guys over
on my channel and yeah that's about it
all right guys bye what's up guys Sam
here and the camera that I've been using
for the past two years is my faithful
Canon t3i whilst this may not have 4k or
high frame rate recording it's been an
absolute trooper and workhorse of a
camera so the best part about this
camera is the cost it can be found for
as low as around five to six hundred
dollars with a kit lens so that makes it
a great affordable option if you're just
starting out and getting into the
YouTube game the other thing that I
absolutely love about this camera is the
cinematic images you can capture using
it especially if you're willing to get
creative with your lighting perhaps the
biggest downside of this camera is the
low-light capabilities which are
definitely not great but aside from that
this is a really great entry-level DSLR
camera look at your head if I could I
would love to have my next camera
upgrade be either the sony a7r Mark 2
the sony a7s Mark 2 given the internal
4k recording the embodied camera
stabilization the full-frame sensor the
crazy low-light capabilities and the
list goes on so fingers crossed that
might happen soon other than that a big
thank you to Ed for inviting me to be
involved in this video and hopefully my
catchy guys over on my channel soon
I'm Evo's Vox and after nearly 5 years
of shooting on my Canon t3i I was
finally able to upgrade to a better
camera the Panasonic g7 which is what
you're seeing right now this is a
fantastic budget camera with a beautiful
4k image
in a natural film like grain I've been
able to set up some really nice
in-camera settings that don't require me
to do much color grading or color
correction whatsoever
it looks great even with the kit lens
but I also went ahead and got a nice
wroking on 12 millimeter F 2.2 cine lens
to go with it as well and it is
wonderful
the g7 handles low-light way better than
my t3 I ever did and with a Wi-Fi
connectivity and touch screen made it
super easy to learn and adapt to as well
if I get a chance to upgrade again I'd
have to probably upgrade to the
Panasonic gh4 K 60fps 10 bit internal
recording the clips that will come out
of that camera are going to be beautiful
and I can't wait to see what people will
do with it of course I'd love to upgrade
to the red 8k camera that everywhere all
the tech tubers have been upgrading to
lately but that's gonna be forever out
of my budget
hey guys my name is Victor and just like
add I also run a tech channel known as
everything technology and where I
produce tech videos based on consumer
electronics the camera I used to film
all my videos is the Panasonic Lumix G 7
with the Rokinon 60 millimeter F 2.0 the
reason being because it happened to be
on sale bonded up with the rode videomic
pro at the same time when every techy
tuber was switching to 4k I really like
this camera because it shoots 4k has a
touchscreen articulating display and the
soft on it is really easy to use if I
was to upgrade right now but I don't
plan on I would probably go with the
Sony HTTP hundred because it's another
budget 4k camera and it has an aps-c
sensor and that's gonna do for my part
thanks dad for having me on so that is
it for this collab as always make sure
to check out the talent I'll drop a link
to their channels down below guys
consider checking them out maybe even
subscribe if you like what you see thank
you so much for watching leave a like if
you enjoy the series and I'll see you in
the next video
