since I've done a tech deal video in
fact when I did a few weeks ago you guys
enjoyed it a lot and you asked for me to
do a lot more of those on my channel so
in this video I'm going to be going over
ten really cool tech deals that you can
get under 50 bucks so let's go ahead and
start the video so starting out the list
we have the wood puck key wireless
charger from phone salesman this is the
bamboo Edition and it's essentially a
really nice looking wireless charger for
your smartphone the microUSB port is
also hidden underneath to give it a more
discreet look if your smartphone does
not come with wireless charging
capabilities you will need to purchase a
separate power card like the one I have
here this one over here is for the note
4 but they do make one specifically for
each smartphone and I will leave a link
below for that as well for installation
is actually really simple you just pop
open the back cover install the receiver
card and then put back the cover and you
are ready to go the next three products
are from a company called Vince Inc so
first up we have a dual USB port car
charger now this isn't your average USB
car charger this is one of the very few
if not the only car charger with a dual
2.4 amp USB port most car chargers have
the standard 1 amp and others have only
a single 2.4 M port while this one has
two which will provide you with the
fastest charging speeds for two of your
devices at the same time it also
features smart power technology which
will detect with device you plug in and
provide the fastest charging available
next up from Vince Inc we have the five
port 40 watt USB charger when it comes
to five port USB charges this is the
best deal that's currently out there
it also features smart power technology
which detects the device you plug in to
maximize both compatibility and charging
speeds up to 2.4 amps for each port this
is great for people that have multiple
devices that need charging at the same
time lastly we have the Vince link ultra
slim power bank where 20,000 milliamps
of goodness and a very sleek design this
power bank is a great choice for juicing
up your power-hungry devices it comes in
either red white gold or gray and
choose two USB ports and a built-in LED
indicator which will display the battery
percentage it is a bit large for 20,000
milliamps however the price for it is
currently one of the best you can find
anywhere for number five we have the
silicon power 128 gigabyte flash drive
actually let me rephrase that this is a
128 gigabyte USB 3.0 flash drive and
it's currently the best deal out there
so if you're looking for a super
convenient and really fast way of
storing some files then you should
probably check it out soon because these
are selling pretty fast
speaking of storing files next up we
have a one terabyte USB 3.0 portable
hard drive from Toshiba once again this
is one of the best deals out there if
you're looking for a solid one terabyte
of storage space it also comes with a
USB 3.0 cable or faster transfer speeds
and I store both the hard drive and the
USB cables in this neat little hardcover
carrying case from Amazon basics you can
store other stuff in here as well like
charging cables USB drives and even
power banks it doesn't have to be
portable hard drives but I will leave a
link for this as well down below for
number eight we have a very very slim
bluetooth keyboard from or beau it has
an aluminum body with backlit keys that
you can change by simply pressing a key
I did notice that the keys are more
bright on top and more darker towards
the bottom it will last you through a
full days of use and you can pick one up
in either white or black you can connect
it to virtually anything that has
Bluetooth technology from tablets to
smart TVs and even smart phones the keys
do feel spongy while typing after all it
is a membrane keyboard but however I did
not notice any lag while typing and it's
very comfortable to use the fact that
it's super light and thin makes it a
very great keyboard for travel the last
two spots are wireless speakers first up
we have the rover beats t12 portable
bluetooth speaker you can get up to 20
hours of playtime with a connection
range of up to 33 feet and up top we
have the media controls that include
pause skip and volume controls and on
the back is where you will find a
microUSB charging port the auxiliary and
power switch the t12 wireless speaker
provides exceptional sound with enhanced
bass which is perfect for music movies
and games the last product on my list is
a wireless speaker as well from mpow
this is the armored speaker and it's
actually
waterproof and dustproof speaker you can
get up to ten hours of playtime and it
even features a one thousand milliamp
emergency power supply which can be used
to charge up your smartphone or other
devices it isn't much but it's enough to
juice up your device for emergencies the
sound quality on the armor is crisp and
provides rich bass it does have slightly
more white noise than a t12 but both
speakers deliver awesome quality I did
put together a quick sample between the
two so you guys have a better idea of
how each of them sound when compared
with each other both of the speakers are
set to the same negative three decibel
output so the volume is the same on both
but anyways here is the quick music
sample from both of the speakers
anyways that's it for the video I hope
you guys enjoyed it if you did and if
you want to see more types of these
videos definitely let me know by leaving
a like on the video also all the
products mentioned in the video will be
listed in the description section down
below for those of you that are
interested but anyways thanks again for
watching this is that from tech source I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
