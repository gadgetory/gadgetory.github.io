Texas and today I have another camera
comparison for you guys this time we are
facing the new Xperia z2 against the
galaxy s5 before we move on to the
samples let's take a quick look at some
specs the z2 has a twenty point seven
megapixel rear facing camera with an
aperture of 2.0 whereas the Galaxy s5s
camera has a 16 megapixel sensor with a
2.2 aperture for front facing cameras
the z2 has a two point two megapixel
camera that shoots in 1080p and the s5
has a two megapixel camera that can also
shoot in 1080p so that's enough about
the specs that sit back relax and take a
look at some samples
what does it be guys at here from Texas
and we're basically doing a video and
audio test on on all the phones believe
it or not I have four phones mounted on
a piece of wood and pay attention to the
audio icon somewhere on the screen it
will tell you which phone is being used
for its audio and you guys can be the
judge on which of them sound great I
also keep in mind that all of this is on
auto and they are shooting in 1080p that
way we can keep the test fair and also
keep in mind that the auto stabilization
is on on all the phones if there is an
option for that
now here is a sample of the auto
focusing on the z2 some phones cannot
autofocus while recording but the z2 is
one of those that can as you can see it
focuses rather quickly and it is also
very accurate the s5 also did a great
job I'm focusing here I would say in
SATs fast as the z2 if not a little
faster accuracy wise it does not compare
to the z2 I find myself sometimes having
to manually focus because the sensor
would not pick up the object
anyways that concludes the camera test
between the Xperia z2 and the Galaxy s5
judging from the pictures here I am kind
of leaning towards the s5 I personally
think that a better job than the z2 in
most cases it has truer to life colors
and the night shots with flash are just
amazing but I want to know what you guys
think of the test I mean am I wrong
which phone do you think did the best
let me know in the comment section down
below I have a ton of videos coming up
so make sure you guys are subscribed to
the channel so you don't miss out this
is that from tech source and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
