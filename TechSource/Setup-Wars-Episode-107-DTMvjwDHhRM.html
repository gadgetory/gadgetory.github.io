welcome to setup wars episode 107 will
you submit your desk setup to get
featured on the channel if you guys want
to participate make sure to watch the
video linked down below also huge
congrats to all four of the winners of
the LG ultrawide monitor thank you guys
so much for participating I know a lot
of setups do not get featured but
unfortunately I was I can only choose 5
setups per episode so I hope to do more
with LG in the future but anyways with
that said let us set up words begin
the set of gear of the week goes to the
stick on game controller hanger which I
actually featured in my Wolverine setup
it was so popular that it got sold out
the next day after I uploaded the video
if you got ps4 or Xbox controllers
laying around and don't have a dedicated
place to put them
then grab one of these bad boys and
stick them against your desk behind your
monitor or even on the wall and throw
your controllers on them it will help
clean up your setup and it will be a lot
easier reaching for them you can also
use it to hang your headsets and there's
even space around to wrap the cables for
a much cleaner cable management I'll
drop a link below if you guys want to
check it out but with that said let's
begin the show starting off the show we
got a very nice black and red gaming
setup from Isaac the first thing that
caught my attention were the insanely
thin bezels from those aoc gaming
monitors he's got those hooked up to a
mount and below that is a giant energy
speaker which honestly looks out of
place I would either mount that under
the table or against the wall I mean
having it just sit on the desk like that
is not aesthetically pleasing he's also
got the Razer BlackWidow chroma key
board and the Mamba tournament edition
Mouse I know I said that this was a
black and red setup but I just noticed
his yellow course there void headset how
do you choke to walk you work to you
literally everything else is black and
red the gaming chair RGB lights and his
PC which is rocking a 6700 K and an asus
rog Strix 1070 so why couldn't you just
go with a black and red gaming headset
excellent work with the cable management
looks like all the wires are hiding
behind the back board and I kind of like
what you did with a keyboard and mouse
wire instead of drilling a hole in a
desk you kind of tied them together and
random under the speaker and into just
back is that why the speaker is there
are you trying to cover up the cables
because I can't think of another reason
why it's there also props on the wire
management for the Samsung microphone
setup adding some zip ties and the boom
arm keeps the cables from hanging down
it's an excellent setup but it does need
some tweaking
thank you regardless Isaac for anything
next up is James was a very clean triple
monitor setup featuring two BenQ
displays on the side and a 24-inch asus
monitor in the center i was going to say
that symmetry was on point but soon
realized that he has also Zakia
and the LED lamp on one side if you kept
one of them on the left side it would
have been perfect but it's such an easy
fix
again I'm not telling you what to do I
mean if you like your IKEA plant next to
the LED lamp maybe it helps you sleep
better at night I mean who am I to say
otherwise I'm just giving my opinion so
if this is my setup that is what I would
have done that's what the shows about
but anyways back to the show so on the
desk we got the popular coarser strafe
RGB keyboard and that's paired with the
unusual you text font Venus MML gaming
mouse which is the first time I've
actually heard of it for audio is
rocking the HyperX cloud to gaming
headsets a blue Yeti microphone and some
adorable tiny speakers from audio engine
I believe these are the a 2 plus
speakers cable management throughout the
entire setup is nicely done from the
microphone wires cables running down the
martyr and the rest of the cables under
the desk I have no complaints however if
you really want to clean things up a bit
more I recommend picking up a wall
Raceway to cover up those monitor wires
kind of like how I did with my Wolverine
setup down here we got the PC that's
pushing all these pixels it's got the 40
60 70 K and an EVGA GTX 970 it looks
like you have your rap sticks in the
wrong slot and also why are you using
the stock heatsink with the 4670 k you
do realize that an unlocked processor
right if I were you I would pick up a
cooler and overclock that bad boy to its
max other than that it's a pretty clean
set up for the most part that mic
placement is kind of bothering me a bit
but I'm sure you were going for
convenience rather than aesthetics thank
you James for entering remember that
wall channel I was talking about in the
previous set up well Andre here put it
to good use
covering up the cables for all three of
the Samsung monitors and for his TV
which he mounted on the left side nicely
done
he's also using the Corsair strafe RGB
keyboard and the asus rog Gladius mouse
the only audio source he has is the
Corsair avoid RGB wireless headset but
other than a few action figures in the
desc he's got his ps4 over there in the
corner and a foam stand pretty
straightforward stuff nothing too
exciting another desk is where as PC is
chilling it's currently walking me 4790k
and the asus strix 970 with eight gigs
of ram cable management is very clean
there isn't any suggestions I can give
you the only things that come
or the keyboard and mouse wires but
other than that it's a pretty clean
setup Thank You Andre for entering
sarunas is next up with his transformer
desk and I say that because it has many
purposes first up is the DJ set up with
his macbook pioneer headphones and he
turned tables out there we got the
gaming setup with the corsair k70 MX
master mouse razer tartarus keyboard and
blue yeti microphone i also noticed that
each setup has its own set of lights and
the monitor is in a different position
the production setup is when he needs to
create beats and you can see that the
monitor is much closer to him he's able
to adjust the position of the monitor
thanks to the ergo tech freedom arm
which even still today is my favorite
monitor arm of all time and finally we
got the racing setup as you can see
everything else is tucked away and the
only things out are the racing wheel
joystick and the wireless keyboard and
mouse I love that everything has its own
dedicated place and that's because
sarunas custom-built his desk from
scratch major props
he's also improved it quite a bit from
the beginning just like everyone
including myself we will start from
somewhere
this was his original set up a while
back and then he upgraded his monitor
got a few speakers and some DJ equipment
he did pick up a few more upgrades later
down the line and most recently he
upgraded his monitor to an ultra wide by
the way welcome to the ultra wide club
and his newly built desk as you can see
in this picture here's a really cool mod
that I noticed so I want us used to
laptop extension stands to hold up both
of his speakers that is very clever
that's definitely a great alternative
for people that don't want to mount
speakers on the wall or have any extra
space on the desk also kudos on the
hooks that you installed on the side of
the desk to hold up the Xbox controller
and keyboard you really do think of
everything
I would imagine a cable management was a
nightmare to do I setup like this with
so many things to connect but I'm
actually surprised at how clean and
organized he kept everything a bunch of
velcro straps and cable clips made this
possible and even added a stencil drawer
on the bottom that's what I'm talking
about and finally wrapping up the setup
is the PC that's powering everything
it's equipped with a 3770k and a
gigabyte 980ti
this setup has personality its unique
cable management is awesome but most
importantly it has purpose and you know
look guys it's little
on time it's been a while actually
showing us that you're watching
congratulations on receiving the next
official set of words seal of approval

approval will receive a $100 gift card a

thoroughness congratulations on your
amazing set up make sure you toss me an
email and set up wars to claim your
prize finishing up the episode we have a
very clean and simple white and black
setup from V ads with a Star Wars theme
we got the 27 inch HT predator hooked up
to another freedom arm and I like how
it's kind of hidden behind the MacBook
on the desk we got the course of K 65
RGB keyboard and the Mamba chroma Mouse
which is on top of a firefly mousepad
and that's also on top of another
mousepad the only audio source he's got
is the logitech g930 3 headset that's
resting on the headphone stand from 12
cells and speaking of 12 staff the
MacBook stand is also from them the ads
did an amazing job putting all this
together and kept the color scheme on
point as well even inside his PC which
has a 60 70 K 16 gigs of ram and NACS
gtx 1070 and finally for cable
management we got a power strip and a
channel raceway in the back holding up
all the cables no complaints here a very
dull white and black setup Thank You V
