coming out I figured now is the best
time to do a review on the oneplus three
I've put it through enough testing to
where I've established some opinions
that seemed to hold consistent the more
I use this $400 budget of a phone so
first thing it's full metal and with
this change comes the loss of the
customizable backplate design wise it
looks like 20% of other smart phones
coming out these days but still in my
opinion it's an improvement over the
oneplus 2 and a lot better in structural
sense than these full glass phones that
were still getting around the device we
get the usual deal but with the addition
of a notification slider with three
positions all notifications priority
notifications and silent I find this
useful whenever in meetings or out of
the movies and I could silence my phone
without waking the screen now because
this is the gold variant it also has a
white front plate but there is also a
graphite color matched with a backplate
I do have some diamond skins on my phone
here to protect the phone from being
scratched and if you guys haven't heard
of them that I'll drop a link to them
down below if you guys are interested
the storage is capped at 64 gigabytes
with no expandable storage or higher
capacity models instead they included
space for a second SIM card on the SIM
tray which I honestly don't see people
using that often it's popular in China
and India but not here in the states and
I would have opted for a model with a
slot for an SD card if I had that choice
my main Android device is usually the
galaxy s7 edge when I'm not testing
other phones so compared to that it
definitely feels thicker but that's
mostly due to the curved nature of the
s7 edge as the 1 plus 3 is actually 0.3
millimeters thinner it is however bigger
in height and width the 1080p AMOLED
display inherently isn't going to be the
sharpest on the market and it's also not
the brightest that only 413 nits
compared to the s7 edges 855 minutes
what that translates to is it's unusable
in direct sunlight the speaker located
at the bottom gets really loud and
sounds clear but I still wish
manufacturers were just default to a
dual stereo setup at this point but I
don't have any complaints here and back
to you is a quick audio sample
the capacitive home button actually
houses a decent fingerprint reader it's
quick and accurate and I don't have any
complaints here internally I Roxy
Snapdragon 820 chip Adreno 530 GPU and
six gigs of ram these specs paired with
a resource low operating system makes
for a great user experience it kind of
feels like you're using a nexus with
virtually no stutter and a stock look I
actually prefer using this to the Nexus
6p because of the homescreen
customization with a long press you can
now change the look of the Google search
bar icon style homescreen grid size and
many others on the left side of the home
screen you get what's called a shelf
where you can basically add memos pen
frequent contacts and widgets
I actually prefer this to the now page
on google stock launcher but that's just
a personal preference in terms of
battery life I would get a consistent
four hours of on-screen time for my
usage from the 3000 milliamp hour
battery that included with their fast
charging or as they call it - charging
makes battery life on this phone a
non-issue for me it goes from zero to 60
percent in just 30 minutes
when using the included four amp charger
usually with budget phones I expected
the camera to be a very noticeable area
where it suffers but I was actually
surprised with the balance oneplus
achieved with the camera this year it's
a 16 megapixel Sony sensor that has
optical image stabilization and phase
detection autofocus the results are
vibrant and crisp without too much over
sharpening like on the galaxy s7 the
camera is easy to lunch and if you have
gestures turned on tracing a circle will
open up the app allowing for quick snaps
oneplus has also kept the interface
simple with only what you would need at
the moment displayed and everything else
tucked away into the settings in good
light the oneplus 3 takes solid snaps
however it's quite the opposite in
low-light conditions especially if
you're rushing to take your shots the
pictures will be blurry as well as very
dark but overall for a budget phone I'm
really impressed with the
camera
Joshua Bain their disease unit morale
thank you the 1+3 checks all the boxes
in terms of what I look for solid build
good camera smooth performance and great
battery life it's not groundbreaking in
any way and one plus was never about
that they just want to deliver a great
phone at a great price and in my opinion
they've done just that
so if you guys are looking for a phone
at around four hundred bucks with great
performance you'll definitely want to
check this out but that'll do for my
review of the one plus three as always
if you guys enjoyed this videos make
sure to leave a like to show your
support it does help the channel up a
ton and thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
