and the build right behind me is
actually the PC for the month of
September and I'm calling it Jack the
Ripper it's equipped with a new 1950 X
thread Ripper CPU which is a 16 core
processor clocked at 3.5 gigahertz and
it's got two EVGA gtx 980ti FTW three
additions and sli originally i wanted to
go with to Vega 64 cards so that it can
be an all AMD build but unfortunately I
couldn't get my hands on a second one
since they are all out of stock the
motherboard I went with is the MSI X 399
Pro carbon which is MSI's best board for
the X 399 chipsets and for the cooler I
went with the CM master liquid 240
finding Orion drumsticks wasn't easy so
I decided to go with RGB instead and
picked up 32 gigs from g.skill powering
the build is a 1,000 watt power supply
from EVGA which I ended up covering in
some D brand skins to match the color
scheme and finally the case I'm using is
the new cougar conquer case but we're
not here to talk about the PC because I
already made two videos on it the first
one is a very nice montage build of me
putting together everything and the
second video is on the gaming benchmarks
and you guys can find the links to those
down below well we are here to talk
about is the samsung 960 pro m2 nvme SSD
which is what is inside this PC the
point of this video is to find out if
upgrading to an m2 nvme SSD is worth it
samsung has not only sponsored this
video but also send out the 960 pro for
me to test out and see how fast that
really is compared to a standard SATA
SSD and the C is actually worth it to
upgrade for testing purposes I ran the
same benchmarks on both the Samsung 850
Evo and the 960 Pro so I'm not too is
the form factor and an MDOT to nvme SSD
sits in your MDOT two slot on your
motherboard while a standard SATA SSD
uses the SATA ports on your motherboard
the point of this video is to
find out if upgrading to an MDOT to nvme
SSD is worth it
a 512 gigabyte SSD from samsung cost
about 150 bucks and the 960 pro cost
double but how much more performance are
you gaining from it
based on my benchmarks more than half
the game saw a noticeable decrease and
lo times compared to the SATA SSD the
most notable being the vision which got
its time cut nearly in half
even programs load much faster a Vegas
Pro 15 took about 10 seconds to load on
my 850 Evo and it took only 5 seconds on
the 960 Pro but what a 960 Pro really
shines is in data transfer running the
crystal disk mark we get about 3400
megabytes per second on read and 2045
for the write the 960 pro is 6 times
faster than the 850 Evo on Reed and 4
times faster on right the only tests
that weren't affected that much were
boot times and applications that
launched within a few seconds like
chrome or calculator and stuff like that
that won't make a huge difference
anyways you will definitely notice the
speeds on heavy applications like
editing programs games and large file
transfers and don't get me wrong guys
I'm not saying do not buy SATA base that
says these that's not the point of this
video in fact the SATA base test says
these like the 850 Evo are more
affordable and they still offer some
incredibly fast speeds especially if you
add two or more of these in raid 0 but
if you want that extra boost and get
ridiculous speeds and nvme SSD is the
way to go you just have to pay a little
bit more for it I'm actually gonna be
using the 960 Pro in my main build
coming in October and trust me guys you
don't want to miss out so make sure you
subscribe to the channel definitely
check it out it's one of the best m2 and
V mes as these you can buy right now and
we all know that Samsung has a great
reputation when it comes to reliability
and quality products but that pretty
much wraps up this video I'll drop a
link to the samsung 960 pro down below
if you guys want to check it out again a
huge thanks to Samsung for sending it
out and sponsoring this video
if you guys enjoyed it feel free to drop
it you like and if you didn't feel free
to dislike as well that's completely
fine too I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
