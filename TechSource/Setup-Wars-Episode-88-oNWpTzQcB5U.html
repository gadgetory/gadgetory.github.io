I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out so starting off
the episode strong we have absorb a with
an interesting dual monitor setup and
now at first I thought he had two pcs
since the monitors are separated like
that but it turns out he only has one PC
instead I don't know exactly he uses
this setup but if it looks for him then
I have nothing to say at least he's
getting a good neck workout he also has
a 55 inch Grundig TV hooked up on the
top with 225 inch dual monitors below
that and in the middle of the desk is
the Deathstalker gaming keyboard and
Logitech MX master mouse for audio he is
walking a pair of Giggy works C 20
speakers and a logitech g930 wireless
headset that's hanging from the Alex
drawers cable management is pretty much
flawless all the wires are being held up
by D IKEA Signum and even mounted the
remote for his RGB lights on the side of
his desk using some cable clips and 3m
tape the PC that's probably the setup
has a 67 GK and a nice GT X 1080 Strix
this is definitely refreshing to see I
haven't seen a setup quite like this
before
I mean it's organized the metrical and
well put together Thank You op Dubai for
entering speaking of well-put-together
setups check out Nathan's white and blue
ultra white setup right off the bat the
presentation is just wow a 34 inch ultra
wide from LG mounted against the wall
without a single wire nearby you know
what look set up start 1 cables through
the wall it just looks so much cleaner
on the IKEA lemon tabletop he's got the
cursor shape RGB keyboard and that's at
a chroma Mouse which he has drilled a
hole for he's also walking a pair of
both companion 5 speakers and a logitech
g930 headset under the desk I do like
the glasses and mustache prop along with
the letters representing his legal name
on the right side I feel like he's had a
bit of a personality to his entire setup
no complaints that the cable management
looks like everything is under control
it appears that he added some LEDs on
the desk and a few other things for easy
access like a USB hub and a retractable
micro USB cable which is smart and
finally the PC that's powering the setup
has a 3770k and an asus strix gtx 970
symmetry organization and consists
Cinci this setup has all of it excellent
work and thank you Nathan for entering
keeping the momentum going we have a
triple amount of a setup from Timo he's
got the 24 inch Acer in between two 21
inch dual monitors for peripherals he's
using the SteelSeries FX 350 keyboard
Logitech g600 mouse and that's pretty
much everything on the desk
other than the at2020 microphone and his
PC which is equipped with a 4690k and an
msi gtx 970 on the top shelf is a pair
of logitech z 623 speakers and the
popular HyperX cloud 2 headset he also
has a gaming wheel for a logitech for
racing game not much cootie-cat cable
management since the backboard is
blocking everything so on that note it's
a pretty straightforward and clean setup
Thank You T news for entering and number
four we have Tom and a gothic theme set
up literally everything here is in black
he has an Acer x 34 predator ultrawide
monitor a Logitech G 910 Orion
spark keyboard and a G 900 Kaos Mouse
from Logitech for audio he is using a
pair of both companion 2 speakers and
bose qc25 headphones resting on the
newbie headphone hangers from the looks
of it cable management seems to be on
the control but can we have a look at
this pc this thing looks incredible the
N win 805 case is definitely a cool
looking case but check out what's inside
with an i7 60 a 50k overclock to 4.4
gigahertz 32 gigs of RAM a Samsung 950
pro m2 SSD and a gigabyte GG X 1080 with
exceptional cable management he painted
the orange parts from the gigabyte GPU
to black along with a few other parts
like the PCIe brackets and fan wires his
setup may seem a bit cramps but
everything is organized neatly and has
purpose
I gotta get props to staying consistent
with the overall black theme as well
thank you Tom for entering when I look
at a setup like Vince's for example I
can't help but see myself in it it seems
like he is a neat freak with some OCD
just like me and if this setup doesn't
proves that then I don't know what will
on a single wire is in sight and even
mounted his custom water-cooled PC
that's rockin a 6700 K and a gtx 980ti
inside the alien lead pc OS 6s case also
mounted against the desk is a master 40
inch 4k monitor from AMH he'll even his
center speaker is mounted
right below that it doesn't look like
Vince uses any headphones the only audio
source are those JBL laughs 30 speakers
the keyboard of choice is the Razer
Deathstalker ultimate and the mouse is
the chroma Naga both from Razer and they
are resting on a Deathstalker extended
mousepad looks like he jeweled a hole
for the keyboard and mouse and the rest
of the cable management is pretty good
there was a power strip mounted on the
back board and the Sony receiver is also
mounted however I do see some loose
wires behind the Sony subwoofer I do
like the fact that represents house
targaryen like me so I'll give them some
points there the flags on both sides of
the setup along with the lights shining
down on them are definitely a nice touch
and add some personality to the entire
setup job well done and thank you for
