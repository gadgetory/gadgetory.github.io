to another build on the channel this
one's gonna be an interesting one
because we're gonna be building inside
this massive case from deep cool this is
the quad stellar and you guys might have
seen it on our CES coverage 2018 but
we're gonna be building inside here the
parts are honestly not that important
really building this to showcase the
case it's time this star I really if I'm
building this to show off the case and
what it can do because it got some
really dope features and even has
movable parts which you can control
using your smartphone so that is what
I'm gonna be focusing on for this
episode and you want to take this time
and talk about Armada modern tanks who
is also sponsoring this video I've had
the opportunity to play this game and
I've been hooked on it ever since
it's a cross-platform 5v5 pvp game
featuring tanks I mean what can be more
cool than that you get to control tanks
and use them to fight over realistic
environments with actual physics built
in the game almost everything can be
destroyed in game from trees falling
down all the way to breaking through
walls combine that with the excellent
graphics and sound you get that
immersive experience my favorite part
about this game is that you can choose
from up to 25 different tanks from the
hangar and you can even upgrade them as
you progress throughout the game not
only is each tank unique but it also has
its very own unique play style and
attributes
not only is Armada modern tanks
free-to-play but it's also a
multi-platform game and it's available
all the platforms listed on the screen
and just my subscribers when you
download the game using the link in the
description section you'll not only get
a VIP account but also a hundred gold
and a hundred thousand silver which is a
really nice bonus to give you guys a
head start on your game as always this
is a tech source build so we're gonna be
throwing in high-end overkill parts
we're gonna with the 78 20 X 8 core
processor this is actually a 128 gig kit
from Corsair I don't think gonna be
using all hundred 20 gigs we might just
throw in 64 gigs or something we're also
obviously using these tricks 1080 Ti and
we're gonna be cooling the cpu with the
h1
the i-pro from coarser powering the
build is the EVGA 1000 g3 for the
motherboard we're going with the asus
rampage 6 which is actually the
motherboard we're gonna be using for the
two and one ultimate gaming PC which is
what we're gonna be building after this
guys I know you've been asking for it
and for storage we are only using 400 80
gigabytes this is the coarser and P 500
m2 SSD again we're not putting emphasis
on storage or the parts we really just
want to show off the case and what it
can do so with that said I think it's
time we can start to build alright guys
well let's begin it there's always
something about opening up a fresh new
processor that gets me excited you know
what I mean but if you guys remember by
a trigon build I did in the Tri stellar
case last year it turned out great but
there was one thing I didn't really like
about the case and that was the tempered
glass panel was held together with thumb
screws which was kind of annoying but
people actually had a solution to that
for their Kwas dollar case they actually
done magnetically which is awesome
alright so we've got the CPU out
Oh welcome to the Republic ladies and
gentlemen and the ROG rampage six
extreme a little fun fact about this
motherboard this is actually the board
were going to be using for the
two-in-one gaming PC and also my rebuild
of big red which is coming up guys I'm
not happy with my current PC some
whenever we build it completely new
motherboard you see few new bands still
it's gonna be awesome make sure you guys
stick around for that it's pop open the
cover I mean the board does have a trap
slot so we might even just use all 128
gigs of this why the hell not it's there
might as well use it right so yeah seven
eight twenty X so I mean if there was a
purpose for this PC it would be for
pretty much anything right gaming
streaming productivity this processor
can pretty much handle all of that and
it's unlocked overclock it as well so
all-purpose gaming and productivity PC
that's kind of what the purpose of this
build is now the tricky part is finding
out where the hell the m dot 2 slides in
you've got this massive cover over here
I'm guessing it's gonna be underneath it
so there must be a way that I can pop
this off the first time I've actually
build using this on the ball there as I
can see already there's one down here
I'm guessing there's one more over here
underneath the first PCI slot so it's
gonna pop this cover off
whoa okay well there's MDOT to slot down
here it's got to put the end back to you
in there first
take him cover it up we're gonna keep
this PC as clean as possible guys only
one storage device and that's gonna be
an EM about two so all right boom put
this cover back on all right easy all
right now let's put on the RAM fresh 128
gigs straight from the factory guys oh
and by the way guys these are rated at
thirty hundred megahertz so not only are
we putting 128 gigs but we're putting in
some really fast related RAM sticks
oh-ho-ho man that's insane I've never
used this much where I mean any of my
builds before I think the most I've used
was 64 gigs so this is pretty much
double that guys check it out
look at those beauties alright so got
that out of the way I think it's time to
put inside the case so let's bring that
up here shall we
there we go alright so the center over
here is pretty much where the
motherboard sits and it can support up
to an e ATX board and it actually sits
upside down because the i/o shield is
down here it also supports water cooling
so you can fit up to 240 millimeter
radiator near the bottom and up to three
hundred sixty millimeter radiator which
is what we're going to be putting in
this one over here on this side kind of
vertically in the front of the case the
back over here is where the power supply
sits and on the top over here is pretty
much the storage unit so the guys this
thing has up to nine
so you can fit up to nine hard drives or
SSDs and there's even extra SSD tray
right here in the front
as far as SLI you can actually support
up to four-way SLI or 3-way crossfire
whatever your motherboard can support
you can fit that many GPUs inside this
case because there's plenty of clearance
on the bottom now if you guys are going
with a single GPU configuration you can
also mount your GPU vertically on this
side because it does come with an
extension built a PCIe build whatever
you guys want to call it so yeah for
this build guys obviously we're going
with a single 1080i so I'm just gonna
mount it over here on the top which I
think will look cooler all right so
before we install the motherboard we
gotta remove this entire plate here so
that nothing gets in the way and we make
sure that we do tighten all the screws
inside the case so I think it's really
easy to remove this there's just some
thumb screws holding it up on this side
and then two more over here alright so
once those four thumb screws are out I
think you just slide this off just like
that
okay alright guys so that pretty much
just gives us easy access for the entire
motherboard tray so if we need to do any
cable management we route any cables
through the grommets or installing the
motherboard it's gonna be a lot easier
without that plate in the way I just
noticed that this fan is in the way so
if we're gonna be using the three
hundred sixty millimeter radiator from
courser we're gonna need this entire
plate open so we're going to remove the
stock fan and I think it was an easier
way to doing this maybe if I just remove
these two screws here I can remove this
entire plate let's check it out
Oh nope of course not nothing is that
easy I think there's two more screws on
the backside okay so there are actually
three thumb screws there's one on the
bottom one in the middle and then one on
the top so let's go ahead and remove
these real quick yep it looks like that
was it god I love a see some other
boards the i/o shield is already
included already installed on the
motherboard it's time to install the
power supply again along with a 1000 g3
from EVGA and this actually the case has
plenty of clearance for even like the
super long extended power supplies so
you have this entire space over here not
only for the power supply but also to
store up all the excess cables so I was
thinking about going with custom cables
but since they're gonna be covered
anyways inside the tempered glass panel
and we're really just showing off the
case
I said why the hell now let's skip at
this time around because you guys know I
pretty much use custom sleek cables and
almost every single one of my builds
sometimes it's okay to use the stock
cables don't care they're not that
hideous they're okay they're pretty bad
but stuff all right see how this fits in
here
there you go just like that and that's
up to scooter man all right
power supply done it's time to hook up
some cables 2,000 years later all right
so now it's time to install the h1 50i
cooler but there's actually something
interesting about this and I'll tell you
guys because we're not gonna be using
the stock fans that come with this
all right so instead of the stock fans
are gonna be using the gamers storm mf1
20s now there is actually a major design
flaw with these fans the way they're
designed it's always gonna be used as
intake I do I gotta say that the
packaging on this is premium I've never
seen packaging quite like this on any
other fans so camera storm good job
all right so these are the fans itself
so this is what I was talking about guys
the way it's designed so if you want
airflow coming in the opposite direction
you can't really switch it around
because of the way the fans are designed
so yeah that's why there was a design
flaw with these fans as cool as they
look and as great the cooling
performances fortunately there's only
one way to use them all right now it's
time to install the fans on the radiator
so fortunately there's only one way you
could put them on
all right Oh friends are installed the
way they're hooked up to the control
panel is by these microUSB cables which
connect to the edge of the fans like
this so when it hooks up to the edge
here and then this end connects to the
back of the control panel and to give
power to the hub you have to hook up the
SATA power cable that comes with it and
then of course this end connects to the
power supply
alright let's screw the bracket back on
the case so there are two ways you can
mount the GPU guys the original way
where you just sit it on top of the PCI
slot on the motherboard and you can
actually leave this off so you can see
the entire motherboard in the GPU or
option number two you can use the
included vertical bracket with the
extension belt and just to change things
up a bit and to show you guys what it
looks like inside the quad stellar case
we're gonna use the actual bracket so
I'm gonna put this back on
alright guys the build is finally
complete well now it's time to load up
windows on it and stall some games
overclock the CPU and the graphics card
check out temps and bring you guys the
benchmark portion my first impression is
building inside the qua stellar guys
very positive I love how ginormous the
case is and because of that he gets so
much space to pretty much do whatever
you want inside right you got room for
too long radiators there's nine
harddrive base for SSDs and hard drives
overall the case design is phenomenal so
props to deep cool for that but yeah
guys let's take this downstairs and see
what it can do so here it is ladies and
gentlemen the quad stellar build finally
complete easily one of the coolest cases
I have built in with that said it's not
for everyone this case goes for 380
dollars guys and they be gonna be
spending that kind of money on a case
then you're obviously planning on doing
something crazy with it the qua stellar
is aimed mostly for PC enthusiasts
modders and people who are planning on
doing high-end builds however if you are
gonna buy the case I strongly recommend
going with the water cooler out because
the temps in here weren't that great ok
so I tested for night and 4k resolution
high settings and pay attention to the
temperatures not so much the CPU but the
GPU which by the way is located near the
top of the case with the front panel
close on the case the GPU peaked at 81
degrees after playing for just about 15
minutes it did hover between 79 to 81
degrees now opening up the front panel
didn't seem to do anything to the
temperatures it may have dropped the
temperature by one degree Celsius at
most so nothing really impressive there
same thing with the CPU no noticeable
difference in temps but check this out
guys once I remove the glass panel on
top of the GPU you can see the temps
drop drastically for both the CPU and
GPU both of them starting at 80 degrees
and dipping down to as low as 71
that's almost a 10-degree difference
just by removing the glass panel now the
testing was done on regular fan setting
on both the croisé stellar fans as well
as the MF 120 s and this is what it
sounds like guys with the regular fan
profile on here on Idol now if you want
better cooling like a few degrees
Celsius you can put it too powerful but
this is how loud the fans get so yeah
noticeable difference coming from
regular and even on silent guys check
this out on silent it's still audible so
needless to say if you're gonna be
gaming next to this thing make sure you
have your headphones on so yeah guys
that's why I recommend going the
water-cooled route I feel like you get
better temps air cooling just doesn't
cut it in this case and I'm still using
a single GPU guys imagine SLI or
crossfire I mean you'll be pretty much
baking in there like an oven also guys
just to be clear there isn't any
throttling present from my testing sure
the CPU and GPU get nice and toasty in
there but they don't affect performance
I tested destiny 2 and GTA 5 in 4k
resolution as well and the same exact
temperature differences were found with
and without the tempered glass panel so
to conclude this video the quad stellar
is a dope looking case made for PC
mothers and enthusiasts
I love the alien-like design and the
enormous amount of space inside to do a
custom loop or some creative stuff and
of course the app you can not only
control the RGB lights and the fan speed
of the case but you can even control the
flaps in the front obviously it doesn't
really do much for performance but it
looks cool and you can impress your
friends when they come over
I do wish however that the fan and the
case controls were on one app instead of
having to download two separate ones but
it's not really a big deal anyways
that's it for the video I hope you guys
enjoyed it thumbs up if you guys
actually want to see a custom loop
inside the quad stellar if this video
gets 10,000 likes I'll start planning it
right now so let me know your feedback
as well as the color scheme you guys
want to see for the quad stellar I'll
also drop links below if you guys want
to check it out thanks again for
watching and I will see you in the next
thanks again for watching guys don't
forget to check out Armada modern tanks
when you click on the link below and
download the game you'll not only get a
VIP account but also 100 gold and a
hundred thousand silver to kickstart
your game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
