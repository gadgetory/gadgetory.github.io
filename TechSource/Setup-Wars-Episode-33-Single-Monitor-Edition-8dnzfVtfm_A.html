will be linked down below so here are
your 5 lucky contestants we have Janne
Jean a Matt Ryan and tuber
congratulations for making it a setup
for is episode 33 first up we have Jan
and his single 24-inch AOC monitor on
top of some sort of a white block that's
used as they stand on the desk itself
you have an Amazon basics bluetooth
keyboard and a logitech t6 51 trackpad
as a mouse this setup is being powered
by the 2014 MacBook Air which is off to
the side and at the opposite side we
have the Xbox 360 and a pretty sweet
stand for the controller and the Nexus 7
cable management is very clean just like
this entire room to be honest everything
is nicely organized just look at this
shelf for instance it's organized from
small to large I also really like the
Justin model artwork you have around
your room that's definitely something I
approve overall a very minimalistic and
very clean setup Thank You Jan for
entering GNA is next up with a 24 inch
asus monitor a cursor key 30 keyboard
and a razer deathadder mouse after the
left side we have a pair of Bose QC 5
teen headphones resting on top of the
PlayStation 4 and under the monitor we
have a Bose Soundlink mini
cables aren't visible so I can't really
criticize you and give you tips but we
can take a look at that dope PC which is
rocking an FX 8320 and an Asus r9 290
GPU other than adding a monitor riser to
clean up the overall look of your setup
there's really nothing else to say Thank
You janae for entering a number 3 we
have math with a 27-inch Asus monitor on
top of this a touchy monitor stand that
I recommended in the past it features a
few USB ports in the front for easy
access and audio ports for connecting
headphones or microphones on the desk we
have an Apple wireless keyboard any Mad
Catz bluetooth mouse which is definitely
an interesting combination we also have
a pair of M audio speakers and AV 6 a.m.
microphone great work with cable
management
I noticed the e box cable box down there
hiding the power strip inside and you
know it's always nice seeing my
recommendations and a set up regardless
if they got the idea of
me or not regardless is a very clean
setup thank you Matt for entering next
setup is from Ryan with a 21.5 inch
monitor a Roseville mechanical gaming
keyboard and a Logitech g600 gaming
mouse I'm really digging that blackmont
understand you have and on the top to
the left of that you have a pair of em
50s to the right of that setup you have
a Samsung TV with a few consoles
underneath so we have a n64 up top a ps4
and an Xbox 360 all the way on the
bottom
excellent work with cable management no
wires touching the ground and they are
neatly wrapped together I also like how
you hide the keyboard and mouse under
the monitor stand when not in use you
certainly know how to keep a setup very
clean and for that I will give you a
point Thank You Ryan for entering last
but not least we have to BER with a 29
inch LG monitor a steel series apex
keyboard and a Roccat Kone mouse on top
of the attitude one extended mouse pad
also on a desk you have a pair of
Logitech z5o 6 speakers and a nice
collection of speed link Wireless game
pads off to the left side the cable
management game is strong on this one I
see that the desk comes with a dedicated
spot for cables and that is pretty sweet
to be honest I will go ahead and drop a
link to the desk if anyone is interested
it's really rare seeing an in win PC
case on setup pours so it's always a
pleasant surprise coming across one this
is the N win 904 glass case and inside
this sexy thing we have a 4790k paired
with a ZOTAC gtx 980ti
the only thing i'll recommend buying is
a controller rack that you could hook up
to the wall or even to the side of your
desk not only will that free up some
space but it'll really clean up the
surface of your desk but I don't that
you have a really sweet setup thank you

episode of setup wars you guys know what
to do drop your comments down below and
vote on who has the best desk setup as
always I'll announce the winner on
