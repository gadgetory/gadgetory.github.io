today I'm going to show you how to
unlock your Nokia Lumia 1520 smartphone
for all countries regardless of what
carrier you have unlocking your phone
allows you to use your phone with other
networks and the process is completely
safe and does not harm your phone in any
way so first off we need to get unlock
code for the phone before we proceed
with the unlocking procedure I
personally use the unlocking company for
all my devices because not only are they
the largest unlocking company to date
but they also unlock almost every GSM
model ever made and on top of all that
they have the lowest prices available in
the market with 24/7 customer support so
to demonstrate the process I'm going to
use the AT&amp;amp;T version and unlock it so I
can use it on my t-mobile network like I
said earlier it's the same exact steps
for all countries and carriers worldwide
so head on over to the unlocking company
comm and there your gonna be selecting
the phone's manufacturer and phone model
from the drop-down list and once you do
that select get a locking code which
takes you to the next step and that is
to select what country you purchased a
phone from as well as the carrier of the
phone this is the carrier that the phone
is originally purchased from you will
need the phone's IMEI number to continue
and I'm gonna show you how to look it up
on your phone that's actually really
simple
you basically go to your dial pad and
you enter in star pound zero six found
and the code will immediately show up
and you will need to enter that on a
website to continue make sure you select
the correct currency for your country
before moving on once you select get a
locking code and purchases securely with
PayPal they will email you the code the
price and time vary depending on the
phone but they do guarantee that you are
getting the lowest price and the fastest
delivery times currently in the market
once you receive your code via email
it's time to unlock your device turn on
your phone and remove the SIM tray you
can use either a paperclip or something
else with a sharp end to do this once
the tray is removed insert your SIM card
in the tray however please note that if
your SIM card is too big or too small to
fit the tray then you are going to need
to adjust the size accordingly for it to
fit properly I actually provided you
guys with a link in the description of
where you can buy a SIM adapter or a
cutting tool as well as an instructional
video on how to you
unless you know how to do with yourself
so go ahead and insert the sim tray back
into your phone and it will either
restart or prompt you to enter the pin
number if it doesn't do either of those
and manually restart the phone yourself
and once it boots up it will ask you to
enter in the pin number to unlock the
phone and this is where you input the
code that you receive via email once
except that your phone is now unlocked
and you can begin using it immediately
so that's how you unlock your Nokia
Lumia 1520 smartphone if you found this
video helpful feel free to leave a like
and if you have any questions or
concerns you could leave a comment down
below and as always I will see you next
