that I would make a video and show you
guys how I edit and record my videos
some a matter my word in this video
we're gonna be focusing on how I record
and edit my sound and in the next video
we'll be focusing on how I record and
edit my videos I'm also planning on
making a video on the top five best
budget microphones and there will be
audio samples as well so be sure to hit
that like button if you guys are excited
to see that by no means my audio is
perfect I just want to get that across I
don't want to come off as having the
best audio on YouTube when I am far from
it but if you're watching this video and
you think my audio is crispy enough or
good enough then this video will
definitely help you out so first off I
have two setups when recording audio the
first one in the most common that you're
actually watching and hearing now is the
on-camera audio I have my son Heiser mkh
for 16 hooked up to my H 5 zoom recorder
and this is how I record my on-camera
audio so you can't see the microphone
it's actually right above me and the
idea is to basically get the microphone
as close to your mouth as possible
at the same time trying to keep it off
of the frame
also make sure your decibel levels are
not exceeding the recording device on my
H 5 zoom I try and keep a sound level
around negative 6 s oppose anything
above that I can start hearing
distortion so how do I record my audio
well as I mentioned before my on-camera
audio is recorded directly into my H 5
zoom which is then stored onto an SD
card my second audio setup is for my
voiceovers foreign boxing's reviews and
other videos where i'm not in front of
the camera in fact I'm recording this
segment of the video with my voiceover
setup I have the focusrite scarlett 2i2
interface package that comes with the CM
twenty-five condenser microphone and the
interface itself if you're recording
audio you need yes need an audio
interface and improves the sound output
especially if you don't have a sound
card in your PC the scarlett 2i2 is one
of the best bang for your buck piece of
hardware you can buy and a lot of
professionals and high-end tech channels
still use it today
this package does come with headphones
but I immediately replace them with my
80 hm 50 X's which I only use to edit
and monitor
sound since they aren't as comfortable
to wear them for long hours at a time as
you can see it's covered in some
carbon-fiber skins from the brand and
they actually release skins for the m-40
X's and M 50s as well so you guys want
to spice up your headphones make sure to
check them out I'll go and drop a link
down below along with all the products I
mentioned in this video
so my mic is hooked up to the newer boom
arm that allows me to position the
microphone at a comfortable angle while
recording my voice overs at my desk I
also attached a pop filter to block out
the popping sounds the voiceover audio
is recorded on the audacity program
which a lot of people use not because
it's free but because it offers a bunch
of editing tools to improve your audio
which I will go over soon okay so what
do I do once my audio is recorded
well I edit it I drag the file into my
audacity program here's what a typical
recording looks like of mine and it
obviously differs from the type of
content and location first thing I do is
remove the background sound because the
h5 zoom picks up a lot of background
noise normally I stay quiet for the
first five seconds of the recording so
that the microphone picks up all of the
ambient noises around me so it's easier
for me to select it I then highlight the
ambient noises go into effects select
noise reduction and click on noise
profile after that I go back and double
click on the audio track to select the
entire recording and then go back into
the effects tab and select noise
reduction again but this time I hit OK
and what that does is it removes all of
the background noise
here's a quick before and after so you
guys can hear the difference so I
promise you guys a few months back that
I would make a video and show you guys
how I edit and record my videos so I
promise you guys a few months back that
I would make a video and show you guys
how I edit and record my videos the
other two things I do on my sound edits
are normalizing the waveform to negative
3 decibels and lastly I mess with the
equalization a bit to give it some extra
bass and treble if you want to copy
these settings and try them out for
yourself you can select the unnamed
profile and click and drag the lines to
match my graph here's a quick sample I
did before and after a full sound edit
so I promised you guys a few months back
that I would make a video and show
guys how I edit and record my videos so
I promised you guys a few months back
that I would make a video and show you
guys how I edit and record my videos so
yeah it's basically how I record and
edit my sound as I said before I've not
an audio expert as much as I want to be
I'm sure there are other settings on
audacity that you guys can mess with to
improve your audio like amplify and
compression and a bunch of other
settings so don't think that these
settings are the best for any recording
it just seems to work for my content and
my recording style recording and editing
audio is definitely something you guys
want to improve on if you're a content
creator like me it's definitely hard to
find really great tutorials online to
learn stuff like that I remember
spending hours on YouTube back in the
day searching on how to record and edit
audio actually you guys watch my
previous my very old videos you'll see
how bad the audio was and how I've
actually improved since then I'm still
trying to find ways to improve my audio
as well and thanks to lynda.com
searching for tutorials has never been
easy they have an entire section with 43
videos just on audacity itself which is
great for anyone that wants to improve
their audio lynda.com also has thousands
of other tutorials shot and HD related

you guys

I shoot and edit my videos make sure to
