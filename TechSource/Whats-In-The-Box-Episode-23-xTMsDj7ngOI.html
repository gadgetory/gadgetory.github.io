definitely one in my bag thank you guys
so much we got a wall charger with a few
USB ports in there also a Type C so this
is a tangle free lightning cable which
is made out of brushed aluminum alloy
cable then I felt like uses something

basic remote in the front and then in

Core for settings in now that it's time
for a DS finale let's go ahead and open
up at the Box on my right yes ladies and
gentlemen that this is exactly what you
thought it is it is a gaming laptop of
course but it is no ordinary gaming
laptop this I can get it out of the box
are you guys ready for this
oh my god this is heavier than I thought
actually this here is you a sous Zeb I
think as I said gaming laptop with the
max-q technology basically there's a
full-size GE X 1080 Pascal card in here
and look up in Sam laptop is open it is
ridiculous that you can set a 1080 in
here look how thin this thing is guys
I'm so excited to do a video on this
huge thanks to Nvidia presenting this
and I am very excited so it's probably
going to be my main gaming laptop if I
ever game on a laptop but very very
stoked this thing looks badass it's all
black got that spell flak look here with
the brushed aluminum look on the top
very nice and down here we just got some
accessories oh they even come with a
twist pad look at this wrist rest
because we can see there's a screwdriver
I'm guessing to access the back if you
want to upgrade them colonel
very thoughtful of ACS to include that
at the power brake and just physics
company I'm not going to bore you guys
with fun yeah if you guys are excited to
check this out let me know I job in your
life and maybe I was gonna say maybe
I'll do a giveaway but I don't know
we'll see the video gets 50,000 likes I
will you know what yeah at this video
gets 50,000 likes I'll do a giveaway on
this bad boy because I'm personally not
a gaming laptop person so I'm not gonna
use it anyways so I'll be pretty cool
anyways moving on to the last and final
box oh yeah here she is this one I'm
actually the most excited about and I'll
show you guys why in a bit
this here is the most expensive case
that I know of personally that I've
purchased and this is going to be my I
want to say my main PC but definitely
one of my main PC
you guys will never guess what case this
is never you know why because it's not
even available in the US that's why okay
yeah this is not happening you know what
I can't even show you this case because
it's literally taken apart every single
side panel I have to install myself so I
can't even show you I'm going to show
you a picture of it something else the
best way so this is the hex here are 40
it's going to be the old white one I
don't know why this is black and white
here's a picture of it somewhere on the
screen you guys can see what it actually
looks like this is a micro I might be
some micro ATX form Baxter cakes but
anyways that is up of the video hope you
guys enjoy it if you want to check out
