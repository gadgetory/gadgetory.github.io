to part 4 of my water-cooling journey
it's been a bumpy start but I learned a
lot and I think what really set me back
a week was a paint but good news is I
finally got the paint and I resprayed
everything and it looks so much better
so check that out guys this yellow is so
much better than before and it actually
matches with the RAM sticks and the
cables of course which I'll show you
guys later and also the coolant the
coolant is going to be very similar to
this if not it's going to be pretty much
identical so let's go and get some
progress done with this build guys I'm
gonna put together the brackets on the
GPU or put back the CPU
block brackets and then finally work on
the rest of the build I'm going to put
on the radiators see if you can do the
pump in this video so yeah lots to do
guys let's go and start cracking
and there we have it guys we are finally
back on track so much better than before
our FBI has watched episode one I think
was episode two was like basically
pitch-black the only yellow where the
RAM sticks but now we have a little more
yellow in the build of course you got
the CPU block bracket thumb screws
that's the leverage and someone is
calling me and of course we got the back
as well which came out beautifully
overall I'm definitely liking the way
this build is going so it's going to put
on the fans on the radiators maybe we
get the pump going and then continue on
with this build
all right so the big radiator is going
to be mounted on the top here like this
actually so that way I can run the tube
from here straight to the CPU add the
CPU to the GPU and then run the tubing
down here to the reservoir and of course
back to this radiator another phone call
ok so yeah and this one is going to go
on this side I just don't know if it's
going to go this way or the other way
because you can choose which side the
hole is so I don't think it really
matters too much actually probably I
probably put this on that side simply
flip this over I just don't want to put
anything on it yet or tighten it because
I might have to change things up a bit
but that side is definitely correct so I
guess it's good and start mounting the
fans on there and then mount this to the
case put on this thing over here and
then yeah see what happens
for watching
all right so here is our first problem
so because I had to put these on the top
here the top portion of the case does
not sit flush as you guys can see there
is a gap the thumb screw on here is
pretty much blocking this entire bracket
to sit flush with the radiator as you
guys can see so I'm gonna have to I
guess deal with it there's no other way
around it if I'm going to mount this on
the top of the case there is no other
way around there so I'm at the tighten
other sides and see what happens I keep
like
we don't know where it came from
they can't imagine where it goes so
surprisingly I managed to make it work
there's maybe about a centimeter gap
between the bracket and the radiator on
abs can tell which is fine it's not only
going to be noticeable and it's not
going to prevent the rater than from
being mounted at the top so it's going
to put this back on the case and work on
the other side houston we have another
problem so apparently this part sticking
out as you guys can see is not good at
all this part is pushing against the
case and it's not letting me align the
holes near the top that makes any sense
but this part is basically pushing this
entire piece to the right and the holes
over here are not aligning with the
holes on the case so I don't know what
to do I just think this radiator is
maybe the design I feel like it's the
right size but I feel like the way they
designed it you know going like this
slanting is not compatible with this
case so there's only two options or
three options actually first option is
obviously order a different radiator
that it doesn't have something like this
sticking out if it's it flush if it sits
flush with this bracket here it would
have been hundred percent fine the fact
that sticking out like this is not going
to work with this case option two I
scratch the build and work on a
different case which obviously don't
want to do and then your option three
which basically hug the PC and jump off
a bridge with it because honestly this
is like frustrating
alright guys so this is what I have done
for today I would say I'm at least 50%
done with a build
so I've done a lot of progress today I
just wish that the rater fit on the top
I would have pretty much been done with
the first half and then the next step
would be
well I start to do the reservoir of
course and then figure out how I'm gonna
be looping this as you guys can see the
colors are actually going together much
better much better than before then the
previous yellow yellow so I'm very
excited about that
can I just can't wait to see how this
whole thing goes together especially
with the coolant and the LED lights so I
think it's gonna look really sick guys
let me know if you guys enjoy the build
logs so far if you guys are enjoying
this color scheme let me know if you
guys have any feedback down below in the
comment section as always if you guys
enjoy my build logs be sure to leave a
like to show your support and I'll see
you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
