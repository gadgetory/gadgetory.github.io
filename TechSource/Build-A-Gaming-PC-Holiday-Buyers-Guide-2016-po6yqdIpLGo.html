days ago and I asked you guys to vote on
what budget build I should focus on for
my holiday gift buying guide and the top
two were a $500 and a $100 gaming PC now
the point of this video is to build the
best possible PC for those two price
points while using parts that are
discounted because of the holidays and
after hours and hours of research I
think I finally done it now I'm sure a
lot of you guys know that PC parts are
rarely on sale and if they aren't sale
the discount is not that much because of
the high demand for them but I was able
to turn a $1,120 gaming PC to a thousand
and three dollars saving you guys about
a hundred and twenty bucks so with that
said let's take a look at the parts now
please keep in mind that these are the
prices at the time of making this video
and most of these will expire by
Saturday November 28th also most of
these parts have a mail-in rebate which
is the price I'm going with all right so
the $1000 build features a 6700 K quad
core processor and MSI z 178 pearl
motherboard and a CM 212 Evo cooler so
that you guys can overclock the CPU and
get the most performance out of it we're
also throwing in two four gigabyte
sticks of RAM rated at 2400 megahertz
and an msi gtx 1070 which is going for
only $380 that's an absolute steal for a
1070 for storage we have both a 1
terabyte hard drive from Western Digital
and also a 120 gigabyte SSD from a data
which is perfect for storing the
operating system and also important
programs that require a fastboot up
powering all these parts is the 500 watt
power supply from EVGA and housing all
of these parts is the amazing NZXT s340
case in black and red of course once
again a total cost of this build is one
thousand one hundred twenty dollars
before some of the mail-in rebates but
afterwards it comes down to one thousand
and three dollars now let's take a look
at the five hundred dollar build now
because of the total price obviously the
discount wasn't that big I was only able
to bring down the cost by twenty nine
dollars off the total so from $521 down
to 492 regardless this is a beast PC for
this price point so I got you guys in i3
6100 we also going with the gigabyte h
110 and the motherboard that features
onboard USB 3.0 we're also going with
once
eighty acres of RAM at 2400 megahertz
and also a ZOTAC GTX 1063 gigabyte
variant which is currently on sale for
storage we are sticking with one
terabyte of hard drive from Western
Digital like before and powering
everything as the EVGA 430 watt power
supply as usual I did have a few extra
dollars left so I decided to go with a
very good looking case so I came across
the coarser carbide series 88 R which
also happened to be on sell it has a
clear side panel USB 3.0 ports in the
front and it's also a micro ATX tower
which means that it won't take up much
space on your desk as always you guys
can find all the parts linked down below
I just find the cheapest price for each
part so make sure you guys are using the
link down below if you guys enjoyed the
series and want to see another one for
cyber monday make sure to leave a like
and also let me know in the comment
section which what's two budgets I
should focus on for cyber monday
I already did 500 dollars and I already
did a thousand so make sure you guys
choose two different budget builds it
can be anywhere from 350 bucks to even
2,000 or 3,000 but anyways thank you
guys so much for watching as always I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
