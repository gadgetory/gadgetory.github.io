wearables more specifically smartwatches
now what Samsung releasing its gear to
they've solved a lot of shortcomings
from the gear one but sadly they
released this year's model still locked
into the galaxy line of devices
fortunately we have figured out a way to
get all the gears working on pretty much
any Android device so in this video we
are going to show you guys how you can
get it to work with your Android devices
so the first thing you're going to want
to do is download the file that is
linked in the description down below
this is a ported version of the gear
manager app of a Samsung device once
downloaded you're going to want to
transfer it to your smartphone
I put the file into the download folder
but you can put it anywhere you like
once transferred go back to your phone
then open up a file explorer i'm using
the ES file explorer in the video which
can be downloaded from the Play Store
for free but you can use any other file
explorer that you find within the Play
Store go on and navigate to the folder
you put the app in in my case it was the
download folder now if you try and
install it it won't let you you have to
go into your settings and enable the
installation of applications from
unknown sources now the ma took us there
but if your phone doesn't just navigate
to the security tab in your settings
menu and enable it through there now we
can install gear manager without a
problem
just follow the installation guide and
you will be set but don't get too
excited as there is still a couple of
things left to be installed
but first let's pair the gear with our
new gear enabled smartphone one thing to
note here is if you were using your gear
previously with another device it will
reset itself deleting all data once it's
done wiping itself which should take
around five minutes you will be ready to
pair your smartphone with the gear when
booted up we can start following the
installation guide on our phone just
click on the available gear device and
before it can pair you will need to
install a few more things that allow for
compatibility the cool thing is you
don't have to look for these they
automatically present themselves and all
you have to do is follow the
installation guide
and you are done once completed your
phone and gear will start to connect to
one another as you can see here you can
indeed control the gear from a non
Samsung device here we are changing the
wallpapers and clock design on the gear
from our m8 one thing to know is that
notifications are not supported yet we
will try and find the fix and when we do
expect to see another video on that all
other functionality is present though
like taking pictures and having them
automatically transfer and even taking
phone calls on the gear from your phone
the SmartWatch offerings from Samsung
are probably the best out there right
now and it sucked that they were
exclusive to Samsung devices only well
I'm glad that we have found a fix to
this and now you can use your gear
SmartWatch with a smartphone of your
choice if you run into any problems or
have any questions feel free to leave
them in the comment section down below
as we always read our comments also
don't forget to leave a like if this
helped you out this is that from Texas
and I will see you next time
