finally arrived and here is my review so
this is Apple's latest professional
laptop featuring a lighter and thinner
design new connectors and a brand new
touch bar taking a closer look at the
specs this MacBook Pro is the baseline
15-inch model starting at $23.99 in the
US it has a Retina display with a
resolution of 28 80 by 1800 giving it a
ppi of 220 it also has a 2.6 gigahertz
quad-core processor 256 gigabyte SSD 16
gigs of ddr3 RAM and an Intel HD
graphics 530 as well as a dedicated AMD
Radeon Pro 450 GPU starting off with a
design the new MacBook Pro is smaller
and thinner than last year's model while
keeping the same screen size and a
slightly longer battery life the laptop
is point 61 inches thick 13 point 75
inches wide and 9 point 48 inches deep
it weighs just over 4 pounds down from
the previous models weight of four and a
half pounds so not much has changed in
terms of weight it's very easy to carry
which is a must for a laptop the macbook
pro comes in two colors we have silver
and Space Gray Space Gray looks great
it's a nice change from the usual silver
color the design in general is very
clean and minimal as expected from Apple
so something you definitely wouldn't
want to get damaged
luckily the brand skins can protect your
device while also giving it a custom
look and I'll be dropping links down
below in case you guys want to pick one
up for yourselves the left and right
sides of the macbook pro house two
Thunderbolt 3 ports that use the USB
type-c connector Apple has removed all
other connections such as the HDMI port
SD card slot and the one exclusive Mac
safe connector while Thunderbolt 3 is
great and can provide a large bandwidth
Apple's decision will leave most
customers needing to buy dongles and
adapters they don't come cheap either
ranging from 9 to $49 but surprisingly
Apple kept the headphone jack around at
this time the speakers have also been
upgraded to provide much more volume as
well as the base up to two and a half
times louder
here is a quick sound test
Apple has also made changes to the two
most important parts of any laptop the
keyboard and trackpad the keyboard is
now similar to the one on the 12-inch
MacBook made up of larger keys with the
new butterfly mechanism it provides less
travel but typing experience feels
better and more accurate than on older
models of the MacBook Pro the force
touch trackpad has also undergone a
change in size and it's now twice as
large as it was on the previous
generation of the macbook pro but the
headlining feature of the new macbook
pro is the touch bar which sits right
above the keyboard so the search bar
replaces the top-level row of function
keys on a keyboard and instead it's a
touchscreen with a resolution of 21 70
by 60 it can provide the usual controls
such as brightness volume and even has a
dedicated Siri button but depending on
the app you use the touch bar will show
controls for that specific program in
Final Cut Pro for example the touch bar
will display a projects timeline for
easy scrubbing as well as tools such as
trimming this is also Apple's first
computer to support touch ID which
allows for a quick and secure way to log
into your laptop while the main display
is the same size and resolution Apple
didn't leave it unchanged it now
supports the wide color gamut being able
to display a broader range of colors
than the usual laptop display it's also
very bright at a maximum brightness of
500 nits which is the brightest screen
out of any Apple's other laptops
viewing angles are great as always and
the bezels are slightly thinner as well
performance on a new macbook pro is
great when combining the quad-core
processor 16 gigs of ram and ultra fast
SSD the computer can handle most tasks
you throw at it
editing 4k for example is smooth and a
laptop can handle multiple tasks
simultaneously without an issue this can
also be attributed to Mac OS which helps
keep the experience running without any
hiccups the 15-inch MacBook Pro with
touch bar ships with Mac OS Sierra now
this is the new version of Apple's
operating system which brings
optimizations to the performance and
battery life as well as new features
such as Siri
that are very helpful Apple pay support
has also been added and the OS can now
also help you free up disk space with
the new improvements that Apple has made
it will definitely be a factor to how
fluid the laptop is when performing
various tasks apple says the laptop can
get up to ten hours of battery life
which is close to my testing I was able
to average around eight hours while
browsing the web checking some emails
and even writing some documents this
will definitely change depending on what
you are using the computer for but the
battery life will still hold up fairly
well even when using more intensive apps
Apple's new MacBook Pro makes for a
compelling laptop but it depends on what
your gonna use the laptop for filmmakers
photographers and even producers will
appreciate the extra power that comes
from the laptop but it comes at a cost
starting at $23.99 for the baseline
model these new laptops definitely come
with a premium price for those that
don't require as much power Apple also
sells the 13-inch MacBook Pro with touch
bar but at its starting price of $17.99
but the pretty much wraps up my review
of the 15-inch MacBook Pro with touch
bar as always I'll drop a link to them
down below if you guys want to check it
out for yourselves thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
