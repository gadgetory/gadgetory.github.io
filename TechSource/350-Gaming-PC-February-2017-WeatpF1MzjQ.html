you guys can hear that in the background
ladies and gentlemen if you have around
350 bucks in your pocket then this piece
actually who the hell keeps $250 in
their pocket if you have around $350
somewhere in your life then this gaming
PC might be for you if you want a game
over 60 fps and high settings and most
triple-a titles I'll also be doing a
full step-by-step build guide for this
exact same PC with the Windows
installation and the BIOS flash so you
guys want to pick up the parts and build
one for yourself then you can find all
the links to the parts down below the
CPU we are using is the popular G 45 60
and we are pairing that with the asrock
H 110 and motherboard which is obviously
going to have to be flashed to support
the new 7th gen processors we're going
with a single stick of 8 gigs of ram
from a victor 1 terabyte of hard drive
space from Western Digital as always and
in gigabytes gtx 1050 overclocked
edition GPU since this performs better
than the rx 460 if you don't believe me
check out my top 5 GPUs under $200 which
I'll have link below as well
powering this entire build is the usual
430 watts of juice from EVGA and
everything is packed inside the tiny yet
extremely cheap DIY PC it doesn't have
any space for cable management no it
doesn't look good but then again what
case does in this price range the fact
that it has a front USB 3.0 ports and
it's only going for 21 dollars
it's pretty hard to pass up starting
with temps to get high 30s during idle
and around 75 during full load which
isn't bad considering it's waiting on a
stock heatsink put the fire strike
benchmark it's scored 59 20 already
beating out all of my previous budget
bills under $600 but Ron volt dark cube
and even my most recent budget build
core bike this build cost under $400 and
it's currently the king of the hill and
it's going to be pretty hard to beat
however when we look at render times
it's pretty much tanked my November
build was also running a dual-core
processor the i3 6100 to be exact
however it significantly did better than
the g4 560 and rendering that just goes
to show the processing power of an i3
there was only a point 2 megahertz in
core speed between the two otherwise
needless to say if you do any editing or
graphic work or use any multi-threaded
applications then this PC is not for you
this is strictly a gaming and multimedia
PC alright now here's the part where I'm
going to shut up and let you guys enjoy
the gaming benchmarks and yes these are
my own at the gameplay please stay away
from reddit
so there you have it some really healthy
numbers from the G 4560 you can pretty
much game over 60fps in the most
triple-a titles in high settings however
some games like Battlefield 1 and tomb
raider will require lower settings to
achieve over 60 frames so the guys like
what you see want to build this exact
same PC for yourself
make sure to watch the build guides link
below if it's available and also
consider subscribing text source for
more monthly PC builds like these
sometimes I do budget sometimes I do
some crazy ultimate builds also if you
guys want to watch my next video
available on nice already make sure to
download the app and check it out I
upload them a few days sometimes a week
earlier on the app compared to YouTube
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
