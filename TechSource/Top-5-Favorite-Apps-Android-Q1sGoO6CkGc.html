tech source and in this video I'm gonna
go over my top five favorite apps that I
use daily on my Nexus 6p let's begin so
guys I have a confession to make I'm one
of those guys who would constantly spend
money on in-game purchases while I'm
playing my clash of clans or hearthstone
the games are so addicting that it's
only a matter of time before I start
tossing my money at it
but you know what I discovered Amazon
Appstore a few days ago and they're
amazing
Amazon coin system which I wish I would
have known before it would have saved me
a lot of money and in fact I've been
using the Amazon Appstore instead of my
Google Play Store on my Nexus 6p and
I'll explain why you see if you buy a
game on Google Play Store or purchase
in-game items you are paying the full
price and your money is gone that's it
you get nothing back but if you buy
games or in-game purchases using Amazon
coins you not only get a discount but
you actually get Amazon coins back in
select games so you're actually saving
money every time you spend them let me
elaborate one of my favorite games on my
phone is hearthstone now if I want to
buy a new hero it costs $9.99 if I pay
directly with my money or I can choose
to buy it with 999 Amazon coins which is
equivalent to eight dollars and 80 cents
so I'm already saving a dollar 20 I hope
that makes some sense to you guys but
because of the Amazon coin system I no
longer use the Google Play Store
unfortunately it's only available for
Amazon and I enjoy the vices but I'm
gonna drop a link down below if you guys
want to check it out so I guess I'll
start the list by going over hearthstone
which is one of my favorite games I play
whenever I have free time it's basically
a card game created by Blizzard and
originally this was released for the PC
but now they made a mobile version you
basically go head-to-head battling with
an opponent by summoning cars that you
gradually collect and win throughout
your matches it's extremely addicting to
play and really easy to learn
you can even verse opponents online for
competitive ranked play the second app I
use on a daily basis is the Leo privacy
guard which is your phone's very own
security system that's a bunch of
features my favorite being the app lock
instead of having a lock placed on your
entire
you can choose to lock individual apps
let's say I have some photos that I
don't want anyone to see well I just
simply log on to the app and put on a
lock on my photo so every time the app
is accessed it will prompt for a
passcode break and alert is another cool
one basically if someone gets ahold of
your phone and tries to guess the
passcode on any one of the apps the
phone will take a selfie of the person
after a set amount of attempts which you
can select from you could then view the
photos on the app itself
my third favorite feature is the safe
box let's say you don't want to lock
your entire photo album and only hide
specific photos you basically access the
safe box through the Leo privacy app and
add the photos you want to hide it
stores them into the safe box and
deletes the originals from your phone
and you can do the same thing for video
files as well
the third app I use daily is called go
keyboard and the basically gives you a
bunch of options and customizing your
phone from themes to plugins and even
changing the font of your entire
smartphone my personal favorite is the
cult of Moto font with the default
keyboard theme and I think it adds a
really nice clean look to my phone and
then before we have color notes I
personally hate Evernote and it's not as
user friendly as I would have liked
which is why I switched to the color
note app you can make checklists color
code your notes to easily organize them
and it even has a built-in calendar for
reminders it's simple straight to the
point and I love using it lastly I use
the YouTube app not because I make
youtube videos but because I like the
Amazon version better you can exit the
app and it will still play in the
background which is perfect for
listening to music the only downside is
that you can't maximize the videos in
full-screen but if you're just listening
to music it works great so those are my
top 5 favourite apps that I use
constantly on my Android devices I'm
going to leave a link to the Amazon App
Store down below so you guys can try it
for yourselves
don't overpay for apps or in-game
purchases guys honestly use the Amazon
coins instead and you will save a
boatload of money as they bonus to my
amazing subscribers I made it to the end
of this video I'll be giving out $110
Amazon earth codes and all you have to
do to enter is just follow me on Twitter
and drop me a comment down below I also
want to give a huge thanks to Amazon for
reaching out and letting me know about
this app and also for making this video
possible thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you and then
