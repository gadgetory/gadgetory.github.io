the year for Black Friday and it starts
in a few days if you're looking to pick
up a sick gaming PC or a laptop this
holiday season be sure to check them out
I'll drop a link below what's up guys
it's a from tech source and in this
video we're gonna take a look at the
best Black Friday and Cyber Monday tech
deals that I found on the internet just
for you guys and if you don't wanna sit
through this entire video you guys can
find everything mentioned in the
description section below alternatively
you can check deals or tech because that
is where we post the best deals we find
on the Internet starting off I do want
to mention that LG recently came out
with a refresh of their gram laptops
featuring the new coffee Lake processors
the one I have with me now is the 13.3
inch and it's equipped with an i7
8550 you quad-core processor it's also
got 8 gigs of RAM and a 256 gigabyte SSD
everything is exactly the same coming
from the previous models except the new
processor one of the things I love about
the Graham series as the battery life
and how light these are weighing under
one kilogram and somehow they even
packed a 60 watt hour battery in here
giving you up to 14 hours of usage now
since they came out with their new
lineup LG is actually having a sale on
their previous models for Black Friday
if you guys want to check them out or
take a look at the new 8th gen laptops
I'll drop a link to it down below next
up we have a really great deal on the
popular treks Titanium's
from aftershocks these are open air
headphones that use bone conduction
technology now it's not one of those
cheap bone conduction headphones that
you see everywhere on YouTube these guys
actually know what they are doing and
then one of the biggest companies out
there that actually do it right one of
the benefits of using bone conduction
technology is that you are always self
aware your ears are not covered and you
can hear everything around you while
listening to music at the same time it's
also very comfortable and won't cause
any ear fittings and snapping is going
inside of your ear right now they're
going for $80 which is $50 off their
original price check it out by visiting
the link below Samsung is selling a 4k
50-inch TV only for $400 with free
shipping you can save $20 off the ps4
controller and check this one out guys
$200 on the Xbox one
battlefield one bundle not bad at all
this next deal is gonna blow your mind
are you guys ready for this a 27 inch
144 hertz refresh rate one millisecond
response time monitor only for $200 if
you guys search up any monitors with
these specs they start at $300 minimum
so if you guys are in need of a fast
gaming monitor snag this while it's
cheap here's another great deal on a
1080p monitor from Asus it's a 23 inch
widescreen monitor with an IPS display
and a 60 Hertz refresh rate it's going
for $80 using the code listed on the
page and after the $10 mail-in rebate if
you're looking for something with a
higher resolution we got the LG 27 inch
4k monitor that's going for 247 which is
ridiculous it also features free sync
and a 5 millisecond response time with a
60 Hertz for fresh weight if you guys
are rocking a high-end amv card like the
vega 56 or 64 then you can take
advantage of free sync I actually have
two of these and it's also the monitor
I've been using to benchmark my PC built
on the channel and I know a lot of you
guys keep asking me in the comment
section what model that is well this is
the one I've been using but only
difference is I paid $300 for mine the
extremely popular PG 3 for 8 Q from Asus
that we always see in setup wars is
going for $970 on wiki by it's currently
going for 1135 on Amazon which is still
discounted but if you guys buy it on
wiki by you can save two hundred sixty
three dollars this is arguably one of
the best ultra wide gaming monitors out
on the market right now let's switch
over to some PC parts now so the 1800 x8
core processor is on sale for 320 which
is at its lowest price ever
normally this would go anywhere from 400
to $440 so you're saving at the minimum
$80 for Black Friday alternatively the
1700 processor is going for 270 which is
down from the retail price of 330 the
six core Rison 5 1600 is $30 off from
retail and finally the 1950 X thread
Ripper CPU is off $200 from the original
$1000 MSRP looking at Intel prices it's
no surprise that discounts aren't that
great but we still have some nice deals
nonetheless like the 77 Andrew K it's
currently going for 289
which is $50 off the original price of
340 the 7600 K keeps switching from 230
down to 200 the past few weeks is kind
of fluctuating but it is down again to
$200 just for Black Friday the
six-course 7800 ex also has a nice
discount it's down to 310 dollars from
360 so you're saving around 50 bucks
there there's a ton of GPU deals out
there and I can't go over all of them
because it'll be very long video so I'll
link some my favorite ones out there and
I'll link the rest below if you guys
want to check it out but here are some
deals you can expect the GTX 1080 from
Asus is currently the cheapest 1080 on
planet earth right now it's coming in at
$500 after a male and rebate these cars
usually go for 550 or higher GTX 1080p I
usually sell in the high 700 but for
Black Friday you can pick one up for 740
either from gigabyte EVGA and you can
even get one for 735 from msi you even
get a free copy of destiny 2 so that's
pretty awesome the best-performing gtx
1060 for its price is from ZOTAC and
it's going for only $240 compared to 260
from the other brands like EVGA this is
actually the card I'm using for both of
my budget builds in December and this
little thing packs a lot of power and I
highly recommend it if you guys want to
game 1080p and high or max settings over
60fps ZOTAC is killing it for Black
Friday they have another deal on their
gtx 1050 TI and it's going for only 124
dollars compared to other prices that
start at 150 we also got a killer deal
from msi on their gtx 1070 you can
actually get it for just $400 after a
male and rebate right now 1070 start at
$430 and go all the way up to 500 so
this is a really great deal here's a
great deal on the rx 580 from msi only
$230 guys that's the same price of an rx
570 and by the way you get a free copy
of quake champions
speaking of rx 570 is the lowest price
right now is from Asus and it's going
for 190 after a male and rebate so check
this deal on the RX Vega 56 from msi
$470 guys these cards start at 5
hundred dollars minimum if you're lucky
enough to even find them in stock if the
one from MSI is sold out which I'm
almost positive it will be by the time
you watch this video there's another one
from XFX that's going for five hundred
and this is just some of the amazing
tech deals that we found on an Internet
unfortunately it's impossible to upload
every single deal we found this video
will be like an hour long but
fortunately we do have a place that we
do store all these amazing deals and
that is our website deal source tech we
have like five people constantly
updating meals throughout the day to
