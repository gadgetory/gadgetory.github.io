iPhone 10 on a wireless Qi charger and a
wired connection well that's kinda what
this quick video was about I'm gonna be
charging two brand new iPhone tens from
zero to a hundred percent and see how
long it's gonna take using both methods
the wireless she charger I'm using is
from ravpower and this is claimed to
have fast wireless charging for the
iPhone 10 and both the iPhone 8 models
however the current iOS does not have
fast wireless charging enabled just yet
but once Apple releases it in a later
update you can take advantage of the
fast wireless charging feature so rath
power Qi charger has a maximum output of
7.5 watts which is actually 50% faster
than traditional 3.5 watt qi chargers
and just for comparison reasons the
stock Apple power brick actually has an
output of 5 watts the charger itself is
very sleek with anti rubber coating that
won't scratch the back of your new
iPhone and it also prevents phones from
slipping off furthermore you can always
protect your phone with some skins I
currently have the black carbon fiber
wrapped behind my iPhone 7 plus while I
wait for the new iPhone 10 skins to
arrive it's a minimalistic approach to
not only protecting your phone from
getting scratches but also adding some
grip in the process I'll drop a link to
some D brand skins down below and the Qi
charger if you guys want to check it out
so as I said before these are both fresh
iPhone tens that I just unboxed and I
purposely drained the batteries so that
they shut off completely I'm gonna plug
one of the phones into the wall using
the Apple power brick and lightning
cable and I'm gonna be placing the other
one on the ravpower Qi wireless charger
and start the timer both phones have the
exact same settings out of the box they
are connected to the same network and
they don't have any extra apps installed
or have anything running in the
background we can see at the 30 minute
mark that the iPhone 10 that's plugged
directly in the wall is already a twenty
two percent while the wireless charging
iPhone is at 17 percent fast-forwarding
to the one hour mark we can see that the
number is pretty much doubled the wired
is at 42 percent and the wireless is at
30 percent and finally a full charge on
the iPhone 10 using the stock Apple
lightning cable and power brick will
take you two hours and 58 minutes
starting from zero percent while the
wireless charging phone is still at 79
percent almost after three hours later
it would take you around four hours and
20 minutes to fully charge your iPhone
10 wirelessly without the fast wireless
charging option keep in mind guys the
new Apple fast wireless charging feature
is not yet available on the brand new
iPhones that's actually coming in a
later update so make sure you guys are
subscribed because I'm gonna be doing
this entire test with the new update the
pretty much wraps up this video if this
was somewhat helpful to you guys
dropping a like would be awesome but if
you guys didn't like it feel free to
dislike as well that's cool too it'll
take me an entire day to shoot this
video believe it or not and this is a
type of videos that you guys love
watching make sure to let me know in the
comments section because I think I'm
gonna start doing more of these as time
moves on
but anyway see you guys so much for
watching I'll drop a link to the D brand
skin I use as well as the Qi charger
below if you guys want to check it out
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
