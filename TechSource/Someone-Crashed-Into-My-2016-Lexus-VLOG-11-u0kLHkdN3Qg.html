someone manages to rear-end my car
that's pretty much the damage honestly
felt like a little bump it was in the
event that we give an accident like it's
only a few scratches but for the most
part the bumper is intact really
surprised at how well this car took the
beating so yeah basically on my way to
the body shop
their insurance company authorized the
repairs so I'm gonna get Alexa fixed
I guess the owner is a big fan of grand
theft auto alright so that's pretty
quick they took a lot of pictures and I
guess they're gonna put together an
estimate and then email me a date when I
can bring my car for repairs which
should be in about a week or two I sold
my car to be fixed to be honest I'm just
so over this right now like this did not
need to happen but happens you know
actually felt really bad for the girl
that went into my car she was crying her
daughter was in the backseat and I felt
really bad like it was a mom's car she
only had liability like whatever it
means and it's crazy our car almost got
total like her front bumper and hood was
like completely demolished and my rear
bumper only had like a small scratch and
scuffs and stuff so that's crazy these
cars are built like tanks so my mom got
a new car too it seems was this 2016
Camry SE it looks like what can I say
we're a Toyota Lexus fanboys haha not a
bad looking card oh that's a nice photo
car definitely so when my packages got
sent to my mom's house by accident so
I'm here to retrieve it maybe even say
hi to snowy a little bit I haven't seen
him in like a month let's see if he
still recognizes me
there is is a little you recognize me
snowing flex sit
oh he always peace live every time he
sees me he gets excited piddles they're
getting ready to move so as you can see
lots of stuff are packed up and they're
moving to Palmdale I'm on by the house
there it's no wait come here
CID me oh my god relax
Thanks sit sit sit right so excited hmm
no I did you miss me hmm did you miss me
what
of course you missed me hmm look what
you did look what you did what is that
come here you look what he did say
goodbye bye
I swear that dog is out of control
hey guys so it's the 23rd of December
and I'm back here at the headquarters as
you can see I did get an email from the
body shop they said it's going to cost
about 1500 bucks to replace the bumper
and have to take it back in January
middle of January because they're booked
for the holidays so after wait like
three weeks to get my car repaired so oh
well not complaining so anyways I'm here
right now and I'm working on another
project I'm going to be doing the ask me
video today I also just finished the PC
build for the giveaway one lucky
bastards gonna take this home or I
should say I'm going to be mailing this
to someone's home all the parts and
details are on the top right you guys
can check out that video but I didn't
ounce this in my giveaway we have it r9
390x and FX 8320 cpu X 61 cooler from
NZXT oh yeah video has been done now I'm
going to go ahead and as you can see I
already set up my area here so I can do
the ask me video and then edit two
videos in one day so yeah it should be
fun so a lot of you guys have been
asking me how I fixed my GPU sag for the
neox
PC build as you can see it's not sagging
anymore well I want to show you guys
real quick so this is this only works
for the MSI GPUs because of the
backplate but I'm sure you guys can find
a way for it to work for your GPU so
what you'll need is one of these
brackets and as you can see back there
because it's black it blends in with the
PC you can't really see it from a
distance but I hooked it up in the back
and the top portion of it let me show
you in the back actually so here's what
it looks like in the back hopefully you
guys can see that one piece is stuck
between the backplate and the GPU and
the bottom part is basically just
sitting upright in a vertical position
holding up the GPU to give you a better
idea I'm going to show you guys from the
front and the same concept applies to
the back so here's the PC bracket I used
so this flat part of the PC bracket goes
between the actual GPU itself and the
plate so so this goes in like that in
between and then the bottom portion
holds it up basically so you have to
raise the GPO up a little bit as you get
this straight without it's tilting like
that so yeah I basically did that over
there at the corner in the back and way
against the motherboard so it looks so
blends in nicely as you can see so yeah
I hope that answers your question I'm
pretty sure if you have any type of
backplate really you can make this
happen but you're just gonna have to
Mickey Mouse it on other GPUs if not you
guys are just gonna have to find a
different way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
