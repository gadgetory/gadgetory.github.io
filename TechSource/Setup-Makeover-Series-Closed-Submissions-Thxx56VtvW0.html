announce my new series on the channel
it's called setup makeover it's like the
pimp my ride equivalent of set up boards
so the idea behind the series is to
completely reduce someone's setup give
them a brand new desk a brand new PC
monitor keyboard the whole 50 yards in
order to do this I'll have to come to
your house whether you live in the US or
across the country the truth is guys I
love helping people improve their setups
I do it every single Monday on setup
Wars I get tons of tweets and comments
every single day telling me that my
videos have changed you guys whether
it's to motivate you to improve your
cable management or motivate you to
clean up your setup or completely redo
your setup you know I love you those
comments and honestly I have so much fun
doing it it's really awesome but it is
time to take it to the next level guys
and I've teamed up with Coolermaster to
make this happen and depending on how
well the season goes depending on if you
guys really enjoy it
they'll determine on how often I do this
on the channel so the instructions to
enter are very simple I'll drop a link
to the landing page down below I'm also
going to go over the questions to help
clarify some things but basically guys
are looking for our people who deserve a
new setup people who need a set up
makeover if you have ultra wide monitors
if you have high-end gaming gear a super
decked out PC please do not apply this
is not for you guys this is for the
people out there who are less fortunate
than us
so what you click on the link it will
take you to the landing page for the
setup of make over the first part it's
pretty self-explanatory you put in your
full name and address so that we can
figure out where you live because
location is also very important for the
series tell us more about the people you
live with do you have a family some
roommates staying with a bunch of
friends or what make sure you guys are
specific tell us about your current
living conditions
do you own a home are you currently
going to school and are staying at a
dorm how big is your place do you live
in an apartment how many bedrooms do you
share your bedroom with a sibling stuff
like that then you need to tell us how
your PC and setup has developed to where
it is today and there's a sample written
in the box to help you guys out tell us
what inspired you
to apply for a makeover from Texas and
coolermaster so the next box is where
you will need to tell us why you deserve
a makeover I think that this is the most
important box of the mall because we
need to hear the real reason why you
need a set up makeover I'll be honest
with you guys if you write something in
like well I want a game in 4k resolution
because 1080p just isn't good enough for
me
we're probably not going to accept that
summation because really looking for
people that are really deserving and
people's lives that will most likely be
changed or impacted with a brand new
setup for example someone wants to get
into music production or editing videos
it just doesn't have a powerful PC stuff
like that that's a there has to be a
meaning behind the set up makeover not
just because I want to play in higher
frames that's that's just not good
enough I'm sorry so once you're done
filling out all the boxes you will need
to upload a video of yourself giving me
a house tour a 60 second tour of your
house and the setup room with you
talking in it so you must be able to see
your face for at least one part of the
video I know it sounds weird but this is
going to help us reject all the fake
submissions out there the second video
you will need to upload is basically you
sitting in front of the camera and
answering the last three questions but
in a video format so you got your
written response in those boxes you guys
can basically see that exact same thing
in the video and the reason why we're
doing this because we get to see you in
person talking about your setup it just
feels more real instead of reading a
bunch of text you also need to send over
five high quality pictures of your setup
and your room so the first picture
should be a shot of your entire room
please get as much in the picture as
possible you can even do a panorama as
long as it comes out perfect the second
picture can be a different angle of your
room what they're set up in the
background and the final three pictures
should be of your setup in different
angles include at least one horizontal
image of your entire setup please also
do not send in any vertical pictures we
will reject the submissions make sure
you guys are shooting all this in
landscape mode the last box isn't that
important but if you guys know the
measurements of your room that would be
really helpful and determining if you
qualify or not obviously if your
up in the size of my closet then it's
not going to work also a quick reminder
you can upload your video on YouTube or
Google Drive and copy paste the link in
those boxes obviously YouTube would be a
lot easier so that's what I recommend
but the choice is yours I know this is
asking a lot from you guys but that's
the only way I'll do something this big
I'll be investing so much money into
this I'll be buying the setups for my
own money
coolermaster will be sponsoring the PC
section but everything else from the
traveling to the set up gear monitors
desk everything will be paid by me in my
own pocket so that's why I got to make
sure that the contestants for setup
makeover are worthy enough and they're
also will and not fake I feel like the
application is a perfect way to
eliminate the lazy people and the people
I just don't care enough to participate
in the setup makeover I want to help
people out there who are in need that's
one of the main reasons I started a show
giveaways are nice helping people on
their setups by giving them tips on the
show is nice but I want to really help
people build a brand new set up that's
going to change their lives
that is the reason that is the purpose
of a set up makeover but anyway that's
it for the video if you guys enjoy the
series idea make sure to leave your
feedback down below like I said guys it
depends on how well the first season
goes and then I can do more of those or
I can just stop it all together but that
will depend on you guys so the final
dates for submissions is August 25th so
make sure you guys send that in before
that that gives you about 15 days give
or take to submit I wish you guys the
best of luck wherever enters huge things
to Coolermaster for jumping on board and
partnering with me to make this happen I
love you guys again best of luck thank
you so much for your support I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
