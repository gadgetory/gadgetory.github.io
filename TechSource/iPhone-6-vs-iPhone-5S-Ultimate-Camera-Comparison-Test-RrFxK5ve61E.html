coverage is cell cashier com they
compared iPhone prices on the internet
and give you a quick coat and the most
cash for your iPhone so go ahead and
check them out it's simple fast and
secure hey guys ed here from Texas and
today we're gonna do a camera comparison
between the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 5s
so Before we jump into samples let's
take a quick look at their camera specs
so the iPhone 6 has an 8 megapixel rear
facing camera with an aperture of 2.2
the maximum resolution it can shoot in
is 1080p and some notable camera
features include cinematic video
stabilization 60fps while recording in
1080p exposure control and slow-motion
video at 240fps the 5s on the other end
also has an 8 megapixel camera with the
same aperture of 2.2 and like the 6 that
also can shoot in 1080p video and some
notable features on the 5s include
digital image stabilization touch focus
and slow motion at 120fps lastly both
phones have a 1.2 megapixel front-facing
camera and with that being said let's
sit back relax and take a look at some
samples I hope you guys enjoy the video
what is it you guys it at from Texas and
this is a video test between these two
phones there will be an audio icon
either on the top right or top left of
the screen notifying you which phone's
audio is also all phones are strapped to
one device so they are equally balanced
if the phones have 4k capabilities then
it is enabled for the test after all
that is a video comparison and the point
of this video is to show what each phone
is capable of
which means putting them on its highest
settings
so unfortunately like the iPhone 5s the
iPhone 6 also does not have autofocus
during video recording as you can
clearly see here I'm not sure what's
taking apples so long to implement this
very useful feature in their phones but
it's getting really annoying to have to
focus every time by tapping on the
screen which is what I'm doing here the
speed at which it manually focuses is
also kind of slow compared to other
phones I'm trying to focus as fast as
possible here between the two figures
and you can clearly tell that it's
taking a few seconds I honestly expect
that Apple's who have improved this by
now here is the 5s and as you can see it
has the same exact problem no autofocus
during video recording which means that
I have to tap on the screen yet again to
focus which is what I'm doing now the
focus speeds are also lacking like the 6
so really nothing approved here from the
5s to the 6 as far as focusing is
concerned
anyways that concludes the camera test
between the iPhone 6 and the 5s honestly
I expected a huge improvement between
the two overall both of the phones did a
great job during the day shots and
really well with the flash shots at
night these two phones really are that
close and quality and I think that Apple
is saving their camera upgrade for the
6s which is a smart thing to do if you
ask me there always has to be some sort
of an upgrade that people are willing to
switch for and I think that Apple is
holding off their new camera for next
year anyways what do you guys think
about the sample pics and videos do you
guys agree with me or not which phone do
you think they'd better let me know in
the comment section down below I'm
actually interested in reading your
comments anyways this is that from tech
source and I'll catch you in the next
video so before I go I wanted to share
an awesome website with you guys cell

the United States they do accept
