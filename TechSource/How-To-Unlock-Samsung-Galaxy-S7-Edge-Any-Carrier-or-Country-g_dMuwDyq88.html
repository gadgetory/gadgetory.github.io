I'm here to show you the process of
unlocking your Samsung Galaxy s7 edge so
you can use it with any GSM carrier in
the world for this demonstration I'll be
using my locked s7 edge and unlock it so
I can use it on my t-mobile network but
it's the exact same process for any
carrier from any country so first off we
need to get the unlock code to start the
unlocking process the place where I get
all my lock codes is the unlocking
company comm because they have the
cheapest prices online and I get my
codes much faster than other websites so
head on over to the locking company comm
and select your phone manufacturer and
the phone model from the drop-down list
on the next page go in and select the
country the phone was originally
purchased from and the carrier of the
phone in my case I purchased that in the
United States and the original carrier
is AT&amp;amp;T before we continue we need the
IMEI number of the s7 edge and the way
you look that up on your phone is to
open up the dial pad and enter in star
pound zero six pound once the phone
displays a number you have to go back on
the website and enter that in once
everything is filled out select get a
locking code and that will take you to
the final screen where you have to check
out after checking out there will email
you the unlock code the price and
delivery time of your code varies by
phone but don't worry because as I said
before you are getting the cheapest
prices online with the fastest delivery
times once the email you the unlock code
it's time to unlock your phone so go
ahead and pop open the SIM tray which
should be located on the top and insert
the SIM card you want to use with the
phone so I want to use the s7 edge on my
t-mobile network so I'm putting in my
t-mobile SIM card if a SIM card doesn't
fit then you have to adjust the size in
order for it to work and there is a link
below to show you how that's done
what's a SIM card is inside the phone it
should take you to the similac page and
this is where you enter the unlock code
that you received from the locking
company after inputting in the code and
hitting a lock you will get a message
stating that the unlock was successful
and the phone will take you straight to
the home screen and your phone becomes
permanently unlocked please note that
some newer devices lock to u.s. carriers
are now remotely unlocked so if it
doesn't prompt for a code don't worry
the locking company can still unlock it
no problem so that's how you unlock your
Samsung Galaxy s7 edge for any GSM
carrier in the world if this video
helped you guys out feel feel you like
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
