today we are reviewing the iPhone 7 and
7 plus both of these phones are similar
with some differences the iPhone 7 has a
1334 by 750 resolution 4.7 inch display
while the iPhone 7 plus has a 1080p 5.5
inch screen the iPhone 7 has 2 gigs of
ram whereas the iPhone 7 plus has 3 gigs
the 7 has a nineteen sixty million hour
battery and the seven plus packs a
twenty nine hundred million power
battery and faster 810 fusion chip is
the same on each phone both phones do
have a fun facing HD camera capable of
taking 7 megapixel photos and recording
1080p video they also pack a 12
megapixel rear camera with optical image
stabilization that can shoot 4k video
exclusive to the Plus model as a second
rear camera a 12 megapixel telephoto
lens that allows up to 2 X optical zoom
Apple has officially ditched the space
grey option replacing it with black and
jet black finishes which seem to have
been the most popular options based on
initial reception Apple's new flagships
feature the same glass and aluminum
design seen on the previous models with
the only notable differences being seen
in the planet antenna bands lack of
headphone jack and a wider front speaker
grille the device is still very slippery
to the hand especially with the matte
black option that I have here in the
video but you can fix this problem with
a V brand skin and I'll drop a link to
it down below if you guys want to check
that out this year Apple has also
redesigned the home button to be
pressure sensitive which serves as
taptic feedback as opposed to a physical
button it will take some getting used to
but I've started to enjoy it after a few
weeks of using the phone the big change
here however is the removal of the
headphone jack so you're pretty much
left with using the supplied lightning
to 3.5 millimeter adapter or wireless
audio options the iPhone 7 and 7 plus
are now ip67 waterproofing rated which
has been a long time coming as long as
the submersion is no deeper than 1 meter
and stays below 30 minutes you shouldn't
have to worry when it comes to the
displays the resolution and size has
remained unchanged at 1334 by 750 for
the 4.7 inch model and in 1920 by 1080
for
5.5 inch option viewing angles are
tremendous as always slight but
welcoming improvements have been made
with the wider color gamut and overall
brightness of the display being
increased by 25% the color
representation is quite accurate but if
you're looking for something with an
absolute amount of pop you might want to
look elsewhere to a phone that uses an
AMOLED display instead with the
increases to battery capacity Apple is
obviously touting the iPhone 7 and 7
plus as having the best battery life
compared to previous iterations in my
testing I was able to only squeeze an
extra hour out of the battery with light
to medium usage this should be able to
get you through the day even more if
you're using the plus model Apple
doesn't offer any form of quick charging
or wireless charging on either model
both of which are now staples of a
flagship smartphone Apple has finally
integrated stereo speakers into the
iPhone 7 one speaker is the same bottom
firing piece as we all know while the
other is integrated in the top earpiece
in fact here's a quick audio test
the iPhone has always been known to have
a great camera and this year is no
different
both models feature a 12 megapixel unit
with a wider F 1.8 aperture Apple has
fitted the iPhone 7 plus with a dual
camera module a company first that seems
to have gathered a lot of interest early
on the wide-angle lens is the same as on
the iPhone 7 utilizing a focal length of
28 millimeters the second camera is a
telephoto lens with a smaller aperture
of f28 providing more reach at a 56
millimeter focal length each phone can
also shoot 4k video at up to 30 fps and
also optical image stabilization has
finally trickled its way down to the
smaller model as well focusing has also
been improved but it's still not the
fastest the front camera is now at 7
megapixels and can capture 1080p video
the field of view is still relatively
narrow compared to the galaxy s7 so
group selfies will require a bit more
work let's go and take a closer look at
some samples photos and videos are as
you would expect from an iPhone bright
colourful and sharp dynamic range has
also been increased preserving some more
details in the highlights when shooting
in low-light scenarios the iPhone 7
preserves detail a bit sharper
particularly in the shadows and by the
way you guys can see a full camera
comparison linked below the iPhone 7 and
7 plus come pre-installed with iOS 10
and when compared with the new a10
fusion chip these phones are very snappy
as expected iowa stan has brought
forward notable changes in the messaging
app and the notification center along
with refinements in the overall
experience and user interface when
utilizing the phone at first I wasn't
really a fan of the touch to unlock
feature but after using it for a few
days I kind of got used to it the iPhone
7 and 7 plus is certainly a well rounded
device however with the lack of major
design changes and must-have upgrades
for the most part it may be hard for
many iPhone 6 and 6s owners to justify
purchasing the new phone especially when
you compare to the competitive market of
budget and flagship smartphone offerings
that being said if you're an avid
photographer and can take advantage of
the dual camera on the plus or can
appreciate the water-resistant
teachers now might be the time to pick
up Apple's newest flagship as always if
you guys enjoy the reviews on tech soars
leaving a like will let me know to
continue thank you so much for watching
and I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
