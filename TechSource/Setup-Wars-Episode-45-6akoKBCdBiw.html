reached 20,000 likes I will do whatever
the top comment there is me to do so
after only two hours the video reached
10,000 likes and I think right now it's
over 20,000 so I am a man of my word I
will do whatever the top comment dares
me to do so let's go ahead and check it
out all right so the top comment is from
Holden McDonald which is weird because
the comment below that has way more
likes but that's what I see on my screen
so that is what I will do
to be fair you never said which setup I
should undo my cable management so I
picked one of my many setups and undid
that and actually don't plan on ever
fixing that up so it worked out but
since you guys really suck and I mean
suck at giving dares I'm gonna have to
make my own there so this video reaches
30,000 likes which I know will never
happen I will do an entire episode of
setup Wars dressed up as kylo Ren and
I'll even tuck as kylo Ren what's up
guys is that from tech source and
welcome to setup wars episode 45 where
you submit your desk set up to get
featured on the channel you guys want to
submit your setup make sure to watch the
video linked below so without wasting
any more time let the setup Bors begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always everyone's gear for their setups
will be linked below along with anything
I recommend in this episode so here are
your 5 lucky contestants we have Archie
Austin Scott and week' and Jimmy
congratulations for making it on the
show starting off the episode is Archie
and his interesting dual monitor setup
so if you recognize his PC it's because
he was featured on PC was episode 5
which he ended up winning at a super
sexy water-cooled build inside the NZXT
h 440 case we have a 40 60 70 k
overclocked 24.4 and - r9 290 X's and
crossfire definitely a beautiful build
but back to the setup we have an Acer 34
inch ultra wide as the main monitor and
a 27 inch asus monitor off to the left
side on the desk we have the ducky shine
three keyboard Logitech G 700 s Mouse at
an extra-large mouse pad from ducky as
well we do have a pair of hyper X's just
lying around near the PC and some pro
media 2.1 speakers on the sides cable
management can definitely be improved by
using some velcro straps near the top to
neatly tie all the wires together and a
cable box for under your desk to hide
that perished up from sight obviously a
hateful anger for your headphones and
perhaps a stand for your smart phone can
help clean up the desk a bit I also
noticed your notebook just laying there
so picking up an under desk keyboard
drawer can help you keep that out of
sight and also in a place where it's
easy to reach I know it's made for
keyboards but you can put other stuff in
there as well I'm not sure how effective
that setup is having another display
next to an ultra-wide especially since
the Acer monitor is curved if we're up
to me I would try and mount that Asus
monitor directly above the Acer one that
way you get to sit directly in front of
the curved monitor and have the other
one just slightly above it but these are
just my recommendations it's nice to see
you again on the channel Thank You
Archie for entering speaking of ultra
wide curved monitors Austin has one as
well but from LG also on a desk we have
the Corsair Vengeance k70 mechanical
gaming keyboard and a corsair saber RGB
mouse sandwich King the monitors are the
bose companion 20 speakers and we also
have a set of RGB LED strips in the back
the outset of choice is the ashtray 50s
neatly resting on its own hanger under
the desk
Cayla management is pretty good for the
most part but if you want to hide those
cables you can pick up these cable
tunnels and run them through it the PC
that's powering the setup has a 4790k
and an MSI GTX 970 which can also use
some velcro straps in the back to tidy
those wires up attaching a Velcro in the
back of the remote and hooking it up on
the roof of your desk is they really
cheap an easy way to get that out of
sight as well lastly that USB hub can
also be hidden either in the back of the
monitor which might be a little
difficult to reach or under the desk
closer to you in my experience 3m tape
in the form of little squares works the
best
other than those minor tweaks you have
an awesome setup Thank You Austin for
entering coming in at number 3 is Scott
with yet another ultrawide monitor I
think I should have called this the
ultra white Edition so we have the non
curved 34 inch LG monitor hooked up to
the freedom arm which is actually the
one I'm using from my monitor as well
you didn't list the keyboard and mouse
but the mouse does look like it's from
real cat we also have a pair of ameica
speakers behind the monitor and a pair
of AKG q7o one headphones on the Omega
wooden head stand cable management isn't
bad I mean you did keep all the wires
off of the ground and used velcro straps
cable clips and even alternate methods
to keep Irish tips against the roof to
try and organize everything so I'll give
you a pass not to mention that you have
two setups so cable management
definitely isn't easy for you
considering that you've a bunch of stuff
to connect we have a water-cooled PC
that's powering the setup inside the air
540 case from coarser it's rocking a 59
30 K and 2 GTX 980 s and SLI while the
other set up is being powered by a 2013
MacBook Pro there's obviously a lot of
stuff going on between these setups but
it looks clean for the most part
thank you Scott for entering finally
breaking the ultrawide monitor shreak is
henrique with his triple 21 inch Acer
setup we also have the Razer BlackWidow
chroma key board and a
a chroma Mouse on top of the SteelSeries
mouse pad we have an m2 stand holding up
the Xbox controller which is hooked up
to the Belkin seven port USB hub for
charging very clever on the placement
their cable management isn't the best I
do see some loose wires behind the PC
which can be hidden inside the omnimount
cable sleeve I do like that you wrap the
cables against the wall with some zip
ties but I would still recommend picking
up a wall cable tunnel to keep those
hidden and finally the PC pushing those
pixels has an FX 8320 and an r9 390
pretty fit for it setup thank you and
Rica for entering last but not least we
have Jimmy and his first-ever Pokemon
themed setup so we have a 23 inch Acer
monitor which was custom painted red to
match the theme we also have the red
dragon vajira keyboard and central
forest mouse on top of the yin-yang
dragons mouse pad also on the desk is a
pair of Logitech speakers which are also
modded red and a pair of Santa arches
gaming headset hanging from the sades
headset hanger cable management is
pretty good I love that you drilled a
hole in the middle of the table and
routed the keyboard and mouse wires
through I'll also give you a point for
that remote placement one thing I would
recommend is to place that power strip
in a cable box since it's that close to
the ground anyways there's really no
reason to mount it against the wall if
it's visible the PC does probably the
setup has a pretty sweet decal and it's
rocking in FX 6300 and an Asus GTX 750
Ti to top off the setup and stay
consistent with a theme we have some
figurines Charizard Bowser and mega
Charizard X by the way I love that
justice league poster you have up there
really sweet set up Jimmy thank you for
entering so that's it for this episode
I've set up boards you guys know what to
do drop your comments down below and
vote on who you think has the best desk
setup as always the winners will be
announced on my Twitter and Instagram
accounts on Sunday so make sure you guys
