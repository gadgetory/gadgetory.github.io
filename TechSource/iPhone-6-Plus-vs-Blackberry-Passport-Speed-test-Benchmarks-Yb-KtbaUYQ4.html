One m9 that's sponsored by cell cashier
com they compare iPhone prices on the
internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iPhone what's up
guys it's ed from Texas and in this
video I will be performing a speed and
benchmark test between the iPhone 6 plus
and the BlackBerry passport wheel
BlackBerry's flagship phone keep up with
the iPhone 6 plus let's find out
okay for the benchmark test
unfortunately the passport can't run
Geekbench
it just keeps on crashing every time I
open it up so instead I will be running
3d mark on both devices
all right so you guys probably already
guessed it from the beginning but the
iPhone six-plus just dominated the
BlackBerry passport in all aspects of
this test I was hoping the passport
would at least have a fighting chance
looking at those specs and the size of
the display but it was just a massacre
anyways thanks for watching the video
feel free to drop your thoughts in the
comment section down below about these
tests and also let me know which two
phones you want to see go head-to-head
