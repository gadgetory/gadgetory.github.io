month ago I visited the in win booth at
CES in Vegas this year to check out
their amazing selection of innovative
towers and I also said that my next
build will be in one of these cases well
if you've been following me on instagram
then you already know that I have
received one of these towers
specifically the D frame mini and by the
way a huge thanks to anyone for sending
this baby to us now if you haven't heard
about the in win cases then that means
you either live under a boulder or you
have never built a PC in your life Edwin
is actually one of my favorite PC case
companies and it's partly due to their
unique and innovative case designs that
the frame mini is no exception with its
open frame structure and it's portable
mini ITX form factor that the frame mini
will easily provide you with the
ultimate gaming experience you need like
most in win cases that the frame mini is
handcrafted and made out of aluminum
with shockproof silicone rubber stands
allowing you to position the case in any
orientation you like by the way I will
leave links to this case in the
description section as well as the
website if you guys want to check out
the rest of their jaw-dropping PC cases
so inside the box you will find a user
manual which includes the installation
guide some warranty information and the
specs of the case right below that is a
ziploc bag of goodies they did include a
really neat branded microfiber cloth
which will come in handy due to the case
having glass sides also in the ziplock
bag is an accessory bag with a bunch of
screw standoffs and clamps which is
necessary to install the parts now if
you've been with the channel for a while
you do know that I build custom pcs
every month or so and once in a while I
throw in an ultimate PC build well I
asked you guys on Twitter a while back
and most of you wanted to see $1000
gaming budget build and I'm going to
build it inside this case I want this to
be a very unique build just like my big
red PC was which means that I might end
up modding and custom painting it as
well the D frame mini is a stunning case
it has a full aluminum frame with an
aluminum metal plate along with tempered
glass on each side giving it maximum
visibility through the case also with
this open frame structure you don't have
to worry
the pc overheating since you get a
tremendous amount of airflow from all
directions i had to go with the black
and red theme because it is by far my
most favorite theme but they do have two
other color combinations in case this
one doesn't quite work for you
so the tempered glass is obviously
removable and it is connected to the
case with four of these thumb screws on
all four of the corners you just simply
screw them off and remove the glass to
gain access to the inside although it is
a mini ITX case it has a lot of space
for its parts because of the way it's
designed the D frame mini is split into
sections and every PC part has its own
spot the fan section is right down here
on the bottom of the case and it
supports two 120 millimeter fans or a
water cooling radiator up to 240
millimeters also the CPU heatsink
clearance is about 165 millimeters away
from the motherboard for its drive bays
it can support up to 3 2.5 inch SSDs and
3.5 inch HD DS moving to the other side
of the case is where you will find the
location for the power supply and last
but not least the case supports up to 2
graphics cards with a maximum length of
340 millimeters needless to say that the
frame mini can support most of the
popular PC components now switching to
the other side is where the front panel
is located along with the common
headphone microphone and USB 3.0 ports
along with the power button besides the
awesome design and color theme of this
case I think my most favorite feature by
far is its portability let's say your
friend is hosting a LAN party this
weekend and you have to bring your own
PC well all you have to do is just grab
the handle bar up top and you are on
your way well maybe you might want to
bring your monitor keyboard and mouse
but the point is it's really convenient
to carry around
anyways that wraps up the video of the
in windy frame mini case I really want
to know what you guys think about this
case so please drop your thoughts in the
comment section down below as I will be
reading them I got a bunch of cool stuff
coming your way so make sure you guys
stick around thanks again for watching
this is that from tech source and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
