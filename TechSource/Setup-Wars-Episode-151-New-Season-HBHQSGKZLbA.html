welcome to the new season of set-up wars
after every 50 episodes I tend to start
a new season but this time I want to do
something a little different you guys
I've been doing setup wars for over 150
episodes and it's pretty much the same
format for a long time so I'm trying I'm
gonna try something different and I want
to see if you guys like it so after
watching this video please either leave
a dislike or a like a dislike meaning
you don't like the new format you want
me to go back to the previous style of
setup wars if you guys like the new
format just drop a like that's all I
asked for that's gonna determine if I
continue this series or not but anyways
what that said let the setup wars begin
so a lot of you guys I've actually seen
my current set up back at home which was
the ultra ride with the white and red
color scheme I'm actually gonna be
redoing that setup from scratch and
that's gonna be coming up later this
year but there's something that I use
with my setup on a daily basis and
that's LastPass which is also kind
enough to sponsor this video a lot of
you guys know that I worked the last
past multiple times before and I've used
them for years now way before they
reached out to sponsor this video and
they just made my life so much easier by
keeping track of all my passwords as a
content creator I have so many different
accounts and websites that I use to
essentially run my channel whether
that's looking up music for my videos
downloading games the benchmark
purchasing products for review or just
simple everyday tasks
LastPass takes out the stress of
remembering all my passwords and keeps
it safe from hackers also their
multi-factor authentication keeps all
your information secured and protected
to learn more about LastPass click on
the link below once again a huge thinks
LastPass for sponsoring this video all
right guys so this is how the format's
gonna be for this episode unlike before
which was scripted I had notes and stuff
ready to go and what to say for each
setup this time it's gonna be Rob I
didn't have any time to prepare this is
actually my first time opening up these
setups I've never seen them before
so you guys will get my first real
reaction as well as impressions and at
the end I'm just gonna give my overall
rating of this set up out of 10 pretty
straightforward stuff and to help you
with this I'm using my editors MacBook
Pro he recently picked this up and I
have no clue how to use this thing to be
honest but he showed me a few things of
how to swap between photos so he set
everything up for me so I'll have to do
is just go to the pictures and give you
guys my impressions and tips and stuff
like that but yeah anyways with that
said let's just begin alright guys so
here goes nothing I'm hoping up the
first setup which I believe it's from
David and start their show okay okay so
first impressions this is one hell of a
badass-looking setup I'm actually
impressed the presentation is really
nice it's symmetrical so that's always a
plus and without even looking at the
notes I can tell he's some sort of a
programmer or a coder judging by those
vertical place
monitors speaking of notes actually take
a look at and see where he's from so
this is David Sarah he's 37 years old
located in LA and he's actually a
developer slash consultant for VR AR
games and experiences okay that's pretty
cool and the setups purpose is
developing editing and gaming okay let's
dive in a little closer that's a really
clean set up so for the monitors looks
like he's rocking two LG 24-inch
monitors that he hooked up for portrait
mode
honestly it says 24 inches in the notes
but I don't think this sees these are 24
inches they are you seem a little wide
for that to be honest but I don't know
so the middle monitor is the Acer
predator X 34 which is a gaming ultra
wide and on the top we've got a BenQ
24-inch see the top monitor is actually
more like a 24 inch whereas the side
monitors aren't 24 inches let's take a
look at the peripherals looks like he's
using the same mouse as me got the
Logitech G 904 the keyboard is the code
87 keyboard with the portable key caps
for audio those look like he has a set
of headsets hanging from the left side
over there we got the pair yet zik
whatever that is and for gaming he's got
the Astro a 50s for the Xbox and PC so
yeah this is actually a custom-built
desk by David and looks like he painted
everything in matte black there's even a
cutout here on the side for his PC a 59
60 X 2 eb g a titan x and sli this is
the water-cooled version from EVGA and
we've got 64 gigs of ram at 2800
megahertz
overall a beast PC and it's really clean
with the white and black color scheme I
don't know so much about the blue Ram
stick but overall everything else looks
really clean looks like I'm outside of
the wall he's hooked up his VR gear that
the oculus rift looks like HTC vive and
the controllers and check this out guys
he has some sort of a strap hooked up on
the ceiling so he can hook up his
headset on and bring it down whenever he
needs to play which is pretty clever I
gotta say oh here's an entire area
dedicated for VR check this out guys
he's calling it the lab Wow looks like
there's some
Cable's up top that's holding up the
actual VR headset oh so it doesn't get
in the way when he's walking around
that's actually very smart that is
pretty sweet I'm not gonna lie as that
is the ultimate VR setup right there I
wish I had that much space honestly for
my HTC vive it's one of the reasons why
I might have been using it at my home
because it is so cramped in the loft
area I do gotta give you props on the
audio game we got a set of Wharfedale
diamond 220 speakers that are hooked up
to the creative soundblaster excellent
work with the cable management honestly
I don't even see where the wires are
underneath the desk looking at the notes
actually looks like it's oh the wiring
is built into channels within the desk
and inside the walls and across the
ceiling so yeah excellent work with your
wire management against the wall over
here looks like there's some more
controllers and a UPS system and even
the wires on the top of his desk are
clean no wires coming from the keyboard
and there's even a channel raceway your
honor if you guys can see that behind
the phone the sound blaster and even his
Amazon echo this setup is freaking
pretty much flawless guys I don't know
what to say everything's on point it's
organized it's well thought out
I love the custom build desk it works
perfectly with this setup organization
symmetry it's got purpose I have no
reason not to give this guy a seal of
approval what do you guys think wow I
can't believe I'm doing okay yeah David
congratulations dude if you're watching
this the submissions from January by the
way so I don't if you still subscribe to
the channel but if you are
congratulations dude I'm giving you the
setup wars seal of approval I have no
reason not to give you one and just to
recap someone who receive the seal of
approval will get a hundred dollars in
cash a techstars t-shirt if they want
but most importantly a one-of-a-kind
unique custom-made plaque that they can
gladly put on their setup or whatever
they want but yeah David congratulations
do this is a badass gaming and
productivity setup I'm really loving
your your VR setup you got there but
yeah if you're watching pus and email
setup words at gmail o'clock llama toss
and email to set up wars at gmail.com to
claim your prize
absolutely stunning setup dude I'm
impressed all right next up is the Jacob
from Atlanta Georgia
he's 32 years old and his profession is
a cardiovascular technologist I honestly
don't even know what that is
the set of purpose is gaming and
research the first thing I noticed is
the pictures are in vertical mode that's
actually one of the requirements you
have to put them in landscape mode but
for some reason this set up made it to
the cut that's it's oh we got nevermind
we got some landscape pictures here oh
it's a hybrid setup we got a PC and a
laptop on there as well so the theme
over here seems to be Star Wars so we
got an all-white with some black accents
that PC looks really nice actually
there's some pretty cool props in there
how does you fit two lightsabers in
there oh this is actually a water-cooled
PC those those lightsabers aren't props
they're actual tubes that Wow okay let's
take a look at some specs it's rocking
these 7700 K at 5 gigahertz MSI 1080
which is overclocked and we've got 16
gigs of ram and of course a bunch of
water cooling parts from ek take a look
at those fan grills that looks pretty
sick looks like everything was custom
made in here I love the little props
down here - looks like we got Darth
Vader and looks like Skywalker in a very
awkward pose what is he even doing okay
so the custom build took him over a
hundred modification hours to complete
Oh even the case has some nice artwork
around it on the side panels and in the
front as well alright looks like we have
an LG Ultra ride hooked up on the wall
this is actually the 34 inch curved
ultra wide and underneath that we have
his MacBook Pro so peripherals he's
rocking a Sade's RGB keyboard we also
got the logitech 303 gaming mouse yeah
it doesn't look like he drilled a hole
for the keyboard and mouse but the rest
of the wires are being held up using the
Signum rack he just kind of just dumped
everything on there my overall thoughts
on this setup I think you did a great
job putting everything together
it's consistent with a color scheme it's
organized cable management's great the
desk surface itself isn't that cluttered
looks like you only kept the stuff that
you're really using on there I don't
know so much about the MacBook Pro
placements maybe we can put that on a
stand and push it off to the left side
but I'm guessing you put that there to
kind of cover up the ultra wide mount
and as well as cover up
cables for the mouse and keyboard so I
guess that's fine the only other thing I
would really recommend is maybe putting
some wall art above your monitor your
first picture actually has a five piece
mural painting of a stormtrooper but in
your other pictures it's not there so I
think you just photoshopped it there
just to kind of show what it looks like
but honestly it looks really good up
there and I do recommend picking up some
sort of painting or wall art and putting
it on top of your setup I feel like that
would be the icing on the cake so to
conclude my overall rating I would say
seven out of ten only because there are
some things you can tweak or maybe add
to your setup to make it pop more and I
feel like that PC by the way beautiful
beautiful PC but I feel like it kind of
stands out it's such an awesome custom
modded PC and then we look at everything
else it just kind of seems basic it kind
of seems out of place but I don't know
that's just those are just my thoughts
maybe you could do some other cool
custom work across your setup to kind of
match the level of creativity that your
PC has again that's just my two cents
I was up to know what you guys think
about his setup do you agree with my
rating if not let me know in the
comments section okay moving on to the
next set up all right next up is Jan
he's 18 from aria Austria he's a student
majoring in computer science and the set
up purpose is gaming after effects video
editing graphic design and programming
what is this
some mistake just put just a bunch of
pictures did you send me a list of your
where's the photos dude oh my god he's
sick oh I think he misunderstood was
asking for this guy is he trolling did
he legit just Photoshop his own setup
there is even a setup for his seal of
approval on the wall he even cut look at
this even Brooke cable management the
wire for the keyboard is going
underneath the monitor oh my god how
much time did you guys spend on this
it's a 5 out of 10
alright moving on okay now here we go
now this is a setup holy cow this is
this has my name written all over it
look at that just beautiful presentation
alright so this guy's name is Joe he's
21 years old he's from the US New York
specifically I was just there actually a
few weeks ago
his occupation he's a United States
Marine oh very nice and he's also a
student thank you for your service by
the way Joe this is honestly a beautiful
setup Alex really clean I just I love
the black and red consistency throughout
your setup beautiful work on that
okay so monitors looks like he's got a
BenQ a 24 inch 1080p BenQ monitor on the
bottom and you also got a 23 inch 1080p
LG monitor up top and we even have a
laptop on the side here it's an
alienware 15 r2 it's a 4k laptop with
touchscreen for peripherals he's got the
Logitech k5t 5 keyboard we had the
logitech g502 proteus spec mouse an
extended black and red mousepad and even
has an extended mousepad for his audio
interface check this out guys that is
that is adorable oh I just noticed the
speaker's - they're kind of blending in
with the wall so these are the Rockville
I think that's how you say it a s + v
bookshelf speakers his audio game is
actually
that bet he's rocking the scarlet audio
interface with the cm 25 microphone and
studio HP 60 that now the pc powering
everything also looks really nice it's
got the i5 7500 we have a GTX 1080 and
16 gigs of ram one thing I do recommend
right after but I noticed is obviously
your SSD it sticks out because it
doesn't blend in with your color scheme
a simple fix to this is just picking up
some skins from Amazon they're really
cheap either in black carbon fiber or
red whatever color you want but it's
really easy to skin that SSD and make it
blend in with the rest of your build the
rest of the bill is actually looking
really clean I love the color choices
you picked on the cables it's actually
it's different its unique cable
management very clean looks like he's
using a J channel Raceway running the
wires through that as even some things
hooked up underneath the desk like it's
Parrish grip and we even have an anchor
USB hub over here for easy access
overall thoughts a very beautiful setup
put together very nicely I always love
setups when they put a lot of attention
to detail and keeping the color scheme
consistent throughout and you can
definitely see that and Joe setup
symmetry is definitely there I love the
black and red acoustic foams he's got in
the back and the lighting is also on
point it's not too obtrusive yeah I got
no complaints all recommendations this
setup is put together really well I
think Joe knew what he was doing this
was this setup is on point he actually
has a setup check this out guys this is
his setup b4 this was a little over a
year ago which he submitted to setup
wars and he didn't get approved but this
is actually a huge huge upgrade from
coming from that look at that I don't
come across a lot of double stack
monitor setups like this but I would say
this is definitely in the top 5 from
what I've seen on the show so far
excellent excellent setup my rating on
this is a solid 9 out of 10 but again
guys let me know what you think in the
comments below a number four is Johan
coming all the way from Sweden and this
is his white and black
I'm guessing star wars-themed set up
right so johan is 39 and he is a CTO at
a software company
and the purpose of the setup is for
gaming and developing martyr of choice
is the PG 3 for 8q from Asus it's an
ultra-wide
and looks like we've got the courser k
65 rapid fire RGB keyboard with the
Death Adder elite mouse from Razer and
he did in fact the drill a hole for both
the wires nicely done
the setup is very minimalistic I like
that he only has just the peripherals
and his Edifier speakers Luna clips by
the way I recognize those from anywhere
because I'm using the same ones the red
version is actually for my own setup
absolutely speakers I love them to death
now the PC is mounted on the wall and
that is the first thing that caught my
attention let's take a closer look at
this beast so is using the popular
thermal take white p3 case which is I
would say one of the very few cases that
you can actually mount against the wall
the cpu is the 7 8 20 x8 core processor
we also got Asus GTX Strix 1080 which by
the way is painted in white beautiful
work third and four Ram this is actually
interesting he's got 98 gigs of ram and
he's using two different types of sticks
four of them are the Vengeance RGB and
then the other four are the regular
Corsair Vengeance lpx sticks the cable
management is pretty good looks like we
have a rack up there holding up a lot of
the cables I don't know what's going on
around this area but there is a channel
raceway routing a few cables down to
this massive power strips a power strip
I think is thick as hell Jesus but we
also have a shower Raceway for the PC
cables as well so yeah all the PC wires
are running through this channel Raceway
near the bottom very clean job there I
don't really have any recommendations on
this setup it's really hard to recommend
or critique a setup that's minimalistic
like this one for example especially
since it is such a great job keeping
everything so organized and clean the PC
is honestly one of my favorite things
about this setup but you did a great job
overall Johan my overall rating for this
is a solid 9 out of 10 hands down thank
you for entering last but not least we
have Victor while that's actually a wow
that's a really nice present
station look at that pub Japan huh okay
so yeah this is Victor he's 29 he is
also from Sweden welcome fellow Sweden
viewer his occupation he's a project
leader for construction and the set up
purpose is for gaming screaming and
working that is a hell of a setup for
working so the monitor is using is a
super ultra wide from Samsung this is a
49 inch it's very similar to the one I
actually reviewed on a channel looks
like it's actually mounted against the
wall and the cables are running through
the wall itself because I don't see any
cables coming out of the monitor nicely
done the keyboard is the SteelSeries M
800 we've also got a SteelSeries rival
hyper beast mouse with a SteelSeries
mouse pad for audio he's rocking a steel
series 840 headset and I think he has a
set of speakers which are the Sonos play
you've got a 5 by 2 and a Sonos sub
which I'm guessing is underneath his
setup another desk setup is actually two
different desks and there is using the
IKEA lemon tabletops with the Alex
George to hold them as support I said a
PC powering everything is actually
water-cooled it's rocking the 7700 K at
4.4 gigahertz come on you can overclock
that better like that thing can easily
hit 5 gigahertz especially since it's
water-cooled we also got 64 gigs of ram
Jesus and it's at 3600 megahertz
with the MSI Seahawk 1080 TI using the
ek wanna block really nice oh it's got a
second PC which is a streaming PC
there's really nothing any pictures of
that but that one is walking at 6700 K
at 4 gigahertz we got 16 gigs of ram and
it's got an Asus 1080 founders Edition I
didn't even see that PC in the back oh
you can kind of see it from this angle
over here okay so it's kind of hidden
behind the his main PC interesting
what's also interesting is that he's
using a single three sixty millimeter
rad to cool both the CPU and
CPU it's interesting unless there's
another radiator in the back but I could
be wrong
there's not that many pictures for this
setup I was hoping to see more but
overall very simple not much going on
here to be honest I do love the lighting
though I like how you put those Phillip
hue bulb things behind the PC and also
behind the speakers the Lightning on
here is on point now here's something I
would recommend since you are drilling
holes through your wall to route the
cables through and you're using a case
that can be easily mounted against the
wall what I would do is mount that PC on
top of your monitor right directly in
the center mount the cables through the
wall and you can move that other PC your
streaming PC closer on the right side I
think that will look a lot cleaner I
only say that because there's not much
going on above your monitor you got this
big blank white space maybe you can put
some artwork on there or something but I
do recommend using that space though you
kind of just give you set up a more full
look and since we're on the topic of
mounting stuff on the wall maybe even
mount your speaker's on the wall either
using a wall shelf or just mount them
directly against the wall the reason why
I say that is because you went through
the trouble of mounting your ultra-wide
against the wall with no cables being
shown
so I think this setup would look really
awesome if it has this levitating look
so keeping the surface area very clean
and having everything else mounted
against the wall without any wires
showing would look really really sweet
in this setup oh yeah that is my two
cents my overall rating I would say a
solid 8 out of 10
thank you very much victor for entry
yeah guys I pretty much wraps up this
new episode of setup wars don't forget
to vote on your favorites setup by
leaving a comment down below also please
don't forget about the rating system
dislike the video if you don't like the
new style of setup wars but leave a like
if you did like it personally I had a
blast making this video it was really
fun just to sit down and go with the
flow
don't worry about any scripting or any
nonsense it was it was actually really
fun to shoot this video maybe because
it's something new but whatever it is I
really enjoyed it
and also guys if you really enjoyed it
like you really really enjoyed this new
style of setup wars compared to the
other one
I think I can promise I don't wanna
promise yet but I think I can bring back
set up words every single Monday I can
do this style every single Monday
because it's actually a lot easier to
shoot and a lot easier to edit
everything is already synced up I just
throw in our timeline do some cuts
render it out so if you guys really
enjoyed it I think I could bring it back
and do it every single Monday for you
guys but anyways that's up to you that's
not up to me thank you again for
watching as always I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
