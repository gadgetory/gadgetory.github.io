honest I finally switched from black and
red to black and yellow so yeah this is
a much-needed change I'm just kidding I
will never switch from black and red
that has always been my favorite color
scheme and there's so much history
behind it but I'm just using this
because honestly it looks so much better
than my previous setup and I hope you
guys like it too it's a nice change it's
temporary until I have to move I don't
know why I'm still rambling welcome to
set up Ward's episode 105 ultra wide
competition sponsored by LG where the
winners will take home a brand new
ultrawide monitor either a gaming or
productivity model whatever their heart
desires there's only two more episodes
left guys with two more winners so the
guys haven't submitted yet make sure to
send in your submission I'm still
accepting requests I think I have room
for maybe 10 more that I can choose from
but anyways with that said let the set
up wars begin
also guys before I begin the episode I
want to emphasize again because a lot of
people are confused it is not the ultra
wide Edition one featuring ultra-wide
monitors this is the ultra wide
competition where I'm only featuring
setups that are not that good they're
decent some of them are even crappy but
these are setups that can use an ultra
light monitor as an upgrade so you might
not see some impressive setups any
jaw-dropping setups they're going to be
decent maybe even some crappy ones like
I said so hope you guys are okay with
that but anyways what that said let's
start to show so starting the show off
is Gabriel and a very nice Star Wars
themed setup featuring the 27 inch dual
monitor we got the devil caliber
wireless keyboard with custom black key
caps while it looks actually nice and
Logitech g600 to Mouse for audio he's
using the Corsair H 2100 gaming headset
and this setup is being powered by the
Alienware 15 gaming laptop but he also
has a 27-inch iMac on the other side for
the more demanding tasks Gabriel did an
excellent job keeping the setup very
clean and he did a great job with the
cable management I will select the
consistency of the theme he's a fan of
Star Wars and he's not afraid to show it
we got paintings wallpapers and a badass
set of figurines with my boy kylo what
up bro where you been man we definitely
need you back on the show an ultra-wide
would be a nice upgrade to this setup
although you might need to move the lamp
and the tablet to make some room good
luck and thank you for entering here's a
pretty basic setup from Ibrahim he has a
27 inch h2s monitor and the popular red
dragon keyboard and mouse combo he's
using the HyperX cloud 2 gaming headset
as well as a pair of bluetooth earphones
from LG that are hanging under the desk
the wallpaper is interesting though
we've got acoustic films on one side and
a pretty strange-looking wallpaper
design on the main wall I'm not too sure
what's up with that
excellent work with cable management
this brings tears of joy to my eyes and
it's one of the reasons I decided to
feature this setup in this episode
excellent work back here not much else
to talk about other than his PC which
features the 6500 and the gigabyte gtx
1060 graphics card Thank You Abraham and
good luck
three we got Geordi you impressed me not
by his setup but his custom-made PC case
looks like it was built out of a drawer
or could have been built using some
pieces of wood either way I commend you
for being creative and for that reason I
decided to include your setup I mean
let's face it there's nothing
interesting about this setup we got a 21
inch Akai monitor basic keyboard and
mouse and a cheap maxtor headset but
that's what the ultra-wide competition
is about giving people with a subpar
setup a chance to win an awesome upgrade
I'm not going to give you too much crap
about cable management since it's
obvious that you tried but if I can give
you what advice please don't use tape to
wrap up the cables together velcro
straps all your best option good luck
and thank you for entering here is
another person that can definitely use
an ultra-wide monitor
I mean sure he's got two displays but I
feel like an ultra-light would be a nice
upgrade and it'll definitely clean up
his setup especially since is rocking
two different monitors a 27-inch AUC and
an Acer display I'm not gonna lie this
setup does seem a bit messy especially
with the cable management but he does
have some pretty nice gear we got the
Razer BlackWidow chroma keyboard
DeathAdder Mouse and a blue Yeti
microphone for sound input if it's not a
pair of clip speakers and two sets of
headphones the Sennheiser 598 SES and
the Razer Kraken CROs which he has
sitting next to a custom-made arcade
flight stick the PC powering the setup
has a 70 70 K and a gtx 1070 i mean it's
definitely some nice choices when it
comes to gear but the actual setup needs
some changes first off the speaker
stands are pointless because the
monitors are blocking the speakers a
solution to this would be to mount the
speakers on the wall by putting them on
wall shelves but to be fair the setup
was kind of doomed to begin with because
of how small the actual desk is I mean
you only have so much space to work with
second it doesn't look like you are
taking advantage of the space that the
Alex Adam unit provides you could have
easily fit the ps4 or even a router in
the center or better yet hide the router
in one of those drawers and then drill
holes in the back to route the cables
through you can also keep your ps4 in
the center I mean unless you really want
to show off your Harley Quinn obsession
another thing you can do is try mounting
the boom arm to the actual monitor arm
of your displays if successful it does
two things one it cleans up the side of
your desk and two it gives you a much
more comfortable angle to use the
microwave once you're done using it
simply fold it and tuck it away behind
the monitors there's definitely room for
some improvement and an ultra-wide
monitor would be a nice start good luck
and thank you for entering and finishing
up the episode we got Roman and a very
clean set up that's being powered by a
MacBook now if those black those
headphones were white it would have
looked so much better but can we just
stop for a second and appreciate the
symmetry we got going on over here
Roman is using a 23 inch LG monitor
that's hooked up against the wall and we
got a pair of Harman Kardon speakers and
the Apple wireless keyboard which is
missing a freaking key are you serious
right now this is unacceptable
I do like the magnetic cable clips you
hooked up against the wall and the rest
of the cables are hidden very well
behind the backboard that about does it
for this simplistic setup
good luck Roman and thank you for
entering so that as if it is episode
