10th around 9:30 p.m. my office was
burglarized so two guys in a white van
pulled up in front of my office they got
through the door somehow without
breaking anything and it was abled my
cameras and then they opened the garage
door down below the van then proceeded
to back up inside finally closed in the
gate and then they were in there for
about thirty minutes taking everything
from my office both from downstairs and
upstairs my camera equipment computers
laptops monitors a bunch of PC parts and
pretty much everything that had value a
very empty room as you guys can see the
only left here was the lighting some
acoustic panels on this desk there was
the razor corex
there was a bunch of PC parts that
actually went into that build I'm
surprised they didn't take the case they
left that there but all the parts are
gone the LG grab was on there that's
gone as well and most of the stuff in
here is gone actually almost everything
is gone we had the LG 65 inch super UHD
TV over here that stolen ps4 pro the LG
ultra wide we had a custom PC MacBook
Pros on the desk there as well and all
the lenses camera equipment batteries a
lot of stuff is over here is economy
even took the router the wireless router
I don't really care about most of the
stuff that was taken the only thing that
was really close to me that I really
cared about that they stole was my red
cinema camera that entire camera with
the lens and everything cost cost me
around 30k that I had to spend out of my
own pocket but anyways afterwards they
got into the van and left I found that
about it a few hours later I called the
cops and I reported the incident and
Here I am one month later making a video
about it
so this is the downstairs you can tell
where they pulled in the van they opened
up the garage gate and they pulled in
backwards with the back facing inwards
obviously and I just started throwing
everything inside
they moved my shelf which was all lit
over there in the back everything on
there is gone as you can see how the
quad stellar case on there all the PC
parts two actually three full shelves of
computer components PC parts are all
gone 1080p is Titan XPS all the high-end
CPUs eight port and for all the water
cooling gear for the two and one PC all
that is also gone that was like a
fifteen thousand dollar PC that I was
gonna be building but the only thing the
left on is some soft tubing custom
cables and that when the coolant so yeah
everything else is gone
yeah just shelves empty to add some
components
but everything in here's is that be
what's ransacked the funny thing is I
know who did this
I am 99.99 percent sure who did this but
I can't do anything about it without
evidence
the detective that's on the case for
almost a month now is taking her sweet
time I'm she hasn't really done anything
there's a traffic camera right here at
the intersection next to the office
where all the cars passed through and it
can easily read the license plate off
the van going through it and she hasn't
even pulled that out yet
so I don't know what's taking her so
long that's fine she's probably busy
with other more important cases but as
of now I'm still waiting the worst part
about all this is that I had no
insurance for this office building if I
did have insurance I probably would have
covered most if not majority of items
that was stolen every single tenant in
this office building is required to have
insurance but for some reason I don't
know why they did not tell me that when
I moved in I've been here for almost
seven months and no one has told me
anything about having insurance I told
myself I wasn't gonna make a video on
this I hate making these drama type
videos I honestly didn't nobody knows
about this except me and like two or
three other people me my own family
doesn't even know about this my mom was
watching his video she's probably
freaking out and she probably called me
at this point but nobody else knows
about this I kept it all to myself
every day that went by it became harder
and harder keeping it a secret I felt
like I was carrying this heavy weight on
my shoulders there's a lot of thing
revolving around the channel that has to
do with this incident and the more
questions that I get asked about it the
more I have to lie to my subscribers and
to brands and other people so that's
kind of why I'm making this video I'm
making it public so I can address those
questions and concerns and always refer
people to come back and watch this video
so they know exactly what happened I was
even briefly considering opening up a
GoFundMe to see who was willing to pitch
in a few dollars to help me purchase
some of the equipment that was stolen
but ultimately I decided not to because
personally I just don't like asking for
money regardless of the type of
situation I'm in it just doesn't feel
right to me if I'm ever gonna be asking
for money it's gonna be help to help
somebody else okay now for some channel
updates the first one
is a two-in-one gaming PC obviously I
can't do that anymore because all the
parts for that build is gone so I can't
do part two anymore I also wanted to
address the Nvidia gaming PC giveaway so
winner should have been selected at the
end of August obviously no winner has
been selected yet because the PC in fact
was stolen that's kind of why it's
taking longer than expected I don't know
if they're gonna rebuild the same PC and
then do giveaway on that or if they're
just gonna cancel the giveaway but if
they do cancel it it is my fault so what
I'm gonna do is pitch in money from my
own pocket and build a similar spec PC
and do a giveaway on that instead now
because of the recent loss I'm gonna be
doing a few sponsored videos for the
month of September to help me recover
some of the equipment that was lost I
won't be able to buy another red camera
obviously it's just too expensive for me
right now and I can't spend that kind of
money on a camera but the sponsored
videos will definitely help a lot
towards recovering I would say majority
of the filming equipment that was taken
from me I'm not asking for sympathy or
pity or money from you guys the only
thing I can ask for is just supporting
the channel whether it's just simply
watching the videos dropping likes
positive feedback in the comments
section or even sharing my videos any of
that would mean the world to me I don't
care about any of the stuff that was
lost they could all be replaced
eventually the most important things to
me right now are my family my health and
of course you guys as long as I have all
that honestly I don't care what happens
next okay there's one more thing I want
to say before in this video and that's
never let your guard down no matter how
well you know someone no matter how safe
you feel bad things tend to happen when
you least expect it that is one thing
I've learned that I've taken away from
this experience and I feel like it's
made me a stronger person there will be
no follow-up video to this if the
investigation concludes the most I'll do
is maybe tweet about it but I hate
putting up videos like this but I had to
for this one for obvious reasons
I'm just I'm not a fan of these type
videos but anyways that's it for the
video thank you guys so much for
watching I do have some really awesome
content planned for the channel so make
sure you guys stick around anyways I
love your faces and as always I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
