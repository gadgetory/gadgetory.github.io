guys is that from tech Soros and welcome
back to the vlog that all it's been a
long time coming but there's a lot of
exciting stuff happening and I want to
make sure I get it on camera for those
of you who enjoyed my vlogs months and
months ago
I'd even know when the last vlog was
even uploaded but anyways as you guys
can see them kind of situated in my new
place
I will give you guys a tour once most of
the things are settled down there's a
lot of stuff that's happening today one
of the things actually I want to do is
kind of fix up my setup because we're
now looking a little janky and the
reason why it will be done much to it is
because I'm getting in these debts and
instead of working on a cable management
and getting everything looking so sexy
it's because I want to take it apart and
do it all over again on the new setup so
that is why I kind of left us just like
this it is a complete disaster please do
not come subscribe and then of course
I'm building myself a new PC as well and
I got some pretty dope ass wall art
that's going to go on top of my monitor
now here's the thing and this is a
decision I went with so here's my closet
I got foams and I apologize to the other
focus on the camera recording with EZ g7
so I'm going to order over to six bones
as you guys can see I don't want to mess
up the wall because I have seen what it
did to my previous wall in my apartment
so instead here's what I'm using right
now for my voiceovers I'm using these
acoustic panels so basically it's two
giant standing panels that I put in
front of my chair and then a microphone
will go in between it kind of sandwich
in you like this so that way there isn't
a lot of reverb and a lot of echo that's
being bounced around
but it's doing a really good job and I'm
happy with this instead of tasting those
damn acoustic poems on the wall messing
that up so I'm definitely happy with
this route for now it's temporary and of
course on the other side of the closet
is my main wig setup there is my other
stat mini that I use to shoot all the
videos and I kind of like a little troll
over here somewhat organized got my
audio interface that I used to record my
audio kind of nice to open up boxes and
stuff like that pens USB and all that
jazz but and then up here is stuff that
I've organized and stuff that I
constantly used every single day the
things got a package early in the
morning that's going to open that up
real quick see what's inside come on
we'll get some breakfast and then we're
gonna get to work guys gonna get to work
and set some things up today yes so
Gorillapod is going to make vlogging so
much easier firstly we have in here
alright power strips for my loft area I
ordered a few these for the recording
that and the last box in here open this
up real quick I think I know what this
one is reading this is the bridge to
hook up all these hue lights let's check
it out that so yeah that's the Phillips
to bridge that I need to hook up all for
his lights and controller using my
smartphone
unfortunately they sell them separately
but needs to be five anyways I'm gonna
leave that there for now let's take this
to where it belongs so upstairs to the
loft area so quick little mini tour for
you guys the kitchen is down there you
go up the stairs and the first thing you
see on the left side is the loft which
is not completed this is going to be the
gaming / entertainment area is going to
be a TV stand I might hook up
against the wall there that testbed
setup is currently temporary let's have
a fireball ready but how would I play
the sport
oh this is my studio so over here is my
studio there we go that's where it
belongs because currently this place
does not have where there it is not
having power strip so yeah this is my
current setup guys it's pretty solid for
vlogging I got the rode mic g7 stock
lens and the gorilla pod so I hope it's
not too shaky obviously this is the
first time I'm vlogging in a long time
so I'm going to prove at times I was on
so anyways let's go get some food and
begin the day so I just realized my mom
took my Lexus still have to take my
other car she's currently living with me
for a few weeks because her house was
being built right now and she's going to
be moving out in mid-august so I kinda
have to deal with that that is the car
I'm gonna have to take unfortunately now
here's the thing guys I don't mind
taking ulema honestly I love driving
this thing but it's a it's for a quick
task like getting breakfast and some
coffee I much prefer the Alexus because
I can just get in and drive this car you
have to sit it in wait five minutes for
the engine to warm up before you can
even climb
can I get the new ice kisara coconut
latte grande please yeah and I would
love to get a turkey pesto sandwich
please also guys are very excited about
an appointment I have I one o'clock
today I'm checking out some office
spaces in Valencia area which is really
close to where I live so I'm hoping I
can find the space within a few weeks
because that's going to be the hardest
part right now I'll bring you guys with
me obviously you guys can check it out
let me know what you think about the new
space I'm looking anywhere between 1,500
to 2,000 square feet because I got to
keep in mind I'm hiring two additional
people to help me with the channel quick
stop getting some gas yeah fun times n
be able to look at montage or something
while I'm just standing here
not that a little less than 50 bucks for
a full tank so almost the whole thing I
just finally got to the office place
this took me about 25 minutes to drive
there honestly looking for something a
little closer but if the space is right
and the price is right I'm gonna have to
make that exception but I'll show you
guys what it looks like and you guys
will be the judge too
yes
four people will definitely fit in here
but I was looking I was expecting more
bigger space to connect at least average
yeah so Tehran six hundred square feet
with all of them combined and there's
the exact same room on the opposite side
so around 600 square feet there so per
room hey guys this is editing ed so I
guess I forgot to turn the microphone on
and I'm just talking to myself over here
so basically they gave me a quote $3,600
for two rooms totaling 600 square feet
yeah that's overpriced especially for
the location and the size and yeah I'm
not going to do it I'm going to find
something that's closer with a lot more
space for $3,000 I can definitely get
something closer to 1500 even 2,000
square feet here in Santa Clarita but
yeah the search continues so yeah guys
the back of the headquarters I'm still
waiting on a few packages there's a few
things I still need to do in my office
and that is to hang my painting and also
also my gold play button and silver play
button I think I might hook them up on
these walls over here and also in the
loft I start to do big white the PC
bills for July which I think it's going
to get pushed for August so as you can
see most of the parts are here
the GPU the case you're still in
wrapping the CPU fan stuff and then here
the rest of the stuff over here laying
on the ground the amusing that's missing
are the RAM sticks and then once I get
that I can finally put everything
together I guess in the meantime I can
start setting up those Phillips LED
bulbs for this desk this is the best
time to be using to record my videos
temporarily again guys will be redoing
this entire room so don't judge anything
in here so this just Canon LG said under
new ultra wide gaming monitor for me to
review so it's going to open it up real
quick
this is the 34 you see 89 G 34 inch
ultra wide curved gaming monitor and
these are the specs over here it's gone
hundred forty-four hours for first rate
the G sink panel with an IPS display
this thing is beast oh yeah guys let's
putting my traps up the vlog I'll try
and keep it as short as possible maybe
four to five minutes I don't know how
long this one's going to be if you guys
prefer longer vlogs let me know in the
comments section otherwise I'll try not
to drag them on for too long
there's nothing really exciting going on
today I'm still waiting for stuff to
arrive I'm still waiting for the Sun to
set so I can record a video but very
boring stuff there's good there's
nothing to be a lot of cool stuff
happening throughout this week I'll make
sure to blog that process but anyways
thing guys so much for watching if you
enjoy the vlogs

to dislike as well that's cool and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
