Vega is finally here and it's aimed to
compete against the gtx 1070 and 1080
this is the current pricing for the GPUs
the Vegas 64 by itself starts at $4.99
while the 54 starts at 399 aim they also
introduced Radeon packs which gives you
some pretty cool discounts on gear so
the two cards that I have here for
comparison are the Vega 56 and the Vega
64 liquid-cooled version which actually
costs $200 more than the air-cool
version it's also combined with their
Radeon aqua pack unfortunately that is
the only way you'll be able to buy this
right now so here's what you get in the
Radeon pack you get $20 off a free sync
enabled monitor $100 off select Verizon
7 CPU and motherboard combos and 2 free
games if you don't care about the games
or don't need to upgrade your monitor
then the aqua pack is simply not worth
it
however if you're going to make use of
the entire $420 savings then go for it
you guys spend an extra hundred dollars
on the pack and save $420 netting you
$320 worth of savings all right so the
main difference between the air cooled
and the liquid cooled Vegas 64 cards are
the clock speeds the single point
performance and of course the power
consumption it's also a lot cooler and
quieter than the air-cooled version my
buddy Kyle from bit with reported his
air-cooled 64 hitting 85 degrees on full
load compared to only 64 on my liquid
cooled version alright so I will be
comparing these two GPUs against the
asus strix gtx 1070 and ii 1080 since
those are the cards that they are
competing with unfortunately I don't
have the founders edition on hand so I
decided to stick with the same brand GPU
to keep things more consistent this is
the test bed that I ended up using so
without wasting any more time let's dive
right into the benchmarks
all right so we got some interesting
numbers the GTX 1080 did better in most
of the games with the Vegas 64 right
behind it there were even some games
that the Vegas 64 scored better like on
battlefield 1 doom on Vulcan and even
division by Tom Clancy
however the 1080 did end up winning with
a total of 64 frames
more than Vegas 64 the Vega 56 did have
some trouble keeping up with the gtx
1070 as well you guys can blame
optimization for the time being but with
the current drivers the g6 1070 is the
clear winner in pure raw performance
over the Vega 56 air-cooled card however
when we take a look at frames per dollar
it's pretty obvious that the RX Vega 56
gives you the most bang for your buck
coming in a little over 2 frames per
dollar followed closely by the GTX 1070
the Vega 64 liquid-cooled version did
horribly in terms of value if only it
didn't cost $200 more than the Aero cool
version it would have been a much better
value over to 1080 with a total of 2.1
frames per dollar assuming the
performance is the same as the
liquid-cooled version alright so in
conclusion the clear winner here is
obviously the 1080 in terms of raw power
but if you guys want to get the most out
of your money and only have about 400
dollars to spend on your
gpu-z Vega 56 is the obvious choice
I'm sure if you guys give Andy some time
for optimizations and driver updates the
to Vega cards will perform a lot faster
just like we saw with their previous rx
500 series I will be doing a follow-up
video and comparing all the new amv
cards starting from the rx 550 and up
against Nvidia's lineup starting from
the GTX 1050 so if you guys are excited
for that
drop a like in the video but until then
I'll drop a link to all the GPUs
featured in this video I hope it was
helpful thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
