and welcome to setup wars episode 73 I
believe where you submit your desk setup
to get featured on the channel so if you
guys are interested make sure to watch
the video linked below so guys it's
challenge time I reached out on Twitter
because let's face it my challenges suck
and I asked you guys to come up with a
pretty cool challenge so I scroll
through a few minutes and I found a
pretty good one which was to destroy my
PC so if this video gets 60,000 likes I
will destroy a budget PC actually to be
specific I'm gonna destroy my brother's
PC because his birthday is coming up
soon and I need to upgrade his PC
anyways so it's kind of like a $450
budget build now so I want to destroy
that on camera if this video gets sixty
thousand likes and yeah check the setup
wars begin
if you guys are shopping around for your
next game make sure to check out g2
AECOM because they have the cheapest CD
keys available for pretty much any game
I'll drop a link to them down below if
you want to check it out as always you
guys can find the gear for every one
setup link below but here are five
contestants for this week we have Brock
Jonathan K pig and abusive
congratulations for making it on the
show so starting up the episode we have
Brock with a somewhat of a minimalistic
set up on the IKEA torn linen desk he
has 227 inch 4k monitors a mechanical
Eagle z77 keyboard and logitech g502
mouse surprisingly there is no mouse pad
off to the left side is the actual 850
headphones and behind that is this
custom PC built inside the fantex Mini
ITX case which is actually the PC I did
a buildin recently inside here is the
6600 K and a gtx 1070 founders edition
very nice combo cable management isn't
that bad but it can definitely be
improved what you can do is pick up a
power strip that has a cord and plug
that into the wall then you can either
hook up the power strip on the bottom of
your desk or put it inside a cable box
on the ground another thing I would
change is the placement of your PC I
would ship both of your monitors to the
left side and put your PC on the right
side exactly the same way it's facing
now this way the back end of your PC is
blocked off by the monitors and you
won't be able to see any wires coming
out of your PC also this way you can see
the front of your rig as well definitely
some minor tweaks are needed but overall
it's a pretty clean setup Thank You
Brock for entering next up is John
rocking three issues 24 inch gaming
monitors clocked at 144 Hertz refresh
rate they are hooked up to a triple
monitor arm and they are resting on a
kitchen countertop with two Alex drawers
as support on the desk keys rocking the
corsair strafe RGB SteelSeries rival 700
Mouse on top of the overwatch razor
goliath s mousepad so kind of looks like
he went with a black and blue setup
although it's not as consistent after
the left side of the table is the HyperX
cloud 2 gaming headset and he also has a
pair of Edifier or 1800s
speakers cable management is excellent
and props on a placement of the LED
remotes I'm not a fan of leaving the
HyperX cloud to adapter on the desk like
that and instead I would have routed
that underneath the desk and attach it
close to the edge using some cable clips
this way it's out of sight and it won't
interfere with you when you put on your
headset and finally the PC that's
powering the setup has a 6700 K and an
EVGA 1084 the win Edition great choice
on a sleeping and I really like the
cable management behind the PC overall a
very badass triple display setup thank
you John for entering K is next up with
a single 29 inch ultrawide monitor from
LG that's sitting on top of the IKEA
linman desk but it appears to have some
sort of tablecloth over it
on top of the course our extended
mousepad we have the taro so labora
keyboard and Armageddon alien g11 Mouse
I've never heard of these brands before
did you pick these up from Mars or
something sandwich King the monitor is a
pair of sonic gear evo 7 speakers and we
do have a headphone hangar holding up
the ws 770's
from audio technica excellent work with
cable management everything is neatly
grouped together and routed alongside
one of the legs it's a shame that you
have to keep your PC on the ground
because this thing looks beast it's
rocking an i5 4460 and a GTX Strix 960
inside the air 240 case it appears that
his girlfriend threw away his paddles
from the PC while they were hanging to
be dried after spray painting I feel the
pain man that really sucks how about
this if you live in United States hit me
up and I'll send you a brand new air 240
case if you want so make sure to toss me
an email at setup pores I actually think
it looks cooler without the panel's
because the thermal take fans kind of
stick out a bit but it's your call
whether you want the case or not a very
well-put-together set up no doubt thank
you Kay for entering a number 4 we have
pig with a yard Daniel that presentation
got me not gonna lie so we have three
BenQ monitors sitting on a custom-made
wall-mounted desk on the surface we have
a custom-made RGB keyboard which he
soldered by himself
Wow is the mouse custom made to Jesus
guess not it's the Logitech G 402 with
the dxracer mousepad there's definitely
a lot of stuff on the dash
including a pair of Philips Fidelio
headphones just laying there I'm not
sure we got that cable management box
from but it's really cool and I like it
next to that he has his iPhone 5 sitting
on a stand and also on the same type of
stand he has the galaxy tablet hooked up
it looks like he's using that as some
sort of a teleprompter or something
similar since it's located close to his
Samsung mic which by the way he has
hooked up on his wall a very interesting
placement speaking of interesting
placements the massive Celestion 100
speakers are mounted above the set up
against the walls I feel like you really
put some effort towards coordination of
this setup and is starting to show cable
management is also done really well
things are wrapped up together zip tied
and kept hidden away from sight also
down here is where the Xbox 360 is
resting along with his PC that's rocking
a 4790k and a gigabyte gtx 1070 it's
also pretty cool that he managed to tie
the LED lights to his music and in fact
he included a video check this out guys
a very sick setup Thank You Pig for
entering last but not least we have
fouseytube
and his black and red set up he's
rocking a 29 inch ultra wide monitor
that's resting on a custom-made desk and
unless we have a red dragon k5 52
keyboard and a logitech g502 mouse on
top of the VIP hams extended mouse pad
it seems like the logitech g502 Mouse is
extremely popular for some reason
keeping with the color scheme you have a
Logitech G 6:33 headset and SPC that has
a 40 460 and a GTX 960 other than a set
of peculiar Turtles on his desk and a
pair of n Studio speakers there's really
nothing else to go over it also appears
that you're into cars judging by the
massive posters on your right when it
comes to cable management you did a
pretty good job I mean I can see that
you use some velcro straps to keep the
wires together and you even have a power
strip hooked up on the bottom of the
desk it's also interesting to see that
you have your taskbar on the top of the
display instead of on the bottom I don't
think I've ever seen anyone do that
before I mean I would recommend a hangar
for your headset but that's already
obvious at this point I feel like there
really isn't much that can be changed to
improve this setup Thank You Yusuf for
entering so that is it for this episode
as always make sure you guys drop your
comments down below and vote on who you
think has the best desk setup and as
always announce the winners on my social
media platforms on this weekend thank
you guys so much for watching as always
leave a like if you enjoy setup wars and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
