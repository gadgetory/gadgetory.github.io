welcome to the very first episode of the
ultimate smart home now a lot of you
guys know that I recently moved into my
new home and I know you guys want to see
house tour and I promise I'll bring one
to you guys I'm just in the process of
still setting up some things as you can
see also while I am setting things up I
thought this would be a pretty cool
opportunity to show off some of the
really cool smart home tech that I
installed and by the way huge things to
LG for not only sponsoring this episode
but hooking me up with some of their
appliances let's go downstairs
alright so this is basically the hallway
slash entrance to my kitchen and living
room but before we go in there if you
look over here on this side you can find
the nest thermostat this is one of my
favorite pieces of tech in fact this is
the first piece of tech I installed when
I moved in what I like about the nest is
the simplicity and the clean look there
aren't millions of buttons I mean it's
just a simple giant button with a screen
and all you have to do is rotate the
shell to adjust the temperature it's
very simple and it's also very
satisfying hearing those clicks so
basically if I push on the thermostat it
gives me more options over here I can
turn on the heater I can switch on the
fan and set a schedule and even access
the settings but I'm gonna be honest
with you guys all this is pointless
believe it or not I haven't even touched
that thing since I've installed it and
that's because I do everything on my
smart phone it's so cool that I can
control the AC from literally anywhere
it's incredible highly recommended I'll
drop links below if you want to check it
out
alright so now that we checked out the
nest thermostat let's move on to my
favorite appliance in my entire home so
ladies and gentlemen this here is LG's
instant view refrigerator and it's one
of the best in its class now normally I
don't get excited about refrigerators
but this thing is packin some pretty
cool tech one of my favorite features of
this refrigerator is the knock twice
feature where you basically knock twice
and you're able to see right through the
fridge that's pretty cool now I don't
know about you guys but I'm one of those
people that opened up the fridge and
just stand there thinking about what I
should eat most of the time I'm not even
hungry and I end up walking away so with
the interview knock twice technology you
can reduce the amount of cold air loss
which helps keep food fresh longer
while that is a pretty convenient and
really great feature to have I tend to
use the door indoor feature a lot more
so check this out guys there are
actually two doors on the right side of
this refrigerator I can open it up
normally by just pulling on the handle
or I can press the button on the handle
and just open up the front door
only that's pretty cool they say the
average household opens the fridge door
15 to 20 times a day which makes sense
to have something like this that not
only gives you easy access to food but
quicker access as well have a super busy
schedule being a youtuber so I find
myself going downstairs constantly
grabbing stuff from the fridge so I make
sure to put the important stuff in the
front whether it's a bottle of water a
quick snack something that's really easy
to reach for those fly by visits LG is
also coming out with a new smart insta
view refrigerator with Alexa voice
enabled and you guys can actually do
some pretty cool stuff with it like play
music or the groceries you can even
check inside the fridge remotely using
your smartphone that's pretty cool in
terms of capacity I mean let's just say
you got storage for days plenty of space
up top and you even get to slidable
trays for this freezer section on the
left side you get a touch panel with the
usual stuff the water and ice dispenser
temperature control and there's even a
filter indicator that will let you know
when it's time to swap the water filter
inside right now you guys can find over
a dozen LG refrigerators with the
award-winning interview feature starting
at 20 199 based on your configurations I
also want to give it props to LG for
having the most extensive range of smart
appliances available today but as always
I drop a link to everything mentioned in
the video down below social secret that
I have a lot of tech here at the
headquarters that I want to protect and
some other valuables of course I mean I
do have one form of protection already
but it's also nice to have protection
while you're away from home and that is
where the blink camera system comes in I
don't know if you guys remember but over
a year ago they actually sponsored a
video of mine on tech stores and ever
since then I've been actually using it
in my home believe it or not absolutely
love it
I keep recommending it to my friends my
family I even bought a pair for my mom
over two weeks ago I think
what I love about the bling cameras is
that it's simple there are no wires
involved no drilling no stupid
subscription that you have to pay for
everything is done straight on your
smartphone the cameras have night vision
flash motion detection there's even a
live video feed I mean it has all the
features you would expect from any
security camera it even sends you
notifications once it detects motion
it's amazing I have one set up in the
living room one in the backyard and one
especially in my garage since that is
where all of my goodies are located and
I'm planning on picking up two more come
here bro I'm gonna show you something
all right guys so this is a laundry room
of my new home obviously it's right next
to the loft and this year is LG's twin
wash that's a good question I did not
tell you to ask me that at all if you
look down here you will see a mini
washer built inside the pedestal I can
use the front washer for larger loads
while I watch custom loads down here at
the same time the side pick is perfect
for those delicate clothes that you
don't want to mix with your main load or
let's say you have some really smelly
gym clothes and you want to wash those
separately
well the sidekick is perfect for that so
not only is the pedestal an extra mini
washer but it also helps lift the entire
washer so that way it's waist tight that
way I'm not constantly bending down to
throw in loads I can simply pop this
open little close in and then close the
door it's very convenient
another thing absolutely love about the
washer and dryer is that they are
extremely quiet I'm gonna start a quick
load and I want to show you guys so you
guys can actually listen how quiet this
is and it's really important to me
because my studio guys has literally
crossed the hallway which I'll show you
in a minute so when I'm recording videos
absolute silence is a must for me so I'm
just gonna set it to a normal cycle and
then I'm gonna hold the start so as it's
warming up guys I'm gonna stand here the
entire time and you can actually hear it
working and you can tell how quiet it is
all right so that's cool and all but why
is it featured in my smart home series
well here's a smart part about it
there's actually an app where you can
download called smart think and not only
can you remotely start the washer using
the app but you can also monitor it at
the same time which is pretty cool I can
also set up push alerts and download
Custom Cycles for let's say sweat stains
baby clothes beach wear and stuff like
that both of the LG dryer and washer
have every possible option listed on
here to get you the perfect wash and dry
every single time it's all surprised
that I own a lot of LG products in my
home from the LG monitor that I use to
edit my YouTube videos to the LG gram
laptop that I always take with me on the
go and the 55 inch nano cell TV I have
in my bedroom and my absolute favorite
of all the 65 inch OLED 4k TV the simple
truth is I like quality and LG makes
quality products their appliances are no
exception and being able to control the
appliances remotely using the smart
think app on your smart phone is one of
the reasons why I use LG in my home it
doesn't matter if it's sponsored or not
guys if the quality of the product is
bad I'm not gonna end up using it in my
home but the pretty much wraps up the
video and the first episode of the
ultimate smart home if you guys enjoyed
it feel free to toss ain't like you guys
didn't feel free to dislike as well as
long as you leave some sort of feedback
again I want to give a huge thing so LG
for sending up the appliances it's
sponsoring this video everything I
mentioned in this video will be linked
below as always things again for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
