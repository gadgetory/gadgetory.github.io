welcome back to another keyboard video
but unlike the ones I've done in the
past this one is going to be in the
premium price range coming in at just
$100 it will be interesting to see what
we get for the extra money over
something like the $25 Jellicoe
mechanical keyboard I looked at not too
long ago I'll drop a link below in case
you guys missed that video so it comes
in two variants the blue switch model
that I have here as well as one with red
switches inside the box we get a key cap
remover as well as extra silicon caps
that are orange
I do enjoy the contrast between orange
and black so I kept them on just for
this video it comes with a 6 foot cable
that extends out the back edge and it is
graded for that extra durability on the
back we find rubberized feet which look
open to the side a benefit of this
design is that they won't fold clothes
when moving the keyboard around there
are quick functions built into the
keyboards memory but they are not
labeled which is my first problem with
this keyboard they did include a guide
to the functions however and after a
week I kind of memorized all the
commands that I regularly use on a daily
basis like the media controls we can
also program our own commands in the
downloadable software or you guys can
even change the existing ones which is
probably why they didn't label them but
I still would have preferred to have an
extra set of key caps with these box
functions labeled on it after all I am
paying around $100 bills keyboards the
metal top plate is brushed aluminum and
it is exposed at the top of the keyboard
this in conjunction with the lower
plastic section of the frame helps
support and stabilize the body overall
it's very solid and I wouldn't worry
about any damages in the future if you
end up dropping stuff on it so the lower
section also incorporates channels that
guide liquid out of the body that's
pretty interesting there's also a nano
coating over the PCB that repels water
with these two features it's safe to say
that this keyboard is water resistant
VLK Biltz which is optical and this
enables a point two millisecond response
time combined that with the three
millimeter of key travel distance and
you get a keyboard that feels quicker
than most keyboards out there and being
optical switches they can't be damaged
by any liquid because the actual light
is registering the input the sound is
very similar to the Cherry MX Blues but
for lack of better word
it feels softer the keys are rated for a
million clicks further adding to the
already great durability of the product
the key dominator software really pulls
everything in with a Marriott's of
features and customization that can be
accessed by the user we get seven
built-in profiles in the bun tab which
can be user customized with any key
combination possible in the RGB
animation tab are presented with ten RGB
presets as well as the function key
combinations that activate them we get
ultimate control here as well with
options to change each color a magnitude
of effects and even the ability to
import and export config files something
unique that I haven't really seen
anywhere else is the ability to change
the keys color when pressed making for a
cool effect through the micro tab we can
assign a key to do anything with nuances
like user specified the light input we
also get the option of importing and
exporting this data into either of the
computer's memory or the keyboards own
internal memory really fine-tuning the
micro command has actually sped up our
productivity
we can now accomplish simple tasks with
one click instead of running through
multiple program menus we get all the
software expected with premium hardware
like this but with more nuance
customizations that we don't see on some
of the other mainstream options writing
scripts was enjoyable but when a
keyboard really shines is in gaming it's
very sturdy with a braided cable we also
got water resistance and solid
construction making this keyboard last
much longer than others the price is
steep at $100 especially considering the
very capable and much cheaper
competition out there but if you guys
want the best and won't settle for
anything less this is definitely a
strong competitor in the premium price
range
my overall rating is 8 out of 10 thank
you guys so much for watching I'll drop
a link to the keyboard down below if you
want to check it out I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
