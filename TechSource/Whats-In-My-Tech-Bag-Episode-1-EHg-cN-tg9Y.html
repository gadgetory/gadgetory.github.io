to make a what's in my tech bag video so
after reading all the comments I'm just
kidding I made that up as an excuse to
make this video nonetheless these are my
tech items that I carry with me wherever
I go whether it's to a CES event or to
my grandma's house I must have these
tech items with me at all times
let's get started starting off the video
we have the Bluetooth keyboard with a
magnetic case by new Lexi I actually
featured this in my recent cool tech
video for December and ever since then
I've been taking it with me everywhere
the case folds itself into a kickstand
which are held together by strong
magnets and turns any tablet into a
laptop hybrid the keyboard is awesome
its clicky with amazing feedback and has
zero lag while typing I do have slightly
larger hands but after using it for a
few hours the spacing between the keys
don't bother me at all the tablet I'm
using is the iPad air 2 which was custom
painted by the dudes at color ware and
they did a phenomenal job with it I did
up for the matte black finish with a
glossy red Apple logo to match my color
scheme and they even do custom
engravings if I want something with more
power I bust up my LG gram 14 which I
also did a review on a few months ago
it's a 14 inch 1080p laptop with an i5
5200 CPU eight gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigabytes of SSD space carrying my gh4
around would be absurd which is why I
carry the next best thing my sony mark 4
this is the camera I use for my vlogs on
the channel and it shoots some seriously
crispy 4k footage in a small compact
form factor combine that with a badass
mini tripod for Manfrotto and you have
the ultimate run-and-gun setup so that's
video for audio I carry the popular h5
zoom recorder with me and it's currently
one of the best portable recording
devices you can buy here's a quick
sample of me talking directly into the
h5 zoom without any editing
here's a quick audio sample from three
feet in front of the h5 zoom without any
editing it records the sound file onto
an SD card which I then insert into the
transcend USB 3 SD card reader and then
I plug that into the laptop to transfer
the audio files
keep the SD card reader in my little
carrying case for my external hard drive
I also carry a few other things in the
other pocket like my 128 gigabyte USB
3.0 flash drive from SanDisk
a pair align lightning cable from anchor
and of course my one terabyte external
hard drive I also carry a wireless
gaming mouse that I picked up for around
five bucks and the only reason why I
don't carry my Logitech MX master mouse
is because it doesn't come with a slot
that I can use to carry the receiver
which is extremely disappointing I
almost lost it a few times before since
I don't have a dedicated place for it
but this $5.00 wireless gaming mouse not
only has a slot for the receiver but it
works great without any complaints for
headphones I usually carry around to
majority of the time I use my m50x says
when I'm using my laptop but sometimes
go wireless when I'm watching a movie or
listening to music on my iPad I actually
did a review on the so drop Bluetooth
headphones on our channel as well if
anyone is interested to keep on my
devices juiced up I use the anchor power
cord 10050 million power charger which
is easily my favorite power bank that
i've ever used it charges things fast
it's powered by Qualcomm's quick charge
2.0 which means that you will always get
the fastest charge possible for your
devices I also have a backup wall
charger from anchor as well to not only
do sup my power bank when needed but
charge multiple devices for emergencies
this wall charger also comes with IQ
charging meaning you will deliver the
fastest charge possible as well last but
not least I don't go anywhere let alone
sleep without having my phone on me the
reason I'm showing my phone is to tell
you about the case I've been using and I
get asked a lot about it this is the
virus dam the case which I featured in
my top 5 iPhone 6 cases but the reason
why I ditched my premium and expensive
Ventor 6 aluminum bumper case for this
is simply because I hate carrying my
wallet around I like to keep as few
items as possible with me and that's
what a damn the case comes in it has a
card slot which can fit up to 3 cards
which eliminates my need to carry around
a wallet I just keep my driver license
on my debit card on me that's basically
all I need it also provides excellent
protection now it is a bit bulky
especially since I have a giant 6s plus
but the trade-off is 100% worth it for
me so before I go I want to say
something real quick guys making videos
like these are never easy despite how it
looks and fun
as a content creator I always look for
other sources to integrate in my videos
to make my job a lot easier and less
stressful from finding great music to
use in the background or using special
effects or just some pretty sweet b-roll
video blocks does just that you get
access to over 115,000 studio-quality HD
videos from after effect templates
motion backgrounds and more there's even
a marketplace so if you get shoot video
you can actually sign up and submit your
b-roll to the website and earn 100
percent commission for anyone that's
interested in spicing up their videos
you can actually try them out for 50%
off the first year and all the details
will be listed down below for you guys
but that's for the video if you guys
enjoyed it make sure to hit that like
button and as always I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
