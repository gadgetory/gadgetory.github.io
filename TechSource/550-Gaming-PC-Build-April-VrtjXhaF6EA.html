welcome to April's PC build this is volt
the $550 gaming PC winning an FX 6300
and an r7 370 it's also rocking the MSI
gaming 970 motherboard eight gigabytes
of RAM from crucial and one terabyte of
hard drive space from Seagate powering
all of these components is none other
than the 500 watt power supply from EVGA
and everything is packed inside the raid
max 403 case the reason why I spend
$20.00 more on the motherboard and went
with the MSI gaming 970 was to
future-proof this PC build and for only
$20 it just made sense
I also planned on overclocking which is
why I went with the Evo 212 CPU cooler I
actually managed to overclock the 6300
all the way to 4.3 gigahertz with stable
temps if you guys want to save 50 bucks
and don't plan on overclocking as much
then you can buy a cheaper motherboard
and skip the CPU cooler altogether which
will bring the total cost of this build
down to 500 bucks I'm going to drop a
link to a cheaper motherboard down below
along with the rest of the parts
mentioned in this video I normally have
step-by-step guides on how to build a PC
for my budget builds but unfortunately
this month I'm running out of time so I
won't be able to do one in fact the PC I
built for December has practically the
same exact steps so if you guys want to
buy the parts and build this exact same
PC I suggest you to watch that build
guide which I will have linked below for
the flashback benchmark volts cord a
50,000 seventy-three putting it right
above the December build and for
additional benchmarks of temperatures
feel free to check out my google drive
link below but without wasting any more
time let's jump into the gaming
benchmark
you
you
so that will do it for the video if you
guys enjoy my monthly PC bills make sure
to leave a like as it does help support
the channel a ton and make sure you guys
are following me on my Twitter and
Instagram
if you guys want sneak peeks on my next
month's ultimate PC bill thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
