Dennis Jay keys Matthew and Felix
congratulations for making it on the
show
also guys and I'm talking about budget
setups I'm talking about people that
don't have multi-monitor setups and
$3,000 gaming PCs and stuff like that
a budget is essentially a any type of
budget really you can have a budget of
$1,000 you have a budget of $2,000 but
these are pretty much so all the setups
in this episode our budget setups
according to me so here people always
commenting down below that's not a
budget set up this dude has a gtx 970 or
whatever so to me it is a budget setup
it's not crazy enough to be a expensive
setup so that's that's the mentality I'm
going with so anyways I hope you guys
enjoy your show let's start the first
set up kind of looks like a miniature
version of the IKEA mom desk I honestly
don't know why it looks smaller than
normal but anyways dennis is using the
25 inch HP Pavilion monitor a kiss on
gaming keyboard paired with the Logitech
g600 Mouse other than the PC the only
other things on the desk are an iPhone
stand and some type of glass ball which
looks pretty cool excellent work with
cable management looks like all the
wires are inside the rack so no
complaints here and also down here are
two pairs of beats solo headphones
finally we have the PC which looks like
it's built inside the fractal defying s
case and it's rocking the i5 6600 K and
an RX 480
I'm not really sure how Superman is
hovering inside the case like this but I
like it it's a cool way to spice up your
build but overall a very solid budget
gaming setup Thank You Dennis for
entering at number 2 we have J and a
very clean white and black setup
featuring the IKEA lemon tabletop and
Alex your units on the Alex add-on unit
he's rocking the Samsung 28 inch 4k
monitor which he has hooked up to his
2014 Mac Mini that's being stored in one
of the drawers underneath he also
managed to keep his setup symmetrical so
we have a pair of Logitech z3 23
speakers on the sides and we also have a
blue Yeti microphone and Satechi
headphones he also went wireless using
the common Apple keyboard and MX master
combo just like most Mac setups I've
seen although I think the massive desk
pad is a bit overkill for such a tiny
keyboard and mouse no complaints for
cable management then again you don't
really have that many wires to begin
with what we're all a very clean and
organized productivity setup Thank You
Jay for entering speaking of white and
black setups Keys is up next
I mean this guy's air conditioner is
also white job well done however this
time instead of a Mac he has a custom PC
instead which by the way has a 6700 K
and an asus strix 1080 okay maybe that's
a little bit over a budget but still so
the corner desk is put together using
IKEA lemon table tops some Alex drawers
and the June table legs I think I said
you say it overall I think it came out
nicely so on the top of the add-on unit
we have a 24 inch Samsung monitor in the
middle of Logitech Z 5,000 speakers and
the keyboard of choice is the cursor k95
with the white LEDs and he's also using
the Logitech G 700 s Mouse both of which
are on top of the Q pad extra large
mouse pad it also looks like he has an
Xbox one underneath the riser as well
and I kind of talked about this on the
last episode but slap some skins on that
bad boy it will look a hundred times
better cable management is also under
control we got two IKEA signals holding
up the cables and it looks like he
mounted the power strip and router under
the table with some 3m tape I don't
think I've ever seen anyone else so
dedicated to keeping consistent with a
set ups color scheme this guy's 3d
printer is also in white and black Wow
in all seriousness I would have gone
with the black wall shelves instead here
so there's some contrast in your room
you never want to overlap two of the
same colors together for example white
acoustic foams and black shelves would
have looked so much better in this room
and definitely complement the setup much
better but I don't really have any major
complaints you did a really good job
with this setup thank you for entering I
feel like Matthew setup fits perfectly
in this budget edition because he
custom-made some drawers out of
cardboard for his books and even a
hanger for his MacBook I guess while
we're down here we can take a look at
the cable management and it doesn't seem
that bad the only thing I would grab is
maybe a cable box to keep that power
strip
but otherwise not bad on the surface he
is using a 24 inch Acer monitor a linky
BlackWidow keyboard and a Razer
DeathAdder chroma Mouse it also looks
like he made a custom hangar for his ATM
58 phones and another hangar for one of
his bags I think that's what it looks
like Mathi was definitely resourceful
and he put together a nice setup Thank
You Matthew for entering last but not
least we have Felix and it looks like
he's made some improvements from last
time first major difference is the table
looks like he finally got a real desk he
also mounted his 24-inch Pankiw monitor
on the wall and made some custom speaker
stands which also has a headphone hangar
that's pretty impressive for audio he
has a sony MDR s hooked up to the muse
mk2 amplifier as well as a pair of JBL
control 1 speakers cable management has
also been improved it looks like he
picked up some Signum racks to help with
that and finally he built his very own
PC which was a huge upgrade from his
laptop it's packing a 40 170 and a ZOTAC
GTX 650 Ti overall a huge improvement
from before congrats on your new set of
felix and thank you again for entering
that is it for this episode as always
make sure you guys drop your comments
down below and vote on who you think has
the best desk setup let's see if you get
this video to 50,000 likes guys that
will be awesome thank you so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
