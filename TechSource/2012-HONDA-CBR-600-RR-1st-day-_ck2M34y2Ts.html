on the CBR 600 I just got about 30
minutes ago brand new from the dealer
delivered to me so psyched about this
bike I can't wait to test-drive it

I love this color choice I'm called at
least six dealers only one of them had a
left and I rushed over that paid cash
pick it up I ordered a few mods on it
I'm going to get the flush mounts get
those are place that we're going to
fender eliminator kit I'm not gonna get
an exhaust yet and wait six months and
then get one installed
what else did I get
oh and an integrated taillight system
just going to be added right there John

means
 amazing I can't wait to drive
the ship tomorrow alright so I just woke
up
I barely any sleep yesterday I was
taking about my bike the entire night
call me crazy but I don't care I have an
emotional value attached to my
motorcycles
I don't be able to understand that but
I'm gonna take this out for a job today
I'm gonna drive to my cousin's first so
you can videotape me driving because I
can't pick myself do you want to show
you is my gear process actually there
about the bike the Joe rocket UFO 2.0
balloon researching for about a week and
it's the best one I found that matches
my bike and the material textile I
prefer textile then another because
can't really move another this one has a
lot of them for freedom and I just love
the material it's great got a pretty
good deal I got I got it for 200 bucks
usually it's a lot more than that happen
oh that's my leather one it's built I
really like using down widgets but you
have a mushroom to move in there it's my
show a helmet fine a helmet shows the
way you go the best of the best I love
this design is amazing

installing them do you just leave a
comment below and tell me which ones you
want me to make a video on I'm going to
be getting the flush mounts the turn
signals replace those I'm going to be
getting an integrated taillight system
with the trans signals on there to find
their eliminator kit and I'm gonna be
getting wind scripts or stripes and I'm
my head on the rim they're either red or
black I haven't decided yet but I'm
probably gonna be putting a red one
