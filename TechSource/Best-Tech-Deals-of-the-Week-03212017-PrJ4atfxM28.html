yes I know I need a shave it's just been
it's been a while life kind of got in
the way and some of the things anyways
no you don't need to know about that
nonsense I still haven't done best tech
deals of the week in like since last
year to be honest usually this is done
every single Tuesday but I kind of just
don't see the point of doing it every
single week because my website deal
source text I always does that
continuously every single day there's
like 12,000 of you guys checking the
website every single day so that's I
figured do you guys like the website so
there's really no point in doing these
but once in a while I've come in and
I'll come in once in a while I'll drop
by and I'll make a video because I came
across some pretty cool tech deals so
yeah so to expect this every Tuesday
you guys can always find these deals on
my website but once in a while I'll drop
by anyway some time talking about side
with system deals so starting off with
some awesome deals on the horizon 7 GPUs
first up is the 1800 x8 core processor
that's going for four hundred and sixty
dollars I'm not sure who's smoking on
the good stuff and putting an original
price at a thousand when that is clearly
not the case the retail on this thing is
only $500 so you're getting a foiler
discount if you buy from ebay by the way
this also comes with their rate by our
cooler moving down a ladder we got these
1,700 going for only 300 dollars so
you're saving $30 in the process also
this does come with the right fire
cooler as well speaking of processors
the 7700 K dipped down in price once
again to $310 it's always fluctuates
between 350 which is the original price
and 310 so that's basically in under $40
in savings but it's sold more than 75%
stocks so be sure to jump on this
if you've wanted to buy this for a while
now here's a pretty sweet deal on the
galaxy s7 32 gigabyte version for
Verizon it's going for $370 and it's an
excellent condition but keep in mind
that it is a refurbished smartphone
speaking of refurbished the Wii U 32
gigabyte deluxe bundle with the new
tender lamb is selling for $100 less
than retail if you don't mind the
refurbished label apparently 10000
people been in mind either way it's
still a pretty good deal so for my
content creators out there the sony a7r
2's price got lowered by 870 dollars Wow
this is a perfect camera for making high
quality videos especially
in 4k resolution and it's one of the
best DSLRs with low-light performance we
got both HyperX cloud gaming headsets on
sale as well the first one is going for
60 bucks and it's refurbished in
excellent condition let me remind you
and the second one is the original
that's going for twenty dollars less
once again it is refurbished as well but
both of these are amazing headsets and
they're selling like crazy the last two
deals on eBay are TVs now the first one
is quite possibly the cheapest 65 inch
curved 4k Smart TV that I've seen online
I mean this thing is almost two thousand
dollars off right now and it's sold more
than 81 percent stock I'm personally not
a fan of curved TVs but if that's your
thing you should definitely check this
out
here's another 65 inch curved TV but
it's from Samsung and holy hell look at
those bezels this TV is practically
bezel if you are paying a bit more than
a sharp tv that we just saw but you are
getting a reputable brand of TV with
extremely thin bezels I also don't think
you can get a thinner than that
switching over to Amazon it looks like
they're doing a gold box deals a day on
tons of awesome tech up to 30% off we
got keyboards headset coolers mice and a
bunch of accessories I'm not going to go
over them but I'll drop a link to this
page if you guys want to check them out
so as I'm editing this video I just
realized that these two tech products
are actually going to expire very soon
and they were actually featured on the
website they also saw tech as I keep
saying and this is actually a really
good example that deals like this come
and go frequently every single day and
they're only available for like a few
hours or even a day at most so so I
guess I'm trying to say is if you have a
few seconds of time available each day
or maybe a week just check back on the
website because you might come across
these limited time offers or limited
time deals once in a while on the
website so first up on Amazon is the
popular MX master mouse which is going
for $60 and it's still currently one of
the best wireless productive mice on the
market final fantasy 15 dropped in price
to $35 which sucks because I bought this
came back in November for $60 speaking
of buying tech at full price my G 900
Spectrum I also went on sale yesterday
dipping down to one hundred and fifteen
dollars I honestly love this mouse to
death and I can't stop recommending it
if you're building a PC and are looking
for a CD key and don't trust Reddit and
one of
I went officially then now you can at a
discounted price of $100
normally when those 10 Pro goes for 140
so you are saving a solid $40 not bad
speaking of building pcs MSI's z170a
motherboard is going for 125 bucks which
is an awesome deal if you're looking for
an unlocked chipset motherboard to do
some overclocking driving over the
Newegg we've got the rx 460 for $70
after a mail-in rebate and that is
pretty much the cheapest 460 I have seen
anywhere if you don't mind the Mellen
rebate speaking the PC parts next up is
the captain - 40 X CPU cooler from deep
cool which is also going for seven
dollars with a mail-in rebate where
normally it would cost you $90 are you
saving around 20 bucks for this the last
night of my new egg is also a CPU cooler
but more on the budget side we got the
popular coarser age 50 cooler going for
only 50 bucks after a $10 mail in rebate
I mean it's close on Amazon for $60 so
you're only saving $10 but savings is
still fading and then we got a new egg
flash first up is a samsung 500 gigabyte
SSD going for only 170 dollars that is
an absolute steal and several extended
mouse pads for you guys only for $10
each you can even pick one to match your
setup since they have a bunch of colors
to choose from I'll link all of them
down below not a bad deal so that is it
for this episode of best tech deals of
the week if you guys enjoyed it and
found a pretty cool textview let me know
in the comment section what you're going
to pick up anything and also make sure
you guys check my website deal source
tech because that does get updated
continuously throughout the day for US
UK Canada and even Germany I know I keep
saying that I know you guys really like
the website because there's 12,000 users
every single day so anyways thank you so
much for watching I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
