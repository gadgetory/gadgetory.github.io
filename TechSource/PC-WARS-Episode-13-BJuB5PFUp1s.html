said welcome to PC wars episode 13 where
you submit your custom PC to get
featured on the channel so if you have a
badass rig and want to get featured on
tech Saurus make sure to watch the video
linked below what I was thinking at a
time let the PC wars begin
never pay full price for games ever
again guys g2a offers the cheapest
cd-keys you can find anywhere check them
out by clicking on the link below as
always you guys can find the full specs
to their pcs linked below
but here are your five contestants for
this week we have Dijon Dennis Mike
Spencer and Tim that's gonna start the
show so starting off strong we have the
mother of all mods Dee Jenn's nature
build called ivy I do not this is an
actual PC with real leaves in it so it's
running on a 4690k a gigabyte gtx 970
and probably even some fossil fuel i
actually don't think there's a single
part in this build
that's not modded from the fans to the
radiators RAM sticks motherboard and
even the reservoir has a nature theme I
don't know about you guys but this PC
definitely gave me some wood a few the
modifications I like are the green LEDs
that show through the vixa RAM sticks
the amazing front panel that shows off
the reservoir and finally the
spray-painted and camouflaged
motherboard that pretty much looks
hidden I'm honestly stumped by the
amazing attention to detail honestly if
you ask me I think that ivy would be a
great contender for the best PC of 2016
it doesn't even stop there apparently
his gaming gear is also modded in some
of nature's goodness keyboard mouse pad
headphone and even the headphone stand
I mean I'm speechless I don't know what
else to say other than thank you for
sharing this amazing PC with us but I'll
leave it to you guys to judge the PC
alright so leaving Wonderland we have
Dennis and his PC called sunrise a black
and red water-cooled beast running a
6600 k overclock to 4.5 gigahertz and an
AMD r9 fury X you know I'll ever get
tired of seeing water-cooled builds
inside tiny ITX cases major props for
pulling this off Dennis the effects
around makes its second appearance in
this episode with a total of 16 gigs for
sunrise and an asus z170 i pro gaming
motherboard cable management is also
spot-on but overall a very solid ITX
water-cooled build with no complaints
Thank You Dennis for entering and number
three we have Mike with dual 9 ATT is
6,700 K and an H 100 IG TX cooler packed
inside the Zalman h1 case this is easily
one of the best non modded pcs I've seen
on PC Wars there's no special sli bridge
or custom sleeves just pure power with
exceptional cable management job well
done Mike and thank you for entering
keeping the train going we have Spencer
with great big wombo plus one on that
name now even though it's a black and
red bill that's a hell of a gorgeous one
at that really love the simple and
elegant look of this that doesn't seem
to be a lot going on and I like that the
great big wombo is rocking a 6600 K and
a single gtx 980ti with an e kwb Titan X
backplate dat thing looks dope
judging by the background that all that
snow was a water-cooled build necessary
where you live I also want to take this
time and thank Spencer for taking his pc
outside to get these awesome shots not
much else to say a very beautiful build
Thank You Spencer for entering finishing
off the episode strong we have Tim and
red power which is a red and black build
and yes there is a difference between
black and red and red and black
the dominant color is always first in
Tim's case this is a red and black build
whereas mine is a black and red build so
we have a 59 30 K overclock to 4.4 and
to Titan X's in SLI with 64 gigabytes of
RAM talk about overkill Excel or work
with cable management that I'll give you
a point for going with the sleeved
cables but I'm not so sure about the
case you are using since you didn't list
that in the notes if any of you guys can
guess what Casey is using I will give
you some brownie points to be honest I'm
not a fan of the tubing but overall red
power is one clean looking PC that kicks
ass thank you Tim for entering but that
will do it for this episode of PC wars
