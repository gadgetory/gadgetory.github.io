we're gonna look at an awesome case from
vessel well technically it's a bumper
case and what's so special about this is
the fact that it's made out of wood and
metal so inside the sleek packaging you
get the wood series bumper case a tool
needed for the installation that you can
also attach to your keys it also comes
with a quick installation guide and a
unique certification from vessel along
with a very huge branded microfiber
cloth and some extra screws now the
vessel case I picked up is the frozen
titanium and walnut combination but it
also comes in frozen brilliant silver
and oak along with a few other
combinations be sure to check out the
link in the description section for more
details
now what sets this case apart from other
wooden cases is the premium look and
feel the top and bottom of the vessel
wood series is made out of solid
aluminum while the sides come in either
walnut or oak finished with brushed oil
so the quality is definitely there now
the installation is really simple as you
would have expected all you need to do
is remove the screws on the top and pull
out the metal piece and slide in your
iPhone then you put back the top metal
piece and screw it in it's that easy now
it's obvious that this case won't offer
your iPhone full protection but it will
protect it if it were to drop on its
side the wood series also offers a small
lip around the case which protects the
front and back of the phone and also
provides a solution to the protruding
camera problem most case companies just
can't seem to get the button
functionality right oftentimes it would
be hard or inconvenient to press but
vessel has done an amazing job with its
slightly protruding aluminum buttons
making it really comfortable pressing
the case also has accurate cutouts for
the headphone jack charging port and
speakers I gotta say the case feels
really good in the hand the wood and
aluminum pieces really work together to
bring a premium feel you should expect
for a premium device what's also great
is that vessel guarantees 100% that the
case won't interfere with signal loss so
overall a really solid wood and metal
case probably the best I've seen yet for
an iPhone and I will leave links down
below if you guys want to check them out
and I also leave a discount code that
you guys can use to knock down the price
a little bit anyways this is that from
tech stores
and I'll see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
