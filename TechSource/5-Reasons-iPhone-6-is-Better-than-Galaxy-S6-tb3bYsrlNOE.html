One m9 that's sponsored by cell cashier
com they compare iPhone prices on the
internet and give you a quick quote and
the most cash for your iPhone
what's up guys it's I from tech source
and in this video I will be giving you
five solid reasons why the iPhone 6 plus
is better than the Galaxy S six now if
you missed my previous video on 10
reasons why the Galaxy S six is better
than the iPhone 6 then I will leave a
link to that in the description section
down below so the first reason why the 6
plus is better than the Galaxy at 6 is
because of iMessage now for those of you
that have used iMessage before then you
know what I'm talking about but I
message is such a great feature on the
iPhone and mainly people got so used to
it that they don't want to switch to an
Android phone because of it it makes
texting and sending pictures videos and
even voice messages really easy and
quickly no matter what carrier both the
iPhones are on not only do you not need
to have any data on your iPhone but you
can also send messages from any Apple
device including their tablets and
computers second reason is that Apple
continuously pushes updates
unlike Android updates which tend to
happen months later iOS updates are
almost immediate and consistent to give
you the best possible user experience
third reason is app optimization there
is no denying that the iPhone has the
best optimization when it comes to apps
they want very smoothly and efficiently
compared to most Android phones there
are rarely any lag or crashes associated
when playing games or even using the
apps the fourth reason is that the
iPhone 6 has slow motion at 240 FPS
compared to the galaxy s6 which is only
at 120 fps there is no other smartphone
out there with this feature and I think
it's something definitely nice to have
the fifth and final reason is
accessories now whether you like to
admit it or not but the iPhone is the
most popular phone out there and because
of that there are lots of accessories
available for them from cases to gadgets
and even third-party equipment will be
available on the iPhone before it's
available on any other Android device
well there you have it five reasons why
the iPhone 6 is better than the Galaxy S
six if you agree with my reasons then

didn't feel free to dislike and let me
