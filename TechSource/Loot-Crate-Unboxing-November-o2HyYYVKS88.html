text source I'm actually doing something
a little different on my channel
something I've never done before I'm
gonna be in boxing the first ever loot
crate and for those you guys I don't
know what that is it's basically a
subscription service that sends you a
box aka loot crate every single month
with a bunch of really cool stuff they
even have limited edition crates that
are available sometimes right now they
have one for black ops 3 star wars and
even one for my anime fans out there you
always get something new each month and
they are partnered with a lot of big
companies to get you exclusive products
but for this month I'm gonna be checking
out the November is loot crate and for
those of you guys are interested in
checking them out I'll drop a link down
below alright so let's get to the
unboxing of this popping open the flap
we are immediately greeted with some
shades shredder shades to be exact which
is basically some purple glasses hooked
up to a plastic crown here's one for any
teenage mutant ninja turtles fan next up
is the cute but deadly figures from
blizzard entertainment there are
actually a few different figurines you
can collect but I got 02 and mine what I
love about these loot crate says that
they always pack in a bunch of cool
stuff so there's a good chance that
there are some things in here that
everyone would enjoy like this vault boy
bobblehead this is definitely something
that fallout fans would appreciate the
quality of these products are also
amazing it really do pay attention to
detail so moving on to the other stuff
they also included a mockingjay pin from
the blockbuster movie franchise The
Hunger Games and by the way all of the
items that each loop crates are valued
way above the actual cost that you are
paying for them each month in addition
to the little figures I also receive a
2d graphic of some of the iconic
characters from the blizzard games you
have Illidan deathwing Arthur's Diablo
terial some zergling and whatever that
is in the form of a magnet you also get
a newsletter from loot crate showing
other products prizes and other cool
info lastly I received a small button
for the November theme and a pretty
sweet Street Fighter comic book after
all the theme is combat but like I said
every month is different and you always
get more than what you pay for so there
you have it the November's loot crate a
bunch of really cool stuff that brings
out your inner geek all these items are
exclusive so you won't find them
anywhere else so I'll definitely give
them a try guys I'm sure it's something
you look forward to unboxing every
single month
but I'll drop a link down below if
anyone is interested as always thank you
so much for watching and I will see you
in the next video it's actually pretty
cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
