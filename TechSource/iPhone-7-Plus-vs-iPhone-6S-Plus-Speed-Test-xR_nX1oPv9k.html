and in this video we're gonna be doing a
detailed speed test and benchmark
comparison between the iPhone 7 plus and
the iPhone 6s plus so we are going to
dig in boot time web browsing benchmark
results and more so with all that said
I'm done let's get into this spec list
the iPhone 7 plus is rocking the 810
chipset with the m10 motion coprocessor
whereas the 6s plus has last year's a
night architecture with the a9 chip the
7 plus also edges out the 6s plus with
an extra gig of ram totaling three gigs
when it comes to display resolution and
PPI both devices have a 5.5 inch 1080p
panel with 401 pixels per inch the big
difference on the spec list is the
camera so make sure you guys check out
my camera comparison between these
devices and I'll drop a link to them
down below in case you were wondering
both devices are rockin AD band skin so
if you are interested in picking one up
the link will be in the description
section so getting to the speed test the
first thing we're going to do is power
off both devices and see the booth times
we also made sure both devices are
connected to the same Wi-Fi network so
with that being said sit back and enjoy
the show
so as you guys can tell from the
comparison as expected these seven plus
did thrive in the benchmarks but some of
the results are actually very surprising
despite the success plus being last year
is hard where it actually edges out
these seven plus and some regards this
could very well be a matter of software
optimization and could be reflected in a
software update so that will do it for
my comparison and benchmark test between
both of these phones if you guys enjoy
the video make sure to leave a like and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
