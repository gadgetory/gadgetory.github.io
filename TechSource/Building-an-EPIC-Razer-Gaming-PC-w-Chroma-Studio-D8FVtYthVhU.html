source and today we are building an epic
Razer theme the gaming PC inside the new
Leonie 11 dynamic razor case some of
this razor gear is also gonna be given
away at the end of this video including
the case so if you guys want to enter
make sure to stick around Lili is also
having a promotion on their new razor
case and I'll drop a link below if you
guys want to check that out but yeah
what that said let's begin I want to
give you two things to read for
sponsoring today's video raid Shadow
Legends is the most ambitious RPG game
of 2019 and it's gonna change everything
it's the most immersive experience you
will find on a smartphone it's got all
the features you'd expect from a brand
new RPG title like an amazing storyline
awesome 3d graphics giant boss fights
PvP battles and hundreds of champions to
collect and customize I mean just look
at the level of details on these
champions the game is free to play and
as an upcoming special launch tournament
with crazy in-game prizes and a
real-life physical prize pack so go to
the description section and download
raid using my link to get 50,000 silver
immediately and a free epic champion as
part of the new player program so the
processor we're going with is the 9900
k-8 core 16th red coffee Lake processor
and we're gonna pair that with the old
mighty MSI Duke RTX 20 atti
pooling the 9900 k4 now is the courser h
150 pro rgba io the reason why it's
temporary because after this build I'm
actually going to convert this PC into a
fully custom modded water-cooled build
so that's gonna be fun the motherboard
we're going with is the MSI godlike
since that is what you guys voted in the
comments section of the unboxing video
after all this is a high-end build so
why not go with the best that MSI has to
offer we're gonna occupy all four dimm
slots with a quad channel kit from jail
we got 32 gigs of the super loose or GB
RAM sticks at 2400 megahertz for storage
we are adding a single m2 the 97 Evo
from Samsung however we are adding two
additional SSDs for a raid 0
configuration you guys might be
wondering why and my simple answer is
purely for aesthetics because the
Lindley razor case has two SSD trays
the bottom so I do want to occupy those
mainly because we have some awesome SSD
covers from v1 tech that I want to show
off so yeah purely aesthetic reasons
we're not actually gonna even use any of
the storage other than downloading games
on there to benchmark powering the
entire build is a fully modular gold
certified power supply from Corsair we
got the HX 850 and of course everything
is going inside a newly released Lindley
o 11 dynamic razor edition with tempered
glass panels a Razer logo in the front
and addressable RGB lighting we do have
some extra mods to spice a build like an
RGB backplate from v1 tech that has the
Razer logo in the center of course we
have some custom cable extensions and a
set of 120 millimeter fan grills with
the UV green Razer logo in the center a
lot of people are not into the fan
grills but I personally like it I think
it's I think an add some spice to the
build but yeah anyways okay let's not
drop that but yeah these are pretty much
all the parts I'm gonna be using in the
build I will be custom painting the case
itself and adding extra mods in the
water pool build so make sure you guys a
notification is enabled for that it's
gonna be an epic video of course but you
guys know what time it is it's time to
zip it cue the music
and let you guys enjoy this montage
all right so the PC is finally complete
and I think it looks pretty sick if I
say so myself the custom mods really
spiced up the build and I personally
think the fangirls were a great addition
because the fans on the side here are
used as intake blowing cold air inside
the case which means that I had to mount
them backwards and the fan grills help
cover up the sticker and the cables the
rest of the lighting from the SSD cover
is the GPU backplate light up the PC
beautifully and I couldn't be more happy
with the way it turned out I'm gonna
save the gaming benchmarks when I
convert this into a water-cooled PC but
what I want to focus on in this video is
the RGB lighting as you can see I built
a quick setup using some Razer gear we
got the huntsmen elite gaming keyboard
the Mamba elite chroma gaming mouse and
the Goliath extended RGB gaming mouse
pad I did set the lighting to solid
green right now which blends perfectly
with the color scheme of the build but
we're not really taking advantage of the
chroma lighting you could do so much
more with it which is why I'm gonna
spice it up a bit so it's not looking so
bland I'm gonna be using Razer synapse
to control the lighting on the Razer
gear connected including the case since
it is a Razer Edition so let's go ahead
and check it out alright so once you
open up Razer synapse on the top here
you'll see the list of your devices
we've got the mouse pad Mouse case and
the keyboard also down here on their
modules you can control your macros you
can even control the lighting from
Philips U so if you have a Philips u RGB
bulb or even an RGB strip on your desk
you can control and sync the lighting
through here as well which is pretty
cool and on the left over here we have
chroma studio alright so let's go into
chroma Studio and on here you guys can
see all the devices we have connected
and over here is where we can customize
the lighting if you want to change the
lighting on all the connected devices
you can either use the mouse and just
drag over everything or go up here and
click on everything then you can come
over here and select any color you want
from the color wheel or set any presets
which you can also customize yourself so
let's say if you find a color you want
you can just come down here hit the plus
sign and it'll save automatically down
here after all that just hit save and
you can see everything changed to that
selected color now obviously we're gonna
keep everything green just to match the
color scheme of the build but we're
gonna add an effect because if you like
solid color is a little bland
so we're gonna try and spice things up a
bit so I'm gonna go down here and add an
effect I just give you guys an example
we're gonna go with spectrum cycling
we're gonna go up here and delete static
because this is layered so I'm gonna
delete that and then I'm gonna select
everything and save as you guys can see
it's gonna cycle through all the colors
slowly you can even control the speed
over here on the top right what's really
cool about chroma studio is a level of
customization that gives you so you can
not only control the entire strip but
you can control individual sections of
that RGB script so let's say for example
I'm gonna do every other section just to
kind of give you guys a demonstration
I'm gonna do blue and then save so as
you guys can see here every other
section of that strip is gonna be blue
same thing goes for the other gear so
let's zoom in a little bit and go down
to the keyboard area and you can kind of
see which areas are separated so you can
select any area from the actual
borderlining or the keys itself even on
the actual Mouse itself you can do the
scroll wheel you can do the Razer logo
or any section of the side glow okay so
let's go back here and give it an effect
my personal favorite is ripple so I'm
gonna click on ripple down here I'm
gonna go ahead and select everything and
over here we're gonna select what color
we want the ripple effect to have again
we're gonna try to tick the green so
this has a nice gradient of green from
dark to light so we don't know what this
I'm gonna go down here and hit save for
now I'm gonna go back and delete static
and then hit save so now we have the
ripple effect programmed in our devices
and by default
nothing lights up until you press a key
or any button as you guys can see the
ripple effect begins from whatever key
you press and kind of just spreads out
to the rest of your devices same thing
with the mouse so if I click the ripple
effect starts on the mouse and just
spreads out to the rest of your gear
which is really cool personally I don't
like how the lighting is off by default
so when I try and change that but still
keep the ripple effect so we're gonna go
down here and add static we're gonna go
and select everything change that to
green
and then hit save now because static is
layered on top of ripple that's gonna
take priority no matter what so our
ripple effect is no longer going to work
as you guys can see now the way to
change that is we're gonna drag static
underneath ripple we're gonna hit save
and now we get static color by default
but we also get the ripple effect so if
we click on a button or a key as you
guys can see the ripple effect still
works that's another cool thing about
the chroma studios you can actually
layer effects like that another cool
thing about Razer synapse is that it's
compatible with MSI mystic light as you
guys can see we are using an MSI
motherboard and a graphics card so we
can actually use chroma Studio and
control the lighting not just on a
motherboard but also the RAM sticks and
the GPU itself so if you go back to
chroma studio and click on the MSI
mystic light option you can control the
lighting on here so let's just go blue
for example just to show you guys a
demonstration and you can see the RAM
sticks the infinity mirror and the GPU
all change to the color blue let's go
back and give it a ripple effect so I'm
gonna click on ripple make sure
everything is green also make sure the
static color is green as well so select
everything green and as you guys can see
every time I had a key
it will ripple from the peripherals to
the PC case motherboard Ram and the GPU
the only downside to this is that chroma
Studio won't let you configure
individual sections of the motherboard
you have to unfortunately select the
entire thing so there's no option to
select let's say one of the RAM sticks
or maybe just a GPU itself you have to
change the colors or effects on all of
those now I don't know if they're going
to change that in a later update but
with this current version of Razer
synapse unfortunately that is all I can
do so that's how you control those three
parts the only other things that you can
control on here are the RGB fans and the
cooler which are from coarser you would
have to use the IQ software for that and
finally you have the RGB backplate and
yes as the covers which are controlled
with the included RGB remote and now for
