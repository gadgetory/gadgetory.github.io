and welcome to the ultimate build for
the month of March this is man --tx the
$2,000 ultimate gaming PC inside the
Manta case yeah I'm kind of running out
of names my pc so just deal with it it's
running on a 6700 K which I overclocked
to 4.5 gigahertz thanks to the amazing
and extremely silent CPU cooler from be
quiet the dark rot 3 I'm also using 16
gigabytes of g.skill Trident z Ram
running on three 200 megahertz and 512
gigabytes of storage from Samsung's 850
pro SSD the motherboard is one of the
most important parts to any pc build it
allows all of the parts to work
seamlessly together and since I'm
building an ultimate gaming PC in such a
small case I had to make sure I don't
cheap out I have used MSI products in
the past many times and they have never
let me down so if the comparing a few
ITX ports the obvious choice was the msi
z170 i gaming pro motherboard it comes
with a bunch of really cool features
like the USB audio power pro that
enhances USB audio quality and my
favorite gaming land which prioritizes
bandwidth to games so we don't end up
lagging or getting disconnected the goal
of this build was to pack in as much
power as I can in a small space which is
why i went with the msi gtx 980ti
graphics card to finish up the bill that
went with 750 watts of goodness from be
quiet
dark power pro 11 power supply the guys
at v1 tech are back again with the
awesome custom sleeves and although they
made a backplate for the GPU which I
planned I'm using there just wasn't
enough clearance to fit it in I gotta
hand it to be quiet though none of the
pcs I've built on the channel or ever
disquiet I might as well call this a
silent bill but this is what it sounds
like while gaming
and finally the icing on the cake are
these LEDs that I picked up from cable
Maude I no longer use the sticky kind
and switch over to the magnetic strips
because of how much easier it is to work
with spending hours building a beautiful
piece II will go to waste if you don't
properly show off what's inside so if
you guys want to check out some really
cool magnetic LED strips along with any
of the mods or parts using this build
then check out the links below for
benchmarks Mantic scored a fifteen
thousand five hundred seventy-six and
you guys can find additional benchmark
scores and temperatures in my google
drive folder which I'll have linked
below for getting work done the pc
rendered out a 60 second 4k video file
in just over four minutes and as always
I'll leave a template in the Google
Drive if you guys want to run the same
test for your PC alright so on to the
gaming benchmarks portion of the video
you guys can find the frame counter on
the top left of the corner if anyone is
interested let's begin
you
so that's for the video if you guys
enjoy my monthly PC bills make sure to
beat the crap out of that like button to
show your support and my next PC bill is
actually going to be a five hundred
dollar gaming PC so if you guys want
sneak peeks make sure to follow me on
Twitter and Instagram
it's basically a thing guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
