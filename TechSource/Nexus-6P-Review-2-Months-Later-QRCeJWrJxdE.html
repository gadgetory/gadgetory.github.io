tech source and today I'm gonna be
talking about the Nexus 6p the Nexus
phones have always been just okay
they've never been great
I mean sure they always ran the latest
version of Android but something was
always lacking either from the build
quality the camera quality or just from
the specs inside the phone and I'm happy
to say we finally have a nexus film that
isn't just okay it's great so I'm going
to do something different in this video
and talk about the negatives first just
because there are so little we might as
well just get them out of the way the
first negative is that the 6p does not
have micro SD card support but we all
expected this from Google's past and HI
micro SD card stands but the good news
here is that you can get the version
that has 128 gigabytes of storage with
the base model starting at 32 gigabytes
the second negative is well hey Bob give
any more negatives about the Nexus 6p
well that seems about right because
honestly you'll be hard stretch to find
anything else wrong or disappointing
about this device the materials Huawei
used to craft this Nexus phone makes for
an excellent build from the feel all the
way to the look finally owning a nexus
phone also means you own a premium
handset with a contoured aluminum body
this thing feels great in the hand the
only thing is that it could get slippery
at times so I slapped a skin on here to
add some more grip and give this phone a
little more style I will leave a link
down below if you guys want to check out
some skins for yourselves it seems like
Google really paid attention to the
smaller details in this phone for
example I like how the upper back is
slightly raised to make room for the
internals instead of how some other
manufacturers do it by only raising the
camera module this way it's a lot more
seamless and when pulling this thing out
of my pocket I find myself using that
bulge to pull out the Nexus in the right
direction with my finger ready on the
fingerprint scanner which by the way is
super quick and super accurate it's on
par with pretty much every other good
Android fingerprint scanner out there
and the cool thing here is you don't
have to hit the wake button in order for
it to start working if the scanner reads
a finger that it doesn't recognize it
will vibrate twice letting the user know
to try another fitting
and if it does recognize the fingerprint
it will vibrate once as it unlocks your
device so by the time I take this thing
out of my pocket I'm ready to go already
on my lockscreen the front of the
display is flanked by two front-facing
stereo speakers which are amazing and
honestly they're comparable to the
speaker's even on the HTC One m9 and
makes this device great for consuming
media from watching movies playing games
or even listening to music these
speakers really shine he also get
extremely loud which is great now my
friends can hear the audio from those
cat videos I show them at parties the
AMOLED display on the 6p is great as
we've come to expect from flagship
phones these days on paper is the same
display that was on the Nexus 6 last
year but this one is a tad bit better in
a few ways first it gets brighter which
makes using this phone and bright rooms
much easier that coupled with the better
viewing angles make the visual aspect of
media consumption on this phone great
the colors still pop like a mo let's all
do but not as drastically as the Nexus 6
did last year which is a welcome change
as the screen is more accurate now
pushing all these pixels is a Snapdragon
810 processor and Adreno 430 GPU and 3
gigabytes of RAM and there's also a 34
50 milliamp battery here and as you
would expect there isn't any lag on this
phone I mean the apps would occasionally
crash and the homescreen would hang
sometimes but other than those hiccups
I've experienced zero lag this thing
also handles gaming like a boss and if
mobile gaming is your thing then this
should be your next toy the battery life
is also really good now I'm a heavy user
and as much as I tried I couldn't get
this thing to die out on me before the
end of the day I will typically get four
hours of on screen time which is great
and that coupled with Android Em's new
DOS feature which puts the phone into a
sleep state and you guys can actually
see when it kicked in through the
battery settings menu it's comparable to
how the iPhone saves battery where I can
go into sleep with 40% battery and wake
up with only 38% still left where before
Android M it would drain all the way
down to 20% this software optimization
implemented throughout the day makes for
outstanding battery life let's not
forget about this phones quick charging
which gave me around 65% battery in
about 40 minutes it's also a good time
to mention it uses USB
to charge up being a nexus of course
this phone comes with Google's latest
software which for now is Android M or
marshmallow depending on how you look at
it this brings in a lot of new things
but the most notable being now on tap
and more control over the security of
your device now on tap anticipates what
you need in the moment by simply holding
down the home button and the phone will
scan what you're looking at and present
you with what it thinks is useful
information there are of course bugs
with this being the first release of
this feature but when it does work it's
awesome we're not going to dive deep
into Android M as that deserves a video
by itself but we can sum it up by saying
that this is the best most well
put-together version of Android today
now let's talk about the camera this has
always been a sore point for Nexus
phones but I'm really happy to report
that after continued use this camera can
hold its own - all of the big dogs out
there the note 5 still does hold a crown
for Android cameras but this isn't far
behind
it's twelve point three megapixel Sony
sensor takes some incredible pictures
and video real quick here's a pro tip
leave the HDR on because for some reason
it makes every picture you could take on
this phone much better the depth of
field is great and it performs really
well in low light which is where most
smart phones struggle it also comes with
an 8 megapixel front camera that does a
decent job I'll be sure to leave a link
to a gallery down below if you guys want
to check out some full resolution
pictures taken on the Nexus 6p now in
terms of video there isn't any optical
image stabilization but there is
software stabilization which does help
with shaky cam there are also options
for 120 or 240 slo-mo video which is a
very nice feature so wrap things up this
is in my eyes the must-have Android
phone right now
it's hardware is top notch and that
being coupled with it being a nexus
gives us phone an edge that no other
Android phone has and that is enjoy
updates this is definitely going to be
my daily driver and if anyone out there
is looking for a badass Android phone I
couldn't recommend anything better and
of course let's not forget how it
undercuts and price as this phone starts
at just $500 which is a steal for what
you're getting if you guys enjoyed this
video be sure to hit that thumbs up
button to show your support and let me
know down below if there are any other
videos you guys would like to see done
with the Nexus 6p thanks again for
watching this is that from tech source
and now
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
