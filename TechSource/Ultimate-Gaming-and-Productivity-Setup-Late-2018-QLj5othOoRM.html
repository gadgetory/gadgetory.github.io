here is our new gaming and productivity
setup for our office we've been
rebuilding the office and on you setup
from scratch
since August of this year and the
purpose of this setup is not only for
gaming but also content creation and
media consumption as well as you can see
I was going for more of a minimalistic
setup with a black and green color
scheme just to change things up now this
Goliath of a PC that's essentially the
main centerpiece of this setup is from
digital storm and actually did a video
on it if you want to check it out but
this thing is equipped with the new 8086
k-6 core processor 32 gigs of ram and
two gtx 1080p eyes and sli I did
overclock the CPU to a steady 5
gigahertz and add an extra 120 megahertz
offset on both GPUs needless to say it
slices through footage like butter while
editing and it handles 4k gaming like a
champ so the games I'm playing mostly
are black ops 4 and I just recently
started Darksiders 2b which i think is
very fun and I'm still stuck on the
first boss believe it or not I'm curious
if there are any Dark Souls fans out
there is Darksiders 3 more difficult or
Dark Souls 3 let me know what you guys
think in the comments section so the
monitor of choice is the new 27-inch
Asus 4k gaming monitor with g-sync HDR
it has a 144 Hertz or fresh rate for
millisecond response time on an IPS
quantum dot panel these specs are
amazing if you're gaming in 4k however
it's also great for color sensitive work
once you enable the white color gamut
option and the settings I like the
aggressive stands that come with the
monitor which is why I decided to keep
it instead of mounting it on the wall or
the desk the razor blade is mostly used
as a second display while I'm gaming or
editing if ever need to look something
up real quick or browse through my
social media accounts I don't have to
all tab I can just use the blade for
that I also use it for gaming so after
I'm done with a video and while it's
exporting I use the blade for gaming
until it's complete I like the fact that
I can take it with me once I'm done at
the office that's actually one of the
reasons why I wanted to do a single
monitor setup and have a separate laptop
form
ability I don't really like the game on
laptops but gaming on the blade is
pretty fun
now while the display is a 4k IPS
touchscreen I'm not able to game in 4k
because the gtx 1070 just can't keep up
so if i want a game over 100 FPS i have
to lower the settings to 1080p now the
downside to that is i'll experience some
screen tearing because the refresh rate
is capped at 60 Hertz unfortunately it
doesn't have G sync either for
peripherals I got to give a huge shout
out to Asus for sending these over along
with the monitor so I'm using the Asus
already Strix Flair keyboard with the
asus rog Gladius 2 mouse the keyboard is
really nice it's a full-size keyboard
with cherry MX blue switches it's
actually one of my favorite keyboards
out there right now one of the cool
things about this is that you can
actually customize the plastic piece
over here with your very own logo I
gotta say I love the integrated media
controls and the volume knob is an
excellent feature as well as the USB
pass-through so if you guys ever need to
connect your mouse straight to your
keyboard then you can speaking of the
mouse it's a 12,000 VPI optical gaming
mouse with Omron switches that you can
swap out if you want it's very
comfortable and I think it's great for
both palm and quad whip types not so
much fingertip I feel like Asus does RGB
best when it comes to peripherals the
ROG logo and the under glow is a nice
touch now for audio I'm using the
Edifier spinnaker is there not only are
they interesting looking desktop
speakers but they do sound really good
nice and bacey with crisp eyes and
balanced mids but one of the things that
got me sold on these was this wireless
remote I can basically use this to
control the audio using this tiny remote
I only use the speaker's when I'm
watching a video or listening to music
so usually when I'm in the other room
shooting a video I like to blast music
to kind of get in the mood
but if I'm not listening to music and
I'm gaming I use these bad boys the
Strix fusion 500 headset it's got 50
millimeter drivers with virtual 7.1
sound and they are very comfortable to
wear the padding is really soft and it
covers my entire ear which helps with
isolating the outside noise something
really cool about this headset is the
touch controls for media on the side of
the ear cup you can actually use your
finger and swipe or tap to adjust volume
and playback they do come with two extra
ear pads and a detachable microUSB as
far as sound quality it's pretty good
it's got a deep bass with solid
mid-range so not bad for gaming
there is a bit of an echo when you turn
on the 7.1 so I don't recommend them for
listening to music but for gaming
they're great since all the peripherals
are from Asus I'm able to sync all the
RGB lining together even with the PC
since it's using an asus motherboard
speaking of lighting I decided to ditch
the usual RGB strips behind the setup
and go with that you guys have probably
seen this from my cool tech episode back
in September so these are the Nano leaf
RGB panels and I absolutely love them
I'm able to customize each individual
panel and give them pretty cool
animation effects if I want to using my
smart phone you can also just pick from
the pre customized templates that come
with the app if you guys don't want to
create your own finally let's talk about
the cable management so this time around
I didn't drill a hole in the desk
because I don't want to ruin the
mousepad
so instead I wrapped both the keyboard
and mouse cable together and neatly
routed it alongside the monitor base
this is a great alternative for people
that don't want a drill a hole in their
desk or their mousepad but still want a
clean surface the cables under the desk
were pretty easy to manage as well so I
basically used a long channel raceway
which routes majority of the cables from
the set up straight to the PC and I used
a bunch of cable clips and velcro straps
to keep the path clean one thing I do
recommend for people if they're hooking
up power bricks underneath the desk is
using strong adhesive that 3m tape
doesn't cut you guys if it's really
heavy I recommend using the heavy duty
velcro straps with industrial strength
these babies do the trick so that's it
guys that is our new setup here at the
office let me know what you guys think
in the comments section down below I
know that it's more on the overkill side
and that's because we are gaming in 4k
and also editing 4k footage so we do eat
the specs to be a little beefy if you
guys enjoy these types of videos
dropping a like would mean the world to
me I honestly appreciate the hell out of
you guys and if you didn't enjoy the
video please also drop me this like and
your constructive criticism in the
comment section below because I always
welcome them thanks again so much for
watching I love you guys honestly to
death you are the best and I will see
you guys and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
