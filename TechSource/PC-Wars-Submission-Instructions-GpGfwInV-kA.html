get featured on the channel win some
prize money and even a custom plaque
well you came to the right place
iOS PC Wars twice a month on the 1st and
15th and the winner of each show will be
part of the best custom pcs of the year
which I will host every single January
out of the 24 finalists you guys get to
vote on who you think has the best
custom PC of the year and the winner
will receive 500 bucks in cash a tech
source t-shirt and also a custom made
plaque which is hand signed by me
everyone else that enters and doesn't
get a chance to win well your build will
still be featured on a channel with a
shout-out to your social media account
or YouTube channel but here are the
requirements and instructions to enter
PC Wars first and foremost make sure
there is plenty of light in the room
please don't take pictures at night I
need a minimum of three pictures of your
PC one shot of your entire PC with a
side panel off showing the entire build
from top to bottom and to close-up
pictures of your PC the first picture
being the top half of your PC showing
off your cooler and RAM sticks and the
second picture to be the bottom half
showing your graphics cards for the love
of God please don't send me any vertical
pictures for some reason I get a bunch
of those make sure that your phone or
camera is in landscape mode the more
pictures you send me the better you
don't have to send me only three if you
send me ten pictures and a bunch of
angles if your PC by all means do it the
more the better
the other two files I need are
screenshots the first screenshots should
be of your CPU and graphics card using
the HW monitor program it's free to
download and I'll drop a link in the
description section on where you guys
can download it once you open it up find
your CPU and GPU labels and make sure
that they are visible at the same time
you can minimize the tab so that they
don't clutter the page this basically
shows me your motherboard CPU and
graphics card so I know that you're not
lying in the spec sheet the second
screenshot should be a snapshot of your
five lag benchmark score you can
download the free benchmark tool using
steam or by clicking on the link below
and downloading it from major geeks or
other websites once you download it make
sure to run the firestrike benchmark
score and then go and take a screenshot
of your score your screenshots should
look something like this
once you have your pictures of your PC
and the two screenshots head over to we
transfer comm and add the files for the
email portion put in setup Wars at
gmail.com and in the message body type
and PC Wars and caps to let me know that
this is for PC Wars and not setup boys
you know that God and list your name and
the name of your PC if it has one and
give me one social media account that
you want me to give a shout-out in the
video below that go to list the entire
specs and parts of your PC please don't
send me links just the names of the
parts are okay under the part list write
down all the mods that you have done to
your PC for example custom painted parts
modded sli bridges sleeve cables or
whatever it is that you added to your PC
what's happening is fill out select
transfer and sit back and relax and wait
for the files to be sent that's
basically it once the files are sent and
you are accepted I will go ahead and add
you to the queue I also make sure to
follow me on Twitter because that is
where all the updates will happen also

domain you can also find more

takes for me to reject a submission as
