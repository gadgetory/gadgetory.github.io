requirements and instructions to enter
PC Wars first and foremost make sure
there is plenty of light in the room
please don't take pictures at night I
need a minimum of three pictures of your
PC one shot of your entire PC with a
side panel off showing the entire build
from top to bottom and to close-up
pictures of your PC the first picture
being the top half of your PC showing
off your cooler and RAM sticks and the
second picture to be the bottom half
showing your graphics cards for the love
of God please don't send me any vertical
pictures for some reason I get a bunch
of those make sure that your phone or
camera is in landscape mode the more
pictures you send me the better you
don't have to send me only three if you
send me ten pictures and a bunch of
angles if your PC by all means do it the
more the better
the other two files I need are
screenshots the first screenshots should
be of your CPU and graphics card using
the HW monitor program it's free to
download and I'll drop a link in the
description section on where you guys
can download it once you open it up find
your CPU and GPU labels and make sure
that they are visible at the same time
you can minimize the tab so that they
don't clutter the page this basically
shows me your motherboard CPU and
graphics card so I know that you're not
lying in the spec sheet the second
screenshot should be a snapshot of your
five lag benchmark score you can
download the free benchmark tool using
steam or by clicking on the link below
and downloading it from major geeks or
other websites once you download it make
sure to run the firestrike benchmark
score and then go and take a screenshot

look something like this
