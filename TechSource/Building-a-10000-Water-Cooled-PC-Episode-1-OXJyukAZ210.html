to another unboxing episode here on the
channel based on the title the video you
guys already know what we're gonna be
doing so I'm gonna be starting on my
next epic water-cooled PC featuring the
corsair 1000d case which sticks honestly
the box is so big I can't even fit it on
this table so that's actually gonna be
the last thing we're gonna be unboxing
everything on the table over here is
pretty much all the parts that are going
in the build plus the water cooled parts
which are on the way I think they'll be
here next week from alpha cool so I want
to give you huge things to aces courser
and alpha cool for sponsoring this build
and it's going to be epic but anyways
guys it's gonna dive into these boxes
and take a look and see what parts I'm
gonna be using let's start off the
unboxing with this one actually now that
I'm thinking about it I don't know if
this is an actual PC part I know
everything else is a PC part except I
think this one and I was right we got a
couple of gaming headsets from doesn't
say it was from but they sent in two for
some reason so he's off from hunter
spider and it's a pro gaming headset for
the ps4 pro the Xbox one asks the switch
and of course your PC or laptop why not
let's just unbox it
you know what let me see how much these
are in Amazon before I even talk about
it cuz it's like 100 bucks I'm not gonna
even show it in the video okay not bad
so they're going forward 26 bucks
it's got 427 reviews four-star ratings
so not bad so pretty flexible actually a
quality feels very flimsy and cheap but
I mean it's pretty flexible oh yeah
these are even lights it's like you can
barely feel anything
comforts there and the ear cups I know
that's not very large so it kind of goes
over your ears so it feels like the
noise isolation is really terrible
because it kind of just hovers over your
ear doesn't really sit flush on it that
makes any sense does have a remote
control here you can control the volume
using the knob over here and you can
also mute your microphone so that's
pretty cool does have a 3.5 millimeter
jack or USB but it also comes with a
microphone and audio Al's for your PC if
you wanna plug it directly in the back
so anyways guys I'll drop a link below
if you want to check it out 26 bucks
seems like a pretty good deal especially
with the reviews on Amazon but anyways
moving on to the good stuff
I'm guessing this is either the RAM
sticks or the processor the processor so
coarse are actually sent in the eye
77020 X which is an eighth core but this
is tech source we don't we don't a core
is too low for us so I think we're gonna
do with 10 core actually and I bought
the spare processor somewhere here it is
it's in a plastic bag actually don't
have a case for this because I think I
use it in a build so this is the 7900 X
this is a 10 core processor using the X
$2.99 platform so we kind of give
ourselves a a 2 core upgrade yeah we
might have to use this in a different
build though what's the next smallest
box that's right here actually this one
is
from coarser I think I mean 90% of the
boxes off from coarser so it's gotta be
see the course our new egg okay so this
is we got the RAM and we've got one SSD
so we are putting in 64 gigs I know
we're not putting hundred 28 that's
interesting we're putting 64 gigs of
their new vengeance LED this is abby
black with the RGB lights I think these
are rated at 3200 megahertz which
obviously we can overclock and we do
have a 960 gigabyte SSD as well I think
we're also I think that's gonna be an
end out too in here as well but it's a
continuing boxing this I think this has
to be like my biggest record between
water-cooled builds usually when I do it
water-cooled bills I wait like six to
eight months so it's interesting that
I'm already starting on my next one
holy commander Pro Batman ladies and
gentleman we have not one or two or
three but four I'm just kidding we have
six commander pros because let's face it
one or two or three or five aren't
enough and we have a set of ML 140 RGB
lights RGB lights that's redundant RGB I
just keep people eyes RGB fans the ml
1/4 is I guess we're not using the ll
series this time around like my previous
build so but yeah for now I'm sorry 6
commander pros and I think the case
comes with a commander Pro installed so
we have seven up to seven I don't think
I'm gonna use all of them but we'll see
all right let's keep the trend going I
think this is the next biggest box yeah
also from coarser let's dive right in
aha of course we need all the juice we
can get so we went with the ax 1600 I
think this is titanium rated I'm sorry
platinum rated not the same thing
Platinum or titanium oh yeah ax 1600 is
gonna give us enough juice to do
whatever the hell we want
inside the case you know hook up as many
GPUs as we want overclock connect a
bunch of fans and water cooling stuff so
yeah this is this is definitely a must
alright we got a box from new egg you
like deja vu I just unbox one we have 2a
x16 edge knife actually we might even
use this one because the case is very
special
I'm going to talk about it in a way but
basically the plan is to build two pcs
inside the case so I'll talk more about
that at the end when I unbox it alright
this one is obviously from coarser
judging by the coarser sale logo oh my
god I have never seen so many fans
we have an interesting combination of
fans actually we have 4:1 20s and 4:1
40s and we also have a set of RGB lights
of course we're sending all this
commander pro's and fans why not send an
RGB strip to top it all off I think the
case can hold up to 24 28 fans it's it's
ridiculous guys it really is this is
like I would say the most overkill build
on the channel so far
you thought my last bill was overkill
you guys have seen nothing yet
I promise you all right guys you have
two more boxes let's get this one open
okay I don't know I don't know why they
sent in an AI Oh cooler I mean it's
obvious we're doing a water-cooled bill
the custom water-cooled build so there
is no literally no need for this I might
have to use it in a different build but
yeah oh thank you Corsair the last box
is from a soos whoo all right let's see
what they got they didn't tell me what
they're sending they just said we want
to participate in your insane
overkill water cool build using the new
1000d case of course there so we're
gonna send you some goodies so we're
gonna check out and see what kind of
goodies they sent me it's Christmas
again Bob it's happening so soon oh my
god can it be is it true
this is real life all right ladies and
gentlemen check this out we have the
usual to 1080 T eyes I mean there's
nothing you know crazy you guys have
seen us on that channel many times but
they also threw in my favorite
motherboard of all time the mother of
all motherboards ladies and gentlemen
the rog rampage six extreme this thing
is seriously packing everything you need
for overclocking for water cooling I
mean this this is it you want the best
of the best from Asus you're looking
right at it so yeah you might wonder why
we're not going with a triple or maybe
even a quad S the life of the build
well that's because like I told you guys
earlier we're gonna be doing two builds
inside the case two separate pcs and we
want to have enough space for another
SLI build for the the other PC if that
makes any sense
so yeah that's kind of what we're going
with - who knows maybe we'll add two
more later on the line we'll see we'll
see I'm not really saying anything now
I'm not gonna make any promises but for
this build we're just gonna go with the
flow I think that's the best and safest
way to do it
I'll speak with that guys I want to ask
you if you want to see multiple series
of the build or you want to see just one
entire video condensed maybe to like 20
minutes or something of the entire build
in one video or you like the series like
you saw in my last build so let me know
by dropping your comments down below but
anyways guys yeah these are pretty much
all the parts plus the water cooling
parts from alpha cool that are coming
next week and of course the case which
we're gonna unbox right now and take a
closer look because this thing is a
beast guys it's pretty much half my
height and I'll show you what I mean
how on earth are we gonna get that on
the desk over here oh wait a minute we
have one more box
I thought I'd miss this just quickly
open it
ah I knew there was gonna be an MDOT - I
spoke too soon
so this is the MP 500 from course sir I
think we're using 480 gigabytes so yeah
it I mean it's not a terabyte or
anything but it's still gonna contribute
to the overall storage ooh we don't
really put you guys have noticed this
but we don't really focus on storage
when it comes to high-end builds because
we can always add storage later down the
line we like to focus more on the
aesthetics and the performance not so
much storage anyways it's trying to get
this thing on the desk okay yeah I'm
gonna throw out my back when I lift this
anymore Bob I need your help man all
right
there's this even fit it doesn't even
fit in the camera frame wow this is
actually literally the biggest unboxing
I've ever done now that I think about it
oh my god what was that Wow
what I can sleep in here if the cooling
is good obviously look how huge this
thing is god damn why would you need
something this big so hey guys this is
the case we're gonna be building in the
1000 the from Corsair this is pretty
much the wet dream of all PC enthusiasts
out there you can do whatever he
fantasized about in terms of modding
water cooling I mean there's so much
room for activities in here okay you can
do all sorts of crazy bends but the
thing that really separates this from
the other giant cases is that it has
space for two motherboards micro ATX on
the bottom any full-size ATX maybe even
an extended ATX on the side here so yeah
and there's also space on the bottom
here for two power supplies so yeah that
is why I want to build two pcs in here
one focused on the workstation side and
one for pure gaming I think it's gonna
be a very interesting project to say the
least it's wrapped around with tinted
tempered glass that's on a hinge making
it really easy to get inside it can
support up to four four hundred eighty
millimeter radiators simultaneously and
up to 20 fan mounts but what I love
about the case is that it gives you the
option of pulling out the trays for easy
access the main feature of the case is
of course the dual system layout you can
mount up to an e ATX motherboard
vertically and a mini ITX board
horizontally this means you can combine
them and have a gaming and streaming
setup running simultaneously or you can
combine your main PC with a file server
I mean the choice is yours you also get
a buttload of room in the back for cable
management SSDs harddrive mounts and on
the front panel it comes with 4 USB 3
ports and two USB C's which by the way
are all RGB lit now it does come with a
commander Pro already installed in the
back however it does
fans because course I wanted to provide
the Builder with flexibility I mean
let's face it if you're gonna spend $500
on this case you already know what parts
you're gonna go with so yeah guys that
pretty much wraps up this video I hope
you enjoyed it let me know what your
feedback is in the comment section down
below what sort of color scheme I should
do because that's kind of still
undecided
obviously it's mostly gonna be black so
let me know what kind of color I should
combine with the black whether it be
black and white black and green let me
know your comments or suggestions down
below yeah it's pretty much it if you
into the channel make sure to subscribe
because you don't want to miss out on
what I'm gonna be doing with this beast
I love you guys so much anything you see
in this video will be linked below I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
