welcome to another detailed camera
comparison test this time we have the
iPhone 7 against the galaxy s7 and
before diving into the samples let's
briefly go over the specs so the iPhone
7 has a 12 megapixel rear camera with an
aperture of 1.8 being able to shoot
video at up to 4k resolution the galaxy
s7 on the other hand has a 12 megapixel
camera with an aperture of 1.7 also
capable of recording 4k video the
front-facing camera on the iPhone 7
comes in at 7 megapixels and can capture
1080p video and the galaxy s7 has a 5
megapixel front facing camera and can
record video at up to 1440 P by the way
these skins are from the brands and they
offer a variety of materials for
different types of devices so if you
guys are interested in checking them out
I'll drop a link to them down below so
without wasting more time let's sit back
relax and take a look at some samples
so the Galaxy s7 and the iPhone 7 both
shoot high resolution 4k video but which
does it better one of the most important
things for smartphones is videography
and the s7 excels in this regard the
dual pixel autofocus is much faster than
the autofocus seen on the iPhone 7 while
remaining very accurate just like with
the photos the s7 has a slightly wider
field of view as well when recording
video color temperature looks to be the
same among both phones providing a
true-to-life tone in certain scenes some
colors are portrayed more accurately on
the s7 brown areas tend to take on a
more purple hue on the iPhone 7
while the processing is not as prominent
on the galaxy while shooting in
low-light scenario video from the galaxy
phone appears to be a bit sharper than
on the iPhone 7 creating some extra
visibility for otherwise hard to see
details autofocus remains consistent on
both but again the galaxy phone can lock
on to subjects much quicker when it
comes to countering shake both phones
have optical image stabilization the
iPhone 7 does this vastly better than
the galaxy phone creating much more
smooth and less jerky video what's up
guys so I am holding both the galaxy s7
and the iPhone 7 and I'm shooting this
video using the front-facing camera
which is also set on its highest
resolution there will be an audio icon
somewhere on the phone or somewhere on
the screen and they will basically
indicate which phone's audio is current
use the front camera is on each phone
shoot excellent video but iPhone takes
the crown in terms of sharpness on the
galaxy fine details seem a bit soft
especially on faces or certain types of
clothing the galaxy phone once again
captures a bit more of the scene thanks
to its wider field of view even with a
front-facing camera the iPhone 7
exhibits a wider dynamic range retaining
more detail in bright areas such as the
sky starting up at the rear camera each
phone shows their own strengths and
weaknesses photos out of the galaxy look
notably sharper compared to the shots
from the iPhone the 12 megapixel shooter
on the galaxy utilizes a slightly wider
field of view compared to the iPhone as
well there are slight variations and
color temperatures between the two with
the galaxy phone showcasing a slightly
cooler image as opposed to the warmer
tones from pictures taken on the iPhone
colours definitely have a bit more pop
to the iPhone 7 photos as well as better
control over the dynamic range the
highlights don't seem to be clipped as
much as they are on the galaxy phone
moving on to the front camera the galaxy
tends to adjust exposure better than on
the iPhone 7 images on the iPhone are
more underexposed as expected though the
galaxy beats out the iPhone for selfies
providing a wider field of view when
shooting in low-light scenarios both
phones hold up pretty well the iPhone 7
preserves detail a bit sharper than the
galaxy particularly in the shadows as
with the other samples sharpening will
have to go to the iPhone as well images
out of the s7 are not soft but rather
over sharpened and not as natural photos
taken with the galaxy R notice will be
cleaner than their iPhone 7 counterparts
showing much less noise in the overall
picture now where the galaxy s7 truly
shines is in the rear flash compared to
the iPhone the galaxy's flash is more
powerful feeling much more of a scene
with light it becomes especially
noticeable if the image has a defined
foreground and middle ground as the
galaxy will be able to light up both
areas of the scene so there you have it
guys both phones have their strengths
and weaknesses the iPhone 7 gets the job
done for capturing photos and videos in
all situations but there are certain
characteristics that the s7 has
that can't be beat the faster autofocus
and wider field of view can be benefit
to anybody as well as the slightly more
realistic reproduction of color but what
do you guys think let me know your
thoughts by dropping a comment down
below I would love to hear what you guys
have to say if you guys enjoy these
videos and want to see a specific camera
comparison be sure to leave a like and
let me know which two phones you want to
see head-to-head in my next video thanks
again for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
