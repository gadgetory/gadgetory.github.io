Texas and in this video we are going to
be unboxing and taking a quick first
look at the Galaxy Note edge i'm also
going to go over my first impressions of
this device after using it for a day so
without any more hesitation let's get to
the unboxing we have the AT&amp;amp;T model here
which is why it's in this horrible box
but in the box you get the device itself
and your usual manuals and warranty
information from Samsung you also get
your fast charging brick and micro USB
wire your 3,000 milliamp battery as well
as S Pen replacement tips if I had to
choose one word to describe this phone I
would choose interesting I mean there's
just so much going on here that is new
to me when I first saw the device get
announced alongside the galaxy note 4 I
didn't think it would be anything
different and honestly didn't see a
reason someone would opt for the note
edge instead of just going for the
normal note but before I say anything
else let me just get this out of the way
I am NOT trying to sell this device to
you samsung has not written me a large
check to give this device praise if they
did I probably would be driving a
Lamborghini or something like that but
I'm not these are my real first
impressions now this phone is far from
perfect and there are a lot of things I
would have personally change to improve
the user interface the main complaint i
have about this phone is the
functionality and how Samsung
implemented the extra features on to the
edge of the phone for example I do not
understand why Samsung didn't make it
possible to open the apps located on the
edge in windowed mode or in a motor we
can continue to do what you were doing
and not have your screen taken over for
example I would love if I could use the
edge to make calls without opening up
the dialer app or you samsung Smart
Remote app without having to load the
whole app up and interrupt what I was
doing that would have made more sense to
me seeing as the whole purpose of the
edge is to make using the phone more
convenient aside from that there isn't
really much else that I can say about
this phone that is negative sure you can
throw the usual complaints in there like
the typical Samsung laggin glitches but
just like on the note for the stutters
on this phone don't come often and when
they do they're usually not that bad but
don't get me wrong they're still present
now let's get to why i like this phone
that's the new factor i don't know about
you guys but whenever something new
comes out but not new as in specs and
better hardware but new as
the first of its kind I get excited
using this phone feels like a new
experience even though most of it isn't
it feels like it is what's exciting me
the most is what the developer community
is going to do with this extra real
estate because as of right now there
isn't really anything compelling enough
to pay the premium over the price of the
note for to get this phone another thing
I wanted to mention is that this phone
and this form factor take getting used
to I found myself accidentally hitting
menus in opening up apps from the edge
of the phone on accident which gets
annoying really quick there is
definitely room for improvement as
functionality seems to be lacking but
this is the first device in the edge
series so i won't give Samsung too much
heat for that so overall if you want a
new experience from your phone and you
see yourself using the added real estate
then you should definitely be interested
in this device that pretty much wraps up
my first impressions if you guys would
like a more in-depth review once I get
to spend some more quality time with
this phone let me know down below I want
to know what you guys think about this
phone feel free to leave your thoughts
down below as I will be reading almost
all the comments but anyways this is Bob
from Texas and like always I'll see you
next time
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
