thousand bucks on a laptop only for it
to break down a year later all times
I've definitely changes you can actually
now purchase a really solid laptop for
just around two hundred bucks so when I
picked up three of the best laptop so
you can currently buy for around two
hundred bucks and I spent a long week
with each one of them so this video is
basically an in-depth comparison between
all three of these laptops so if you're
in the market for a budget laptop for
around two hundred bucks then you came
to the right place
alright so first off let's go ahead and
introduce the contenders first off we
have the Asus 10.1 inch transformer book
coming in at 199 even and then next up
we have the Asus 11.6 inch ebook for the
same price and lastly we have the 13.3
inch HP stream coming in at 200 $9.99
let's go ahead and jump into the specs
real quick so the transformer comes
equipped with an Intel quad-core 1.33
gigahertz processor with 2 gigabytes of
RAM the asus eeebook has an Intel Atom
quad core 1.33 gigahertz processor with
2 gigs of RAM as well and the HP stream
has an Intel Celeron 2.16 gigahertz
processor also with 2 gigs of ram so we
get a glossy plastic design for the
transformer and popping it open we are
greeted with a very compact keyboard
with a textured feel for the palm rest
area even though they used up the entire
surface area for the keyboard which is
great the keys however are still small
especially for me since I have large
hands I definitely wouldn't recommend
this laptop to a student or writer as
typing for long hours would really be
inconvenient the keys feel a bit spongy
but a good thing is that if you are
typing at least all the keys are within
reach so you don't have to constantly
move your hand if you have especially
tiny hands then you can probably pull
this off the trackpad is very small and
works well for the most part it's very
unresponsive in certain areas and I
noticed it doing pop-up windows like
these but on everything else it works
great with no complaints and the top
feature is also very sensitive and works
100% of the time so there's really no
need to physically click the buttons the
asus eeebook has a plastic design as
well for both the outer shell and the
inner and it comes in an optional dark
blue color the keys are spaced nicely
and are very firm when pressing them and
offer great feedback I can easily waste
my Pall Mall typing the backspace button
is a bit far but I can still reach it
however if you have smaller hands that
are might be inconvenient for you I can
easily type for a long period of time
using the keyboard the comfort level is
definitely high on this laptop the
trackpad on the e-book is probably the
best I've experienced in any budget
laptops by far not only is it really
sensitive but it's spot-on in terms of
scrolling it can register the gestures
really well and determine how fast I
wanted to scroll which is really
impressive however just like the Asus
Transformer the scrolling feature
doesn't work in some pop-up windows as
well and must have something to do with
these software since it's consistent
throughout the asus models but please
keep in mind that it's not like this on
all the websites just a select few that
I have tested the tap to click feature
is also 100% accurate and I experienced
zero problems using it in these past
seven days the HP stream features an all
plastic build with a smooth plastic
surface inside with a dotted design that
comes in pink as well the keyboard is
slightly bigger than the asus eeebook
and has a much larger surface for the
palm rest which means that you can
comfortably type for long periods of
time the keys are nice and big with a
very clicky feel and they are really
easy to type on with great feedback the
only issue I have is that the backspace
button is a bit far which forces me to
reach a little more for each key press
which really isn't a big deal the
trackpad on the HP stream 13 comes in a
very close second it's sensitive but not
as responsive as I would have liked
sometimes it wouldn't register my scroll
gesture so I would have to do it twice
and and our time is where it doesn't
even scroll at the speed I wanted to
scroll for example if I want to scroll
down the page faster by swiping my
fingers down quickly it would scroll
slowly instead the issue is not
consistent but I do notice it from time
to time the type to click feature
however is accurate and I haven't
experienced any problems with it this
past week in terms of using it on the
lap I found that the ACE
this transformer is way too small to
achieve a comfortable typing experience
you need to have both of your legs
really close together to support the
laptop and it just isn't natural not to
mention that it's top-heavy so the
slightest shift and weight can tip over
the entire thing plus it doesn't help
that you can tilt the display as much
compared to the other laptops it's much
better to use the tablet option in this
situation the asus eeebook is a lot more
comfortable to keep on your lap it is
the most flexible among the three
allowing you to tilt the screen to an
angle you are more comfortable with and
because the laptop is balanced nicely
you won't run into tipping issues at
this point I'm sure you guys have
already deduced that the HP stream 13
would be the most comfortable because of
its sheer size well you are correct not
only is it the most comfortable but it
feels the most natural you can even set
the laptop further away since it has a
much larger palm rest area now let's
talk about ports the Asus Transformer
features a micro SD card slot for
expansion a micro USB micro HDMI and an
audio jack on the other side you have
your volume controls and a power button
and on the bottom you'll find a single
USB 2.0 port the e-book features two USB
2.0 ports on one side and on the other
we have the charging port micro SD card
slot micro HDMI and an audio jack
the HP screen features two USB 2.0 slots
and the charging port on one side and on
the other you will find a computer lock
a full HDMI port USB 3.0 an audio jack
and a micro SD card slot also on the
front of each laptop is the front facing
camera and here's a quick sample of each
one so here's a quick sample of the HP
stream 13.3 front facing camera and it's
actually being shot in 720p which is its
highest resolution and also notice
compared to the other two laptops that
has a much wider field of view all right
now I'm looking at the asus eeebook
laptop and it's currently being shot in
480p which is its highest resolution and
by the footage it's pretty obvious that
it has the worst palm facing camera
compared to the other two laptops now
I'm looking at the Asus Transformer
front facing camera it's being shot at
720p and
actually a lot better than the HP stream
13.3 and first place for camera quality
I would give it to the Asus Transformer
followed by the HP stream and then
lastly a single on the bottom of the
laptops you can find the rubber feet on
all four corners which prevents the
laptops from sliding while typing now if
I had to rate which laptop has the best
grip it would definitely be the asus
eeebook on top followed by the Asus
Transformer and lastly the HP stream 13
also on the bottom you can find the
speaker's the HP stream has them located
near the front whereas the asus eeebook
has them closer to the corners the
speakers on the transformer however are
located on the tablet portion near the
edges Windows 8.1 is great on laptops
only if there is a touchscreen feature
or a mouse attached otherwise using the
trackpad on a Windows 8.1 laptop is hell
for me and annoying for most people now
I've mentioned this many times in my
previous videos but I always install
start 8 as soon as humanly possible
it's basically a Windows Start menu and
it helps me out a lot since I don't use
a mouse the windows 8 menu is still
there in case you still want to use it
however now the Windows Start menu pops
up when you press the Windows key and
it's just a lot easier navigating around
with that installed now having a
touchscreen feature is a completely
different story it eliminates the need
for a Start menu since you can simply
use your fingers to navigate around much
quicker but it's still nice to have and
if you guys want to check out start 8
I'll go ahead and leave a link down
below windows 8.1 also runs really
smooth on all three of the laptops I
mean there is still some lag present
when scrolling through large websites
however it's very subtle and shouldn't
bother you at all I'm really impressed
at how well the laptops multitask you
can basically have a game playing on one
side while you browse through a Twitter
feed without any problems or lag both of
the Asus tablets are outstanding when it
comes to multitasking however I can't
say the same for the HP stream lag
becomes more noticeable when splitting
screens and playing a game at the same
time however if you don't have a game
open or graphic intensive programs then
you won't experience any lag while
multitasking and I've only noticed that
on the HP screen 13 now let's talk about
displays the Asus Transformer has a 10.1
inch eye
pS glossy display with a resolution of
1366 by 768 P the asus eeebook has an
11.6 inch glossy display with a
resolution of 1366 by 768 as well an HP
stream has a 13.3 inch LED matte display
with the same resolution using the
laptops outside however is a different
story on the Asus Transformer you get
lots of reflections due to its glossy
finish so I recommend using it on the
shade instead of under direct sunlight
the e-book is very similar it too has a
glossy finish but there are slightly
less reflections when comparing it to
the transformer lastly we have the HP
stream and as you can see there are no
reflections thanks to its matte coating
anti glare displays are ideal for
outside use especially under direct
sunlight however all displays have a
trade-off having a glossy display means
that you get more vibrant colors and
contrast and having an anti-glare
display like the HP stream means you get
bad viewing angles and colors appear
more dull the viewing angles are the
best on the Asus Transformer because of
its IPS glossy display you can tilt or
turn the laptop any way you like and
there will be very minimal visual
distortion the other two don't even come
close the e-book comes in second tilting
or turning the laptop slightly will
begin to wash out the colors as you can
see here and then the HP stream comes in
third and has the worst viewing angle
among the three mainly because of its
matte display as you can see the colors
become washed out even by slightly
tilting the screen here are some pics i
pulled up on each laptop and you guys
can compare the differences as you can
see the colors are more vibrant and
saturated on the Asus Transformer
whereas it's kind of washed out on the
HP stream the e-book is right there
between the two slightly less saturated
but not to a point where the colors are
completely washed out no laptops
experience backlight bleeding but the
blacks are much deeper on the
transformer because of its glossy
display second place goes through the
e-book and once again the HP stream
comes in third by the way I should
mention real quick that neither of these
three laptops come with backlit keyboard
so you have to rely on the brightness of
the display to light up the keyboard
texts are super sharp even when scaling
on all three of the laptops and I don't
have anything bad to say on either one
of them here's a quick video sample we
their volume maxed out so you can see
and hear the differences between all of
them
is from now where were you when they
took over the planet
it's over I'm sorry
you may lose your faith in us but never
in yourselves from here the fight will
be your own productivity wise I found
that the HP stream to be the best option
simply because of the screen size I
recommend either a 13 or 14 inch laptop
for students to take advantage of the
entire screen real estate whether it be
using a split screen feature researching
or even simply typing up an essay for a
project alternatively you can hook up
the laptop to another monitor using the
full HDMI port located on the side of
the laptop you can either add a
duplicate screen to mirror everything
you do on the laptop or extend it and
use it as a second monitor if you need
extra space the same can be done using
the other two laptops solver instead of
an HDMI cable you will need a micro HDMI
cable and I'll go ahead and link a few
them down below for those of you that
are interested as long as you keep the
resolution of the monitor the same as
your laptop you won't experience any lag
so make sure to keep that in mind now
let's take a look at the performance of
each laptop starting off with the geek
bench test both of the Asus laptops are
running on a 32-bit architecture whereas
the HP stream is running on a 64-bit
architecture which is why around the 32
bit benchmark on all the laptops to keep
it a fair test and here are the scores
the HP stream on top followed by the
e-book and then the transformer and
third place rest assured I did one the
test three times on each laptop and I
pick the highest scores here is the same
test using the 64 bit benchmark on the
HP stream for those of you that are
interested and as you can see the single
core and multi-core scores are much
higher when it comes to streaming videos
unfortunately 1080p is the highest
resolution you can watch in without
stuttering or lagging and that goes for
all the laptops now let's talk about
gaming I want to recommend gaming on
these laptops at all since they don't
have the specs to support it however if
you were to play a similar game like
Minecraft and maximum field of view you
can expect an average FPS of 21 on the
Tran
former and 17.5 FPS on the e-book on the
stream if you're lucky you will get
around 15 fps and even though all the
laptops have an Intel HD graphics chip
the HP stream seems to have the worst
gaming performance this is how much
battery was drained after gaming for 30
minutes on each laptop and you guys can
apply the same principle for graphic
intensive tasks if you want to get an
idea of how long the laptop will last
from 100% to 0% all right now let's talk
about the actual battery life in real
life usage in order to get very accurate
results this is what I did I started the
day at 12 p.m. with a fresh full charge
on all the laptops the brightness was
set to 50% with balanced power plants
selected and the laptops never showed
off nor went to sleep I watch the same
video on YouTube for one hour exactly on
each laptop then I listen to 30 minutes
of music on Spotify and then the rest of
the time the laptops were left on the
homepage of YouTube until they ran out
of battery the transformer lasted from
12 p.m. to 907 p.m. which gave a total
battery life of 9 hours and 7 minutes
the e-book lasted from 12 p.m. to 11 4
p.m. which was a total battery life of
11 hours and 4 minutes
and lastly the HP stream lasted from 12
p.m. to 7:30 - which is a total count of
7 hours and 32 minutes for battery life
so based on the test the laptop with the
best battery life goes to the e-book and
these results are actually really
similar to what the manufacturer claims
on each of the laptops which reassures
me that their claims are very accurate
so in conclusion all three of these
laptops are amazing in their own
category you can't go wrong with either
one of these the Asus Transformer is
perfect for someone whose mobile and
travels a lot also someone who really
doesn't need a laptop and prefers a
tablet with a keyboard add-on as a bonus
the HP stream 13.3 is perfect for
students and everyone that prefers the
largest screen size they can get for
around 200 bucks the large surface area
on the keyboard makes it the best choice
for productivity
lastly the asus eeebook is for everyone
else and personally my favorite choice
out of the 3 the 11.6 inch screen is the
sweet spot for both portability and
productivity not to mention the awesome
lightweight design and out
Landing battery life I went ahead and
put an entire list of pros and cons for
each laptop and you guys can pause the
video if you want more time to read it
but for the sake of time I'm gonna go
ahead and finish the video so yeah
that's basically my comparison between
the three best budget laptops that you
can currently buy for around 200 bucks
if this video was helpful please leave a
like on the video to show your support
it took me more than a week to get this
video together for you guys or those of
you that have a larger budget then you
guys should definitely check the link in
the description section because I've
gathered three amazing laptops that I
personally recommend if you're looking
for a larger screen with better specs
and they're actually under the $450
price tag I also put together a list of
accessories that work well with these
laptops and you guys can find a link to
that down below as well but that's
basically it thank you guys so much for
watching if there's a specific type of
video you want to see next let me know
