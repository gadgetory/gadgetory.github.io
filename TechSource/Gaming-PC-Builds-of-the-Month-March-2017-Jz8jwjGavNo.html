I got two really cool PC bills for the
month of March for you guys so the first
one's gonna be $1,000 rise in editing
and gaming mini ITX PC and the second
one's going to be $1,550
Intel gaming PC also it's going to be
mini ITX and just a reminder guys these
videos are only to help you come up with
your ideas on your next gaming PC they
are not physical builds in fact my
monthly PC bills still will continue
that's nothing to do with these packs of
videos but anyways with that said let's
go ahead and dive right in to the rise
in editing PC so we're going with the r7
1700 because the chroma offers the best
value when it comes to any eight core
processor make sure you guys check out
my comparison video I did in case you
missed it
it does come with their race spire LED
cooler so we don't need to pick one up
but in order to overclock it we do need
either a 370 or a 350 board so in this
case we're going with the MSI be 350 am
gaming pro which will get the job done
and since we got a black and red
motherboard we have to stick with the
color scheme which is why we are picking
up to 8 gigabyte sticks from G scale
totaling 16 gigs of DDR 4 memory after
all this is an editing PC and the more
RAM you pick up the better it is
alternatively you can always pick up
only one stick of 16 gigs instead if you
want to add another 16 gigabyte stick
later down the line
since the motherboard only has two DIMM
slots but keep in mind that the resuit
gigabyte is the maximum memory that's
supported for storage you got a few
options so the main drive we're going
with the a data to 40 gigabytes m2 which
currently has the best bang for your
buck most of them tattoos at 240
gigabyte of space start at $100 so this
is a pretty solid deal for 560 megabyte
read and 520 megabytes right and for
mass storage the usual 1 terabytes WD
hard drive will do just fine the EVGA
gtx 760 super clock 60 divided very
improve i'd enough firepower for gaming
over 60 FPS high settings than 1080
resolution powering this entire build is
a 500 watt power supply from EVGA which
has plenty of juice and finally the case
we're going with is the thermaltake core
v 21 mini tower in fact both pcs in this
video are going to be using the same k
a portable yet powerful editing and
gaming rig that's only gonna cost you
guys $988 from the time of making this
video as always all the parts will be
linked below but let's move on to our
next PC I'm calling this one Snow White
on steroids it's still using the
thermaltake mini ITX tower but this one
is the core v1 and it's in white because
this entire build is going to have a
white color scheme we're going with the
7-inch 700k quad core processor and
repairing that with the azrog z 270 ITX
motherboard and we're going to overclock
it obviously so we need a solid cooler I
went with the deep cool 120 X because
not only doesn't match the color scheme
and let soap ask but it will get the job
done
and keep the temps really cool I
overclocked a 7700 K to 5 gigahertz
using this exact same cooler for one of
my subscriber builds a few weeks back I
highly recommend it
sticking with the color scheme we are
going to rock to 4 gigabyte 6 from
crucial at 2400 megahertz and for
storage we are going with these same
parts as the previous build da data to
40 gigabytes m dot 2 and 1 terabyte hard
drive from WC again don't worry about
the m dots you messing with your build
because the motherboard features a
vertical m dot 2 mounting solution so it
won't be visible the motherboard also
has some white and silver accents so
it's going to contribute to the
beautiful all-white build this wouldn't
be snow white on steroids without a GTX
1080 so why not put the best GPU out
there in a tiny build like this now
obviously this is optional you guys can
put in any GPU that fits your budget
here instead the power supply we are
using is the NZXT Hale 80 to 700 watts
which is fully modular because we are
trying to keep the cable management very
clean in this tiny Tower and we don't
need all those the necessary PSU cables
it's also white which matches the build
but it's not really going to be visible
in this case anyways so this will cost
you around $1,550 give or take if you
guys enjoy these two bills consider
leaving a like and if you didn't feel
free to dislike and if you guys want to
see a similar builder to Snow White let
me know in the comment section down
below I actually want to do a pretty
overpowered PC in such a tiny case on
the channel so I think I'll be pretty
cool for next month also let me know in
the comments section if you guys want to
see a specific type of bit
old for next month PC builds whether
it's budget related color scheme related
or whatever thing guys so much watching
as always and I'll see you in the next
