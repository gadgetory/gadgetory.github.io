tech deals of the week is canceled
because I don't have enough time to do
that every single Tuesday in fact we
have a website now deal source tech
where you guys can find all of those
deals on a website but all hell broke
loose and a lot of dislikes lot of
unsubscribing happened so I was kind of
confused why people preferred a more
video format as opposed to a website
which is much more simple you just go on
the website check out the deals and then
log off and move on with your day a lot
of you guys actually enjoy the video
formats so here it is I'm bringing it
back it's going to be every single
Tuesday just like before however my good
friend Julian is going to be the one
taking over because I don't have the
time to do this every single Tuesday I'm
focusing more on the website and I'm
focusing more on other tech related
videos so yeah pretty much you guys get
both now the website still there and now
you guys get best tech deals of the week
every Tuesday so win-win for everyone
right anyways that's basically it this
is Julian's first time at X or so make
sure you guys are nice to him don't give
them any crap obviously you will get
better as time progresses or as time
goes by I think it's always thinking
over time Julian go ahead and take it
away what's up everyone this is Julian
