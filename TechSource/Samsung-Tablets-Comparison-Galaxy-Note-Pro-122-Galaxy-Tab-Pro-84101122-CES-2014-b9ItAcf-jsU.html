Squarespace the one tool needed to

portfolio for free trial or your first

10% off what's up guys Tech source is
back in CS at the Samsung booth and
today we're gonna be comparing all the
Samsung's newly released tablets Samsung
released a total for tablets and we're
gonna be running through all the
differences in order to help you choose
what tablet best fits you so all the
tablets come with a 2560 by 1600
resolution display with the screen size
is bearing from 8.4 to 12.2 inches
both the Note pro 12.2 and Tab pro 12.2
come with three gigs of RAM
while the Tab pro 8.4 and the 10.1 both
comes sporting only two gigs both the no
pro and tap pro 12.2 come with a 9500
million batteries while the Tab pro 8.4
comes with something slightly less at
4800 followed by the 10-point one which
is at 8200 the other one's similar CPUs
are the only difference being the Tab
pro 8.4 does not have your model
available with Samsung's own 1.9
gigahertz Exynos 5 octa chipset they all
have a variant that sports Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 CPU the Note pro 12.2 is
also the only tablet that comes with the
s-pen the software experience is
somewhat similar across all tablets the
s-pen does offer more functionality by
giving access to multiple features like
being able to easily take a screen shot
at the current window and make notes as
well allowing users to open applications
in a custom sized window offering a
better multitasking experience honestly
if you're a busy guy and want to get
work done while you're on the move the
Note pro 12.2 is the best option for you
since you could take advantage of the
s-pen for more accuracy and access to
more features the screens are beautiful
across the board but we do prefer the
twelve point two inch tablets for
watching movies and consuming content
they all feel very similar in the hand
with a fake leather backing and plastic
sides and a thin body for those of you
guys who love to consume media and watch
movies and YouTube videos all day I
would go for either of the twelve point
two inch models if portability is what
you seek on the other hand the 8.4 inch
model is the ideal size while still
offering you an improved viewing
experience to that of the cell phone the
10.1 inch model is a nice sweet spot for
those
think the 8.4 inch is too small and the
12.2 inches too big so that's all the
tablet some Samsung I hope we helped you
guys out on deciding which one fits you
best if you were to pick one of these
which one would you guys prefer and why
feel free to leave a comment down below
