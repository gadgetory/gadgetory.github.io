wars episode 122 when you submit your
desk setup to get featured on the
channel if you guys want to participate
make sure to watch the video linked all
the way down below in the description
section let the setup Wars begin so guys
I've been playing this game called guns
of boom for the past month now and it's
extremely addicting so be warned because
this game will definitely eat up all of
your time YouTube is very stressful for
me one of the ways I unwind and just
take a break from making videos is by
playing guns and boom believe it or not
so instead of just talking about it I'm
gonna jump into a quick game so the
concept of the game is very simple guys
it's a four and fourteen deathmatch and
you can actually play with three random
people or you can invite your friends
and group up as well so the concept is
very simple you move around and you aim
at them and the gun automatically start
shooting you can reload just like all
first-person shooters and actually if
you aim at their head it does more
damage because it's considered a
headshot
just like that so currently my favorite
gun is the Anaconda because the longer
you shoot the faster it gets
I was in love using my sniper from time
to time if I want to slam from a
distance safely and I'd have to worry
about close quarter combat so let me so
I can snipe somebody sure you guys the
power of the manticore sniper that I'm
using right now wow that was almost a
noscope it's got a ton of weapons and
gear to choose from I really think you
guys will enjoy playing it especially if
you love overwatch or csgo I mean the
graphics the sound effects everything is
awesome on this game if you guys do
download it make sure to add me to your
friends list so we can play together my
in-game name is Tex or underscore
YouTube just like how it is on the
screen guns a boom is a real PC shooter
on mobile so join the millions that
already play the game I'll drop a link
to the app down below it is free to play
on both Android and iOS and also huge
things to guns a boom for partnering
with me to make this video possible
starting off the show we got a very
organized set up from Bua featuring the
34 inch ultra ride from LG and the
courser strafe RGB keyboard with the
logitech g502 Mouse flanking the monitor
are a pair of Logitech z5 33 speakers
and behind the monitor is a boom arm
holding up his BM 800 microphone if
you've been paying attention there are
two things that Bua has done to his
setup the first one being the carbon
fiber skins looks like he applied them
to the top of his sony MDR headphones as
well as the base of the headphone stand
and then the Logitech speakers he even
skinned his PC case the fantex
evolve which looks stunning by the way
excellent cable management inside the PC
and I noticed that you have purple
accents throughout your setup the LEDs
from the Strix 1070 and from the
keyboard and mouse the second thing I
noticed from his setup is the commitment
on that black and white contrast a white
audio rate with a white Xbox one
controller on a black shelf and vice
versa on a white shelf also the black
and white Star Wars poster we got the
black and white figurines on top of the
case and black gear on top of the
desk nicely done usually when people
have great cable management inside their
pcs their setup reflects that as well
and it's no surprise that everything is
very tidy underneath the desk most of
the cables are tucked away inside the
net and the rest of the cables are tied
together using zip ties and we also got
the power strip that is hidden inside a
cable box underneath I'm very impressed
I don't really have anything to
recommend at all it's a very clean setup
Thank You Bua for entering Hecky is next
up with a triple monitor setup featuring
two 24 inch Acer monitors sandwich king
a 1080p display from asus right in the
middle and it looks like all three
displays are hooked up to a custom back
board that he built himself it also
looks like he's using the same
countertop as my filming desk and that's
being held up by an Alex your unit and
to Ikea legs he is using the wired Apple
keyboard with an MX master but he did
drill a hole in the desk for the wire
and he also drilled a hole in the
backboard to run the monitor wires
through as well for audio is rocking the
Fat Boy microphone what is that is that
really what it's called Fat Boy from
hair microphones I gotta look this up
I'm sorry for some reason I feel like
I'm getting trolled
wow it actually exists what kind of a
company would name their mic Fat Boy on
their website it says Fat Boy brings the
fat to your home studio what the hell
does that even mean
I'm sorry but am I being naive or
something does f80 or fat mean something
in the audio world anyways back to this
setup so as other audio gear consists of
a pair of KRK Rokit five speakers with
eight-hour add-on which by the way adds
more bass to this sound output we also
got the popular a THM 50 X's the cable
management seems to be under control for
the most part there is a lot going on
underneath the desk but the Signum rack
has most of that contained
however the wires behind your PC might
need a few velcro straps or better yet a
cable sleeve I'll drop a link to when I
recommend down below speaking of your PC
I don't even know how that tiny 750ti
is handling three monitors that's pretty
crazy you know what I feel really bad if
you're watching this video toss me an
email and I'll send out a brand new gtx
ten
TTI I know it's not much but it's
definitely a nice upgrade for your rig
the only other thing that bothers me is
that light on the right side it's kind
of throwing off the balance and the
symmetry of your setup we got the boom
arm that offsets the LED lamp you have
on the left side and then you got a
random light pole it's kind of weird
because you don't have it on the desk in
some of your other pictures so maybe
it's just there for lighting in that
specific picture but either way you got
a pretty good foundation for an awesome
setup just work hard and save up for
those nice upgrades thank you hey Kay
for entering Johnny boy is next up with
an interesting setup so this is the
first ever triple monitor cubicle setup
that I've ever seen on the show he's got
two 22 inch monitors below the 45 inch
Sony smart TV and I'm just surprised
he's able to fit all this gear in such a
tiny space he's using the eraser or not
a chroma keyboard and a random budget
Wireless Gaming Mouse even though he's
got such a small space to work with he
kept his setup very clean and tidy
who needs a headphone hangar when he can
use this side of your cubicle wall as a
hangar he hooked up his turtlebeach
stealth 400 and the JBL synchros
headphones up there and look at the
placement of his snowball ice microphone
on the left side very creative you know
what will be even more creative finding
a way to hook it up behind that Sony TV
see if you can find a way to clamp the
bottom part of the boom arm to the
mounting part of the TV mount if it
works out you can hide the boom arm
behind the TV and bring it straight down
and over the TV when you need to use it
he also has a ps4 on the left side and
when he's bored from console gaming he
jumps on his PC which has an FX 6300 and
an Rx 480
I gotta give you points for putting a
piece of glass underneath your PC since
you do have carpet a lot of people just
leave their pcs on carpet and they
wonder why their pcs die after a year
cable management is also on point good
use of the velcro strap behind the PC
and I don't see any other wires
underneath your desk so nicely done
there's no question that this setup is
yours you made sure of that by posting
pictures of your childhood something
that isn't very common on setups I'm not
sure whether it's because we are
embarrassed of our child
pictures or we just simply don't have
any but it's nice to see something
refreshing on setup wars sadly our
memories fade and the only way we can
capture our past is through pictures or
video and Johnny decided to live those
moments every day he doesn't care about
how sexy or how badass has set up is the
most important thing is it works for him
and that's all that matters the fact
that you made it work with such a
limited amount of space will earn my
respect any day Thank You Johnny for
entering brace your eyeballs because
this next setup will either make you
want to pull out your eyes and eat them
or you'll make your jaw drop to your
trousers this is definitely an
interesting layout
he's got 325 inch ultra wide monitors
but the middle one is in vertical mode
and that's because he's a professional
software developer and he uses the
vertical display for coding as you guys
can see in this picture behind the
monitors he's got two Philips 2.1
speakers and on the desk he is using the
Texas mechanical keyboard with the red
dragon kirua 502 Mouse I gotta say that
desk looks really nice and apparently it
was custom made by a carpenter and he
said that he didn't want to drill a hole
for the keyboard a mouse because it
would ruin the beautiful desk and I can
understand I mean your cable management
is perfect anyway is no need to drill
any unnecessary holes if you don't want
to it looks like he hooked up his power
strip underneath the desk and he placed
his subwoofer on his PC now I don't know
if that's a good idea because the
vibrations might damage the components
inside your case over time but I don't
know maybe you're fine speaking to the
PC is rocking an i 360 100 and the msi
gtx 1060 with 16 gigs of ram by the way
I did read your message and I thank you
for the kind words stuff like that
really reinforces the reason why I do
YouTube every single day I'm glad that I
could help and thank you again for
watching he basically wrote down that he
watches almost all my videos and he's
learned to build a custom PC and a clean
desk setup from it he followed all my
guidelines from building a PC to cable
management and he built his very own
setup and I'm guessing this is the
picture of his setup before everything
was put together a simple symmetrical
and very clean setup by the way I like
them honest
on your desk thank you rev for entering
Jesus mother of all black and blue balls
what the hell is going on over here now
this is a creative setup Wow
black on blue with wooden accents now
that is an interesting color combination
this dude even framed his acoustic
panels he legit framed them with wooden
pieces this is gonna blow your mind guys
are you ready for this the wall that he
mounted his PC and monitor on actually
comes out and he kept all the cables and
the power strips behind that let me
rephrase that
he cable managed inside of a wall this
episode was over okay I'm just gonna
give this to you please it would be my
honor if you were to take the seal of a
pool for me and also here take this $100
cash prize and also if you want you can
take home a text source t-shirt so if
you're watching this video toss an email
set up boards at gmail.com and claim
your prize because you definitely
deserve it this setup is not only unique
but it's symmetrical organized and it
has purpose well done this entire room
is fitted with black and blue acoustic
foams and he even has a dedicated
station for recording audio the blue
yeti microphone with the isolation
shield as a disgusting combo and I mean
disgusting in the best possible way it's
ridiculous with that isolation shield
does for voiceovers if you guys on one
of those then you know what I'm talking
about
I love to set up even more now because I
just realized he's rocking the same
speakers as me but in black instead so
on the left side he's got a pair of
Audio Technica m50 X's which are skinned
by the brands of course and he's got his
pixel XL right next to that he's using
the Corsair k-6 t5 keyboard with the
Logitech g600 Mouse and a black and blue
mousepad I swear everything is literally
either black or blue or both even its
chair I mean the consistency and the
commitment is insane
all right now that I've calmed down
let's take a look at his beast PC right
there in the center so I'm expecting
something ridiculous oh it's actually
not that bad I mean he's only walking a
6850 k-6
core processor 32 gigs of ram and two
gtx frickin 1080s jesus lord have mercy
on my soul
the entire build has custom painted
parts and he even added blue carbon
fiber skins to some of the parts are you
kidding me
it doesn't even end here he has another
setup on the opposite side of this room
and I mean I don't even know where to
begin on this one he managed to mount
his monitor keyboard mouse and even his
PC on the side of a writing desk not on
it but on the side I bet you this is
what he was thinking in his mind before
he decided to do this hmm
I definitely need another setup for my
room but I got no more space what should
I do you know what screw it who needs a
surface for a setup I'm just gonna use
this side of my furniture and create a
set up there so when the desk Keys got
the Xbox one which of course is skinned
in black and blue carbon fiber skins but
why stop there if you can skin the
router as well and he's also got quite
the collection of GPUs showcased here
apparently he's a PC mater and he's also
got an anti-static mat over here with a
bunch of tools and a drawer full of PC
accessories Zacks organization is
definitely on another level that's for
sure and to top it all off this entire
room was modded by him this is actually
what the room looked like before he
added the wooden walls he does have a
youtube channel I want to give him a
shout out because his setup is very
impressive it's called next tech news
make sure you guys check him out and
tell them that texts or sent you maybe
even compliment him on his setup video
I'll double ting to his channel below so
definitely check it out guys my only
question to you Zack is where the hell

taking requests on their new 35 inch
curved gaming monitor that features a 2
millisecond response time
100 Hertz refresh rate and a 34 40 by
1440p VA panel with free sync the
monitor is rocking a VA panel which is
known for their high contrast ratio
deeper blacks and virtually zero light
bleed it's also great for productivity

all these awesome features in an ultra
wide gaming monitor for only five
hundred and fifty dollars so if you guys
