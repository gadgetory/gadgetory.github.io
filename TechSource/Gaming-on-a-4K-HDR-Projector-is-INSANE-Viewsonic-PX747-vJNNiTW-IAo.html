gaming setup can be very pricey
especially if you're using a traditional
TV but ever since Texas Instruments
released matrix chip we've seen an
influx of affordable 4k projectors in
the market
however the brightest and the most
affordable one you can purchase right
now is this the viewsonic px 747 a sub
$1300 4k projector that was sent to us
by viewsonic to review considering the
4k claim it might seem too good to be
true and somewhat it is the actual image
is 1920 by 1080 but what the Texas
Instruments chip enabled was pixel
shifting a clever trick that shifts the
red and blue sensors by fractions of a
pixel to create a sharper image although
I've heard from other sources that there
is a slight difference when looking at
the viewsonic image side-by-side with a
true 4k projector but those usually run
a few thousand dollars more now if
somebody told me that this was a true 4k
projector honestly I wouldn't even know
the image is so sharp that I couldn't
even tell the difference now fortunately
the projector does not come with
built-in Wi-Fi however it does have a
wide variety of connections on the back
we get audio in and out ports VGA HDMI
and a mini USB along with a few other
ports the projector also has a 12-volt
trigger which can be used with a
motorized screen so when the projector
gets powered on the screen will
automatically lower which is pretty cool
also on the back of the projector you'll
find Kensington lock which is great if
you want to use this at a classroom or
office to secure the projector and on
the top there is two wheels what is four
zoom and the others for focus also up
here we got a few buttons we got one for
power as well as a few other options if
you want to change settings right from
the projector however it does come with
a backlit remotes although it's not the
prettiest remote out there it does give
you quick access to some settings you
can change on the fly instead of
reaching to the projector to do it so on
both sides of the projector you'll find
the Vance
and it's for the built-in fans inside
and they do ramp up as you begin using
the projector over time however if
you're playing games or watching content
on it you hardly even hear that alright
taking a look on the bottle of projector
you will find two adjustable feet which
lets you adjust the height and as well
as mounting points if you do decide to
mount this on the ceiling for example
guys you can project up to 300 inches
which is just mind-blowing you can make
your very own private home theater
system assuming you even have that much
space on your wall to use unfortunately
I don't have a wall big enough in my
office or back at my home to utilize the
full 300 inches this thing gets up to
3,500 lumens which makes it one of the
brightest we have seen what this means
for the user is that you can use it
during both daytime and nighttime but at
higher brightness levels the colors do
get a little washed out so make sure to
watch out for that so the lap inside
this theme can last up to 15,000 hours
and that's using super eco mode which
also lowers the brightness now if you're
watching content with maximum brightness
the entire time then that lowers the
lifespan to around 4,000 hours alright
so let's talk gaming I'm gonna take this
downstairs to the gaming then load up a
fortnight and Uncharted on my ps4 Pro
and see how it handles while gaming
hi guys so I'm playing for now right now
and it looks incredible the cool thing
about this is that I don't even notice
any input lag which is crazy considering
the size of the projection so yeah guys
if you game on your TV you're not gonna
tell the difference and input lag
switching over to this projector unless
you have a crappy TV then it's gonna be
a lot quicker all right now the audio
quality on the projector is pretty bad
it's a 10 watt speaker and let me
actually increase it to max that's max
it doesn't even get that loud and the
quality is not even great so I do
strongly recommend using an external
audio source for example for us setup we
are using an LG sound bar and it sounds
so much better another thing you get
what the projector is HDR so if you're
watching HDR content or playing HDR
games you're gonna take advantage of
that amazing dynamic range you get
deeper blacks vivid colors needless to
say if you combine all that with the
sound bar it makes the entire viewing
experience that much more immersive the
blacks are deep but it won't compare to
an OLED or even other projectors at a
higher price point and out of the box
the colors we're a little washed out but
that was easily fixed by tweaking the
color profile since the image is being
projected on a wall and not being
displayed on a panel just like
traditional TVs there's gonna be no
color shifting so you can pretty much
watch this from any angle and there will
be no distortion so what types of
content can you consume with the
projector honestly is pretty much
supports anything that has HDMI anything
from console gaming to PC you can even
hook up your Roku or fire TV or even
just your cable box or if you have
DirecTV or Time Warner you connected via
HDMI and you're pretty much good to go
as someone who's never used a 4k
projector for consuming content or
especially playing games I gotta say
it was a positive experience overall
switching over from a standard TV the
image quality really impressed me you
get a screen size up to 300 inches in a
portable form factor but who's this
projector for exactly well first of all
I want to say that it's not for people
looking to replace their current TV it's
more for people that want to build this
awesome entertainment or even a home
theater system right in their room
someone who has the necessary space on
their wall to take advantage of the
massive 300 inches and also somewhere
that you can control the lighting
imagine having a projector set up and
inviting your friends or guests over
that's pretty awesome to be honest if
you got the space and room for it and
you do plan on using it multiple times a
week then this would be a really nice
upgrade to your current home but if
you're not gonna be using it as
constantly and you don't have the space
for it then it would be a waste of money
to buy it but anyways that does it for
my review of the viewsonic px 747 if you
guys want to check it out I'll drop a
link to it down below thanks so much for
watching and as always I will see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
