to Urbo today we're going to be taking a
look at our keyring charger this is a
great way to charge or sync your mobile
devices this particular one is designed
for Apple devices so it has a USB
connector on one side and a lightning
connector on the other side but I'm
going to show you this product in action
here so you can see what really makes it
unique and that is of course on my key
ring
so I'll just zoom in so you can get a
little closer look so what I really like
about this product is that it's firstly
it's ultra small it's not going to
tangle and it has a magnetic loop so
that it can easily close with a positive
lock there and it's also very easy to
remove from the keyring now I know that
personally I often lose my lightning
cables but I never lose my keys so by
combining the two I'm sure that I'm
always able to charge and sync my mobile
device on the go it's available in four
different colors as you can see and you
can buy them individually as well it
outputs 5 volts 1.5 amps that's just a
standard charging voltage and amperage
and of course it's available in a micro
USB connector for your Android devices
it doesn't have to go on a keyring it
could definitely go on something else I
actually have a backpack with me today
just to give you an example of what it
looks like you know on another here we
go here here it is on my backpack
easy to put on easy to take off and very
hard to lose once again this is the ER
bow keyring charger and it's for your
mobile devices Apple or Android and
thank you for watching

hey guys I'm Jeff hi guys I'm Helmut I
think it's amazing how many people have
the same experience with their earbuds
it definitely is you know an earbud
problem you know they're falling out you
can tell people are kind of pushing them
back in or they're uncomfortable they
make your ears tender so we needed to
create a solution in that solution is
your hooks when you're running you know
outside or when you're working out in
the gym you want something to stay with
you as an active person you want to
achieve that focus where you can push
yourself to a limit that you've never
been before and why be distracted by any
of your bud when you don't have to be
and we don't want you to think this is
only for athletes this problem of
earbuds falling out is so common so what
we've created with ear hooks is a
universal attachment that connects to
almost all in-ear circular earbuds that
increases their fit increases their
comfort as far as design goes we really
looked at every piece of ear hooks as
you can see we've got a shark fin design
on the top here which we call the tip on
this piece is what disperses a lot of
the weight of the actual earbud you see
you've got the elastic tire here which
stretches on and off we've did a lot of
testing we relentlessly tweaked and
changed the design we prototyped over 20
different ear hooks throughout the
process the testing range from running
cycling swimming surfing we really try
to do everything we could to make sure
that these ear hooks could endure and
with every environment that they would
ever see we were very thoughtful in our
design process each step of the way
we've redesigned and we've reproduced
and we've retested and we know now that
we have a product that is passing all
those tests we have flying colors the
same way athletes push themselves to be
great at what they do
we've pushed ourselves to make your
hooks great at what they do
right now your hooks are something that
not too many people know about but the
people that do know about it have had a
great response we want to share this
product with the world and we can only
do that with your help we're hoping this
will be a collaboration hoping to learn
more about our product from all of you I
want to hear some stories from you guys
and you know really make this a great
product together when you talk about
listening to music it makes you want to
move then with your hooks you finally
can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
