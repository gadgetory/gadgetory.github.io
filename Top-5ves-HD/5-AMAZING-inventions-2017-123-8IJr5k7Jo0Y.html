this is the Urbanek smart electric wheel
and it is the only difference between
your existing bike and a fully
functional electric bike by simply
replacing the front wheel of the bike
you already own it will turn into an
electric bike and take your cycling to
the next level it flattens out the hill
and beats down any headwinds it shortens
the distance by making it faster and
getting to your destination without
breaking a sweat
urban X electric wheel fits any size and
type of bike either v brake or disc
spring so you can enjoy the benefits of
an electric bike while keeping the bike
you already have it comes in either
twaddle version or pedal-assist version
the choice is yours all the components
including motor battery and other
electronics are well contained within
the wheel just a few steps of quick
installation and a new electric bike is
ready to ride we've engineered an app
that lets you choose whether or not to
use its features like distance and speed
tracking battery life readout and ride
mapping those are for you that enjoy the
wheel free from any device
the innovative detachable battery makes
it possible to extend your range
instantly while the built-in USB outlet
can keep your phone or other devices

about up slopes or long distances with
speed of up to 20 miles per hour and the
ability to travel up to 30 miles with
one single battery your venture can take
you further
Urban X is all about fun recreation
freedom and accessibility our dream is
to kick start the bike revolution and
make cycling popular again you can be
part of it together let's make it happen
we're always trying to deliver what
gamers really want and in this case it's
an uncompromised untethered solution the
total freedom of a wireless mouse with
no worry about whether or not you
haven't charged the fundamental
technology behind power play is fairly
simple it's been around for over a
hundred years but to actually implement
that technology into a super thin form
factor that's easy to use was incredibly
difficult the end result is a product
that you simply plug it in put your
mouse on the mat and you go with the
power play solution we have the ability
to charge not only when the mouse is
just sitting there but anytime you're
using it as well so you get basically
infinite power one of the great things
about power play is that it has a
Lightspeed receiver built-in which means
not only are you going to have unlimited
charging but you're also going to have
an incredibly stable and high-speed
connection to the wireless receiver yeah
we've been working on this for about
four years now it's a very
straightforward concept but the actual
effort and engineering and science to
put together something that can build an
energy field large enough to allow you
to move your mouse while you're charging
is incredibly complex and we're calling
it power play included with the Logitech
G wireless charging system are a hard
Mouse mat a cloth mouse mat the power
play bass a data and charging cable and
a power core module to set it up
choose the surface that you'd like to
use either cloth or heart plug the USB
capable into the back of the power play
bass and into your PC the light will
flash blue and show that it is turned on
remove the weight door from the bottom
of your G 9:03 or g7o pretty mouse
insert our core into the bottom of the
mouse and turn it on once you turn the
mouse on it will automatically pair with
the power play bass and you're ready to
go there's a Lightspeed receiver
embedded in the power play bass so
automatically you are now communicating
wirelessly to your computer
the powerplay charging system when you
combine the power of Lightspeed Wireless
with the fact that you never have to
charge your mouse ever
due to unlimited power that's an
incredible combination I think a lot of
gamers have had this dream and now with
Logitech G for making it a reality
from the people that brought you the
five tribe range of powerful resonant
speakers which took the world by storm
five tribe now brings you the mini troll
the world's smallest waterless resident
speaker it turns anything into a speaker
by literally spreading the sound waves
through the material of this place come
and it is still small enough to fit in
your jeans many pockets
tons of water the mini troll is based on
the innovative technology developed by
the US Navy for military use in
submarines the unique thing about this
is its resonance core that transforms
electromagnetic pulses into vibrations
which spread directly across any surface
you choose transforming any surface into
a powerful speaker simply turn on your
mini drone place it on the hard surface
and enjoy your music with quality
powerful its vacuum thing will make sure
your mini troll stays right where you
put it in the small traditional speakers
the sound is propagated from a small
membrane and this naturally limits the
fountain
instead with many trophy the sound is
projected by the mass of the chosen
surface allowing much higher salma
furthermore in the traditional membrane
speaker the sound comes from a specific
direction instead the chosen surface
projects the sounds in every direction
creating a surround the chemical
everyone will hear the same sound making
it perfect for entertaining
camping relaxing at home even the office
the mini troll is great for extending
the audio of a laptop or for making easy
hands-free conference call the 360
degrees down will ensure everyone hears
the same information we've been working
tirelessly over the last 12 months to
miniaturize the technology about
well-loved 5 tribe resonant frequencies
without compromising the sound quality
or losing any of the key distinctive
grant factors we need your help to
mass-produce the mini troll can get a
tool or joystick
stop listening to your music put
low-quality classic Bluetooth speakers
the last few weeks back choose the
quality of the flower metal Italian
design mini troll which comes with an
automatic 24 month warranty worldwide
