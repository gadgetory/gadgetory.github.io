Oh
hi everyone my name is lock from a
product design engineer I would like to
share with you guys my day-to-day
community experience
just like many people a lot listening
missing from my ipod during the journey
to work however I'm always struggling
with tangled cable apart from travelling
a whole cable management to be an issue
at home or in office too I also believe
most of us would hit cables falling on
floor
inspired and motivated by the problems
mentioned above I have come up with an
idea i created my co and they take cable
organizer simple yet practical solution
you
with the use of magnets you can keep
your headphone on to your shirt so that
you will not string wrong especially you
are drawing
he also took your head
from falling where the Yippies come off
from views we have gone through numerous
prototype and tested in many rows until
we are now confident to bring my co into
production niko is produced by edible
oil molding process with using pc abs
and t-butyl a stoma as a material with
two magnets integrated on both ends for
the beguine nikova come in three colors
for you to choose from which is black
chambray and navy blue makeup platform
is made of aluminum material by cnc
machining process it comes with two
colors black and silver anodized finish
now we didn't have an support to pledge
us in kickstarter so that we can promote
go into final production you will get
special price for virgin or sinking
paddle certain 30 family and friends
will be much appreciated as well thank
you for watching we hope you love Nicole
what do people want I mean really what
drives people is it money is it power or
isn't something simpler take Eve we're a
global community is formed around the
small team and its passion for great
hardware together they're creating the
first ever crowd developed computer what
drives this community to keep on pushing
themselves to study learn debate and
then says time and again that every
detail is considered
people want a great display whether it's
for watching movies editing images or
just working in the Sun this is
important it's our window into the world
it should be the best and so our
community fought it out until they got
the screen they wanted music melody the
sound of your family's dream dude from a
world away the community one of the best
audio then we've answered with the most
advanced and powerful audio
configuration out there we throw
ourselves into designing the most
beautifully crafted and functional
computer imagine big companies are
racing for the slimmest devices possible
but when the eve community realized that
real all day battery life would only
cost them a millimeter it was a
no-brainer people want to create objects
of beauty tools that are perfectly
balanced
they will achieve mastery and take pride
in the details that's why they rejected
the bloatware keeping this tool sharp
and true today we live in virtual spaces
and in these spaces we dream together we
dream of the things we will make things
that one day we will touch our dreamers
have pushed us to make the V the king of
ports they realize the value of
connection today we're proud to
introduce our computer
it's been made by our passion to
community v what people want
in the mid-1800s typewriters and
calculators started to become common
we've come a long way since then and a
lot has changed in the last hundred and
fifty years thanks to the endless march
of human ingenuity we've created
industries we've designed technologies
that make our lives easier safer and
more efficient from big things like
travel and communications to things that
we just now take for granite like
refrigeration it's a great time to be
alive this is the most comfortable era
in human history with some key
exceptions the workplace not much has
changed in the last century sure our
technologies are slicker faster more
efficient but even with the advent of
the lightweight laptop we're still
bending to our machines and working on
tables and chairs like we did in 1899
let alone 1999 and it's all rather
surprising considering all the studies
suggesting that sitting and slouching
decreases productivity inhibits
creativity and is just generally bad for
a long-term health somehow there has to
be a better way
for the past five years the team of
successful serial entrepreneurs have set
out to change the way we work to
redefine how we interact with our
computers with well over a million
dollars of angel investment and founder
funding our coalition designers
engineers and creatives have developed a
dynamic workstation that caters to a
growing number of high-intensity
computer users
and after much
an error and progressive prototypes we
are excited to share it introducing the
alt workstation
it allows users to work in four key
productivity positions whether you want
to sit stand collaborate or focus our
patented technology provides continuous
comfort while your computer seamlessly
moves with you all with the simple push
of a button for decades sitting at work
with standard with alt work any position
can be standard you choose we've adapted
to our computers sitting and slouching
for far too long isn't it time they
adapt to us
why hasn't someone built a workstation
like this before because it's really
really hard
