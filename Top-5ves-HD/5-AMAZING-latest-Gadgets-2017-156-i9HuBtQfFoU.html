hi I'm SPO I'm a printer I don't have
any fancy lights whistles or bottle
openers but what I do have is pretty
awesome I have the ability to print on
just about anything in fact if it can be
printed on I'm the one to do it
I can do all of this because I don't
have a feeder instead I'm a free access
printer which means I don't care how
thick heavy or high what you want me to
print on is just put me on top of what
you want me to print on choose the file
you want to print from your preferred
device and hit print I do the rest of it
because I use a patented retractable
tread system I stay accurate and aligned
throughout any print job so whether
you're printing a cut out for a pattern
a poster like no other or some shirts
for any upcoming crowdfunding video I'm
the last printer you will ever need I'm
SPO and I simply print on everything I'm
not perfect yet but with your help I
will be soon now let me introduce you to
my inventor hi I'm Joey and for 25 years
I worked in the print industry I came up
with the idea of SPO after I realized
how many customers we were having to
turn away for jobs they were either too
small for the quantity that we needed to
require for our jobs to be done they
couldn't afford the jobs for the
quantities that they were doing or it
was just a matter of price and quality
and the timeframe that they needed it so
I came up with SPO since there was
nothing else out there like it
everything about SPO had to be
engineered from the ground up from
designing and milling high-grade
reinforced treads with the fiberglass
reinforced mesh to eliminate stretching
a retractable system that maintained
alignment throughout any size print job
two cartridges with embedded hardware so
SPO reacts differently depending on what
you were printing on everything about
SPO has been made to fit in the smallest
footprint possible to maintain
portability after three years of
development and work and a team of
awesomely dedicated people who have been
working two jobs sometimes more to make
this happen we're now at the point where
we need your help we have our utility
patent set everything is in motion our
product is working everything
you see in this video none of it's an
illustration it's not perfect but it's
really close with your help I know that
we can get there and get the rest of the
way as of right now most of our custom
internals are made using 3d printers
unfortunately even the best 3d printers
on the market aren't perfect and those
imperfections on gears gantry's in the
body itself caused a slight drift that
has a ghosting effect on the printing
this will be resolved by having the
internals machined and milled as well as
making them out of more durable
materials than PLA plastic finally there
is no open source large format printing
software on the market right now so SPO
is limited to an eight and a half by 11
inch printing size we need to hire on a
software programmer so that SPO can
print on anything as small as a business
card or as large as a billboard easily
and efficiently as our goal is to have
SPO manufactured assembled and shipped
here in the US we have spent years
sourcing as many solutions to these
hurdles as possible and now have
everyone in place to be able to move
forward by backing us you will soon be
able to simply print on everything and
even if you can't help monetarily by
just sharing us on your social media
outlets you would do a lot for us thanks
a lot I appreciate it thanks again for
watching this video and if you have any
questions don't hesitate to contact us
because we're as excited about this as
hopefully you are thanks
you
the last couple of years has really been
about us just becoming obsessed with
understanding where time tracking and
recording fits within the overall space
of someone's workday what we wanted to
do with tiller was make time tracking
much more accessible and immediate to
make time tracking a better experience
than all of the software based products
before it we really sat down and said if
we were going to start this from scratch
and really look at this problem from
first principles would you come up with
an app or a plug-in to solve this or is
this something else that will make this
actually a better experience available
so our idea was what if we combined more
tactile Hardware solution with software
tiller is a small USB powered device it
recognizes and something's touching it
and inside it is a bearing that turns
allowing you to turn the dial and switch
between tasks or clients it has a light
in the center of it which indicates to
you whether you're tracking or not
tracking the times we found that the
fact that it's a physical object means
that when you're engaging with it it
brings a sort of a mindfulness and a
deliberateness to the work you're doing
a lot of our process involves users
getting to test the prototype or use the
prototype versions that we have and that
feeds into the process of design and
development a lot of our early work was
fast prototyping versions of the
software and hardware to get everything
right and where it is today we're really
getting into the nitty-gritty of
interaction design when you touch this
thing how does the interface appear on
the computer when you turn it what
happens is it as fast as it president
need to be and is it too intrusive or is
it to hit him and these are really small
things that we've had to tweak over and
over again even though till is designed
to work as a standalone product people
are already using lots of different time
tracking solutions in their businesses
so till it integrates directly with a
lot of the tools that freelancers and
small businesses are accustomed to using
things like harvest and zero technology
when it's done right should allow you to
do more of the things that you care
about it interested in and spend less
time on the things that don't really
excite you that much
we've developed this thing for the last
couple of years and be really pleasing
to see you know this thing roll out to
teams and individuals and really
possibly in fact their work we're just
really excited to share tiller with the
whole community
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
