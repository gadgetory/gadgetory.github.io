to make dovetails that are perfectly
centered in your stock market
you
you
against the vertical stock
put your template on top and match up
the back of the slots with your layout
line then use the locknut and brass
thumb screw to clamp the template in
place insert your tail boards in the
front of the jig and put them up to the
bottom of the template now install the
dovetail bit in your router attach the
guide bushing to the router base plate
set the bit depth to 5/8 of an inch
and now you're ready to route put the
router on top of the template before
turning it on make a climb cut and then
route the dovetails
route slowly from left to right
then remove the pieces from the jig and
test the fit and a cymbal
quested by our customers the dowling
center bar has precision location
notches an inch a metric scale with an
adjustable end stop and stainless steel
guide bushings that allows you to drill
perfectly spaced and centered endgrain
holes every time so just a line squeeze
and drill to make perfect dowels without
needing to clap our jig or tighten knobs
or handles with the MT doweling jig you
can align the precision machine notches
on the jig Center bar with dowel
location marks anywhere along your board
edge or use the adjustable Center bar
end stop for drilling 2 or 3 precisely
spaced and grain holes this feature
allows perfect alignment of face frame
styles and top and bottom rails the
Handy inch millimeter scale lets you
accurately set the stop what could be
easier the MT doweling jig comes with
three stainless steel drill guide
bushings in both 1/4 inch and
three-eighths inch drill sizes and just
like our Center gage the new doweling
jig easily and accurately finds the dead
center of your board every time
no tedious trial and error adjustments
required the MT doweling jig lets you
drill a series of equally spaced holes
along the edge of a board after drilling
their first three dowel holes slide the
dowel jig along the board till the first
drill guide bushing aligns with the last
drill to hold and then insert the index
pin and continue drilling to make more
dowel holes it's that easy people ask us
if we can use our quad trimmer for
t-bone so I'll show you how that works
very simple you got your team molding
take your flush cut tremors come right
up to the end you cut that off really
nice and you can make a second cut if
you need to so you've got that done
we'll do both sides very simple now you
take the quad trimmer you put it on
there then get to do a perfect job just
like that tea molding with the new quad
trimmer from Pascal over seven specific
router operations the crb7 comes with
two different sizes of guide rods and
the rod spacing is adjustable
guaranteeing a perfect fit with almost
every router available the crb7
functions right out of the box as an
offset base the large footprint adds
stability to your edge forming
operations keeping the router stable
even when working around corners
the included pivot pin and screw store
magnetically in the bridge installing
the pin instantly converts the crb7 for
circle cutting the stock base can cut
circles and arcs from 3/4 of an inch to
nearly 9 inches in radius the micro
adjust wheel allows for precise setting
of the bit so that your cuts are exactly
where you want them to be and unlike
most other router jigs circle size
adjustment can be made without
disturbing the position on the board
circles and arcs up to four feet in
diameter can be cut using the included
large circle compass kit the micro
adjust wheel helps place the bit exactly
where needed anywhere on the circle
attach the included centering pins to
cut precision mortises turning the base
and keeping both pins tied on the part
guides the router on stock up to 5
inches thick the micro adjust wheel
makes cutting centered and offset
mortises easy and accurate and allow
simple adjustment for cutting wide
mortises more accurately than ever
the included anti-tilt leg is used to
keep the router from tipping when riding
on a template tall or narrow stock or
when working close to the end of a panel
cutting rabbit's grooves and datas using
a straight edge guide is simpler than
ever with the crb7 no need to try and
set the straight edge exactly the micro
adjust wheel allows you to fine-tune the
offset perfectly
index cutting of regularly spaced
grooves is a breeze with the crb7 adding
a guide strip to the supplied holes on
the base makes consistent cutting of
spaced grooves across a panel simple and
accurate the guide rails and micro
adjust wheel allow for very accurate
adjustment of the spacing
and this method also allows for making
v-groove fluted or even beadboard faux
panels with the optional edge trimming
kit the crb7 becomes the fast and safe
way to trim edge banding no more holding
large panels on edge and trying to
balance the router on a narrow surface
you can now do your trimming flat with
superior control
the optional edge guide allows for
routing deep within a panel while
guiding off an edge the guide rails and
micro adjust wheel allow you to set the
cut precisely where you want it the edge
guide comes pre-drilled with holes for
mounting a sacrificial fence when
milling on or close to the edge of a
part and power tools crb7 mark 3
provides amazing control and ease of use
over seven major routing operations
making your woodworking more effective
and enjoyable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
