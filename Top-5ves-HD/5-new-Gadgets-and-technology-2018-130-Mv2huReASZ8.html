rechargeable it can hold a charge 15
plus hours wholly lit the eos
automatically lights up when you put it
on your finger the LEDs in the EOS lasts
over 25 years we've worked hard to
develop three prototypes and we have
taken huge steps to get this product
where it is today introducing yuffie
ever cam the first of its kind home
security system that gives you
everything you want with none of the
hassles no need for wires and no need to
deal with frequent battery changes 365
days of battery life we partnered with
Ankur to put their most advanced battery
technology inside the ever camp and by
using a low frequency transmission
signal to stay connected on standby mode
saving energy by up to 70% ever cam will
keep on working for up to a year without
needing to be recharged with the
adjustable ball shape mount ever cam can
be positioned and repositioned use
either the single screw mounting base or
skip the mounting hardware the magnetic
1080p HD camera will just stick to all
kinds of metal surfaces
ever cam withstands temperature changes
and moisture so you really can put it
just about anywhere motion triggered and
Wi-Fi connected ever cam sends you a
notification when someone's at the door
or someone's on the sofa even when
someone is raiding the fridge the
artificial intelligence uses a
three-phase system to ensure you see
what you want to see and ignore what you
don't step one it's able to screen out
movement that doesn't have a heat
signature using an infrared sensor step
two it detects human body shapes in
various positions and step three facial
recognition technology allows ever cam
to recognize faces of people you want to
give clearance to or keep a closer eye
on so just set your preferences to send
an alert when it matters and ignore it
when it doesn't oh yeah and it has
two-way audio Brian step away from the
pizza we are the first to put an SD card
into a home base securely storing 60
days of footage locally no need to go to
the cloud no up charges or monthly
contracts we have a great team of top
engineers software developers AI experts
and we are working with industry leading
manufacturers to make all this happen
we've built an amazing system that's
ready to go right out-of-the-box easy to
set up yourself without compromising
security but we need your help to take
what we have and get it to market no one
else is offering a wireless camera with
a year of battery life and ever cam just
keeps getting better by the day there
are a ton of other great features so
make sure you check out all the stuff on
our campaign page we have suppliers in
place the prototype is done all we need
is your support this is comm bar the
only heavy duty multi-tool that combines
the core tools needed for the outdoors
in ax a hammer and a spade along with
dedicated room in the handle for a
magazine or comm bars knife and soft all
tools fold into a rapid activation
system that weighs only 3/4
two pounds has former officers of the
IDF Special Forces and about outdoorsmen
we know that the only way to execute a
successful operation is by sweating the
details
cutting absolutely no corners and
planning for every possible outcome we
applied the exact same logic when
creating calm our our first role was to
make a tool with a lifetime warranty the
starting point was to ensure that each
tool was developed according to US
military spec standards but since no
such combined tool exists there are no
standards for it so we created a new
standard we put comm bar under heavy
loads and smash the rocks with it we
left it in water for a week and poured
sand into every opening after every
torture test we double-checked that each
tool was still fully functional and
locked securely in place making sure
safety mechanisms are up to the
challenge the only way to create a life
lasting tool is to use live blasting
materials comm bars main body is made of
aircraft-grade aluminum the hammer is
stainless steel his Spade is made of a
single piece of titanium and the axe
combines both titanium and stainless
steel through naval sharpening the
different parts are meticulously fused
together to a single sturdy unit can
outperform
any task to provide a great grip while
using these tools the ergonomically
designed and well-balanced handle
completes calm bar into a tool that
feels perfect in your hand inside the
handle there's room for calm bars not
made of stainless steel and crafted as a
top survival knife next to it is a place
for the saw made of aircraft aluminum
and polymer with a blade replacement
mechanism for full flexibility to carry
combi we created a holster and a case
designed for durability and rapid
activation because nature doesn't wait
for you to find your gear we've been
developing calm bar for three and a half
years to make sure it comes out perfect
light sturdy iconic wherever you go with
it and whatever you do with it calm bar
is the perfect heavy duty outdoor
multi-tool
the game world for one second can
determine the difference between victory
and defeat quick cans are crucial this
is why we oftentimes see professional
gamers using hand warmers cold hands
slow you down significantly but sweaty
hands caused by hyperhidrosis for
intense gaming moments can be just as
bad and what about those annoying table
tugs all these factors add up and slow
you down and nothing out there really
addresses these issues efficiently
instead they can create new problems
like leaving us with a cluttered desk
this is why the inevitable appears and
see how it can boost your performance
the inevitable if fingers instantly it's
quiet it uses very little energy and it
has three heat levels that puts you in
control the fan that'll cool your hands
is powerful yet quiet three fan speeds
will provide you with just the right
amount of breeze pro gamers still prefer
corded mice for speed and reliability
the included Mouse bungee will help you
execute smooth fast and precise
movements now there's always a port with
an easy reach with our three port USB
hub
touch switches don't break and look
great control the knife attack
effortlessly with your fingertips in
case of overheating or when not in use
the device will shut down automatically
for safety and energy saving as you can
see the designs are finalized the
prototypes are fully functional and we
are now ready for production to bring
the inevitable if-- we require capital
for the expensive tooling costs buying
components at a bulk discount and much
more back us now and reward your hard
working hands with in an editing and
have your desk looking like this at the
same time
