kubo revolutionizes the way we teach
coding with the introduction of the tech
time programming language two years ago
Daniel and I started a research-based
project to teach children in the age 4
to 10 about basic coding we did this
because we believe programming skills
are essential for kids to acquire to
succeed in the 21st century the result
of this project is cool robot in 2034
it's estimated that forty seven percent
of all the job supper know today will no
longer exist they'll be taken over by
robotics and artificial intelligence
therefore kids need to learn basic
coding skills in order to work side by
side with technology the problem with
the way we teach coding today is that we
introduce it too late and we use to
complex tools you're taking coding out
of the screen non to the table so coding
becomes as easy as doing a puzzle game
the robot consists of two parts a hit
and the body it's so intuitive that all
you have to do is to assemble the tool
and kugel is ready for action khoobam
revolutionizes the way we teach coding
with the introduction of the tech time
programming language when you use the
tactile coding package children learn
crucial 21st century skills like
collaboration communication critical
thinking and creativity you can also add
the language packets and children will
learn to spell their first words for
every kubo subject packets we provide
learning material with examples and
therefore Google can both be used in
schools and in homes schools preschool
toy
our design philosophy is if you design
for children you should design with the
children that's the reason why we
involve children in every important
design decision it is our dream that
every child will have the opportunity to
learn coding from a very early age when
you support Kudo you help us achieve
that dream if you want to support or
learn more about the kuba robot project

let's face it water can be lots of fun
until we need to drink it sure we know
it's healthy but it just doesn't taste
as exciting as all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more that Chuck hey and
that's a problem a very big problem so
we decided to put some fun into drinking
water with the right cup it's the
world's first ever fruit flavored cup
designed to get people drinking more
water sure it might look simple but it
actually took six years of research and
patented technologies to get where we
are today and we believe it's going to
be a real game thing so how does it work
well for starters our brain identifies
flavor using two main senses taste and
smell that's why we inserted innovative
fda-approved fruit scent and flavor
directly into the right cup so when you
drink water from it your nose picks up
for fruity aroma your tongue senses the
hint of a sweet taste and your brain
yells when in fact you're only drinking
natural water oh wow sounds great but
does it work well we asked ourselves
that very same question so we put the
right cup to the test with our orange
flavored prototype
whoa okay wow you're kidding right
what's in this it's not just water
tastes on something else just water it's
crazy brilliant just brilliant now that
we know that it works let's meet the
team behind the idea for years I've been
researching a lecturing about scent
marketing showing how is it is to
manipulate the brain with smell when I
was 30 I was diagnosed as diabetes and
my doctors told me to drink only water
but I hated the taste that's when I came
up with the idea for the right cup
after years of research and development
we've reached the stage where we need
your support to turn the right cup into
reality the right cup is great for
anyone who wants to cut down on sugary
drinks and drink more water which is
basically everybody please help us
change lives of millions of people by
supporting our project on IndieGoGo
together we can make a real difference
and turn the world into a better and
healthier place one cup at a time let's
make drinking water fun again
don't you just love getting your period
I know I do it's a great time to do
everything I said all the pain is
unbearable I used to worry that my
period was with MP from doing my
favorite activities but now I in a box
oh this is painful what the hell am I
gonna be dry now this is the last place
I should be I could take pills but they
take a long time to work and usually
they don't eliminate the pain just
reduce it and then in a few hours you
just fine starts or i can use Libya
Libya is a drug-free solution to
menstrual pains how does it work simple
menstrual pains are results of a
connection between your brain and your
lady parts hello lady parts get ready
for some pain no brain no but then Libya
stops this connection with pulses dented
and antenna Dada take that pain signal
oh the results Libya considerably
reduces and could even completely
eliminate the pain unlike pills libya
reduces your pain instantly its effect
lasts as long as you use it and you
don't develop a tolerance to it all you
gotta do is take these two stickers
attach them to where it hurts and turn
libya on there's even an adjustable
button to control the pulses according
to your pain and the whole thing is
totally discreet oh and it's also very
cute and colorful cuz we're girls help
us fund libya and move from this
that is painful I to this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
