you
a few years ago no one would have ever
thought that life would become a giant
collection of digital files this
ever-increasing amount of digital
information is your history your
memories your life where do you store it
how do you keep it safe we can't count
on our hardware devices they break they
get stolen or we lose them and our
lifetime of photos and personal
information goes with them we all love
the cloud it makes sure our information
stays intact even when our devices don't
but we also fear the cloud our entire
digital life is somewhere else in
someone else's hands what if they wanted
to sell your data or steal your identity
or use your bank information what if
they could see or duplicate your photos
or find out where you live it's
important to remember that what gets
uploaded to the cloud stays in the cloud
even if you delete your copies they're
out there forever but what if you had a
small easy-to-use device that encrypted
all your cloud stored data at the source
so your files would appear jumbled
unreadable to everyone but you there is
such a device it's called Smid and it's
built for people like you who love the
cloud but need to make 100% sure that no
one will ever see your data
Smith Pro is the only cloud privacy
device designed and priced for personal
use it automatically encrypts your
information before it leaves your home
or office or wherever you are you get a
light portable device and a single
startup key all you need to do is create
an account and choose your cloud
providers that's it
you're up and encrypting all of your
cloud store data even if someone did try
to access or view your information in
the cloud all they would see is
encrypted data it would be of absolutely
no value or interest to them at all one
total privacy in the cloud just plug in
your Smid safeguard your digital life
forever
been working nonstop for over two years
to design and develop a Smith we are
fans of cloud storage but we know that
it has certain price risks so in order
to make cloud storage a viable option
for everyone we created Smith it's like
make every cloud your own private cloud
we are big supporters of personal
privacy and personal freedom Smith is
our solution to infringement on these
freedoms now we will love to have your
help
getting a Smith into the market thank
you very much from the people that
brought you the five tribe range of
powerful resonant speakers which took
the world by storm five tribe now brings
you the mini troll the world's smallest
wireless resident speaker it turns
anything into a speaker by literally
spreading the sound waves through the
material it is placed on am it is still
small enough to fit in your jeans mini
pocket so how does it work the mini
troll is based on an innovative
technology developed by the US Navy for
military use in summer
the unique thing about this is its
resonance cord that transforms
electromagnetic pulses into vibrations
which spread directly across any surface
you choose transforming any surface into
a powerful speaker
simply turn on your mini trawl place it
on a hard surface and enjoy your music
with quality powerful sound its vacuum
bass will make sure your mini troll
stays right where you put it in the
small traditional speakers the sound is
propagated from a small membrane and
this naturally limits the sound pounder
instead with mini troll the sound is
projected by the mass of the chosen
surface allowing much higher sound level
furthermore in the traditional membrane
speaker the sound comes from a specific
direction instead the chosen surface
projects the sounds in every direction
creating a surround effect everyone will
hear the same sound making it perfect
for entertaining
camping relaxing at home even the office
the mini troll is great for extending
the audio of a laptop or for making easy
hands-free conference calls the 360
degrees M will ensure everyone hears the
same information
we've been working tirelessly over the
last 12 months to miniaturize the
technology of our well-loved 5 tribe
resonant speakers without compromising
the sound quality or losing any of the
key distinctive brand factors we need
your help to mass-produce the mini troll
and get it to your doorstep
stop listening to your music with low
quality plastic
Bluetooth speakers that last a few weeks
at best choose the quality of the solid
metal Italian design mini troll which
comes with an automatic 24 month
warranty worldwide enjoy the vibe - in
the tribe please back us today thank you

problem back pain experts estimate that
four out of five people you know will
experience back pain at some point in
their lives whether it stems from a
sport injury poor posture or simply your
daily commute it can plague us almost
anywhere that's why I created the
background
hi my name is Travis Buell and I'm the
creator of the back rack in my late
teens I started experiencing lower back
pain after a traumatic car accident that
fractured my pelvis
fast-forward 18 years a desk job and an
active lifestyle that pain is now
prevalent up and down my spine I've
tried every roller device and treatment
imaginable but I just couldn't find
anything that provided relief in a fast
efficient and convenient way over the
past year I have been tirelessly
designing and prototyping the back rack
so it's easy effective and comfortable
to use for all ages and body types of
importance was to create something
that's portable hands-free
cost-effective to use in your home
office or gym and even take it with you
on vacation the back rack allows you to
effortlessly obtain a deep tissue
massage acupressure and trigger point
release all Y mobilizing the joints in
the spine promoting healthy spine
alignment for an intense floor
experience simply place it towards the
bottom of your back and tilt until you
contact the device as you begin to roll
out the back rack we'll quickly find and
straddle your spine allowing it to
locate each and every trigger point
that's causing you pain and discomfort
within minutes you will be able to feel
the magic for a less intense more
controlled experience place the back
rack between a wall and your body
starting with your feet closer to the
wall will provide the least amount of
pressure if you want to increase the
intensity take small steps away from the
wall until you find your desired comfort
level
you don't have to go far to find
somebody with back pain or spine issues
a friend a parent somebody work with or
even the people at your local gym the
back rack is so portable I can throw it
right into my gym bag I can put it in my
briefcase bring it to work it's just
there when I need it
so I love the back rack because it's
super easy and convenient I can do it
against the wall and really control the
pressure and it relieves my pain in my
neck in my back I can also do movement
in it to open up my shoulder to really
get in spots that are harder to get well
I work construction so it's a pretty
physical job sometimes I come back home
in my lower backs tight or my between my
shoulder blades hurts and it's nice to
have something like the back rack to to
roll it out and loosen myself up my name
is Erin McGinnis and I'm the owner of a
physical therapy practice every day I
treat patients that have acute and
chronic back pain with treatments like
soft tissue mobilization manipulation
and movement based exercises when I was
introduced to help develop the back rack
we wanted a product that would be easy
to use and allow the patient to do these
treatments at home independently back
rack is a multi-purpose tool that
promotes spine health through soft
tissue massage and joint mobilization it
is unique from other myofascial products
because it spreads the pressure over a
large treatment area which drastically
improves comfort back Rack is ideal for
all classifications of low back pain
because it does not put the spine in a
dangerous position but instead you'll
maintain a neutral spine while the
product provides an anterior
mobilization to three spinal segments at
once
this makes it more comfortable than a my
fastball foam roller or any other back
relief product the client can start with
a simple trigger point release and
progress to a more dynamic therapeutic
movement like Active Release techniques
the back rack also treats a thoracic and
lumbar spine by mobilizing the facet
joints through a safe range of motion as
the facet joints are really stiff you
might even hear the cavitation this is
the one device out there that can
replace multiple therapy products in my
clinic and will do the same in your home
it is safe affordable and most
importantly effective
now is the time we need your help to the
minimum order quantity and produce the
very first run of back racks so please
