tackle it's my invention
so ultimately all-in-one now for your
phone or camera six
you
there's been little to no innovation in
the design of a bedsheet in decades
where co-founders have spun and we're
bringing you the first functional set of
sheets that doesn't sum
your bedsheets are awful for three
reasons they're difficult to put on your
bed they don't stay put and it's a
hassle to make your bed every day in
searching for a product that solve this
problem we could not find a set of
sheets that fit our standards of what
function and quality traditionally
Hospital corners have been used as an
attempt to keep your top sheet in place
but it doesn't work Hospital corners do
not withstand tossing and turning and
they're time-consuming here's how we
solved the problem the sponge she
replaces the hospital corner with a seat
you start by pulling the seam over the
corner of your mattress securing the
sheet in place you don't have to Center
your sheet because the sheet does the
measuring for you the seam keeps the
sheet from moving throughout the night
and the side flaps are short enough that
you can choose to tuck them in or leave
them untucked whichever you prefer spun
sheets make it fast and easy to make
your bed and will stay perfectly tucked
all night long no matter how restful or
rowdy your sleep
our pillowcase is designed to keep your
pillow inside the case where it wants
just tuck your pillow into the pocket
and it will stay our fitted sheet is as
I'm with grippy elastic which keeps the
sheet from popping off the corners of
your mattress and the directional tags
take the guesswork out of positioning
your fitted sheet we strongly believe in
the functionality of our product but not
at the cost of quality and comfort
there's a misconception that
thread-count is the only and most
reliable benchmark of a quality sheet
which is not the case there are five
factors that go into a perfect sheet
thread count cotton type fiber length
thread thickness and weave
we've combined all five factors to
construct the perfect sheet spun sheets
are 500 thread count woven into a sateen
weave creating the perfect balance of
softness and durability spun sheets are
100 percent long staples of pima cotton
grown in the u.s. under fair ethical and
responsible guidelines our sheets are
oeko-tex certified which means they are
free from any harmful chemicals so why
do we care so much about sheets we were
frustrated that other sheets were not
all functional and proud of this world
cup we believe they should be both we
wanted to take a product as simple as
sheets and turn it into something people
you
my name is Azam and moved to Singapore a
few years ago when the rent charging my
Mac I'm reminded of how bulky and
inflexible the Yucatec book is compared
to my old us title used in Japan the
same problem lies in the EU and a you
type love as well as a minimalist and
designer this is space and efficiency in
an I sought to solve this problem a star
studying clock mechanism on how to
redesign the most efficient and elegant
plug for all types after a year of
relentless prototyping extensive testing
with my engineers overcoming extremely
technical challenges while keeping the
final product simple and elegant
we have finally conquered the structural
issues successfully created foldable UK
human au plugs this is the total
traveler
with are foldable structure the plug
space is reduced by more than 60% at the
same time it solves the every Lawson
problem of pork storage to tailor to a
better charging experience for everyone
and not just Mac users we have designed
a topia charger a modular design charger
the acceptance event work types from the
tofu traveler it becomes the universal
travel adapter with USB fast charge for
your phone and tablets simultaneously
also for your laptop and other AC
charging devices the tiny size of tofu
minimizes leverage from the wall to
prevent inconsistent contact with the
socket the tofu charger is more than
just a USB charger this powerful and
adaptable in the special fuse list
design guarantees charging safety for
Kickstarter backers we have designed a
purple carry case for you to start both
the tofu charger in the tofu traveler
and further traveling and daily
convenience we have designed a
rechargeable mini LED torch light that
fits perfectly in both Turkey's
we need your support when you cook your
life like these are I may live as I'm
lost
three years ago we brought you the memo
bottle in an attempt to reduce the
devastating effects that serious water
bottles have on the environment many of
them ending up on our beaches but thanks

able to prevent over 1.9 million bottles
from being consumed and through our
donations to water the dog we've been
able to provide clean drinking water to

passionately for the last few years to
bring to you an exciting new range of
murmer bottles and milla bottles premium

quality control if you believe in our
vision and want to see this new motor
range come to life and we invite you to

single-use water bottles and help
conserve this beautiful planet so from
us and the entire metal bottle team we
thank you wholeheartedly for supporting
the one bottle movement you don't need
this much of a troubled we're a
Development Board are you waiting for a
superhero well we don't think so
meet watches watch acts is an Arduino
compatible wearable development platform
it has all the things you need on a
wearable you just feel free to explore
with watch acts simply plug and develop
kids loved watch acts what a fun way to
explore in nature they also love scratch
watch X's scratch compatible so that
they can enjoy easy programming Fitness
sure why not develop your own step or
heartrate tracker be the muscle geek at
the gym you want to reach high make your
custom altimeter we will provide you the
3d model of watch X
pick your favorite reference design and
simply print it or come up with your own
too serious simply make a watch for
everyone or help fight global warming
your train ride is too boring watch X is
there for you and hey why don't you
develop your own game
this is Ennis and this is Mustafa or
chicks is available designed to engage
young makers they will build what they
develop instead of audacity project sits
on a desk it opens up new possibilities
to advanced users in wellness fitness
tracking and sport when it comes to
education there are tools to teach
electronics and programming but
industrial designs also a big part of
life politics does not have a case it is
just a NATO step potential PCB with this
approach we encourage young developers
to design their own case 93 printed this
way they will experiment challenges like
aligning a button off or investi port we
believe that the development platform of
our has arrived please support us to
bring more chicks to life
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
