to foil every method thieves use to
steal your wheels our patent-pending
design is unlike any other it features a
conical shaped body with non coplanar
engagement surfaces and what does that
mean it means when a thief tries to get
a wrench across the lock it simply slips
off the conical shape also prevents
common methods of wheel lock removal
from being used against them 12-point
sockets and wheel lock removal tools
were in part because they are stronger
than the lock recognizing this we made
advanced wheel locks from an alloy so
strong they resist almost anything
designed to bite into steel we tested
them against everything from tools made
to remove rounded off bolts and nuts to
a pipe wrench we did not stop until we
arrived at a material so durable
nothing could grip it the design and
material are only part of the story the
other half of our unique patent-pending
lock is the removal tool the inside of
the tool features key plates that act
like fixed tumblers in a traditional
lock these plates are made from a
hardened alloy steel nearly as tough as
the nut and are designed to withstand
the abuse of an impact wrench just like
the lock and key on your house our key
plate design means we can offer nearly
infinite combinations all of this adds
up to an unsurpassed level of security
because of our innovative design CNC
machining is the only way we can
manufacture them other wheel locks are
made by using a forging process and
materials not nearly as tough as ours
for that reason other wheel locks will
never be as good as ours we are ready to
go to manufacturing with two Master
sizes between the two we have
applications for most vehicles and we
are currently working on designs that
will cover the rest
join our Kickstarter campaign and be one
of the first to own this revolutionary
new product because what we really want
is to end wheel theft for good
