kids and half the time they think
they're killing it as parents the other
half they're doing their best just to
keep everyone alive like you they just
want to be the greatest parents they can
be they don't want their kids to get
hurt and they always try their hardest
to keep them healthy but no matter what
they do the kids get sick from time to
time and that really worries them Kinson
knows how awful it can feel to worry
about your kids especially when they're
not feeling on to present the kinsa
smart your thermometer tells you your
kid's temperature right away in just one
second which is great during the day
poor at 3:00 a.m. when everything seems
to happen with kids so when your kid is
sick and you're not sure what to do
kinsa can help
sometimes sleep-deprived parents will be
a little fuzzy on the details but kinsa
won't be questions like how high did the
fever get or when can I give the next
dose are stored for reference later
updates can even be shared instantly
with anyone looking after your child if
anything kinsa makes those
all-too-common sick kids situations less
stressful reassuring you that you're
doing the right thing so you can worry
about everything else that comes with
kids growing up like explaining the
birds and the bees surviving summer camp
their first cellphone drivers ahead
student loans their first job interview
getting married
hi I'm ender I started cancelled with a
mission to keep families healthier and
to give you peace of mind when you need
it most when your child is sick two
years ago the IndieGoGo community helped
us launch the first-ever fda-cleared
smartphone connected thermometer we've
been able to develop an even more
advanced product the kinsa smart your
thermometer does everything the original
kinsa does but instantly wirelessly and
in a way that's easier for parents of
younger kids and with this launch we're
super excited to bring you new features
that will work on any cancer thermometer
this includes real-time medical guidance
based on your fever and symptoms we can
also show you what symptoms and
illnesses are going around your child's
school and soon your entire local area
to thank the IndieGoGo community that
helped us launch we're offering it to
you first
at as low as half of what it will cost
at retail and we're really excited about
what we'll do with the funds we'll raise
earlier this year we offered free kinsa
thermometers to a small number of
schools across the country in a program
we called fluency the results were
incredible these schools were able to
reduce sick days and keep their students
healthier using canceled
with your support we'd like to expand
that program and give free thermometers
to all families at 100 deserving schools
this fall please take a minute to spread
the word about this campaign to your
network and help us grow the kensic
community so we can all keep our
families and our schools healthy for
years to come
you
this is Leo two minutes and she's out
but you you've been trying for two hours
I'm sure you've tried every trick in the
book like trying to stop thinking stop
thinking stop thinking stop crap I
thought or trying to relax
oh it's not that these techniques are
useless in fact they're actually pretty
good
unfortunately you probably had more
important things to learn at school this
here is his jaw relaxing fast is his
thing just look he focuses on his
breathing and he progressively slows it
down and by slowing his breathing all
the way down to about six breaths a
minute
he stimulates the barrel flicks
physiological mechanism that allows him
to become completely calm in just a few
minutes and when it comes to not
thinking he's pretty good at that too he
can concentrate on his breathing for a
really long time and remain undistracted
by buzzing thoughts but you are not his
room even in bed you struggle to focus
on your breath for more than twenty
seconds at a time
actually your attention span is probably
more like balls than his runs that's why
we've designed dota it helps you fall
asleep by making you almost as chill as
his room I'll have one of those
you synchronize your breathing with the
light projected on the ceiling by
focusing on something outside your own
head you'll pay less attention to the
thoughts that are keeping you awake at
the same time just like a metronome dodo
helps slow down your breathing from
eleven to six breaths a minute which
helps relieve your anxiety and so in
less than eight minutes you'll find
yourself ready to doze off dodo won't
turn you into a Buddhist monk but it
will help you fall asleep faster and
that's probably all you need
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
