happy you're interested in air bar let's
get going the air bar sensor is
extremely easy to set up we're going to
show you the steps air bar comes in
different sizes if you don't already
know the size of your display just
measure it diagonally and then choose
the size that best suits your computer
now your air bar sensor has arrived and
we're going to show you how to attach it
the first time you attach air bar it's
important that you do it correctly
Center it three millimeters below the
bottom edge of the display use the width
of the USB cord as a reference and use
the white alignment markers to center
air bar start by removing the two tags
on the back after that gently attach air
bar to the bottom bezel then press
gently above the magnet points remove
air bar and press on the magnets a bit
harder to fixate them that's it now you
can attach and detach air bar again and
again without hassle and it will be
perfectly aligned and centered every
time thanks to the magnets that remain
below your screen and don't worry you
will still be able to close your
notebook without any problems now that
air bar is set up start your computer
running Windows 10 attach air bar and
plug the USB connector into the notebook
you now have touch air bar senses input
just above the display pinch roll sweep
and have fun

my name is Ju I'm entrepreneur from
Cleveland Ohio and the founder of cocoa
I'm obsessed with being able to
minimally transport everyday carry items
like smartphone tablet keys sunglasses
so I decided to design a bag it was
different from anything that I could
find on the market
the bolster small carry bag is unique
because it tapers to a slim profile
towards the back of the bag so that it
has a more contoured fit around the body
as we build a dedicated sunglass pocket
made from pho felt that will protect the
bag from any of the other contents easy
access to a nice point and shoot
sunglasses wallet or whatever else you
might want to put in there even a yo-yo
you can also put a lot of extra things
in there like extra cables an external
battery for charging up your iPhone or
iPad the elastic waistband allows you to
securely put the bag on your body so
that it won't be loose when you're
active we put a d-ring on the back side
of the bag to keep your keys away from
everything so nothing will get scratched
just clip it on and you have easy access
to your keys when you need them we built
this bag that could deter Superman we
actually had worked with a special
manufacturer to put a kryptonite film on
the I'm just kidding bowls are small
Carrie is not only made for mobility
it's also built for durability we made
this thing from the highest quality 1050
d ballistic nylon that we could find all
the webbing is military-grade we use the
highest quality fasteners that we could
find the zippers are all waterproofed
and all materials that we're using for
this bag are sourced right here in
America I started working with an
outdoor gear manufacturer in Utah who
are just crazy about quality so what the
final samples have proved from them
we're ready to start production we have
all of the materials ready to be sourced
and we are ready Faline Kickstarter are
you ready to go minimal this summer
without getting a funky with like a man
purse or a fanny pack
so you never know when you're going to
need a few extra pockets and it lends
itself to a wide spectrum of lifestyle
needs a bag that you're going to get is
going to be the best made in the world
Thank You Kickstarter we're really
looking to get this project going and
need your help spread the good
minimalist word and help us get this
project off the ground thank you
