old standard the new craftsman 25 foot
Sidewinder tape measure standard
measuring tapes stand straight up

patented design rotates the tape to lay
flat making it the most stable tape

stabilization and allows you to make
repetitive layout marks based on a given
distance rather than pulling out the
length of the tape and doing difficult

fractions a breeze the auto blade block
makes the job easy automatically locking
in place so the tape only retracts when
you want it to and a convenient writable
surface helps you keep track of

guaranteed to give your life a little
extra peace of mind hi my name is
Rebecca and I'm a lactation consultant
today I'm going to be sharing my new
paper product called the la vie
lactation massage chair which is
literally a lifesaver if you're
breastfeeding or pumping it's easy no
bolt has multiple library modes there's
a hundred percent waterproof which means
you could use it in the shower what I
love about this product is its unique
shape it has three different sides which
helps you solve a bunch of different
breastfeeding problems the smooth back
side can be used to help soften the
breast and stimulate letdown the rounded
edge can be used to dig into plug ducts
and help break them up and the sides can
be used to help move fluid and express
milk whether you're in the beginning
middle or end of your breastfeeding
journey this is a wonderful tool to have
on hand
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
