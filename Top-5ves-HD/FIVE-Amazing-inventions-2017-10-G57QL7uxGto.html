you
hi crowdfunders i'm jake and i'm the
founder of cinch two years ago yelp has
been the ultimate pop-up tent to over 30
countries worldwide and the response was
phenomenal you've proven the
crowdfunding is the best way to launch
an innovative idea of your feedback
we've made even more improvements I came
to you a vision for exceptional camping
without compromising you bro my dream to
life all the benefits of irregular
temples tons more with none of the
household I'm designed every singe 10
you can attach a solar power pack this
captures solar energy on the roof of the
10 channels it inside through a web
approved for into a pocket-sized power
bank which we've upgraded this year to
have three times the capacity of the
previous model the solar pack is so
versatile you pout all of the USB
powered gadgets and there were two USB
ports so you can par two devices at the
same time we can take the power bank
with you on the move just unplug it and
slip it into your pocket the two
entrances each with the report finding
loads of functionality you can tailor to
your own needs you need to cinch each
entrance at its own canopy with
detachable poles and new 2016 it's a
super extended canopy which lets you
extend your living space by negative 4
square meters
all the kit that's nearly away into the
bag this year each such as to kill safe
demos attached to the inside of the 10
cinch comes in three sizes two three
four person each one is the largest in
its class a4 map with over six and
square meters of living space it's a
biggest pop and ten in the world every
tenant double skin to stop condensation
we use advanced waterproof fabric which
is three times the industry standard
give me a peck to protection really wet
conditions you don't want to get to a
campsite master spend ages assembling
your 10 want to be able to enjoy
yourself straight away and make the most
of being outdoors I came up research
after years ago into music festivals on
camping trips and never find an attempt
to suit my needs I went through dozens
attempt the big manufacturers always let
me down the adventure doesn't M&amp;amp;R sun
goes down night Sam is just as important
as day cinch is fully equipped for the
dark every singe is packed with LED
Tampax to cool torches the turn into
lanterns
well now my the life at the guylines
glow in the dark
resigned a blackout canopy that also
regulates the heat super easy to pour in
a matter of seconds in the morning is
sleeping at 10 as long as you want still
stare cool and comfortable temperatures
instantly takes less than a minute to
pack down to
pop-ups are great but you still want
space comfort good qualit materials the
sort of stuff you get when you spend the
time in putting up a regular ten how can
I found my ideal tent anywhere so I
decided to make it myself the criteria
was non-negotiable light and easy to
carry with everything packed together
Lords of cool features some really
serious kit underneath easy and fun but
made from the highest quality materials
and built to last in 2014 thanks to you
we were able to produce inch on a bigger
scale than ever before it was a massive
success but it's all in the beginning
that jump taught me loads about the
large-scale manufacturing process made
it clear that can go even further the
next generation scent is ready to go
testing is complete and I manufacturers
fully briefed we just need your help to
finish biomaterials and get production
underway in return you'll get a new and
improved since before anyone else in l.a
2017 some really cool extras to just
take a look at it was see what an upper
you have confirmed my belief that scent
is the ultimate pop-up tent let's make
the hassled comfy thing of the past give
people an experience let's fit the
outdoors
you
I think any dog owner can relate to it
you look into their eyes and share a
brief connection and see that they
really want to understand so when you
think about trying to talk to your pet
there's really only so much you can say
but what if somehow you could
communicate more what would you ask them
first this was the inspiration of the
clever bed cover pad is an interactive
device that reward your dog for solving
simple puzzles we know that when your
reward animal for performing a certain
behavior it's more likely to perform
that behavior again in the future we use
this every time we try to get our doc to
do something for a treat and to the most
important factors in making this work or
repetition and consistency so clever pet
uses your dog's morning meal and the
time it spends at home to encourage
interactions throughout the day it
starts out simple your dog will get a
treat whenever she presses any of clever
pets buttons once she's got this down
clever pit makes her job a little bit
tougher now she only gets a treat when
she presses the button that's lit up
once she's learned that the game changes
again clever pet gradually teaches her
to interact a more interesting ways and
she stays active and happy all day long
the really great thing is that this is
all automatic clever pet engages your
dog even when it can't be helped my
favorite part about working with dogs is
seeing progress on a daily basis I've
learned a lot about how dogs interact
with their surroundings and the most
important takeaway is that a dog with a
job is a happy dog what's really
interesting is that all my clients have
the same request they all want a happy
healthy and well behaved dog so when I
was first introduced to clever pet I
learned that there was something for
these problems keeping our dogs engaged
and busy while we're not at home I've
introduced dogs to just about every
interactive toy and device on the market
and nothing challenges your dog like
clever pentose we begin with simple pet
behaviors and have since advanced to
more complex interactions at clever pet
we're driven by compassion and curiosity
to find a way to care for pets when
they're alone
and get a better sense for who they are
so whether you're looking to keep your
pet healthy and happy or simply dealing
with your dog's anxiety when you leave
the house clever pet adapts to meet your
dog's needs clever pet engage idle pause
hyperduck is a new concept that we've
been working on for about what 10 years
yeah and I think it is really all about
the the notion that our shoes should be
smarter and should be able to adapt to
our activities and to the shape of our
feet as they change so when you open the
box you're gonna have two shoes you're
also gonna have your charger two pucks
one for each shoe they magnetically
stick to the bottom of the shoes to
check the battery level you press any
button and the last flash that the LED
has that indicates what your battery
level is if it's full it'll be blue if
it's half full it'll be yellow and if
it's almost empty it'll be red usually a
charge on each shoe will last about over
two weeks it depends on your use how
many times you're tightening and
loosening and adjusting throughout the
day this shoe is programmed to turn on
automatically when you put your heel on
to the foot bed so when you slide your
foot in and you press your heel though
yep there's no need to actually turn it
on it it's just always on its smart
enough to be ready when you step into it
like tinker is saying automatically runs
the two buttons are marked with just two
little blue squares and the top button
this one Titan so you just press the
button and the laces will tighten go to
loosen you just press the back button or
loosen button and they loosen say you
want it to go to much tighter so you
just adjust it to where you want it to
go I pressing to hold both buttons for
two seconds and you hear the motor run
that just reset your preset so that
every time you get in the shoe now it'll
go to that much tighter setting there is
a loosening button it's the lower button
of the two and you just press it for
basically about two seconds and it
loosens the shoe up automatically until
you can pour you put up in case you're
having any trouble with it whatsoever
you press and hold both buttons for 10
seconds and you'll see a rainbow of
colors go over the lights and that'll
let you know that you've reset the
system your preset won't change but the
system will just reset if that doesn't
work you can throw it on the charger for
about 30 seconds and it also do a system
reset in the end it's a multi-purpose
speaker and you should just go have fun
and do anything you'd like to do
athletically or casually we call at one
point 0 because it's just the first step
in better fit and comfort in an adaptive
way that then it improves athletes
performance

when I was a kid I dreamt of having a
hoverboard so I began experimenting with
magnets I've been working with brands
and businesses to create custom
levitation displays I've been levitating
shoes skateboards speakers and even a
mouse what if we could combine magnetic
levitation with induction what if we
could set the light bulb free this is
flight it's a levitating light it's
floating using magnets and in power
through the air so how does it work you
line up the center of the bowl with the
center of the base when you see the
light turn on you gently let go and
watch it levitate we want your flight to
last a long time so we use energy
efficient LEDs that are safe and don't
need to be replaced we crafted the base
from sustainable source to oak ash and
walnut oh yeah and just tap the surface
of your flight to turn it on or off when
you're not using your bulb wireless
power is good for other things like
charging your phone we would love for
you to experience flight so back our
project today and be the first to get
your hands on the flight be the first to
experience levitating light</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
