hello my name is Scott come Fuhrman
founder of clinically fit the developers
of the extensor first thank you for
buying our product I want to take a few
minutes to show you exactly how this
device works and help you make the most
out of using it you're going to notice
that the in your bag they're going to be
a series of finger bands in three
different sizes the device fits on both
of your hands with the blue thumb bands
fitting on either one of your hands
first thing you want to do is find the
bands that fit most suitable to your
fingers place them in the device and
then slowly a few times for each one
going through the motion of
prestretching your finger bands which is
going to activate the elasticity in
these bands making it a little bit
softer and a little easier to use next
you're going to notice that there's a
grid on here and this grid has three
different rows that allow you to
increase or decrease tension for each
one of your fingers individually the
first thing we're going to do is place a
device arm it slips on either hand and
like a glove and just by sticking your
fingers in these bands both the blue and
the gray securing the strap to your
wrist
you'll be ready to go make sure that you
seek approval from your physician if you
have any kind of a condition before
beginning any exercise program
by incorporating all of these different
exercises each time you use them the
device will help you overall just
increase the overall fitness in your
hands your wrists and your elbows now
the device is meant to be used for no
more than a few minutes a day a few days
a week we certainly don't want to get
into creating an overuse problem while
we're trying to heal an overuse issue
again thank you for buying our product
we think it's going to do a great job at
helping you become more effective in
using your hands your wrists and your
elbows it's really going to help to
decrease pain just follow the
instructions again a few minutes a day
just a few days a week and you will get
the results that you need do you have
the same problem I do you arrange the
furniture in your home just the way you
like it but you can't move the light
switches so now you need to call an
electrician hey Kevin hey man what's up
I need that light switch changed
I want a light switch right here so I
won't fall off the bed anymore
and I can turn on the light switch right
now whoa how did you do that I also have
a toddler and I would like to switch
lower so he can reach it and I can turn
on the switch like this you used to
think I need to tear out pieces of the
wall and run additional wires but now
this is no longer necessary you just
need to open the package no setting
replace the existing light switch with
this base switch then you can put the
gecko switch wherever you want and it's
done you can place an icon lets you know
what the gecko switch controls here
there are many icons to select from the
LED behind the icon lets you know when
the light is on or off makes a bedroom
light gradually brighten to wake you up
or make it to turn off with the time
delay 3 to 1 if you can't find the Gekko
switch use the search function and it
will beep oh here it is hmm do it now
