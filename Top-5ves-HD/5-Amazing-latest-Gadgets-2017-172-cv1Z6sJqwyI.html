fun we don't want to sacrifice comfort
instead we use sophisticated
technologies to bring comfort along with
us but what works great at home may not
perform as well on the road
we pushed the limits and challenged
ourselves to use ultra light weight
saving cutting-edge technologies yet
again those solutions that were so
effective at home are often useless when
traveling but here's a real situation
that is just as absurd we put a half
liter shampoo bottle in a sports bag
when we go to the gym or in our suitcase
for a two-day trip and our favorite body
wash and of course we can't forget a
conditioner and it is never just one
bottle for those who want to go
lightweight without sacrificing our
needs we introduce your new companion
pack stir so what is pacster pacster is
a refillable multi-purpose container
designed to carry liquids small personal
care items and a toothbrush using
pacster is not difficult at all
large refilling caps make sure that
refilling three individual chambers is
quick and easy to personalize the
arrangement of products in your pacster
simply change labelled caps dispensing
is also intuitive just press a pump
button a few times for liquid to start
flowing and to use next chamber just
open dispensing cap and repeat the
process
the waterproof section will keep
whatever you put inside dry under any
conditions you can also carry a
toothbrush in a secure ventilated
section that is designed to allow easy
drying the structure of the body is firm
which means it will never leak under
pressure pacster is easy to carry around
doesn't take much space and is
lightweight whether your going to hit
the gym on a business trip or just to
stay overnight in your best friend's
place pacster is what you need after all
life is about happy moments
and not unnecessary hassle
pacster is your gym buddy and a travel
companion
we see that space and time are
intertwined we cannot look out into
space without looking back earlier this
NASA discovered its sources most
founders
I heard about the traps first I was
tempted by the possibility of these
potentially habitable planets always had
a fascination with science my mind
instantly erased what time would even
took the idea of my travelers one watch
package over the next six months
several aspects the Trappist one
invasion they can stand apart
large
others overdose
real also services
we're bidding

Travis one stupid essence
don't personal bus hire done
Oh stand up arson fire
strapped to me what rain thunder but the
oldest
The Independent Spirit your excuse
first law redesign we're excited to
present
air pollution is a global epidemic from
the big headlines we hear about to the
personal stories we don't millions of
people feel its effects every day we are
cool masks and we have a solution
this is hexa the best clean air supply
mask ever created with two customized
fans in a control dial to adjust air
flow hexa can power up to 150 liters of
clean air per minute 20 times the amount
you consume while resting this increase
clean air supply alleviates pressure
from your lungs and helps you breathe
better so whether you're walking cycling
or on the road hexa keeps you safe and
breathing easy
hexxus replaceable proprietary filter
provides triple layer protection against
exhaust smoke allergens bacteria and
viruses the filter is assembled using
three key elements a high-tech particle
filter military-grade active carbon
fabric in nano silver when combined hexa
can block lethal particles smaller than
2.5 microns commonly known as PM 2.5
when people wear hexa we want them to
feel free it's light and breathable
thanks to its open honeycomb structure
its triple air valves efficiently
release heat moisture and co2 keeping
the mask cool and dry the face seal and
clean air flow combined to create
positive pressure preventing any leaks
and blocking out bad air all this is
powered by a separate mobile power bank
keeping hexa flexible and safe hexa is
compliant international standards
including Ross Cee ul FCC FDA and NIOSH
Hex's control unit also doubles as an
air quality sensor that can be used on
its own it detects airborne particle
densities around you and alerts you with
LED lights or notifications to your
phone
pollution data can be mapped out on our
app so you know exactly where hex is
needed and once connected to a Wi-Fi
network your air quality data can be
shared with your loved ones and the hexa
community engineered for superior air
flow unmatched protection and total
comfort hexa is your bridge to clean air
hi I'm Edward emphasis my son Luke when
my family lived in Asia
Luke suffered from asthma caused by air
pollution we looked for a face mask but
finding a good one was impossible so we
built hexa we have been developing a
stove for two years we have assembled a
phenomenal team of engineers and
software developers helping us through a
dozen designs and prototypes for this
final version we're looking to
Kickstarter to help us fund our tooling
in our production with hexa I can travel
anywhere without worrying about air
pollution we want to give you into your
loved ones the same peace of mind we
hope you can share in the back our
campaign thank you
they say the best camera is the one in
your pocket but convenience comes at a
cost
today's slimline smartphones are
brilliant as touch screens and
telephones but try to use them for any
serious photography and they become an
ergonomic nightmare the hardware buttons
don't function as you think they will
and the software controls never seem to
be in the right place or the finger yoga
in the world won't help you take a
left-handed selfie and that is why just
mobile has created this the shutter grip
it easily connects to pretty much any
smartphone out there case or no case and
connects via bluetooth to control your
camera once it's paired you simply need
to press the button and it will
automatically connect and that is where
the magic begins
yes I won't touch me
thank you
how fast you're ready to shoot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
