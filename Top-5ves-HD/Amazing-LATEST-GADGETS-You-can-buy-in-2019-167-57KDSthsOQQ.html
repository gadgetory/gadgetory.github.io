handheld tripod designed specifically
for filming videos or taking photos on
the go quickly switch from a handheld
grip to a tripod and then back again in
just seconds it's super slim and it
easily fits into your bag or just clip
it on instead switch pod is built to
last
it's made with an aluminum alloy not
plastic so it will hold whatever camera
lens and accessories you put on top of
it yet it only weighs 11 ounces or 315
grams that's less than your morning mug
of coffee
- the coffee here's how it works first
attach your camera with the tightening
knob or attach any ball head
quick-release system or phone adapter
next grip the handle wherever you'd like
if you need a choke up or switch hands
no problem to set it down just swing the
legs open or if you want to be fancy try
it with one hand when you're ready to
pick it back up bring the legs back
