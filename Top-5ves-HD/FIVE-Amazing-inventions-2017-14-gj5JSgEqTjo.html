co-founder of IQ he is a fact worth
knowing more than forty percent of all
people in the world are afflicted with
correctable vision impairments

comfortably and ultimately more
productively in less than a year our
team has developed the personal vision

vision testing solution so precise and
so accurate it rivals professional-grade
auto refractors used by your eye doctor

your smartphone use the results to other
eye glasses online but this is not just

the convenient squeeze tubes we use for
many products at home and at work have
been around forever but as convenient as
they are it's impossible to completely
empty them until now we all have
accepted the struggle to get everything
out of these tubes
amazingly they can take up to twenty
percent of their precious contents to
the landfill
look around your house how many tubes
can you find you'll be surprised let's
end this nonsense once and for all and
start saving you money squeeze tubes get
ready to feel the big squeeze hello I'm
Steve and I'm Clark we're mechanical
engineers from Denver Colorado we're
pros at designing new products the idea
of wasting anything really bugs me the
squeeze tubes and matter how hard I try
I know i'm not getting everything i paid
for there are a lot of products out
there that come in tubes and many of our
really expensive so a few years ago we
set out to design a product that could
completely empty an e-2 including
medications cosmetics and moisturizers
sunscreens art supplies food items and
of course toothpaste and today we are
excited to announce the world and we
have finally created these simplest and
best way to empty tubes the big squeeze
is a patented hand tool specifically
designed to eliminate waste and save you
money on all your teams here's how it
works take any partially empty tube open
the jaws if you enter the tube in
between the gears squeeze the handles
and turn the crank the gears do all the
work it's that easy all the contents are
pushed forward ensuring you get every
last bit it took many rounds of
prototypes to arrive at the ultimate
solution but we knew it had to feel
comfortable in your hand be extremely
easy to operate so we spent months
fine-tuning the ergonomics for a great
grip a quality feel it's also engineered
to last a lifetime with diecast zinc
handles and extruded aluminum gears to
handle the toughest of tubes we are
proud to say that the big squeeze will
be backed with a lifetime warranty and
made entirely in the USA it's a tool
just like a can opener it doesn't stay
with the tube you just use it as needed
one big squeeze around your household or
business you have all your tubes and
extended lease on life it's like
squeezing money right back in your
wallet get every single ounce out of all
your tubes help kick-start the big
squeeze today with your backing the big
squeeze can become a big success thank
