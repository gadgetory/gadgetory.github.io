your kids on the one hand you know they
have tremendous potential and you're
confident they'll have an incredible job
in a developing market on the other hand
they can enjoy eating an entire tube of
toothpaste when getting them a new toy
you want it to be fun because they're
just kids
but you also want to develop their more
intellectual side because they can't
really eat paste for a living meat algal
bricks smart coating blocks that teach
your kids actually it's a simple concept
choose and build a robot coat it to do
nearly anything then press play and
watch it go here's what's special about
algal bricks while there are many stem
products the teacher kid to think
analytically algorithm or than that it
teaches your kids how to actually code
to go to robot your kid uses two types
of bricks functions and parameters just
like in code their function box for
sound movement and lights stacking
parameters on top of functions creates
the different actions
big parameters for small children and
small ones for more complex commands
here's a line of code that will make the
algo cannon play music moves straight
then spin right while blinking its eyes
and blue and red lights then shoot balls
for six seconds here's how that line
will look in real code Algol breaks even
helps your kids debug the record by
lighting up what's currently running
want to make it even more interesting
add sensors to the bot to respond to
sound touch distance and life and it all
connects to an Arduino ring with all
these options the possibilities are
endless here's an algo bot that takes a
bite every time you clap your hands and
this Ferris wheel starts spinning when
you open its door you don't have to
invent your own activities algo brakes
comes with various activity boards and
activity cards that will leave your kids
step by step on the path to becoming a
coder once your kid masters Algol breaks
the transition to real code is a cinch
all you need to do is sit back watch
your kids expand their minds and then
clean up the carpet because after all
there's still kids
now that sounds great but you've heard
about stuff like this before and you
know what happens you buy a new toy your
kids get excited then five minutes later
they're back on their tablet not with
alcohol bricks algo bricks is compatible
with Lego bricks
remember when you were kid and couldn't
stop playing with them now imagine if
you could make anything you created make
sounds light up and come to life
I'll go bricks was created by two people
Amir and then both obsessed with
education from games Danny has a PhD in
robotics and the mirror is an education
tech entrepreneur and founder of young
engineers an educational network that
teaches stem in over 40 countries
worldwide together they want to take
coding education to a whole new level so
if you want to bring out your kids full
potential and teach them how to actually
code get out go raise your kids will
have an incredible time and a bright
future
I'll go breaks watch the tutorial videos
on our campaign page to see what your
kid will learn with algal bricks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
