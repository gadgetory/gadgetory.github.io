let's be honest the skate industry
hasn't seen any real innovation in the
past 30 years that's why we've decided
to think outside the block
introducing the world's first bullet
resistant clear customizable skateboard
here for absolutely any lifestyle
whether you're a beginner skateboarder
or an advanced downhiller the jelly man
award is the perfect ride for you what's
going on guys to spin CEO and co-founder
of jelly we're super excited to
introduce you the all-new redesigned
jelly Manowar which has been a
culmination of all the awesome feedback
that we received from our jelly fans
across the world but we thought would
you go one step further so we teamed up
with the homies and lock risers
innovation to give our boards the
functionality to fit your lifestyle the
flex of a snowboard needs to flow the
surf for the jelly Manowar is a
downhillers
so I really like the new jelly deck Man
O'War super sick for Scott concave keep
it under my key blocks are super sick
they just click right into my skateboard
I'm not down the hill without worrying
about my camera hi my name is Kevin
founder and chief technical innovations
officer for blocker Iser innovations
I've always liked putting things in
places that's why I came with the stash
block so i can put more things in more
places what are the things can you put
it into the stash block you might ask I
wonder what's up sup bro got any jelly
but of course care from grave yeah the
patent-pending Betty box allows you to
replace your stash block with the go
block and now you can film with added
stability
the standard GoPro attaches to the top
of your board increasing vibrations and
rendering your footage useless Plus once
you stick them on they become a
permanent fixture
the go block can be easily taken on and
off allowing for limitless user
experience by absorbing vibrations
reducing speed wobbles and increasing
stability the space-age material
provides extreme flexibility making
jelly the easiest skateboard to ride
ever it really is the perfect board for
riding down the boardwalk is so cruisy
it was super mellow but really
responsive like I'm not used to skating
I felt really natural on the board it
was really inviting and we both really
had an awesome times getting the boards
they really enjoy a how they flex about
how durable they can be
they're awesome I can't I can't think of
another board ride on they don't catch
over tracks it just flowed over
everything they're good they're nice are
smooth the fast my friends love them
good time
I love this board it saves you valuable
minutes in the morning it's fun for me
to get from my car into the office look
at it sleek enough that I can bring it
in feel comfortable
the jelly borders made it so much easier
for me it also takes you up to the next
Levela skateboarder get so scared till I
cried the jelly board but the jellies
board wasn't actually just smelled scary
to ride you need a few tiny the added
benefit of a deck made out of
bulletproof glass is simple it's super
high impact resistant and one hundred
percent recyclable jellies rock is ready
to roll all we need is your support
overall I like clean designed and well
engineered solutions to really
everything in cycling I think you really
need to break it down to the simplest
form over the years I've seen so many
different accessories and how the design
has changed and how it's move more
towards more integrated solutions it
just seemed like computer mounts were
left behind there's been many times I
looked down at the computer in the
computer mouse and I just thought
there's got to be a better way to do
this while I'm looking at the four bolt
stem on my bike I realized that the
solution was just right in front of my
face I mean we have a mounting position
right there why are we using it having
some interest in product design and
development I thought well we'll just
make something I didn't want to appeal
to just the competitive cyclist I want
to offer a solution to anyone who rides
a bike and not only did I want something
that would fit multiple bikes multiple
stems but also multiple computers and
really put it in the optimal position
when you try to make a clean design of
simple design the complexity behind that
effort is huge you know the great thing
about the cycling community is that
there's people from all walks of life
different professions and coincidentally
a great product engineer join our team
last year which was the perfect
opportunity to collaborate on this idea
that I had so what we came up with was a
solution
a direct stem mount for cycling computer
I work as a model maker and design
engineer at PDT the challenges of making
a direct stem out was having it be
adjustable and adaptable to the multiple
status on a market right now the format
is fully adaptable to almost any stems
bolt distance between centers and
there's five positions for mounting it
this is 12 by rotating the arms you get
three four and five in addition to
having five height adjustments the
format also has for a nap adjustability
accommodate different sized computers
it's definitely an asset for commuters
and recreational riders especially if
you have a bell a phone mount a light
and you probably have a reflector
mounted somewhere on handlebars let's
get your computer off the bars puts it
down out front and frees up some bar
space to me this is a piece of art I
just like the sleekness of it the
compactness of it so the way it changes
the whole silhouette of the front of the
bike over the course of my 16 years here
at PT I've been involved in thousands of
successful projects and from an
engineering standpoint do a project that
I'm most proud of is the formality I
think that keeping the designs simple is
the most robust label
we didn't want to just make a highly
functional model we also wanted it to be
beautiful and we know that the design we
come up with is simple and elegant and
checks all the boxes
the new aerodynamic frame / faster
racket head speed an optimized string
pattern for enhanced spin production the
new pure arrow is engineered to let you
dominate from the first point the match
point
but above all it's a spin machine
the new babolat pure arrow the action
sports tracker it's a small little
device the size of reese's peanut butter
cup and you manage your snowboard your
surfboard your wakeboard whatever and
tells you how fast you're going how many
waves you've cut how many calories you
burn for skiing and snowboarding it'll
tell you things like air time how high
you're jumping which lifts you were on a
bunch of other things but basically it
measures your activity
tres will also auto edit video footage
for you so if you're taking video with a
GoPro or a sony or canon you can
actually put the video in and it'll edit
out all the highlights for you as well
as color correct and overlay your stats
all automatically
definitely some of the differences
between you know some of the other
gadgets that are out there would be that
it's physically mounted audio surf water
there's nothing that's in your arm or
you know any any kind of odd you know
stat that can be thrown in there it's a
something that's going to be as close to
the water as possible until you're going
to get you know the closest results and
it's so easy is kind of stick it on your
board and just like the trace in and
you're good to go
