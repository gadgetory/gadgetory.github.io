I'm the creator of the bed shelf II know
not bed selfies guys to the right a
little very are the bed shelf II you
know my entire life
I've noticed that if there's one thing
that we could all use a little bit more
of its space big clunky furniture can
make your home feel more like a cage
sometimes finding something as simple as
finding a place to put your nightstand
can become quite the challenge so I set
out to create a solution that would work
for everyone in every living situation
from the college dorm room to the studio
apartment to the best of all and my
favorite the bunk bed this bedside shelf
is easy to install it attaches firmly to
the edge of your bed frame without tools
using a simple and time-tested clamp and
knob mechanism of course it had to be
extremely sturdy to safely hold all your
bedside needs design wise it features
rounded edges and a neat wire slot for
charging your phone we chose to
handcraft the bed shelf e out of bamboo
you love bamboo it's four times harder
than overt and matures in just three to
five years it's eco-friendly and has a
ton of great character over numerous
designs and sketches later we've arrived
to a clean minimal form offering a wide
range of versatility
this is the Lummi duo say hi lumi Lully
duo is a case that gives you
professional studio quality lighting for
your photos and for capturing those
great moments on video plus it's a drop
resistant case so it always keeps your
phone protected press the back button
once to turn on the selfie lightly press
it again to switch the backlight on if
the lights are too dim or too bright you
can hold the back button to adjust the
brightness lumi has its own battery so
it'll never use your phone's that also
means you can use it as an ambient light
for your photos
Lumi lets you capture everything in a
warm radiant light anytime anywhere that
dawn or dusk inside or outside with Lumi
you always have the perfect light to
capture life's best moments
sergeant were under heavy fire enemy has
