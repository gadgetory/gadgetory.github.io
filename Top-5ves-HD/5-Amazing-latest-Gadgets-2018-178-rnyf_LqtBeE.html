organization elements we've also
integrated stowable shoulder straps a
hidden pocket and many more features

perfect bag
hi i'm ryan and i'm elias we are part of
the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it clings to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we'd come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travellers wanting an easy
way to wash clothes while on the go
it's also simple to use you simply place
it water add some soap turn on the
built-in timer and walk away minutes
later your clothes are cleaner than ever
before sonic Stoke is designed for
travelers moms neat freaks looking for a
thorough cleanse and not just on clothes
by the way but on fruits and vegetables
to folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full size laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close sonic soak is your solution
sonic soap is ready to be shipped just
after our campaign ends we just need you
to help make it happen which means you
can have a cleaner almost anything and
practically no time once we end this
campaign successfully
what is this tell us god damn it is it
dangerous
it's a chair is this supposed to be a
chair do I look stupid
it's too light to be a chair this is a
chair we've found your secrets you mean
my bag
you're not being straight with us look
at all these mechanical parts they do
not belong in a chair
Kevlar strap ballistic nylon seat the
core is made of carbon fiber but why
these are special force materials to
make the slimmest and lightest portable
seat in the world we had to push the
materials and the technology to the
limit everything down to the smallest
screw is made to measure it's this
anodized aluminum great ice and it's
corrosion free as well as strong as it
gets
what's next you're gonna tell me that
boom thing can hold a grown man 300
pounds not a problem just try to unfold
actually really comfortable is designed
to strengthen your core and to avoid
back problems you can adjust the height
so it matches your specific needs so
you're telling me these are in foreign
spies using the cylinder to communicate
of course not the sit back is simply
perfect for multiple everyday normal
occasions hiding around golfing hunting
just make life so much easier and more
convenient it really is something
special I mean such craftsmanship only
premium materials how can we get it you
can be the first one to get the sin if
you support our Kickstarter campaign
every dollar counts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
