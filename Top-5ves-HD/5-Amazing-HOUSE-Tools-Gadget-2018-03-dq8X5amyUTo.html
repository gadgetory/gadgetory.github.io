on the digital screen the home plow by
Myer is the perfect solution for
self-reliant people who like to take
things into their own hands we call it
piy for plowing it yourself and the home
plow makes it fast and easy with six
models to choose from there is a home
plow that's right for you this video
will help you select the right one
before exploring what is unique to each
of the six models let's start with the
key features that are common to all home
plows home plows are designed to fit
today's most popular SUVs or light
trucks and allow you to stay inside your
vehicle while plowing all home plows can
be attached or removed from your vehicle
without tools in less than a minute
central to the mounting system is a
class 3 2 inch receiver hitch that is
sold separately you can purchase from
local retailers or from home plow comm
to help you move snow quicker and easier
most home plows come with our patented
Auto angling feature Auto angling
automatically angles the plow left or
right when it encounters the weight of
the snow on the blade or you can lock
the blade into position with the
provided pin now let's talk about the
differences within the home plow lineup
we offer a good better best product
lineup that features two offerings
within each category in the good
category is the home plow basic home
plow basics are the least expensive
models and ship in an easy-to-manage
carton assembly should take less than an
hour using common household tools once
assembled the blade measures 18 inches
high and 6 feet 8 inches wide at the top
of the blade you'll find a handle that
is used to raise or lower the blade
in addition to the manual model the
basic home plow is also available with a
wireless key fob to raise and lower the
blade moving up to the better category
you'll find the home plow on wheels this
category includes two models both with
onboard wheels that store right on the
plow the wheels make it easier to roll
the plow away for convenient storage or
remounting for added convenience both
home plows on wheels come fully
assembled the blades are four inches
taller than basic home plows which helps
clear deeper snow faster the only
difference between the two home plows on
wheels is how the blade is raised and
lowered model 24,000 uses an electric
motor with a wireless keifa while model
25000 uses a hydraulic motor that can be
used with either a wireless key fob or a
wired controller both home plows on
wheels rely on Auto angling for
left-right blade movement if you want
the ultimate in plowing performance then
take a look at the full power at home
plow the two models in this category
operate just like a commercial plow this
means the up down right and left
movement of the plow is controlled by an
in-cab controller that is hardwired into
the plows hydraulic pump full powered
