Evo is the only companion your
smartphone will ever need replace $150
worth of gear with one sleek device that
does it all
they say when you gain something you
lose something your headphones give you
a great immersive audio experience but
they also make you lose awareness of
your surroundings and I noticed people
listening to headphones being oblivious
to the outside world I thought there's
got to be a device that can fix this
problem and that's how I thought of the
concept for sound break introducing
sound breaks 2.0 the world's first
device that lets you be isolated and
immersed in your headphone audio yet
still be able to clearly hear important
outside sounds sound break fits between
your headphones and your audio player
sound ray adjusts to the sound level in
your environment after you press a
button the button illuminates while
sound break is taking samples of your
outside sound level when the light turns
off some break has created an alert
level that is custom for your
surrounding from now on when outside
sound is louder than the alert level
you'll hear it instantly streamed into
your headphones there is no impact to
your audio quality you can also select
from five different sensitivity levels
so you can choose to be alerted by
softer sounds or louder sounds you can
also use it with Bluetooth headphones
using an extra Bluetooth accessory sound
breaks 2.0 is the result of over two
years of research and development design
and iterations one of the sound breaks
have a simple design to be as easy to
use as possible version 2.0 has new
features that make it even easier to use
than before with just three buttons when
you go to a new environment or the sound
level changes just press a sample button
again to have it adjust you can change
the microphone volume by holding the
sample button you'll hear only outside
sound as it blinks and then you use the
up or down button to change the volumes
press it again to return to normal sound
break is rechargeable with a simple
micro USB connection by backing our
campaign you'll receive the world's
first headphone device that selectively
streams and outside sound and you also

you to listen to music replacing the
headphones on the bone part near your
ear so your ears are not plugged with
normal hearing sound waves travel
through the air to the middle ear to
three small bones which vibrate and send

personal stuff and because these screens
are inexpensive and can be everywhere
all I ever need to carry is my house
for one edible water bottle I'm sure
you've heard the phrase have your fake
quinita - what about drink your water
and eat the bottle - the number one new
invention was created by skipping rock
slab in hopes of replacing the millions
of water bottles thrown away each year
polluting our planet this water
container is more of a ball
ooh-ho is biodegradable and has a
natural membrane that is easily digested
the skin is made from a seaweed extract
and has no taste
but flavors can be added pop it in your
mouth and get hydrated
woo-ho is cheaper to produce than
plastic bottles and has a peel off layer
to keep it clean until ingested but
