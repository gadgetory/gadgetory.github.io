we're here to change that last year we
released the highly anticipated Juno
jumper which is ranked in automobile
mags top eight essentials to buy this
spring this year we've taken it up a
notch and brought you something even
more spectacular powered that we can all
rely on anywhere anytime
introducing the Juno jumper pro ERG no
power were dedicated to finding new
innovative ways to solve your everyday
problems the Juno jumper probe is a
solution to many of those problems the
geogebra probe might be small but it
packs a punch
not only can you jump-start any car
truck with the added function of our AC
dot you can have a portable outlet just
about any way being in Silicon Valley Oh
is really important for us to have a
modern solution for our needs and a
compact solution as well it's amazing
now to see the response from our guests
with the old type of system it was
really designated only for technicians
and valets to operate and with the new
system we feel comfortable having any of
our employees old or young male or
female trained or not trained as they're
comfortable using this system the 4G no
power we outfitted our washers with
these heavy bulky industrial batteries
it couldn't even last all day with the
Juno power where you can throw in a
backpack or throw it into your bucket
and you can walk from job site to job
site it's been very challenging when a
washers out in the field they've done
two or three jobs and their battery no
longer works they can't do interiors
anymore they have to turn down jobs and
you know power really has helped us kind
of get past that issue which allows us
to be a mobile business a true mobile
business previously we've had issues
when our car batteries died Chris has
been traveling and I've had to call
triple-a I've had to wait a long time
kids are late for school I'm late to
work I've used it to jumpstart my car
with no problem it's essentially dummy
proof it's not intimidating you connect
the cables there's a green light there's
a red light you can't go wrong with it
you push the power button and off we go
we take public transportation into the
office every day so I use the Juneau
jumper Pro to travel with my laptop and
charge it on the go
I also travel with tablets and it
charges that as well as my phone so it's
really basically a one-stop-shop for
portable charging our kids use the Juno
Jumper Pro all the time I feel very safe
and secure with it they use it to charge
their tablets their portable DVD player
we use it on the go we use it in the
backyard we use it in the car
anytime we travel as well from
jump-starting your car to preparing for
natural disasters the Juno Jumper Pro is
there for you and with the addition of
the dock the Juno Jumper Pro is
transformed into the ultimate portable
power source we're ramping up production
and we're almost ready to go but we need
your help to make this possible by
supporting us on Kickstarter
we'll be one of the first to receive the
genotype for pro and you'll never have
to worry about the power again
company rescued me has created the
latest lifesaver electronic device

before you start your vehicle move your
head to the upright position and simply
place it on your ear like this turn it
to the on position any time you move
your head 15 to 20 degrees the headset
will vibrate or beep
depending on the model if you're feeling
drowsy and your head lean slightly
forward it will wake you and alert you
to take immediate action the outcome of
drowsy driving could be tragic
or it could be prevented simply by
owning your own alerting headset visit
