the tranquility and their movements to
the beauty in the way they light up a
room they can't survive in just any
aquarium they need a specialized tank
with no sharp objects or corners hi my
name is Blake rotten home program and we
are the co-creators of the jelly tank
and yes we're plans a year ago we set
out to create the ultimate jellyfish
tank one that solved all the problems
from every other tank on the market
every aspect of the jelly tank design
was based on functionality in form with
its clean lines sophisticated look and
natural flow our proprietary tank design
patent Oslo bar ensures a current
similar to what jellyfish would
experience in their natural environment
we designed the spray bar in a way to
keep the jellyfish from getting sucked
into the grapes while promoting movement
within this allowed us to develop a
powerful filtration system to ensure
optimal and water quality the tank is
small enough to fit on your desk yet big
enough to hold dozens of jellyfish our
design is twice as big as other tanks
and market which gives jellyfish a more
stable environment and makes it easier
for you to maintain there's nothing more
beautiful than illuminated jellyfish so
we integrated a high quality
remote-controlled LED light I can light
up the jellies with whatever color suits
your mood
I can see here and look at it for hours
I think this is so cool that you can
actually have something like this like
on your desk in your house absolutely
we've aligned ourselves with what we
believe to be the fact to create a
sustainable source of jellyfish for our
hangovers we could also system or
purchase on users or expert Aquarius
pivotal confidence join a on a product
that is backed by both science and
research put together be ultimate
starter kit for all your kick starters
we've included everything you need to
get your jelly tank up and running
including going fish we've done all our
homework we've done our prototyping we
have the perfect pod for you and this is
where we need your help in order to get
this into the marketplace and on your
desktop let's put this gently tank in
every household across America or office
or restaurant or anything else awesome
you
one day it was just a dream but now we'd
like to introduce you to solar gaqs
smart blinds that automatically track
the Sun and generate electricity from
its energy it's very simple to use even
children can use green energy for their
needs all reports and control systems
are available on your smartphone solar
tax is an all-in-one solution you simply
plug in your smart blinds and solar
energy starts to power all devices at
home plus you can charge any home
battery storage you want to use and use
a small internal emergency battery
whenever you want this way you produce
your own energy and save money on
electric bills solar gapps
is a perfect system for your home
especially if you live in a flat and
don't have a roof to mount solar panels
on owners of commercial property can
mount solar gaps on windows and reduce
operational costs for instance on air
conditioning we spent thousands of hours
on research and development of our
product we built a dream team with
diverse experience and engaged
successful entrepreneurs as our advisors
and mentors current results of our work
are based on expert reviews from around
the world we created a product that is
ready to be produced and shipped you can
start small and try solar gas technology
order Solar gap sample even this small
part of lines will be enough to charge
your smartphone or fitness gadget you
will appreciate all products quality I
have a dream that one day not home will
be connected to the green but the grid
will be connected to the pole we need
your help to start mass production to
reduce operational costs support us and
