the tranquility and their movements to
the beauty in the way they light up a
room they can't survive in just any
aquarium they need a specialized tank
with no sharp objects or corners hi my
name is Blake rotten home program and we
are the co-creators of the jelly tank
and yes we're plans a year ago we set
out to create the ultimate jellyfish
tank one that solved all the problems
from every other tank on the market
every aspect of the jelly tank design
was based on functionality in form with
its clean lines sophisticated look and
natural flow our proprietary tank design
patent Oslo bar ensures a current
similar to what jellyfish would
experience in their natural environment
we designed the spray bar in a way to
keep the jellyfish from getting sucked
into the grapes while promoting movement
within this allowed us to develop a
powerful filtration system to ensure
optimal and water quality the tank is
small enough to fit on your desk yet big
enough to hold dozens of jellyfish our
design is twice as big as other tanks
and market which gives jellyfish a more
stable environment and makes it easier
for you to maintain there's nothing more
beautiful than illuminated jellyfish so
we integrated a high quality
remote-controlled LED light I can light
up the jellies with whatever color suits
your mood
I can see here and look at it for hours
I think this is so cool that you can
actually have something like this like
on your desk in your house absolutely
we've aligned ourselves with what we
believe to be the fact to create a
sustainable source of jellyfish for our
hangovers we could also system or
purchase on users or expert Aquarius
