when carrying a wallet or purse is
impractical uncomfortable or just a
little bit risky so we made curve the
world's first contactless payment ring
now you can leave all this at home and
still pay for stuff with a single
gesture no pin or paired smartphone
required you can use curve to make
instant payments anywhere that displays
the contactless payment symbol which at
last count was over 38 million locations
worldwide engineered from zirconia
technical ceramic curve is
hypoallergenic nearly as scratch
resistant as diamond and waterproof and
unlike power-hungry smartphones or
smartwatches curve never needs charging
but there's more to curb than just
payment if you're in London you can
simply tap in on buses and on the
Underground avoiding card clash and that
frenzied search of the barrier for your
ticket or oyster cut you can also store
contact details to share with friends or
colleagues at the top of an NFC enabled
phone and you can even use curve to
operate an NFC door lock to access your
home or office

my name is tracy miller and i am the
creator of San the sands travel bottle
was developed because my own problems
with making or buying juices and
smoothies as an avid juice and smoothie
lover I always felt like it was a race
against time to finish my beverage if I
didn't finish it quickly the juice would
separate and start to go bad
after doing research I learned that when
blended fruits and vegetables mixed with
the air they rapidly oxidize or lose
their nutrients and go bad I tried to
find a product solution for this problem
and there really isn't anything
available in the market until now when
our team are brainstorming together was
Tracy on how to preserve juice we kind
of have this recon always when you hit
your forehead and go why didn't I think
of that but I think that we all work
comes after the idea RT work very hard
and put all our energy creativity and
experience together and create a sense
we make sure every concave and every
curve communicates function and we're
just getting started we have plan more
products to be the perfect companion for
your healthy lifestyle this is how Sands
came into development it is a travel
bottle that includes a pump mechanism in
the lift the pump mechanism removes air
and preserves your juice or smoothie for
a longer period of time now we need your
help to bring sand to life sans keeps
your juice fresher for longer
