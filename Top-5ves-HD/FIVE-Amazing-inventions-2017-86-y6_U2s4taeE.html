about this place did you ever miss a
flash of creative genius well it
definitely not alone I need to bring
Jessica here she would love this place I
hope to share that with everybody we are
building a first smart voice recording
wearable
Andy and allows you to capture your
thoughts for the cliq motion nothing to
detract we will stay focused on what
really matters to you organize your
notes with hashtags can integrate them
with your favorite apps
you can create voice memos list and send
reminders do you call our device and
amazing teachers if you move noise and
wanted to our old AI system for my
friend identification
take note and capture your greatest
ideas with ease when you out for a walk
or run it works to find just fine so
don't worry about leaving your phone at
home a full battery charge lots for
about four days of average use since one
has futuristic design to make it
memorable than you remarkable it's
created in the intersection of ways and
symbolizes the sound that you create
when you speak it's fully charged in 30
minutes on a specially designed dog
station but completely device and
allocate interchangeable backs with all
the distractions in life on the go it's
so easy to forget a great idea fan film
is a note pad built for your busy
everyday life it is it's over a year to
build the first holiday now we need your
support to produce the first batch it
will happen all of us sooner or later
make you wish some techie would just
come up with a solution already like
this guy even you're building a Zeppelin
airship science computers minecraft
pokemon and I mean before it was the
going thing for everyone in the dog
stereotypes of indicate that this is the
kind of guys who could invent oh boy
what's that it's a solar power cap where
can I get one well you could get a crowd
to fund me in advance and I'll
manufacture one for you seriously if you
are a human and you own a phone you want
one of these high quality solar panels
on a hat a portable constant charger for
your phone it's perfect for the beach
the mountains playing pokemon go whether
you are wearing it or not and because
the power goes first to the integrated
battery you still have stored power to
charge when you go inside when the sun
goes down or on a gloomy day and don't
forget to say that it needs is a safe to
use lithium iron phosphate battery which
means that it's safe to put on your head
gotcha now let's not waste any more time
if you're watching this video we need
your help to improve the production
quality and produce this product period
we sincerely thank you for anything you
can do whether it's sharing this video
or pre-ordering your solar power tap
right now and since these hats are so
popular it's a pretty good idea to buy
more than one just before you do Marc
summers the creator of solar power tap
wants to say sincerely we thank you for
your support
you
you
Oh
normal
we do what at work in the car and while
we eat you're probably doing it right
now and it's killing your health not
long ago health experts began sounding
the alarm about the dangers of prolonged
sitting an easy way to reduce the amount
of sitting is to use a sit stand desk
the problem is that these
first-generation sit-stand desk lack
many of the features you want and need
in a desk that's why we created vivid
stand versatile refined intelligent
what's it stand desk first at the market
I had to have one with my bad back
sitting all day long is no longer an
option after only that were just a week
I knew that I'd never owned any other
type of death but aside from the obvious
health benefits of calling the system
desk these first-generation desk just
didn't have much to offer I knew that we
could take this it's been death to the
next level for the past 15 years or so
we've been manufacturing high-tech
products and office furniture for
fortune 500 the past two and a half
years we've been designing and
manufacturing excited suits and
desperately want our first priority was
to build sit-stand desk four legs and a
top that fits into any environment more
importantly it had to be top quality
solid as a rock next we added technology
that gave us precise control of the desk
and allowed us to integrate modern
technology and technology that will be
developed years from now finally we
wanted to ensure that our users can
modify their desk to suit their
individual personalities here are just a
few innovations in our Quattro four legs
sit-stand desk four legs sounds simple
but getting four motors to consistently
rise and lower the exact same distance
time and time again is incredibly
complex if we didn't do it right we
would have a desk that would begin to
slope over time it has taken us years to
get this right but you can have a desk
that stays level and functional for
years to come
not only does our vivid LINQ system
precisely controlled desk movement it
has a motion sensor that can activate a
number of features future updates could
allow integration with third-party
devices like phones smartwatches amazon
echo and Siri viv attract a 3-point
mounting system that allows you to mount
accessories and modify your desk in any
way you can imagine ways that we haven't
even thought of desktops choose from
cost friendly laminate eco-friendly
bamboo or long-lasting hardwood options
the Quattro desk movement is smooth and
natural letting you go from a sitting
position to standing in just a few
moments as you use the desk you'll
notice the positive effects of standing
while working almost immediately reduce
stress on your back and thighs increased
productivity energy and better mood but
the long-term effects are just as
important for anyone concerned about
type 2 diabetes cardiovascular health or
obesity sitting all day long should not
be an option as I mentioned before we
can manufacture products for over a
decade we know how to get high-end top
quality products out the door and we
know that we can do the same thing or
did we realized that many people in need
a smaller disk than what we can offer
can our four-legged version that's why
we've introduced the two-legged duo it
offers much the same technology at a
fantastic price you can help by getting
one of our high quality sit-stand desk
at an incredible price pre-order your
vivid stand desk today so we're here on
kickstarter so you can pre by our desk
with the best technology at the lowest
price we believe this will be the last
desk you'll ever need to own

ultra HD we can view all your videos 360
