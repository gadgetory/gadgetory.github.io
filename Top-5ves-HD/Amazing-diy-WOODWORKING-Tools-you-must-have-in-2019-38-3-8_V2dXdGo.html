'el clamp transforms completely the way
you glue wood panels it's two straight
steel bars ensure that panels are flat
every time quickly and easily to make
wood panels with a dam stem clamps start
by putting the bottom bars on two pieces
of wood then adjust the height of the
clamp so it's centered in the thickness
of the panel the dam stem clamp is
designed to work with thicknesses from
3/4 of an inch up to four and a half
inches lay your wood pieces so you can
apply glue on their edges put the pieces
in place for the last step clamping now
put the second bar on top apply downward
pressure and tighten the knob to lock it
in place
drop the locking pin to match the panel
width then tighten the hand screws to
make perfectly flat panels every time
since each dam stem clamp prevents
panels from popping up you can space
them between 12 to 18 inches apart much
more than conventional clamps you will
need less clamps and since they weigh
just 4.6 pounds you can move the panels
out of the way easily no cleaning
problem either with its electrostatic
paint finish glue you won't stain the
wood and you can even peel it off with
your fingernail simplify your wood</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
