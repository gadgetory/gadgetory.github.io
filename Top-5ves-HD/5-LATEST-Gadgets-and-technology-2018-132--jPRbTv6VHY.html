Nutella is now able to eliminate VOCs
bacteria virus fine particulates and
orders and remember there are no filters
to change and it's the only product that
creates fresh new air
it's falsi we worked a lot with fluid

this is Kelvin a home coffee roaster
that turns roasting into something you
can do from your countertop we use to
accept that someone else roasted our
coffee for us with industrial machines a
while ago these pre roasted beans cost
us fifteen to twenty dollars a bag and
start to get stale the instant you open
them
we knew we could make coffee roasting
simple enough to do at home so we
created the Kelvin home coffee roaster
Kelvin lets you start with green beans
straight from the source and roast them
to your exact taste for one-third the
price to create Kelvin we immerse
ourselves in coffee culture to
understand the details of the roasting
process and tested every technology
available to produce the simplest most
effective roaster with no complicated
routines all you need to do is set the
roast time and let Kelvin do the rest
Kelvin uses hot air to evenly roast the
beans it heats up to the right degree
and it automatically cools down the
beans after the roast has ended Kelvin
even filters out the chaff during the
roasting process making cleanup a cinch
to make sure you always have a supply of
fresh beans we also created an app that
allows you to choose your beans from all
over the world with our suggestions for
different roasts that way you can enjoy
a range of flavors each time you roast
Kelvin can roast enough beans for a cup
or an entire pot of coffee we want
everyone to be able to have control over
the most important factor in their
coffees flavor our team of experts have
dedicated their years of experience into
making Kelvin beautiful technically
feasible and easy to use
