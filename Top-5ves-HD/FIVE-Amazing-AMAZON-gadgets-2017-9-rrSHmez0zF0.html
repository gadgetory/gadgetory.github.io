hey there this is Alice Itachi today I'm
going to show you our new type C power
meter and what this will do is measure
power input or power output to your type
C device I'll show you how it works here
so I've got my power bank and my type C
cable
so what I'm going to do is connect the
type-c cable to the power meter and then
plug it into my macbook pro you'll see
this the tachi logo come up here and on
this readout it will measure the voltage
in volts the current and amps as well as
the current over time and milliampere
that's flowing into the MacBook Pro now
let's change modes and we'll show you
how to measure output power so I'll grab
my sitaji hub over here plug this into
the power meter then plug my power meter
into the macbook and then I grab my
iPhone and plug this in to the hub
you'll be able to see on the screen of
the parameter that arrow has changed
directions so it's measuring output
power now
so again it'll give you the same the
voltage the current as well as the
milliamp hours so this device is really
useful for testing your accessories and
peripherals to make sure that they're
operating at their advertised
specifications this will let you weed
out if you have any counterfeit products
or any products that aren't functioning
as they should as well as showing you if
you're charging your type C device such
as the MacBook Pro it will show you how
many milliamp hours have charged over
time as well as showing the drain how
many milliamp hours have left the
MacBook Pro to charge the iPhone so yeah
that's our new type C power meter hope
you guys liked it let me know in the
comments if you have any questions and
check us out on our website to touch net
as well as Facebook Twitter and
Instagram thanks enough a good day
Oh
No
I once ate a whole box of Girl Scout
cookies Samoas are they're really good
and daddy takes a nap I'll eat as much
candy as I can
once I was watching a movie and at the
end I realized I ate a whole pint of ice
cream I love hot cheeto I love bacon I
love hot cheeto once ate 50 pieces of
bacon in a single day I'm obsessed with
hot cheeto I can't stop eating hot
cheetos helped me I'm excited to
introduce you to the kitchen save it fun
and easy way to control temptation the
kitchen save to the tamo container that
puts you in control let me show you how
it works
first place an item in the container
next rotate the dial to set the timer
and finally press the dial to activate
the alarm once the container is locked
it cannot be opened until the timer
reaches zero it's that easy I came up
with the idea of the kitchen safe while
completing my graduate studies I was
looking for something fun and easy to
use and help me with my food cravings
lose a little weight and live a
healthier lifestyle all while still
being able to enjoy the occasional snack
to design a product that lives up to the
highest standards I work with Ryan Tseng
an engineer and classmate I met while
studying at MIT the kitchen's safe is a
time lock container that puts you in
charge you put an item in the container
and set the timer once the timer is set
and the button is pressed the container
locks and cannot be opened until the
timer reaches zero it is a simple
concept that produces powerful results
the goal when designing the kitchen safe
is to create a high quality product that
works well looks good and it's fun to
use
the product has a large clear display a
smooth dial sturdy lock and a clean look
that compares to the highest quality
containers available in stores the
design process took over a year we
investigated many options and with each
prototype we refine the design until we
ended with the great working product the
container base is made from four
millimeter thick acrylic for durability
and a clean look the LCD display was
custom developed to incorporate large
high contrast characters for easy
dealing the dial is specifically
selected for its smooth action time
could be set or short as one minute or
as long as 10 days the electronic
locking mechanism was designed to ensure
a strong seal we have tested the kitchen
safe and we're confident that it is a
great product there you have it the
kitchen state we've worked hard to
develop a great product and I've lined
up a factory for production and this is
where we need your help by ordering a
kitchen safe and spreading the words to
your friends you can help us turn it was
just an idea into a product that
thousands of people can use and enjoy
from all of us at the kitchen safe we
thank you
you
