to heat the cooking forces five times
faster than a traditional charcoal grill
it's super easy to use giving you more
time to enjoy the day feel free
rather than fiddle with a fire since
sole source port has no flame and is
cool to the touch you can also use it in
places like beaches national parks and
apartment buildings where fire cooking
isn't allowed treat yourself a fresh
outdoor cooking free of toxic smoke you
can grill with sole-source in the
morning midday late afternoon when it's
cold when it's windy at the beach even
under passing clouds as long as the Sun
is still smiling down on you the Solar
reflectors are engineered with the ideal
curvature for capturing the sun's ray
providing the equipment of about 600
watt but we're all cooking powers you
can cook from approximately one hour
after sunrise to one hour before sunset
on a bright beautiful sunny day for
example within five minutes the grill
will be at grilling temperatures within
10 it'll be hot enough to sear within 10
minutes charcoal is well it's getting
there even though it's reflecting all
that energy the surface is cool to the
touch as the heat of focus directly onto
the cooking surface and only the cooking
surface aligning the grill with the Sun
only requires you to look into the
blackout mirror and aim the beam right
at your pan the v-shaped cutout puts you
in the captain's chair of the
sole-source sword
because you deserve this grill to work
for you how are we looking there
okay the grilling platform is a
versatile pot stand that allows you to
use the cookware you already own you can
grill pan fry saute steam boil deep fry
pressure cook and slow cook we have
taken our original model and redesigned
it with the on-the-go griller in mind
the new sport assembles in less than
three minutes and packs down to a light
weight to feed carrying case giving you
the freedom to cook anywhere and
remember no flame means no smoke clean
air cooking bright lumps are ahead so
get outside and get grilling whether it
be your first grill a girl for the patio
tailgate beach camping a grill for the
end of the world or you're just looking
for an upgrade the sole source port
makes you the star of any cookout so
head over to our crowdfunding page to
take advantage of our early bird special
pricing grill with soul source port
three
hold on
Oh
in
when you
Oh
that'll never happen to me because I use
this this is the Z course smart case now
it might look like an ordinary phone
case but it ain't now inside my Z case I
got this this is called the Z core this
thing packs a lot of heat not the
regular kind of heat that I keep in my
trunk I'm talking to good stuff advanced
technology the Z core comes with up to
128 gigs of memory that way you can
clear up all those photos from NASCAR
weekend and take more selfies like this
one or that or that's going to be a
problem the Z core comes with a 2600
milliamp smart battery that's a hundred
percent extra charge on most of your
mobile devices all Z course comes
standard with wireless charging you live
in a future baby so cut them wires out
your life yeah in my personal favorite a
god-loving
LED light cuz if you're like me
sometimes the power company shut you off
oh there goes again
Zika is universal it works on almost any
mobile device this here's my brother
Randy he's got an old iPhone 5 because
he owes some child support so if I
wanted to I can let Randy bar Mazique or
this is my brother Jake he's got an
Android phone cuz he's adopted but what
I could let him borrow my Secor - here
you go weird oh look at there it's my
ugly sister now normally I don't let her
borrow my stuff but I can hey Jake give
her the Zeke or Jake he's a little slow
there you go creep works with almost any
mobile device you just switch out the
case you're good to go
I can even use the room camera ah what's
wrong with you
okay and I want to mess this up for
y'all who already got a battery case
like this one but guess what they're
done get a Z course smart case now go
ahead we are breaking photography don't
Romanian facts are from San Francisco
and we got our start here on Kickstarter
in 2014 you helped us launch our first
product the export and the the world's
sharpest and most color neutral envy
filter many of the world's best outdoor
photographers have relied on the x4 nd
for its superior sharpness and color
neutrality performance we took all of
our engineering and success from the x4
neutral density filter and created a
number of new and exciting products for
outdoor photographers the first product
we are excited to announce is the dark
CPL what is a dark CPL it's a polarizing
and neutral density combination filter
the dark CPL eliminates vignetting down
to 16 millimeters on a full frame setup
and combines the industry-leading
performance of our x4 Indy and x4 Cpl
filters the second filter we're excited
to announce is the X 14 the world's
first kippered glass gmv available in
100 and 150 millimeter formats
manufactured with tempered shot be 270
optical glass made in Germany we built
the x4 gene due to withstand the extreme
conditions of outdoor photographers the
x4 genie also features our
state-of-the-art coatings MRC 16 and
nanotech coatings on both sides of the
glass and backed up by our 25-year
ironclad guarantee the x4 GMD will be
available in the five most popular
densities
we're also excited to announce our
second newest product the x4 square envy
and like the circular x4 MD that we
first launched here on Kickstarter this
is the world's sharpest and most color
neutral squared indie filter it also
features our state-of-the-art coding
technology it will be available in
densities ranging from 1 to 10 stops and
100 and 150 millimeter formats we also
created gnv and square in the filter
cases to make it really easy to travel
with a square and GMD filter system just
wouldn't be complete without a great
holder and none of the options on the
market really were that great so we went
back to the drawing board and designed a
new filter holder then getting can be a
common problem with filter holders but
our x100 system over has no been getting
down to 16 millimeters on a full prime
setup and there's a lot of small details
that we think photographers will love
the finished aluminum has been anodized
matte black to reduce reflections into
the lens barrel when the holder is
pressed against the adapter ring the
entire system clicks into place securely
this allows for easy and secure
one-handed operation and similar to our
x4 line of circular filters we've added
traction to the front of the holder to
make it easier to grip as a huge thank
you for helping us make this product
line come to life we're offering each
filter for only $149 only during
Kickstarter and $1.99 for 150 millimeter
formats as well as our new X 100 filter
holder for only $39 each and we know
that Kickstarter can be very risky so
we're extending our website 300 day
return policy to Kickstarter
as a very small startup from San
Francisco it just wouldn't be possible
to take on a project of this scope and
scale if it weren't for this incredible
community from everybody here at
breakthrough photography we sincerely
appreciate your pledges and your support
to help us bring this product line to
life
