assurance that you will have a way to
cook food and boil water in any
situation the quick stove cook kit
includes a custom stainless steel pot
with a sturdy handle that locks the lid
down for easy transportation the lid can
also be used as a cooking pan eating
plate or flipped upside down while
cooking to be used as a double boiler
when not in use
the pot holds the stove and to fuel
disks for easy transportation as a
self-contained kit the cube stove weighs
less than a pound and is made of durable
steel which makes the stove strong
enough to support any sized pot or pan
you would like to use the stove is
optimized to burn the quick stove fuel
disks but easily burns other fuel
sources like fix amine fuel tablets
sterno cans wood charcoal and alcohol
burners
when using the provided pot and fire
starters you can boil four cups of water
in under four minutes the fuel disc is
made of cedar and wax and will burn for
25 to 35 minutes the fuel disc is
essential for emergency preparedness
because it is waterproof and because it
can be stored for years without going

emergency cook kit but in the event that
you do you will be prepared to cook food
boil water and provide heat in any
situation thank you for supporting our

is the origin of survival kit a
multi-tool a waterproof storage case
actually it's all of those things more
durable than a survival kit more
functional than a multi-tool and more
useful than a storage case when you
can't tolerate gear failure the origin
is your kit survival pins can rust and
survival pouches can puncture or tear
but the origin made from durable ABS
plastic and overbuilt where it counts
holds up to abuse after abuse inside the
case and protected by a machined silicon
waterproof gasket you have a collection
of essential survival tools including
waterproof and windproof tinder quick
fire starting tinder stainless steel
wire and nylon cord great for rigging
shelter or repairing gear under the lid
wilderness expert buck Tilton survival
instructions provides 62 tips and tricks
ranging from building a shelter to using
fire to signal rescuers on the other
side of the lid we've added a flip-up
rescue flash signal mirror with a retro
reflective aimer that can send a signal
up to 10 miles away with the origin over
for the one hand operable fire lights
Parker a liquid damped compass for
navigation and a removable
multi-function knife the drop point
knife blade is aus-8 steel and alloy we
chose specifically for its hardness and
edge retention in the base of the knife
is a 100 decibel signal whistle in the
front of the handle has an LED light
that shines down the blade for task
cutting in low light the origin is the
first of its kind but the only thing
that will matter to you when you're
surviving outdoors longer is that the
origin works when other gear fails
