today at CRKT we're showing you the
jettison pocket knife the designer this
knife Robert Carter comes from a long
line of custom knife makers his father
Joe pardhu and grandfather Mel pardhu
had built have built significant names
and designs in the industry this new
knife from Robert Carter definitely
stands up to its heritage and has a very
distinctive look it's got a modified
sheepsfoot blade in a satin finish that
adds to the style the overall look of
the knife it also has these cool stone
wash handles and this oversized pivot
the jettison features a frame lock for
safety and to close that you simply push
aside the frame lock and disengage the
blade the blade can be opened with this
cool shark-fin looking flipper that
easily activates the smooth open action
when you want to deploy the blade the
knife also features a low profile tip up
carry pocket clip and we have another
jettison available in this compact
version so here are the two knives
side-by-side you've got the full size
jettison and the jettison compact
version when open the full size knife
measures about 7.75 inches and the blade
accounts for 3.26 of those inches the
sleek distinctive look of this everyday
carry knife and its modified sheepsfoot
blade style really set it apart from
other modern folding knives out there in
the marketplace right now thanks for
watching and thanks for carrying CRKT

earthquakes tornadoes floods and
hurricanes leave us without running
water gas and electricity which stove
was born because least I need to provide
affordable but reliable camping and
emergency preparedness cooking solutions
we designed this emergency cook kit to
provide you and your loved ones with the
assurance that you will have a way to
cook food and boil water in any
situation the quick stove cook kit
includes a custom stainless steel pot
with a sturdy handle that locks the lid
down for easy transportation the lid can
also be used as a cooking pan eating
plate or flipped upside down while
cooking to be used as a double boiler
when not in use
the pot holds the stove and to fuel
disks for easy transportation as a
self-contained kit the cube stove weighs
less than a pound and is made of durable
steel which makes the stove strong
enough to support any sized pot or pan
you would like to use the stove is
optimized to burn the quick stove fuel
disks but easily burns other fuel
sources like fix amine fuel tablets
sterno cans wood charcoal and alcohol
burners
when using the provided pot and fire
starters you can boil four cups of water
in under four minutes the fuel disc is
made of cedar and wax and will burn for
25 to 35 minutes the fuel disc is
essential for emergency preparedness
because it is waterproof and because it
can be stored for years without going
back we hope you never have to use this
emergency cook kit but in the event that
you do you will be prepared to cook food
boil water and provide heat in any
situation thank you for supporting our
Kickstarter and make sure to keep a kit
in your car office and home the kit is
great for gifts so make sure you buy
extras for friends and family
is the origin of survival kit a
multi-tool a waterproof storage case
actually it's all of those things more
durable than a survival kit more
functional than a multi-tool and more
useful than a storage case when you
can't tolerate gear failure the origin
is your kit survival pins can rust and
survival pouches can puncture or tear
but the origin made from durable ABS
plastic and overbuilt where it counts
holds up to abuse after abuse inside the
case and protected by a machined silicon
waterproof gasket you have a collection
of essential survival tools including
waterproof and windproof tinder quick
fire starting tinder stainless steel
wire and nylon cord great for rigging
shelter or repairing gear under the lid
wilderness expert buck Tilton survival
instructions provides 62 tips and tricks
ranging from building a shelter to using
fire to signal rescuers on the other
side of the lid we've added a flip-up
rescue flash signal mirror with a retro
reflective aimer that can send a signal
up to 10 miles away with the origin over
for the one hand operable fire lights
Parker a liquid damped compass for
navigation and a removable
multi-function knife the drop point
knife blade is aus-8 steel and alloy we
chose specifically for its hardness and
edge retention in the base of the knife
is a 100 decibel signal whistle in the
front of the handle has an LED light
that shines down the blade for task
cutting in low light the origin is the
first of its kind but the only thing
that will matter to you when you're
surviving outdoors longer is that the
origin works when other gear fails
