grandfather used to say people say I
inherited his eyes I don't know about
all that
but one thing I'm sure of is that I got
my love for music from him left me is
vinyl collection it has a special place
in my home right next to my Kozma phone
we've all inherited something whether
it's looks taste hobbies passions Thomas
Edison has left us one of the greatest
inventions of all time the phonograph
although his inheritance is far greater
thanks to his numerous innovations and
inventions this one has evolved the most
evolution can go no further than Cosmo
phone Cosmo phone is much more than a
phonograph much more than a record
player much more than a spectacular
design masterpiece bringing back the
iconic shape of the phonograph with
cutting-edge modern features Cosmo phone
is the perfect choice for everyone who
loves vinyl its speaker can turn 360
degrees so that you'll be able to listen
from anywhere in the room more than that
the speaker is portable so you can take
music with you wherever you go and you
can connect it through bluetooth that
any device you like our passion for
music and vinyl fuels our dream
today we're announcing our newest
Kickstarter campaign masterbox we've
re-engineered an ordinary fidget cube
into a Bluetooth device with a whole
load of useful functions and fit it into
this compact cube in my hand a handheld
trackball and you can easily control
with your thumb when you flip to the top
it's also a fully functional joystick it
also features a laser pointer to make it
the perfect gadget for your presentation
along with a micro SD card slot and last
but not least of course its primary
purpose of digital the masterbox project
was inspired by the frigate q our
engineering team has enabled Bluetooth
connection into a compact q master box
features Bluetooth 4.0 which connects
seamlessly to your laptop compatible
with Windows and Mac simply pairing the
master box with your device it gives you
the ability to control your presentation
home media center and internet browser
it has a wireless handheld trackball
mouse with left/right click function a
joystick capable of remote controlling
VR video for your home media
- monster box is also a brilliant
wireless presenter featuring the microSD
card slot and a laser pointer in 2015 we
took a risk on a non-traditional time
display the original holograph automatic
was the most funded mechanical watch
campaign on Kickstarter proving that
people want something different
never content we've spent the last two
years improving and refining the
original while remaining true to Zarek's
core mission of creating unusual
timepieces we're proud to reveal the
halo graph to automatic
the Hitler F two features Eric's
innovative signature display and halo
hands which float over the arch to
encircle the time the inner hand
highlights the hours the outer hand
highlights the minutes every component
on the halo graph - automatic was
redesigned and upgraded it's powered by
the Miata a2 s7 automatic movement with
an increased 42-hour power reserve the
dial now features larger arcs and bigger
numbers for improved legibility and
several callers have Swiss super lumen
over for reading the time at night two
elements new to the halo graph are a
day/night indicator and a sweeping
seconds display built directly into the
movement grille the dial is covered by
an ultra scratch resistant sapphire
crystal to protect against daily wear
and tear we placed an anodized aluminum
ring between the stainless steel case
and bezel for a pop of color
the halo graph two straps are made from
premium American leather sourced from
the acclaimed tannery
Korwin they feature built-in
quick-release spring bars for easy strap
changes shooting cinematic footage is no
longer just about image quality but
motion
this is Muay the first pocket-sized Olli
for smartphones making it possible for
everyone to capture cinematic footage
with the retractable phone holder and
the patent-pending
rotary legs make it possible to achieve
perfect linear and curved movements with
one tool what about cameras just snap
the swivel clip and mount your DSLR
mirrorless or action cameras the secure
ball joint allows you to capture from
any angle the foldable legs make it
compact and create a low center of
gravity providing the best balance even
with the DSLR we've tried hard to
develop additional abilities for Muay
that enhance its ease of use and boost
your creativity
attaching the flow modules will
transform Mui into a motorized Oliver
flow is the most intuitive and simple
way to have an automated motion just
turn it on and scroll four speed
adjustment with flow X Mui becomes
completely hands-free you can adjust
speed direction and control your camera
remotely Mui
will go fast enough to follow the action
and slow enough to capture perfect time
lapses
tract will turn your movie into a
lightweight and easy to set up slider
that can be mounted to any tripod it is
made from airplane grade aluminum to
ensure the best quality and stability
it's foldable then compact just put it
into your backpack and discover the
world mui is small but powerful it can
shoot steep incline shots on low
climbing freely along the track without
a cable or belt we've gathered an
amazing team of product designers and
engineers we iterated and tested it over
and over again finally creating
something we are truly proud of our
mission is to empower and inspire people
to tell better stories and make
professional videography available for
everyone anywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
