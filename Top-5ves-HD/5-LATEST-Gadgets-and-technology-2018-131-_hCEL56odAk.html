would enhance the experience of using
printed books we took inspiration from
the calmness of the Swedish countryside

banker bookmarks that prevents your book
from closing to use it simply slide into
your book and the pages will stay open
without the need for your hands to turn
pages simply slide up and flip

to ensure that both the design the
manufacturing behind the page anchor
could meet our street standards the end
result is a collection of four models
all crafted and 3/16 on stainless steel

with a layer of precious metals the
combination of these three steps result
in both longevity and a beautiful
timeless finished
