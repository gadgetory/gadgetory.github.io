speeding ticket and let's be honest some
of you more than others don't worry
we get it you're important you're super
important your slow motion tossing your
hair in the wind important you've got to
get there 42 seconds earlier I get it
me too the thing is you're not and
speeding that's some serious stuff
fact is we spend eight billion dollars a
year on speeding tickets and that's just
in North America this stops now that's
why we designed trap tap this round
little Marvel can save your life and
you're going to see cool right you're
trapped app will notify your potentials
rivals such as red light cameras and
schools them flashing red I'll even
flash green to let you know when you're
speeding also this little guy flashes
the blue for those hidden speed traps
and camera pros we rely on you and
everyone else to help find these around
your city you see a speed trap and your
trap tap doesn't light up it means
you're the first one to find it you're
like a modern-day Columbus just tap
twice and boom you saved everyone cash
possibly a life
sounds like that could be annoying right
now it's not just tap the device once
while it's lit up to silently take the
speed trap is no longer there double tap
to remove the alert and update the
community thinking about setting fake
alerts don't bother we have algorithms
to prevent false positives but statute
Oxford it won't work I know what you
think Scotty I already have now why do I
need that good thing there easy is and
not distracting at all and yes you know
there other maps and apps that can help
you too
problem is if confusing and dangerous to
use so dangerous they force you to take
your eyes off the road now this this is
easy and safe all right let's say your
car isn't available and you need to use
your friends right you can't take that
pad - now systematic with trap taps it's
simple to change cars just pick it up
and move it
what's that you don't have a car I hear
you brother we haven't forgotten about
you easily attached to trapped copter
bike rather ride it's let's be real you
want to be safe and lower the amount of
money you waste on speeding tickets so
you can continue to the things that you
love we are trapped up you're not so
annoying backseat driver
Jarvis you there
that's your self-assess eh heads-up
display check
you
Oh
you
70% of Americans have trouble falling
asleep at least one night a week it's
never been harder to turn off our mind
completely unplug and reach a deep
relaxation and restless that we actually
introducing gravity a weighted blanket
engineered to be 10% of your body weight
to naturally reduce stress and increase
relaxation through deep pressure
stimulation over the last year we've
studied the incredible science and
medical research about the positive
effects that weighted blankets can have
on serious conditions like PTSD insomnia
OCD and serious forms of anxiety this is
critical because 40 million people in
the country suffer from prolonged
anxiety that is 18 percent of the
country and so we wanted to take this
science and design a product that could
help everyone each gravity blanket is
tailored to represent about 10% of your
body weight it evenly distributes
pressure across your body while you rest
by stimulating these pressure points
gravity blanket increases serotonin and
melatonin levels while decreasing
cortisol nough some studies even
reported that 90% of participants felt
an overall calmer feeling and a reduced
sense of anxiety and it isn't just for
sleep the black you can be used in bed
or it can be used on the couch after a
super long day or it can assist you in
reaching a deeper meditation or mindful
we've developed a range of weighted
options spanning from 15 20 and 25
pounds to fit your individual needs and
preferences from beautiful design to
material sourcing we set out to create a
blanket that looks and feels as great as
it performs the inner shell is a hundred
percent cotton while the outer shell is
a beautiful and ultra comfortable micro
plush fabric the soft outer shell
provides amazing comfort for warmth
during the colder months and it's easily
removable to
main cool during the summer this also
makes it super easy to watch our trusted
manufacturing partners are ready to go
all we need is your support to make this
product a reality introducing knit bar
the main hub is the brain and it's Wi-Fi
enabled it tracks and monitors
electricity usage at an outlet level you
can plug it directly into an outlet or
use it as a power bar where you can add
many different modules like smart
outlets USB chargers a Wi-Fi repeater
and an environment sensor that tells you
about the temperature humidity light and
sound level in your ambience the surge
protector keeps everything safe and the
extension cable well it makes things
easier and all the modules speak with
the main hub and the main hubs because
your Wi-Fi this allows the main hub to
send your outlet level electricity usage
to the knit app you can view your usage
historically and in real time the app
also enables you to remotely control
schedule and set smart rules to automate
when things turn on or off the
possibilities are endless why air a
roadie and I were playing first-person
shooter we're sitting there on the couch
and driving his Jeep I'm on the back and
I'm pounding away with the gun and he's
hitting the bump and then the thing
explode
on the screen we go flying but there's
really nothing except a little vibration
what good is that like is something
missing here we started thinking about
wow you know that would be great if we
could kind of get that feeling across
not only do you feel the impact but you
feel a spread and you get a kickback and
it's all there the whole experience and
that's when you actually feel like
you're totally immersed with air eggs
that's what you get
my name is Brody Stanfield I'm the
president co-founder of F tech my name
is Michael Stanfield and I'm the vice
president and co-founder gaining today
is a two dimensional product experience
is limited to sight and sound and so
we're providing a new dimension if the
suit is a haptic products that provide
sensory stimulation taking the user into
the game whether it be sound sensations
of touch the idea of the impact Eric
will put you into that experience that
you've always wanted there are three
major components to the suits there's
the decoder the exoskeleton and the sim
skin the decoder is the piece that
attaches actually to your console or
platform take information then it brings
that and send it to the exoskeleton the
exoskeleton is now the component that
sort of has all the pieces in Eric that
you're wearing from the nervous system
which is the feedback to the control
center which takes the information from
the decoder as well as the power
supplied to make sure it's wireless
the sound that we're providing is a
patented sound is quite a different
experience we want to make it a surround
sound feel for the ideas we have six
speakers two on the front on this side
two on that side and then on the back
one here and one here as well as a
subwoofer you're always in the sweet
spot no matter where you are
and as for like vibratory feedback right
now it's always been to the controller
so you feel a rumble in your hand now
we're actually getting it so it's
located on the specific parts your body
where it should be there are sixteen
points on the front eight points on the
side and sixteen points on the back
alright so first thing we're going to do
is I'm going to test this in vibrational
stuff so to start with I'm just going to
set a value here and I'm going to top
right you feel that yeah all right so
let's switch that over to bottom left
and with you yeah which is that's pretty
much how vibration works as for stims
they're pretty much focused on
particular muscles they contract the
muscles it can either give a full
contraction or it can be a slight
contraction once again same things
operate so they just have some file you
okay yeah shut that off how you feeling
we can see it moving your shoulder
forward like that yeah I know being
awake alright that's pretty much it for
the basic fundamentals what air I can
actually do so what do you think of it
it was pretty interesting and I really
experienced something like that yes
virtual world awareness you actually
inside the world that you're playing it
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
