you
today at CRKT we are taking a look at
the leon mod designed eaton tool this is
one of our very most popular products of
all time and with good reason basically
it is a glorified spork a spork on
steroids if you will you've got your
spoon there as well as your fork tines
right there you got a bottle opener that
works very nicely right here we have a
cutout for your hand so you can grip it
nicely and the thing about that is it's
going to cut down on the weight
significantly this tool only weighs 1.5
ounces so if you're looking for
something for backpacking or just
something light for your kit for your
car kit or camping this is a great
little tool you've got a little flathead
screwdriver there kind of a chisel point
on the end right there and then you've
got three metric wrenches you've got a
ten millimeter an eight millimeter and a
six millimeter comes with a carabiner so
you can clip it to your backpack clip it
to your pants your gear that sort of
thing now I love this tool I have a
black one myself I take it camping all
the time and highly enjoy it it comes in
black as well as your orange I believe
we call that tangerine is the official
color name on that one fuchsia which is
to say pink and we have a yellow one as
well the colorful ones have a little bit
more high visibility so you're less
likely to lose it in camp so keep that
in mind when you're selecting your color
anyway it is a very cool tool designed
by Leon MA and available all over the
place thanks for watching if you have
any questions be sure to visit our
website and thank you for buying using
and eating off of CRKT tools thanks and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
