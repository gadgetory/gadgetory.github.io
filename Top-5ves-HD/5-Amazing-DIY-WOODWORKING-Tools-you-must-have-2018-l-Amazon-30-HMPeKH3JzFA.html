for hundreds of years craftsmen have
used cope joints for inside corners when
fitting crown and other trim moldings
inside corners are almost never truly
square and a proper cope joint can adapt
to the variations until now coping a
complex joint was a tricky and
time-consuming task but rocklers speed
cope jig makes it easy by providing a
stable platform for your jigsaw to ride
on simply cut your molding as you would
for an inside mitre then square cut the
bottom point to meet the flat of the
molding the speed cope can adjust to
nearly any molding up to seven and a
quarter inches wide
keeping your jigsaw in the same plane as
the miter cut the sharp details are
relief cut then simply jigsaw along the
line where the miter meets the molding
