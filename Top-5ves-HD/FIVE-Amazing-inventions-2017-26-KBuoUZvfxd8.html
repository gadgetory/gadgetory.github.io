Talon in your hand and that's it two
years ago we bought you tactic is first
crowdfunding campaign the one bottle
opener and now we have our latest
innovation ready for you Talon pushes
the limits with materials technology and
functionality its patent-pending design
is made possible by using an advanced
composite material this makes it super
strong and enables the unique unibody
design that increases strength and
hardness we've also created a dual
purpose storage compartment into the
design to function as a socket something
that hasn't been possible in a
multi-tool until now we make the Talon
in Melbourne Australia and over the past
few months our team has worked closely
to perfect the design for manufacture
it's great to be involved again with the
same factory that produces our popular
one bottle opener this kind of
collaborations make sure that everyone
involved has a deep understanding of the
project and the high standards we expect
having a local manufacturer also reduces
the risks usually associated with
overseas manufacture now waiting on
shipments faulty products or delivery
delays will be right there in front of
the machine as they come off the line it
doesn't get any more personal than that
importantly tooling has already
commenced yes that's right we've made
the decision to launch straight into the
production process because we reckon
you're gonna want one or two in time for
Christmas we're tooling the mods now and
we'll be ready for full-scale production

support and look forward to getting a
