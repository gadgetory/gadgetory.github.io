hi Kickstarter I'm John an industrial
designer with over 20 years experience
designing and developing products for
industrial clients fabricating models
and prototypes is a huge part of what I
do but I'm using a laser cutter a CNC
router or 3d printer or all of them
together but follow the methods and
tools that I use just one I've relied on
heavily over the years and that's vacuum
forming it's my so-called secret sauce'
way it comes to making three-dimensional
plastic parts the problem is though back
informers aren't exactly accessible
they're massive factory great equipment
the constant arm and leg and there
aren't really any proper that subversion
system either until this is vaca for the
world's first digital desktop back and
former now everyone can shape and form
plastic like a seasoned pro with
vacuform smart efficient and easy to use
features such as I exclusively design
high-performance hybrid vacuum system
that delivers extremely detailed shapes
and parts a computer-controlled heater
and thermal probe the monitors of
plastics temperature in real time
and a built-in library of heating
profiles for various materials so you're
sure to get perfect results part after
part just select a correct profile from
the menu press Start and wait for the
vacuum to switch on once it's on all you
have to do is slower the handle bar and
begin vacuum forming with a vacuform you
get a compact professional-grade vacuum
former without a hefty price tag
allowing you to finally get that ball
rolling on that business idea of yours
or simply make things for your own
personal enjoyment whatever those things
might be whether it's one of designer
toys custom packaging for bespoke
gadgets
or one of a kind art pieces by back in
my project I'll be able to produce the
first batch of back you forms and put
them in the hands of makers everywhere
helping them bring their awesome ideas
to life I'll also be able to do further
research on new raw materials and
develop vacuform software even more
continuously expanding its library of
eating profiles so vacuform actually
gets better with time now that sounds
like a pretty good investment don't you
think for more details feel free to look
around my Kickstarter profile and make
sure to visit vacu forms official
website and Facebook page Thanks now
