assembly can be one of the biggest
challenges the Craig 90-degree corner
clamp simplifies the assembly process by
aligning and holding corners and
partitions at perfect 90-degree angles
so you have both hands-free to end
fasteners
unlike some corner clamps that can be
cumbersome to use the 90-degree corner
clamp is simple plus it works with
ninety degree but joints and T joints
used to attach shelves and partitions
all you have to do is squeeze the padded
handles and the clamps cast aluminum
wedge and V shapes draw tight against
the inside and outside phases of the
joint this holds the two pieces at
exactly 90 degrees a reversible corner
stone makes it easy to align the mating
pieces in the clamp while edge stops
cast into the under V help ensure that
the edges will be flush and aligned too
with the clamp holding the joint
securely together you can add the
fasteners the 90 degree corner clamp
works great for building with Craig
pocket all joinery it even has access
points in the under V that allow you to
drive a Craig screw with the clamps
still in position openings in the outer
V also make it easy to attach the joint
with the brad nailer or even to drill
and drive conventional wood screws the
90 degree corner clamp is great for
building drawers cases boxes and more
because it works with thin materials and
lumber up to one inch thick and thanks
to Craig's Auto max Auto adjusting
technology you never have to readjust
the clamp when you move from one
material thickness to another just
squeeze the clamp handles and automax
technology does the rest applying the
perfect amount of easy to regulate
clamping pressure to the joint every
time and with every material thickness
when you're looking for a fast foolproof
way to create square corners and
perfectly positioned shelves or
partitions on your woodworking and
do-it-yourself projects the Craig 90
degree corner clamp is the perfect
solution
keeping a clutter free and organized
shop is critical in this smart addition
to the Festool MFT adds valuable space
and convenience

simplify your dado cuts with the
woodpecker's dado setup fixture or DSF
and when paired with the woodpeckers gap
gauge tedious dado setups are a thing of
the past
the traditional method for setting up
dado cuts can be a repetitive
frustrating pursuit and without a
precise way to measure data width or
securely arrange the dado stack you're
forced to reach inside your saw again
and again to get the right cut
by mimicking the mounting of the dado
set on your table saw the DSF allows for
an easy economic setup just take a
physical reading of the material with
the gap gauge then match with the DSF to
set the perfect dado with eliminating
the need for multiple test cuts saving
time and stress the DSF incorporates a
5/8 inch brass Arbor and threaded knob
that fully compresses the dado stack
just as your saws Arbor nut would and
can accommodate dedos up to fifteen
sixteenths of an inch thick quickly
secure the DSF with a bench vise by
drilling into a work surface and
inserting the included three eighths
inch pins or mount to a Festool MFT with
its perfectly matched bushings a clever
addition to your shop the gap gauge
makes gauging the thickness of material
or the dimensions of a joint a one-step
operation and the mini gap gauge is
perfect for mortise and tenon joinery
work more efficiently and make dado
setups quick and easy with the
woodpecker's dado setup fixture and gap
gauge
a combination built for precision in the
USA
woodpeckers newest one-time tool the
ultimate doweling jig significantly
broadens the scope of dowel joinery
possibilities like Center holes for face
frames offset holes for 1/8 inch reveals
and double hole offsets for robust T
joints and miter joints furthermore it
can be used for non Dowling chores like
drilling precisely spaced and aligned
rows of shelf pin holes our jig is
certainly the broadest one you've ever
seen thick aluminum beefy stainless
steel and solid brass produce a
rock-solid foundation that will not
distort when applying full clamping
pressure to your stock you can be sure
your dowel holes are drilled dead not
square this baby weighs in at more than
4 pounds and that doesn't even include
the end stop edge guide and attachment
bars the ultimate doweling jig comes
with hardened stainless steel drill
guide bushings mounted in the 1/2 inch
thick by 4 and 1/4 inch wide by 7 inches
long solid aluminum base plate drill
guide bushings come in two sets of four
in both 1/4 inch and 3/8 inch diameters
also available in optional five six
eight and 10 millimeter diameters as
well guide bushings travel in a slot in
the base plate and are always perfectly
spaced thanks to the innovative
stainless steel cam plate the cam plate
features a scale and pointer that
indicates hole Center spacing the
spacing range is 3/4 inch to one and 1/4
inch
below the baseplate are a fixed clamping
jaw and a unique adjustable jaw
stainless steel and brass clamping
screws are fitted to the fixed jaw and
can be used in three different positions
for holding narrow or wider stop the jig
holds stock up to two and 3/8 inch thick
the adjustable jaw can be set for either
centered or offset hole drilling
perfectly spaced double rows of dolls
are not only possible they're easy jaw
justement is achieved by selecting one
of four jaw faces a b c and d and where
the face is positioned on the base plate
face a and c allow 1/16 inch adjustments
and face b and d allow 1/32 inch
adjustments proper positioning is
guaranteed thanks to engraved scales on
the base plate and matched serrated
grooves milled into the base plate and
jaw and once the jaw is fastened in
place the grooves prevent unintentional
movement of the jaw the adjustable
clamping range from hole Center is from
1/4 inch to 1:13 30 seconds of an inch
the ultimate doweling jig adjustable end
stop delivers repeatable perfection it
functions in three different ways front
face for tall boards notch corner for
longer boards and with the round pin
installed for offsets less than 2 inches
it's the perfect solution for drilling
precisely aligned holes in mating pieces
think drilling face frames for joining
and grain rails to edge grain styles the
end stop is primarily used at the end of
the jig in combination with 4 3/8 inch
by 12 inch long stainless steel
attachment bars that easily thread
together for extension up to 48 inches
they can also be attached to the side of
the jig for other applications
easy-to-read laser engraved scales are
on the bottom of the baseplate for
setting the end stop to the whole center
of the drill guide bushing which is
reflected by the zero line either mark
your first hole location on your board
and align it to the zero mark or use the
scale and align the board's edge to the
desired distance yet another unique
feature is the adjustable edge guide a
major limitation of all other Dowling
jigs is they only work near the edge of
the work piece
woodpeckers ultimate doweling jig sports
an adjustable edge guide that blows this
challenge out of the water now you can
use dowel joinery on the face of wide
stock and plywood simply remove the
clamping jaws attach one or more
extension rods to the base plate then
slide the edge guide onto the rod now
you're set to use dowels to join parts
that were virtually impossible before
and the edge guide can also be used to
drill a series of accurately spaced
repeatable holes in case work parts like
bookshelf sides for shelf supports this
task is easily accomplished using the
supplied 1/4 inch and three-eighths inch
guide pins just insert the guide pin in
the first drill guide bushing to index
from your first or last hole drill it's
that simple and for those of you who use
the 32 millimeters system this ultimate
doweling jig can easily be set for
thirty two millimeter line boring
woodpecker's ultimate doweling jig has
it all our latest one-time tool has
everything you could ever want in a
doweling jig highest quality materials
made to exacting tolerances stout
construction and easy to use with great
features no other doweling jig is ever
provided make it feel at home in your
