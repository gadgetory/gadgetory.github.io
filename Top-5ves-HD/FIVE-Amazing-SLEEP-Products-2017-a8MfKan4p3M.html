hi my name is Maria I'm the co-founder
of Olli I'm also working mother to three
wonderful kids I'm sure most of you can
imagine what morning's look like my
house an entire week without being woken
up way too early
forget it children under the age of
eight don't understand the concept of
time they wake up and think the day
started on the wakeup no it's still
night time but get up anyway over the
years we tried all kinds of products to
help them understand that it's too only
together we knew they had to be a better
solution so two years ago we went on a
journey to create it ourselves we
surveyed thousands of parents
interviewed sleep training experts and
read countless case studies from sleep
scientists and that is how only a spawn
only is really different from anything
else on the market it is the first app
connected sleep training companion that
prevents your child from waking you up
too early in the morning only uses
colors to help your child understand the
concept of time using only is simple
first for the night pick one of the
scientifically recommended colors for
optimal sleep quality such as red then
pick up choice favorite color for the
time together such as dream only is not
ready to operate on itself the only
thing left is to make sure your child
understand it's okay to get up when all
is green your child may still wake up
early but he will remember to sing bed
until Olli turns green
then you will know it can come to your
room and that you will happily let him
climb in bed with you
we can also help with your choice
bedtime or night time routine actually
Olli can assist you in all your daily
routine activities it will help you as
parents is the power struggle unwind and
enjoy each other's company
everything about Olli is designed to
make it a delightful experience for you
and your child you can reduce Ali's
intensity down to the slightest clue for
a soft reassuring presence the online
want an extra thirty minutes of sleep on
a Sunday morning simply make a
last-minute change with one tap on your
iPad or iPhone
we can Grandma's family vacations only
follows your child wherever he goes no
need to have an iPhone or iPad around
Ollie's battery can last up to seven
days on a single charge we created early
because we were frustrated with the
impractical products out there two years
of obsessive designing prototyping and
testing has brought us here
the result is unlike any other solution
milligan device with a seamless
experience now ready for mass production
we can't wait to bring Elsa skip to join
your family thank you
we take over 6000 breaths but what are
we actually breathing in regular bed
linens and pillowcases are covered with
hundreds of millions of microbes and
quickly become a breeding ground for
dust mites and allergens
although advised to clean our sheets
every two to three days most of us wash
them every 5 to 7 weeks
introducing 29 linens copper sheets and
pillowcases 29 linens are infused with
natural copper to eliminate harmful
pathogens on a molecular level
copper attracts bacteria upon contact
copper ruptures the bacterial cell wall
destroying bacteria at an amazing rate
billions of cells in only minutes our
technical process weaves copper
threading with bamboo fibers into an 800
thread count crisp per cal weave every
second regular bed sheets go unwashed
bad bacteria grows but our linens
showing 99% elimination of bacteria in
just 30 minutes
we spend one third of our lives in bed
and we don't want to go another night
inhaling countless pathogens and
bacteria 29 linens are a better way to
solve and prevent future problems from
occurring one clean and comfy night
sleep at a time so join us in making our
dream a sweet dream for all of us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
