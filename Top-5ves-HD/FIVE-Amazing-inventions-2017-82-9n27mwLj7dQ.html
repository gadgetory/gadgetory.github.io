okay like the idea and being in here
for me whether or not I get outside is
not an option it's just a matter of when
where and how I've always loved the
outdoors
mountain biking skiing trail running
camping you name it
one thing that is always bugged me is
the hassle of changing in and out of my
gear when it's dirty wet or snowy out
there
balancing my shoes or using my car mat
or tau was never a good option that's
how I created the adventure mat
it finally makes changing outdoors
simple
the adventure med is a gateway to the
outdoors it allows you to transition to
nature without the hassle
enjoying the outdoors just got that much
more enjoyable
