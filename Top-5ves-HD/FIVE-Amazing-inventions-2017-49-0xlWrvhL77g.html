I'm Raphael the founder of neo let's
talk about the things around us we have
so many different devices and each one
has their own remoter app you end up
with so many jumping from one remote to
another or when using an app finding
your phone unlocking it finding the
right app and waiting until the app is
ready it's cumbersome and inconvenient
it would be so much easier to control
everything from one place that's why we
have created neo neo is a smart system
that connects to all the devices in your
home and makes them available one
easy-to-use app and for the ultimate
simplicity used to neo remote it
recognizes you and lets you control
everything instantly so whether you're
watching a movie setting mood lighting
relaxing with your favorite music or
lowering the window shades neo makes it
effortless and trust us setting all of
this up is insanely simple to make near
absolutely amazing we assemble the team
with expertise in home automation
software hardware and consumer product
design we truly inspired each other to
create something really special after
year of research and development we have
perfected the remote you will be
delighted with the results new has just
the buttons which are absolutely needed
to get that tactile feedback whether
cranking up the volume or flicking
through the channels
new includes a superb high-density
touchscreen display surpassing even
apple's hyper matina standard we
embedded a hand detection technology
engineer for which we have a patent
pending the technology knows you and
shows you your favorites instantly the
neo will even help you set and manage
parental controls near goes months
without needing to be charged and if you
can't find it use your phone to activate
the SOS so you know where its hiding the
rise is like Apple TV nest Hugh sonos
Roku and over 10,000 other major
audio-visual devices are supported right
from the box our driver team and some
more devices every day so even if you
don't have the latest devices Neil will
just work we've been spending a lot of
time testing devices and electronic
stores and repair shops and that's why
it is insanely easy to set up now we are
currently producing the first news if
you order it now you will belong to the
first people to own one thank you well
as a facial massage of course you
haven't but this toothbrush does that
and more but before we tell you about
our world-class features and the health
benefits of our three deep toothbrush
we'd love to share our story in the
words of our Creator who has 20 years of
experience in product design and
manufacturing six years ago my kid got a
tooth problem the dentist asked my kid
to use a better toothbrush so I searched
the electric toothbrush market after I
tried a few high-end new products I
still knew none of them were good enough
for my kid it took five years of dental
research user studies and product
designing finally I invented more
effective technology in oscillating
rotating and sonic for our electric
toothbrush and the users loved it
then my wife had to ask you love our kid
enough to make her a new product how
about me it was a newsflash to me I
could add two options for women's facial
care the three deep toothbrush uses
sonic circular vibrations to thoroughly
buff your teeth it's far more effective
than any other tooth brush on the market
at removing plaque and it even forces
toothpaste between your teeth in a world
where the majority of cavities are
caused by poor brushing you need this
kind of precision in a toothbrush and as
a bonus the two additional heads for the
three deep are great for facial
cleansing and massage this multifaceted
tool comes with three toothbrush heads
so it's a perfect gift for the whole
family and there's no need for batteries
you can recharge it over and over now of
course three deep can't happen without
your support we need you to back our
campaign today so we can better spread
the word and produce the first run of
our product so take control of your oral
and facial health and pre-order your
three deep toothbrush today person the
one who wakes up early dive straight
into a morning meditation is super
productive at work drinks those eight
glasses of water and always hits the gym
but let's be real living that life means
building better habits and our brains
want to follow the ones we already have
not the new ones we're trying to cram it
but sometimes all you need is the right
nudge
hi I'm Kayla and meet modi a smart
companion for building better habits we
created modi with a distinct purpose to
empower people to take those small steps
that over time result in big impacts in
our health and happiness these more than
just a cute face Modi is designed the
latest insights from both behavioral
science and social robotics when you
place Modi in your home or office every
time you walk by he becomes an instant
reminder to keep committed each time you
do your habit Modi is there to help you
track and celebrate your small wins
giving you that immediate gratification
the better you get the more excited 30
times but slack off and Modi might get
angry or sad or stay purely encouraging
Modi knows what works best for you
because he's connected to the web he's
constantly analyzing and evolving so he
knows how you're progressing if you're
at risk of falling off and when to send
the right types of nudges specifically
for you compare all this to the same
daily push notification you keep
ignoring still how can something so
simple actually change your behavior to
tell you about how we form good habits
let's start with something that we're
all familiar with forming a bad habit
boom cookie fundamentally your brain
needs three things to form a habit a
trigger a routine and a reward when I
saw that plate of cookies I didn't even
think about grabbing my brain
immediately triggered me and I knew that
eating that cookie would reward me with
its sweet Joey deliciousness your brain
forms good habits in just the same way
by completing this loop over and over
again moni works by seamlessly
integrating these three elements into
your busy lifestyle Modi himself is a
trigger more specifically what's known
as an environmental cue and by using
Modi your habit is already set up to be
small distinct and actionable finally
movie celebrations provide an immediate
reward he makes sure that you feel
satisfied and accomplished each and
every time and perhaps a big guilty if
you're not
moni is the outcome of over a year of
human centered design and engineering
rigor we discovered that triggers and
rewards driven by emotion are far more
potent than numbers lists or alarms now
we're finally ready to release movies
straight to you the only question is
what habit will you
when we can't help you magically climb
Mount Everest or run a marathon
overnight he's there to help you do
something more essential become a better
you one habit at a time but we need your
help please back us and be a part of
bringing Modi to life be I love
everything about it I love the movement
of the noise i love the shows and i
spent many years in many loud
environments listening to DJ's play and
bands and what I've realized is that hey
I love music we have a lot access to it
and I'll keep doing it and then later
down the line i realize that i hearing
issue people don't know what that
ringing sound in the ears that is a
person slowly losing their hearing being
a DJ led me to clubs and let me to my
first night club we decide to build one
of the world's most powerful sound
systems in new york and that is where
the problem started spending probably
almost 24 hours a day seven days a week
into place to get home then you have
this acoustical hangover and you wake up
with a headache and you're irritable
with the good of what it is and the fun
part there was this other dark side
which is not really addressed in these
places because it's gonna be bad for
business and I own them so being the
cause of something I think I felt an
obligation when I started this you know
it was a real problem I've developed a
serious case of tinnitus and this what
led me to an audiologist to get my
hearing examined
he fitted me for a musician air plug
cost me a lot of money I was like
looking at these things that went out
with it and basically when I were the
one he gave me people are saying to know
you were in a hearing aid what I wanted
to do is make sure that no one else has
to go through this we spend a lot of
time and money and engineering to come
up with a really beautifully designed
product that is superior to anything out
there but it does it enhances fidelity
and what fidelity means is you're gonna
be able to put in the product in your
ear you can go out and you'll be able to
hear the most amazing music with as much
clarity and you can still have a
conversation with someone next to you
and you'll go home and not have this
acoustical hangover I don't want to be a
preacher about it but what I want to do
is somehow create an awareness factor
and I think prevention is the foundation
the level of awareness is what's going
to shape this product and take it to it
needs to go
