improve your posture just stick it on

is the only device that truly senses the
bag it's also the only pastor trainer
that works no matter what you're doing
sitting standing or walking oh look one
of the screen slouches has discovered
that if you press the button once more a
bright go switches to tracking mode a
mode that doesn't vibrate when you
slouch but still keeps all your daily
posture data in the upright app

toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates

humans you're the hygiene hero so it's
no wonder you think you're winning the
constant battle against microbes that
can spread like wildfire and make your
entire family sick nasty little buggers

products and environments that your
loved ones use every day we call this
enviro hygiene and if you're ignoring it

decades that certain wavelengths of
light eradicate all kinds of gross
microbes like mold and bacteria do you

about our or of anti microbial life it
uses sub UV light wavelengths that are
safe for humans and are still ultra
powerful at killing microbes it's
convenient size and shape means it can
fit into all kinds of products it's
waterproof these three attributes make
the orb incredibly useful
