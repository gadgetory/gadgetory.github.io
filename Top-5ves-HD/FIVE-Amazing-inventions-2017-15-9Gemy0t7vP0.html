something that every one of us does but
then most of us don't do as well as we
should sleep we spend a third of our
lives doing it each day is dependent on
it but we still neglect it knowing how
you slept is good but it's not enough
you need to begin to understand why you
slept a certain way while you sleep at
night you have no idea what is happening
nobody's even thinking about the most
important room of our lives and how it
impacts us the bedroom hello we want to
change that sense is a simple system
that tracks your sleep monitor the
environment of your bedroom and reinvent
clr sense watches for noise light
temperature particulates in the air and
more prove the sleep pill your movements
at night tells you how soundly you're
sleeping if you're disturbed at 3am you
should be able to see if it was your
partner snoring or a car alarm that went
off we all have a natural sleep cycle
but a normal alarm will wake you up
regardless of when's best for you with
census smart alarm it knows how to wake
you up at the right time so you don't
start the day feeling terrible
if you want to be up by nine-thirty but
you already have awakened 915 then your
alarm should know to go off they're not
wait for you to fall deeper into sleep
here at hello we've been heads down for
quite a while now building we're a team
of designers engineers and operations
experts who collectively have built
products and services that millions of
people around the world use in love
making world-class hardware and software
on their own as part doing these things
in concert together obviously becomes
even more complex that's why we've
assembled a team of the best people to
do just that with the rise of wearables
you've seen that people clearly care
about this sleep but to us it felt so
natural to be worrying about putting
something on charging it remembering to
press buttons we believe that technology
needs to disappear it didn't make sense
to us that we've been told to put
something on just as we get into bed
everything of sense is designed to fade
away you should simply be able to just
sleep when designing sense we didn't
want to create something that looked
like just another piece of technology
that's easy to do it's much harder to
design a device that feels at home
sitting beside your bed every day it
should look like an object that you'd be
happy to have their almost regardless of
its purpose for something so natural
asleep we wanted to design something
that felt organic the spherical form and
nest like structure helped to keep
things both simple and strong to get to
where we are today we've iterated
literally hundreds of times by being
able to 3d print and laser cut our way
out of almost anything we've settled on
a design that's beautiful and one that
also functions perfectly with all the
sensors we have inside fitting so much
insight such a small space is pretty
hard when you look at what goes inside
sense engineering everything to fit is a
challenge but it's fun
it's like a beautiful puzzle fitting
together perfectly to become strong
sturdy and to protect everything inside
objects shouldn't just be designed to
look good they should be designed to
last that's what building things for
people is about but sense in the sleep
pill we wanted things to stand the test
of real life and we've made sure we did
just that sleep is important to the
Chevron so we didn't want to make this
product hidden in silence and without
your help you on the Kickstarter
community to help us in shape more per
building as we build it with your
support we can together help people to
better understand themselves and the
world around them we're so excited to
put sense and get it to you
once in a generation there's an
innovation so revolutionary that lives
change forever for people living with
diabetes the time is now Medtronic is
proud to introduce the mini med 670 g
it's the world's first hybrid
closed-loop system that automatically
continuously adjusts basal insulin
delivery with medtronic exclusive
smartguard HCL technology you'll feel
peace of mind knowing that your numbers
are where you need them to be and only
one cgm sensor is trusted to power the
hybrid closed-loop system The Guardian
sensor 3 the mini med 6 70 g with hybrid
closed-loop technology is coming spring
2017 and how do you open the door to
this landmark in diabetes care history
by buying the mini med 6 30 g system
through priority access today both
MiniMed systems are waterproof and more
adventure ready than ever before each
has a high visibility color screen
personalized options and user-friendly
design with similar hardware there's no
better introduction to the mini 967 EG
system than the mini med 630 Jesus make
the choice to change your life take
advantage of priority access now by
visiting Medtronic diabetes calm /
priority dash access act by the end of
the year and reduced out-of-pocket costs
to as little as zero dollars the
revolution is here
the Medtronic MiniMed 670 g system is
intended for continuous delivery of
basal insulin at user selectable rates
and administration of insulin boluses
and user selectable amounts for the
management of type 1 diabetes mellitus
in persons 14 years of age and older
requiring insulin as well as for the
continuous monitoring and training of
glucose levels in the fluid under the
skin the mini med 6 70 g system includes
smartguard technology which can be
programmed to automatically adjust
delivery of basal insulin based on
continuous glucose monitor sensor
glucose values and can suspend delivery
of insulin when the sensor glucose value
falls below or is predicted to fall
below predefined threshold values
warning Medtronic perform an evaluation
of the mini meant 67 EG system and
determined that it may not be saved for
use in children under the age of 7
because of the way that the system is
designed and the daily insulin
requirements therefore this device
should not be used in anyone under the
age of 7 years old this device should
also not be used in patients who require
less than a total daily insulin dose of
8 units per day because the device
requires a minimum of 8 units per day to
operate safely
proud to announce the way lens cap first
data-driven camera built from the ground
up for drivers our system includes a
high-performance camera Bluetooth
enabled obd2 connector and a stylish
steering wheel remote all of which comes
paired from out of the box so it's as
simple as plugging in employment we've
gone beyond the ordinary foxiness a
regular camera and design a device that
fits into the interior of any high-end
vehicle by combining video and data our
camera enables users to tell the full
story of their behind the wheel
experiences the Bluetooth enabled obd2
connector taps directly into the car's
computer allowing users to show what's
going on under the hood as well as on
the road in addition to performance data
from the vehicle the Wayland's camera is
loaded with its advanced sensor suite
including a 10 Hertz GPS sensor for
professional level track timing a 9
access motion sensor for recording all
the genes that a car pulls and dual
microphones for capturing the symphony
of exhaust mates gone are the days of
having to sift through hours of footage
the camera software can identify the
most interesting clips using dead for
example it can identify the highest tree
forces or it can identify clips with the
fastest 0 to 60 poles by the time you
pull over the Whelan's mobile app
presents you with interesting clips that
are ready to share through a simple
interface with the included steering
wheel remote you can even share your
driving experience from behind the wheel
without ever touching your phone we've
assembled an incredible team of
world-class designers developers and
engineers
we're not just launching a product we're
building a community we want our first
users to appreciate all of the hard work
that's gone into designing and
engineering this camera that's why we're
launching on Kickstarter to provide our
early adopters with pre-orders at a
fraction of the retail price come help
us build the Wayland's community hey I'm
bill and needs to work as a programmer
any engineer any designer will tell you
that if you want to do your job
productively if you want to do it well
you need at least two monitors you need
one to write the code and you need
another to check the graphical user
interface changes that are made back in
the old days we had desktops to do this
which were great but you needed to add
an extra graphic card to add another
monitor to it but for us luckily laptops
came along soon after and made
everything a lot more convenient laptops
are great they allow you the flexibility
to work from home hotels restaurants and
friends houses so all of a sudden with
laptops everything got a lot easier and
more convenient for everybody but for
people like us who still need more than
one monitor it wasn't that simple you
can't take a monitor into a coffee shop
a it'd be weird be it totally defeats
the purpose of the ease and convenience
of a laptop so what we do we came up
with expand de expander expands your
laptop's display real estate
expand de is a secondary monitor for
laptops that slips on and doubles as
protection it runs efficiently through
only your USB port that's right no extra
power cables to deal with it keeps you
portable while greatly increasing your
productivity expander only needs one USB
port for both video and power it offsets
the very low consumption of the LED
panel with photovoltaic solar panels on
its backside these panels provide a
trickle that will continue charging your
laptop even when it's not in use on the
macbook model expander will add two
extra USB ports allowing for charging
and other peripherals while you're using
expander essentially we've given you the
best of both worlds you get all the
portability and convenience of a laptop
plus double the working space so you can
truly work how you want where you want
and when you want now we've been pretty
extensive in our prototype phase we've
designed our board and have a working
prototype the last 18 months have been
spent talking with vendors both home and
abroad to figure out how to bring you a
really special product and we have
everything in line except for one thing
figuring out our mass production
pipeline and that's where you come in we
need funding to pay for expensive
manufacturing tools we need capital to
buy components at a volume discount and
by contributing to our campaign today
you guarantee yourself a lower price and
bypassing any waitlist when the ex van
de hits the market thank you so much for
partnering with us as we bring you guys
a really special product that we believe
in
we developed this product for people
with an active lifestyle those who carry
a backpack those who ride subway those
who ride their bike commuting to work
those who are adventurous growing up in
Colorado I found the real passion for
the natural world I want to live healthy
I want to eat healthy I want to have
that food with me all the time we've
made a reusable container that you can
take everywhere with you it's super
convenient it's wonderful to have and
it's worth its weight when you carry it
around
the majority of trash that I create is
from food waste wax cardboard styrofoam
plastic things that get thrown away it's
all packaging I want to do everything I
can to prevent the natural world from
being stuffed with trash what does it
mean to live in a world where we're
conscious about the way we create waste
there are ways to reduce it we developed
a product that doesn't break easily is
dishwasher safe and food safe is
approved by all the science foundations
for food and it can clip easily to your
backpack so it makes it highly portable
it holds 33 ounces that's a big enough
meal for any size and shape I look
forward to how convenient it can be to
have home-cooked food anywhere
I tried at first carrying food in for
instance Tupperware I constantly look
around for a container that won't leak
and none of them fit that bill they
always have some amount of liquid coming
out of them the green traveler allows
you to carry delicious healthy food with
you you can pack any food you want or
non-food items it won't leak it'll keep
water out and you have four compartments
to choose from you get to experience
home-cooked food from anywhere anyone
who packs lunch for the day needs a way
to do that without creating waste the
green traveler is food safe dishwasher
safe liquid tight and you can clip it to
your backpack we see this as the most
convenient way to carry food with you
students can take it to college adults
can take it to work it can be used for
food it can be used for other items as
well first aid supplies mothers can pack
all the things their baby might need go
to a food truck or hot bar without
generating any more wasteful packaging
we're providing a solution for healthy
and sustainable lifestyles we are a team
of engineers and MBAs we have experience
taking businesses out into production so
we're confident if you fund this that we
can watch it we can help change the
culture and the way we consume food we
want you to have a healthy waste free
meal anywhere you are help us raise the
capital for injection moulding so we can
get the green traveler out to everyone
join our campaign to show how much you
care about having a convenient reduced
waste lifestyle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
