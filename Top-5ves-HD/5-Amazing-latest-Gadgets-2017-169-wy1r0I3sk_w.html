simple life focusing on a variable

simple and also just like you
we found the keyboard and mouse are
never used simultaneously our Kissin was
why not share the space the simplicity
can be acquired simply but finally we
found the best solution mochi provides

slim pantograph keyboard thin and safe
laser sensors generate a large optical
touchpad at the exact moment you want to
use it bluetooth low energy technology
assures an extended battery life the
gorgeous aluminum body makes mochi more
slim and durable the cover of mochi not
only protects the keyboard from damage
but also it turns into a portable device
staff of course mochi never compromises
its style for great performance
play the book mocking to the simple and
also not allowed you
it's Thursday tradition here at home
biogas
that means banana pancakes
a 2015 we launched the first IndieGoGo
campaign showing the world how to turn
this into this an idea of a backyard
appliance returns organic food scraps
into cooking gas was first of its kind
we were so excited to see all these
people from all over the world enjoying
the system the first campaign enabled us
to get home by gas to the heart of
remote communities in need people who
have been cooking over fire would
suddenly had clean free energy it was a
huge step in fulfilling our vision the
amazing support inspired us to think
forward what if we could take the home
by gas appliance make it even better and
reduce its overall cost it took us over
a year
home bogus 2.0 is an advanced appliance
that produces green renewable energy
installation is now simpler just for the
digester with water
mount the gas container using the
supplied sandbags and you're ready to go
the 2.0 version is 50 percent more
productive easier to maintain and super
durable we've also added a home bar gas
stove to give you the perfect solution
an average family produces about two
litres of wasted day why should organic
waste go into giant polluting landfills
when it can go back into nature home bar
gas 2.0 can now produce up to three
hours of cooking gas per day more than
enough for an average family plus a top
quality completely organic fertilizer
that goes back into the soil your own
backyard eCos icon once food waste goes
in the bacteria digests the organic
material and released bogus and
fertilizer no electricity is required it
is completely safe to use order lists
and can digest anything from fruits and
veggies to meat and dairy home bar gas
2.0 is now ready for mass production we
need your help to start the
manufacturing process if you believe in
our cause we invite you to back our
campaign and share it with your friends
and family thank you
more and more people are beginning to
reduce reuse and recycle as a way of
life Nature has given us so much now
it's time to give back
we really are very kind to our necks
often for many hours of the day working
on laptops looking at social media on
our phones even driving and leisure
activities can take their toll 50% of
adults
yeah that's 50% of adults suffer with
neck pain each year I should know I see
them in my clinic every day hi my name
is Wes Marshall our physical therapist
and the developer and creator of Nick
Saviour I've seen incredible rise in a
number of people suffering with neck
pain and headaches over the last 20
years I've always done all I can to try
and help people and treat them the right
way also to empower them to help
themselves for centuries people have
loved the feeling of having their neck
stretched in clinic we do this by
pulling on the base of the skull and
it's a feeling that people love and I've
always wanted to be able to recommend a
product that does exactly that however I
wasn't happy with the products that are
on the market but claimed to help they
are either too difficult to use
uncomfortable or just plain ridiculous
so I decided to do something about it I
realized that foam could be the solution
brilliantly lightweight is soft and
comfortable and it can produce
considerable forces when it's bent out
of shape three years ago we launched
next savior original but only after four
years of painstaking developing trial in
the testing we created a super easy to
use effective product that stretches
your neck while you just lay down and
relax
next day the original went on to win
three Design Excellence Awards and it's
recommended by therapists and plasters
instructors all over the world
we always wanted to grow the next over
family and inspired by feedback we are
proud to present next series little
brother
next Savior minute next time you Mini
has enhanced contouring still has Lyle
strong stretch options for his even more
compact support support it really fits
into your life and is ideal for home
work leisure or winter it can be used
instantly whenever required over and
over again to provide neck pain and
headache relief without medication next
every mini helps you feel better and
taller with improved posture so if you
want to undo the effects that stress
gravity poor posture have on the neck
the neck surgery mini can help so now we
need your help with enough backers we
can get necks / mini into production and
we can help you to be kind into your
neck remember the good old days when
life was just simpler
remember those happier times when times
seemed to just pass a little slower
there really was something special about
getting await for days for a Dear John
letter but of course everything wasn't
so simple back then there was a time
when the products in your home made you
work for them instead of working for you
but luckily big blind company saw an
opportunity for innovation and gave us
window coverings so smart so advanced so
state-of-the-art they could be
controlled on demand from the palm of
your hand and would you believe us if we
told you the development of window
coverings stopped there until now meet
my smart blinds the simplest smartest
solar-powered window coverings since
antennas and dial up Alexa open my smart
blinds okay opening my smart lines

smart blinds will pay for themselves in
energy savings giving you extra cash to
spend on all your guilty pleasures fast
food online shopping and all that stuff
your friends are trying to sell you on
Facebook sound too good to be true well

the motor are sensors that tell the
blinds when the room has had enough Sun
the blinds will automatically shut
protecting your floors and furniture and
keeping your home nice and cool saving
you money

scheduling you don't need a clock or a
smartphone or even a brain for that
matter my smart blinds do the thinking
for you set your schedule once and

your blinds before jumping in the shower
