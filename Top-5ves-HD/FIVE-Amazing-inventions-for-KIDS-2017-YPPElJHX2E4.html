hello Kickstarter my name is Rafael you
probably remember me from a previous
project the book Papa know which was
successfully backed by this amazing
community three years ago it's been
delivered to 700 buckers from more than
30 countries it totally helped me to
launch my artistic career I've made solo
exhibitions a mobile game and even a
kinetic watch in Japan and now I'm
really happy to show you my new project
it's been inspired by my nephews they
absolutely changed my life
so I want to introduce the Kickstarter
community a new magical adventure of
children books app children's books is a
series of interactive real-time
animation board books in which children
can perceive motions directly from paper
through a special film there are three
books up shapes up colors and up fouls
imagine having an object in your hands
and just by sliding your fingers over a
special film you can feel the magic
happens you won't believe your eyes
you
the books have rounded edges which are
ideal for children to handle them safely
it seems magic children learn in a
unique and fun way that will allow them
to develop their multiple intelligence
artistic logical mathematical and
spatial skills they will also acquire
new language skills since the books are
bilingual with texts in both English and
Spanish op children's books attract
children so much that they choose them
over digital devices bringing them
closer to the world of physical books
and boosting their concentration in a
playful way they can be enjoyed by
people of all ages it is real time
movement
you
however this project cannot be made
without your help so I invite you all to
join our community of amazing backers so
you can get so many cool rewards we have
for you the rewards for backers include
a special limited edition of only 100
units for Kickstarter of a three in one
board book interactive prints original
Plexiglas art pieces and even the
kinetic watch hand made in Japan so I
hope you can make obsidian books come
true and you can have it in your hands
very soon thank you for watching
it's the excitement and wonder of
invention in an easy to learn quick to
play card game it's fun for all ages in
row my lab you're an adventure racing
the build your robot and win the coveted
Duvall Prize in robotics but the life of
robotics is competitive and other
scientists are trying to beat you
hi I'm Adam and I'm Noah when we created
robot lab the card game and so our
fondest memories we're sitting on a
table playing games with friends and
family we want to bring some of the
Dreaming toddlers now let's start
working on the game we knew two things
one it was gonna be by robots because we
live in robots and two it needs to be
fun for kids and still engaging enough
for experienced gamers during the game
you get parts to use but some won't
match your robots blueprint and are
better on discarded or used to setback
your competitors you can also take some
time to do some research
grab discarded parts or even cause
malfunctions to other robots along the
way others try and stop you by creating
ears or attaching their own annoying
parts to your robot be the first
scientist to build a robot with a head
two arms and two legs of one color to
win the accolades of the robotics
community and the world
no one journey from concept to design
and development through hours of testing
but finally we're ready to be this
creation into the world and we want it
to look and feel as high quality as
possible but we can't do it alone help
us add robot lab to your collection
[Laughter]
we're working on straightener which is a
programming language for young kids
specifically designed for five to seven
year olds and is designed with them in
mind
so is developmentally appropriate and
children can create animated stories
interactive games collages or anything
they imagined I like scratch jr. because
there's so many programs that chica make
it's like you can make your own you
basically get to make your own game and
do it yourself a few years ago my
research group at the MIT Media Lab
introduced scratch a new programming
language that lets kids ages 8 and up
create their own interactive stories and
games and animations and kids around the
world have been making millions of
projects with scratch a couple of years
ago we started a collaboration with
Mitra the MIT Media Lab to explore how
we could extend scratch for a version
that's specifically designed for young
children
guess which one from this row makes
which one for me this world in this book
in your win if you do win if you get all
three right computer programming or
coding is like a new form of writing a
new type of literacy like writing when
people learn to code they learn new ways
of organizing their thinking new ways of
expressing ideas so when you learn to
code you're learning many other things
you're not just learning to code you're
coding to learn now until now people
have generally seen coding is something
very difficult accessible only to a
small subset of the population but
that's starting to change we really
think that coding can be and should be
for everyone
we believe that learning how to call is
a way to express yourself it allows
children to think in a systematic way so
while they are expressing themselves
they are also thinking about steps and
problem-solving and what comes first and
one comes next
and that sequencing and sequencing is an
important skill that leads to academic
success makes it wait 50 seconds we
design scratch junior to match
developmental abilities of young
children we look at cognitive social
personal capabilities and we design the
features of scratch jr. to match what
young children can do we work with
teachers we work with children we work
with parents and we observe what they
were able to do what they were not able
to do and we went back and redesign
scratchier many many many times so we
can really be a tool for young children
being a teacher in an inclusive
classroom we have such differentiated
needs so this idea that there's an entry
point for all the different kids in my
class regardless of where they're at
with their learning there's some way
that they can get into it and start
playing around and start learning how to
create things that there's a point of
entry for everybody in my class we're
now working on a version of scratch jr.
for the iPad and we're really excited to
get it out to the world so that young
children ages five to seven can start
following their imaginations and
creating a scratch Junior we won
scratched Junior to be free so the kids
from all backgrounds have easy access to
it but that means we need to raise funds
to support the development of the
software and the resources of support
materials we really hope that you'll be
able to help us finish the development
of scratch jr. so that young children
will be able to learn to code and code
to learn
three years ago my friend mater and I
began to work on a new programming
language for children ages three and up
we wanted it to be tangible inclusive
and accessible to all gorgeous we call
it a better place
learning to program in early years
should be fun it should be playful we
should be lucky game cubetto is a simple
hands-on system that is logo turtle
inspired Montessori approved and it
works without the need for screens or
literacy the battle playset is made up
of three separate elements a friendly
wooden robot called the battle that
likes to be told where to go and how to
get there but more crucially a physical
programming console and a set of
colorful coding blocks that make up a
real programming language that you can
touch the blocks are instructions that
you combine into a program that gets
better from A to B you play with
algorithms functions loops and there is
no right or wrong way to play the first
version of the caberta playset launched
three years ago and compared to his work
since then we've delivered 800 beta
units to parents teachers and children
and over 40 countries and from Asia to
Africa to the Americas one thing was
clear a better future in which we don't
just consume but also create with
technology is one that we all want for
our children we want to create a global
standard and early learning and
programming and if we're successful
we're going to create new blocks that
connect our console to more than just
toys we think the potential for a
tangible inclusive playful programming
language can be huge and right now
together we have the opportunity to make
this happen
the thought of meeting people in xx sign
that are going to tell us different in
love with programming because of what we
did today is something that really
inspires us and something we think is
worth once upon a time we were natural
makers then the world got sealed up
billions of screens one size fits all
then came a challenge with your support
we came out with a simple kit happy now
we're back with three new kits to make
and code the physical cameras pixels
speakers and sensors this is a camera
follow the story make it yourself
snap a picture code your own flashes and
filters add a tripwire and you can
trigger shots make a pixel grid learn
its logic make it Sparkle show sound
display data code your own game
add a tilt sensor and take control make
a speaker an electronic instrument
put your own music loops and beats add a
gesture sensor and burn so
mix and match to make thousands of
powerful projects
join a world of curious people of all
ages but I really never knew cameras can
be attached to speakers that make
matters like that barely Marinette
opening up this kit making a camera I
just felt really empowered useful
innovative great product my little
camera took really good pictures if
somebody took my code and used it to on
their own speaking cat I'd feel so proud
it uses your whole mind like the
creative side the analytical side it
uses everything this is something that
you feel I could do it myself way we
could do it together and I could pull
kind of apart the wall I think it's nice
that you get to control it so it's like
you know you can really make it here and
really get some be a big sense of pride
play with these kids learn how the world
around you works and make it through
something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
