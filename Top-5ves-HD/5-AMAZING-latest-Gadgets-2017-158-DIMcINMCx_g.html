I'm urban co-founder and CEO of team OSA
for 34 years my family has been
producing and growing team on our tea
plantation in Taiwan since the beginning
our mission has remained the same
deliver the most authentic and healthy
statistics to our customers that's why
we created team OSA a temporary machine
that combines the modern science with
the art of the traditional team engine
the brewing process is very important to
making the perfect cup of tea brewing
with water temperature that's too hot
can damage the natural antioxidants in
the teas steeping tea leaves for too
long can also create a bitter flavor
that's why many people add the
artificial flavors and sweeteners team
OSA is an automatic team master which
learned your taste preferences we
utilize a special extraction method
ultrasonic extraction which rapidly
takes flavors out of tea and enhances
the antioxidants and aroma naturally you
can use the tea mosa paper capsule or
you can use your own loose tea leaves
once you insert the paper capsule team
OSA
scans the capsule and sets the optimal
brewing temperature in steeping time
alternatively if you use your own loose
tea leaves which allows you to customize
the brewing process and enjoy the tea
exactly how you like it the demos a
companion app gives you the option of
customizing the brewing temperature
strength and cup size through your
device remotely you can join the team
OSA community to explore the tea recipes

and largest powered style separator in

every one of us is punishing our necks
and shoulders with the time that we
spend with technology bad posture
driving long hours as an inventor I saw
that there was definitely a need to have
some sort of a really simple home device
where you could spend 10 minutes a day
with a gentle slope to extend your neck
for good posture take Michelle for
instance she's been visiting
chiropractors and massage therapists to
help with her tension headaches and the
knots that she has in her neck and
shoulders you know I was so used to my
chronic pain that I had kind of lost
sight of just how much it was impacting
my life before it used to be that I woke
up stressed I was stressed all day at
work stress when I came home to cook
dinner when I leaned back I feel my full
body relaxed and it's really helped me
get back to living a normal stress and
tension free life no more worries about
bad mood and for performance at work the
best part of it is that I can use it
every day after just 10 minutes of using
it I'm feeling more freedom it's got an
adjustable decline so it really supports
my neck and upper back so now my neck
and shoulders feel just really clear I
just don't feel that tension all the
time that it was carrying with me it's
day-to-day struggle just to stay happy
and focus the tension and discomfort in
my neck is limiting what I can do the
discovery of the travel 2.0 has given me
my life back I'm able to work out the
way I want to I'm a calmer driver I can
go to work and focus and be productive I
feel really great it's still happier in
general
home I get that 10 minutes with travel
2.0 I can go from one setting to another
it feels better as I go through the
settings even though I punished my body
working on computers for years now I
have a way out it's just amazing we made
sure that the design is portable
instruction free and shareable with
family members we knew that we had to
make a second generation and the second
generation has an all new heating pad
and it really increases the comfort and
relaxation even more the heat level is
adjustable so I don't have to be locked
into one option I can immediately feel
when I turn on the heat the difference
that it makes it really allows my neck
muscles to relax now that I've been
using the tranquil 2.0 I feel calmer I'm
in a better mood I'm happier I don't
feel this weight on my shoulders all the
time it's been really amazing we want to
get this awesome product out to people
everywhere but we can't do it without
your support with the money we raised
from this crowdfunding project we'll be
able to make our first round of tranquil
2.0 production units and you'll have the
chance to experience more comfort and
freedom in your body in only 10 minutes
a day right from your home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
