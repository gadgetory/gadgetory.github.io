the Eclipse table and what makes it so
unique the Eclipse table features two
levels the lower level holds up to four
drinks and the mesh cupholders that
leaves the top open for playing games
are eating without the fear of jumping
over your drinks during a fast-paced
game this model comes with the
checkerboard top and a set of checkers
which are stored in a zippered side
pocket so they're always kept with the
table assembly for the Eclipse table is
easy after taking it out of the carry
bags you simply clip the buckles at all
four corners and then tighten the
webbing to your preferred totnes to take
down the table you simply unclip all
four buckles and the table folds up and
conveniently fits into the included
carry bag you can also just loosen all
four corners and not even unclip the
buckles and put it into the carry bag
with a buckle still attached
the Eclipse table is so compact and
lightweight you can bring it to all of
your outdoor outings for convenience and
entertainment thank you for watching
