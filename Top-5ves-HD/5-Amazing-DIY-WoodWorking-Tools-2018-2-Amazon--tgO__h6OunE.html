the secret to great projects
with high quality cuts and you can make
them more easily than you ever thought
possible using your circular saw plus
the Craig rip cut the Craig rip cut
circular saw edge guide takes the
intimidation out of cutting and allows
you to make cuts without measuring
without marking and without having to
keep the saw from wandering off of a cut
line the RIP cut turns your ordinary
circular saw into a precision edged
guided cutting tool that makes straight
accurate repeatable cuts in plywood MDF
and other large sheets easy and accurate
and because projects often call for
multiple pieces to be cut the exact same
size with the RIP cut you can lock in a
size and can be confident that with cut
after cut the pieces will be exactly the
same size also you can make these cuts
anywhere you need to by taking your side
of the material instead of having to
bring your material to the saw the RIP
cut makes this possible with a universal
sled that holds your saw an aluminum
guide rail with built-in measuring scale
and an oversized edge guide that follows
the edge of the plywood sheet to provide
complete control as you cut the
universal slide can also be used on the
Craig enqueue cut the RIP cut worked
with just about any circular saw whether
it has a blade mounted on the left or
the right side plus the edge guide is
reversible so the RIP cut works equally
well right-handed and left-handed
mounting your saw on the RIP cut is
quick and easy and your song can be
removed for other uses
then reinstall just as quickly using the
RIP cut is easy to just lock the saw
slide at your desired cut from one inch
up to 24 inches wide
then simply hold the edge guide against
your sheet turn this on and go a large
handle on the edge guide that helps you
maintain solid contact with the edge of
your sheet with the RIP cut circular saw
edge guide it's just that easy there's
no measuring and no marking just
straight accurate repeatable cuts every
