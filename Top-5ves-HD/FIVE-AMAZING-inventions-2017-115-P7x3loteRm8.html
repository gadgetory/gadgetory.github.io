for our trip to Savannah we've got this
new fused smart card that's going to
help us with our purchases throughout
the trip this card can store information
from almost any card in my wallet debit
cards credit cards reward cards gift
cards gym membership anything with a
barcode and EMV chip a magnetic strip or
NFC tech few stores it you just swipe or
take a picture of a card through your
smartphone and it appears on fuse now
you may be wondering about security
defuse card runs on Bluetooth and
connects directly to your phone if
necessary you can delete all the
information on the card with the push of
a button I've got my key I've got my
phone I've got my wallet fuse allows you
to select any card to use when you need
it for instance when you pay for gas you
might rather use debit and credit you
can also add your gas paid membership
info you can even use multi pay mode to
combine the two cards for a simpler
transaction view's makes it all easy
I've got like 30 different cards all at
once so it's got my debit cards credit
cards gift cards membership cards that's
awesome
see if it works all right it worked
fused has the capability for NFC
technology NFC means you can tap the
card to make contactless payment using
its buttons you can create a six tap
password to lock and unlock the card so
if it ends up in the wrong hand they
won't be able to access your information
by pressing the hold button for three
seconds you can freeze the fused card so
that your preferred payment method
doesn't accidentally change the card
stays locked and active for ten minutes
unless it's told otherwise
it's cool too because if you forget your
card your phone will send you an alert
before you get too far away plus its
battery lasts an average of 30 days that
means you have about a month before you
have to worry about recharging it but
when you do have to charge it visas
portable charging cradle has a built in
battery allowing you to charge the card
on the go in Savannah we had the chance
to use the fuse it's pretty awesome that
you can put all this tech into a card as
thin as this fuse your whole wallet in
one card nowadays there is something
wrong with the market of climate
equipment on the one hand there are
plenty of absolutely inefficient small
devices that don't prevent suffering
from heat on the other hand there are
over five bulky solutions that consume
tons of energy they require complicated
maintenance and to be honest not always
provide you with desired level of
comfort I don't know about you but I
would like to have a device that
combines possibility of desktop gadget
with efficiency of modern technology
meet next generation of evo polar smart
personal air-conditioner this
multifunctional device group humidified
and purifies the air creating a perfect
microclimate around yourself the report
is easy to use as one to screen fill the
water tank adjust the fan speed inject

evaporation it written creates these
natural refreshing breeze one can feel
at the Seacoast and I found the dryer
hair and skin report produced moist and
taking care of your house and beauty

comfort and the optimal humidity level
this is definitely not something that
central air conditioning systems respect
also cooling effect spread and evenly
and those who are close to an air
conditioner always feel too hot and
others always feel to call during the
summer season fully air-conditioned
spaces become unbearable and regular
heat way make it much worse even best
climate systems often can cope any
need some extra cooling power Eva
Poehler makes you feel comfortable in
any condition improving your
productivity and helping you to achieve
more the core technology behind the
report is Eva bridge especially
developed operative metamaterial based
on minor napadas this is also important
to be both compact and powerful unlike
traditional materials have a breeze

prevents bacteria and more spread we're
always there is no pre owner any other
toxic quality
this makes the Apollo technology
absolutely safe to use and eco-friendly
