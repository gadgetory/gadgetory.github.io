mighty mini scraper this tool excels at
glue removal and is an effective wood
scraper that delivers a finished quality
cut in tight spaces regular scrapers and
sandpaper can't reach our new mini
scraper comes with a solid carbide
insert featuring the convenience of a
blade with four long-lasting sharp edges
when an edge is eventually dulled the
problem is easily cured by simply
loosening the screw and rotating the
incertain 90 degrees furthermore our
standard inserts edges are ground with a
slight camber to help prevent marring
your wood surface the same cambering
practice many woodworkers apply to their
hand plane blades and card scrapers an
optional perfectly square and straight
edge insert is also available
it's the insert to use for dead straight
scraping in 90-degree corners our mini
scrapers rugged carbide blade will pop
the toughest dry glue right off your
work and the mini scraper really shines
removing most glue from the inside
corners of canada dissemblers and other
boxes when you find dreaded dried glue
in a tight corner our mini scraper will
remove it with ease you can scrape dry
wood using either a pushing or pulling
motion use the pushing motion with the
handle at low angle for an aggressive
bulldozer light cut
to produce a finish quality cut use the
pulling motion with a handle held at a
high angle like 60 degrees on harder
woods and about 40 degrees for softer
woods you can easily clean excess glue
on your scraper with a wet rag and get
this because carbide Steel's are free of
iron the blade won't rust nor will the
super tough polycarbonate handle so get
woodpeckers new mighty mini scraper a
remarkably handy addition to your
toolbox everybody knows that a
well-tuned saw can make most saw blades
cut smooth as silk the trick is getting
your saw tuned the patent woodpecker saw
gauge makes that process simpler and
easier than ever it's the first saw
gauge that doesn't require any assembly
setup or calibration it's also the only
saw gauge that automatically tracks the
exact center of your miter channel
regardless of its width or condition how
does it do that simpler than you might
think
by straddling a pair of smaller
precision pins with a larger machine
cradle pin which creates the perfect
mechanism for finding the center of your
miter slot
watch how easy it is to use the saw
gauge to check how parallel our saw
blade is to the miter slot even
variations as small as a thousandth of
an inch can be easily measured and
adjusted for by repositioning the
trunnion underneath the table or
adjusting the saw top itself what about
the RIP fence the saw gauge tackles that
job just as fast with the blade lowered
bring the RIP fence into range of the
gauge you can easily check how parallel
the fences to the miter slot as well all
wood is not the same
ripping solid wood versus plywood often
requires a different fence alignment
where the cleanest air out free cuts in
plywood set your fence exactly parallel
to the miter Channel for solid wood you
may want to kick out the outfeed in a
few thousandths
now that you can make these measurements
in mere seconds why not and finally if
after everything your sauce still
doesn't cut smoothly you may have a bet
Arbour just like with your blade and
fence the saw gauge can measure that as
well if you've ever installed drawer
slides you know it can be a challenge
you have to position the slide at
exactly the right height with just the
right set back and hold it perfectly
level while you try to screw it to the
cabinet it's a fussy frustrating job
unless you have rocklers new Universal
drawer slide jig designed to work with
most of all barring the epoxy and Center
mount slides the jig holds the slide
securely and makes it easy for you to
position it perfectly for quick accurate
installations and it features an
indexing rod that makes repeated
installations a snap
like all great jigs it's easy to use
just separate the two parts of the slide
and put the cabinet track in the jig as
it will be installed in the cabinet an
integral stop guarantees the right set
back from the front of the cabinet and
the innovative locking wedge grips the
slides securely so you don't have to
worry about it shifting or tipping
beveled edges on the jigs wings line up
at the bottom of the slide for easy
positioning at the cabinet and there's a
scale in case you need to offset the
mounting height the jig positions the
slides square to the front of the
cabinet and level from front to back
flat areas on the body make it easy to
clamp it to the cabinet if you want to
free up both hands to drive the mounting
screws after installing a couple of
screws you can release the locking wedge
remove the jig and drive all the
remaining mounting screws as directed in
the slide instructions if you need to
install multiple slides at the same
height this jig will save you a lot of
time and the hassle of measuring at each
location
it features an indexing rod that lets
you register the slide off of a
reference surface on the cabinet the rod
can be installed from the top or bottom
of the jig depending on the location of
the reference surface when you've got
the slide located precisely slide the
indexing rod until the plastic foot
makes contact and lock it in with the
brass knob at the next installation site
just about the foot of the indexing rod
against the reference surface to
position the jig at the right height
you'll get perfect installations time
after time the indexing rod also works
great when you're mounting Center mount
to slides on a cross rail so if you want
easy and accurate drawer slide
installations every time you owe it to
yourself to get rocklers Universal
drawer slide jig</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
