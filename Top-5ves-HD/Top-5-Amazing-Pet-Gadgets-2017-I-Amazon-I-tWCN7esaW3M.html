we
that's at people we can't measure our
life without them they're a part of who
we are but with every pet we've ever had
we're always learning about two things
the lost pet and a 6-minute most days we
treat our pets better than we treat
ourselves for all the happiness they
bring to our lives we think they deserve
the best so we combined great technology
with great insurance so we never have to
worry again this is muscle the muscle
color uses GPS and a cell chip to stay
connected all the time
that means you'll always know your pet
is even if they manage to give the noble
collar means no more logic when we found
out that less than 2% of pets were
covered by insurance
we set out to change pet insurance pays
vilely so we teamed up with embrace to
offer simple straightforward coverage to
cut their people everywhere and to be
able to do with call from here to just
make sense a dog base has been healthy
pets are happy pet and happy pets make
happy people our business is all about
offering high quality service that keeps

we're making is a complete ecosystem for
helping ensure the Wellness of your pet
the nuzzle collar is a gps-enabled
collar with activity monitor that helps
you stay in touch with your pet even
when you're not around them the app is
sort of the home base of everything you
can get a lot of statistics from your
pet where your location is how often
they're walking you're able to monitor
some emergency might be happening and
getting immediate alerts might make the
difference between your pet being there
when you get home and your pet not being
and also from the app the nice thing is
that you can actually purchase very
simple easy to understand health
insurance for your pay the nuzzle
insurance product helps give you peace
of mind I'm excited about the challenge
of taking all these pieces of technology
and fitting them into this elegantly
designed package it's been done by one
of the top design firms in the world we
really like working with startups
because you basically work with the
founders and they're passionate and
they're committed does for us I deal
most of the people here either have a
dog or a cat you know it's a big part of
their families I think it makes it kind
of personal and special to do it one of
our design decisions from the very
beginning was to make sure that that
bond that connection between you and
your pet using the nuzzle app the nuzzle
collar was always there without any
subscription fees it's important to us
that our app in color easy to use and
simple to understand
