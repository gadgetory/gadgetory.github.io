through-hole knob insert the appropriate
size one-and-a-half inch full threaded
bolt with a washer into the knob from
the bottom and then attach the hex nut
then pull the bolt from the bottom to
seat the nut in the hex nut recess hold
the knob in your hand with your finger
pressed against the bolt now tighten the
bolt till the nut is fully seated then
remove the bolt and washer and you're
ready to go to make a studded multi knob
insert the appropriate sized bolt into
the top of the multi knob and through
the hole attach a washer and nut and
tighten till the hex head seats into the
recess now remove the nut and washer and
you're done heavy-duty you bet most
low-cost plastic knobs are molded with
the insert right up against the bottom
of the knob making it easy to pull out
and is far less durable the new multi
knob features a molded hex shaped recess
sitting above a quarter inch thick
reinforced layer this design makes our
knob virtually indestructible and ideal
for woodworking jig applications when
you hold the multi knob in your hand
you'll notice thick rounded corners and
easy to grip textured surface with
smoother corners and more knife to grip
makes the multi knob easier to tighten
without the knob digging into your
fingers and with the new woodpecker's
multi knob you can use standard full
threaded bolt sizes ranging from 3/4 of
an inch up to 6 inches in length
the woodpecker's multi knob is available
for either quarter inch or 3/8 inch
fasteners knobs are packaged in four or
twelve pounds hi I'm Andy glass of glass
impressions running stock perpendicular
to your router table fence is not only
unsafe but the quality of your cut can
be diminished rocklers coping sled is
the perfect solution to increase both
let me bring you in for a closer look
and show you its features the sled comes
with two tall round handles to allow the
user a firm comfortable grip from any
angle of approach a clear elevated guide
runs against the fence offering a large
smooth running reference edge without
having to cut the sled or use a miter
slot a support block gives support to
the workpiece and an included abrasive
strip keeps the workpiece from being
pulled towards the bit a toggle clamp
features tool free adjustments and
one-handed operation simply press on the
red handle to hold down the workpiece to
use the coping sled set up the router
bit of your choice and adjust the height
taking into account the thickness of the
base using Rockler setup blocks make
this process very easy insert your
workpiece move the support block with
abrasive tape and lock it into position
then activate the toggle clamp I press
enga√±o router and dust collection and
make a smooth pass by the router bit
keeping the clear guide along the fence
the sacrificial backer will prevent
blowout and can easily be replaceable
woodpeckers complete drill press table
package starts with a large 16 by 23 by
1 inch thick work area with a low
friction non-glare microdot laminate
surface the table edges are covered with
a durable high-density banding
permanently bonded to the MDF core now
remove the tear out eliminating filler
to reveal for leveling screws for a
level working surface then notice a 3/8
inch centering hole allowing you to
Center the table to your drill presses
drill chuck for a perfect alignment of
your table your table comes with two
embedded dual tracks which are secured
by 8 quarter-twenty bolts which
eliminates pullout and each is laser
engraved with empirical scales for
precise fence positioning the 36 inch
long dual track fence with a laser
engraved Center type scale makes it easy
to use from both sides of the table the
dual track feature allows for stop
options like the flip stop or L stop the
new-and-improved fence bracket now makes
it easier than ever to adjust the fence
from left to right
or front to back the beauty of the dual
track fence allows you to adjust the
fence from side to side so you can
increase the stop range to a full 28
inches the package includes two one-inch
flip stops which can be accurately
positioned on the fence alive for
quickly multi hole drilling of your
workpiece
also included are to hold down clamps
with non-slip tips to lock down material
for heavy drilling operations the new
optional addition is the deep III drill
press fence this 3/8 of an inch thick by
three by three by twenty three and a
half inch long fence is machine to give
an accurate 90 degrees from the table
it's designed for supporting stock on
edge and is great for drilling out
mortises
sure bench vices are heavy-duty but
they're not indestructible the extreme
force that generate can be their undoing
if not used properly racking is enemy
number one of your vise and your stock
racking happens every time you clamp
stock near the end of your vise because
the lead screw and steel rods are in the
way if you tighten the vise with this
setup racking will occur causing an
unwanted vicious circle of events
because equal force is not applied to
your stock greater force is required to
secure it now your vise is racked even
more racking can crush a corner of your
stock due to the tremendous unequal
force worse yet your vise can be bent
when this happens your vise is
permanently damaged woodpecker's
precision vise shims eliminate racking
when you insert vise shims equal to the
thickness of your stock at the opposite
end of the vise clamping force is
equalized woodpeckers new vise shims can
be combined to match just about all the
possible stock thicknesses a woodworker
will ever need the 22 piece shim set is
comprised of 16 stainless steel shims
1/16 of an inch thick for shims 1/32 of
an inch thick plus one big shim at 1 and
1/2 inches and another that's half-inch
when all are used these vise shims can
handle stock up to 3 inches thick our
full deck of shims is captured in an
aluminum collar in which they easily
slide up and down you can quickly make
up the combination you need to precisely
match your stock thickness the collar
quickly comes apart through rearranged
shim positions or add or remove shims to
get that perfect fit furthermore our
unique design means there is no fussing
around to align the shims between the
vise faces since they drop straight down
without slipping sideways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
