from quick-set america's
number-one-selling lock brand the
premise smart lock with apple homekit
compatibility only from quick-set made
for the world you live in
the a9 was created with one single
purpose to give people magical
experiences with the a9 I wanted to make
a timeless classic something which is
beautiful from all angles in all types a
9 was inspired by sound and by music the
shape is a circle and the reason why I
choose the circle is press sound travels
in circles the a9 is made out of a very
few elements but those materials and
elements choosing are the best so it's a
very high quality wood high quality
plastic high quality aluminium and a
very good fabric the a9 is a very
flexible design you can choose to have
it on your wall have it standing on the
tree wooden legs you can make it blend
in or make it stand out using the
product should be simple if you want to
turn up the volume you just do like this
if you want to turn down do like this
and if you want muted just do like this
the big consideration with the a9 was
not to tune it like a big floor-standing
loudspeaker it really is a standalone
system so it has to deliver some of the
characteristics that you get from a
normal stereo system all in one package
so we look for powerful base a good
punchy kick drum for example some
spaciousness that you normally wouldn't
see in a standalone system but also the
feeling of a powerful system so that you
didn't feel like you were ever going to
reach its limits no matter how loud you
turn it the a9 has a switch on the back
that actually lets you change its
profile so if you put it in a corner
which would normally boost the bass you
put the switch in the corner position
and that reduces the bass accordingly
and that will compensate for what the
room does to the sound of the speaker
itself the a9 has it all is that
beautiful design
fantastic craftsmanship and amazing
sounds in one package
you
Ceri time for bed
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
