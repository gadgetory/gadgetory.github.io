collection system from Rockler it's got
a distinctive scoop shaped dust port
that cups spindle turnings to capture
dust and fine shavings as they're cut
from the workpiece before they get into
the air no other dust hood gets us close
and the dust right system is fully
adjustable to provide access for sanding
without sacrificing performance if you
turn small projects you owe it to
yourself to check out the dust right
lathe dust collection system he started
using feste tools about ten years ago we
were trying to be sold on using this saw
and just put part with the money at that
time as soon as we saw what the tool
would do it was a no-brainer
we could make ten thousand cuts with
that saw not have to use clamps and
never have one chip on it we have the
first one we bought ten years ago we
just purchased one hundred and fifty
thousand dollar edge bander that will do
one thing put a banding on straight what
we're looking at right now is the
Festool contour evander that's gonna do
a few things for me we're going to be
able to do radiuses which is a big deal
for us we can work out in the field we
can work in the shop with it or our shop
is relatively good size but floor space
is at a premium when I'm done with it I
can put it away lock it off and it's
taking up no floor space
I started here at doors and drawers in
1987 and the production manager for the
conturo comes in is it uses the same
industrial techniques that are large
machine uses in mobile being able to do
the radius parts without watching blew
dry
hi guys can keep moving on to the
different jobs time is money and this
thing saves us a lot of time I always
knew that we were going to be building
furniture we didn't know what that it
evolved into this guy's been here 10
years 15 years all the way up to 30
years so there are two crafts people
knowing that we can take somebody's idea
get it built on time and in budget
that's what I like tools help they make
you shine better you still have to build
things by hand but now you have some
additional tools that help us out doing
it and doing a better job with it
if you've ever tried to install fronts
on cabinet drawers you know it can be
hard to get everything lined up and keep
it there while you drive mounting screws
you could try double-sided tape but
adjustments can be hard to make or you
could tack it in place with Brad nails
through the drawer front but that leaves
you with nail holes marring your
finished surface rocklers drawer front
installation clamps provide a better
solution
these steel clamps attached to the
drawer box and hold the drawer fronts
securely in place leaving your
hands-free to fine-tune positioning and
drive mounting screws threaded rods with
easy to grip knobs on one end and nylon
capped pads on the other provides strong
clamping pressure without damaging the
drawer front or box knob taut the bolts
with nylon tips allow precise
side-to-side adjustments and they
incorporate a nut that lets you lock in
the position for quick accurate
repeatability on additional drawers the
clamps even lets you push the drawer box
back into the cabinet with the drawer
front clamped so you can verify the
alignment
