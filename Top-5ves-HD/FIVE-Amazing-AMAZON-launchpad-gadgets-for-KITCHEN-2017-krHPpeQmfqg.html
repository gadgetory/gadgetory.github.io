sous-vide is a cooking technique in
which food is heated at a consistent
temperature in a water bath because we
can control the heat precisely we can
predict the results exactly every time
with traditional cooking methods heat
flows from a burner to a pan then into
our food or the glowing elements of an
oven heat the air around the food
cooking it because the air in the oven
and the middle of the pan are much
hotter than you want your food to be
you've got to take it away from the heat
at just the right time take it off too
early or too late and your food is
either under or overcooked when cooking
with water instead of superheated air or
a pan you can raise the temperature just
enough to get the food to the exact done
this we prefer once it is up to
temperature we can pretty much just
leave it in the bath until we're ready
to eat perfectly cooked food sous vide
seemingly magical cooking technique of
high-end chefs from the future but
actually just heating food with water
here's the thing about water water
doesn't care if you're young or old here
it's risky you have wrinkles if you win
agretti water doesn't care if you're
popular and those voices in your head
that are always saying I'm too old I'm a
loser I'm not good enough what am i
doing water doesn't hear those voices
and wouldn't care if it could to water
you are perfect
exactly the way you are you are actually
made up of 70% water whether you think
yourself as worthy or not
water accepts you and so do we and we're
here to make your water a little more
pure with a more sustainable filter to
sustain you so you can continue on your
journey of realizing you're perfect
you're perfect just the way you are dude
hi I'm Matt I'm really excited to try
the Innova precision cooker I haven't
cooked sous-vide before but I can't wait
to give it a shot all right I've got the
wand and you got the clamp and we're
ready to go before I get started I had a
couple questions but thankfully have
Bill Clark from Innova here to answer
them for me
so bill what is sous-vide good question
so sous-vide or precision cooking has
been around for decades and use the
world over by top chefs everywhere all
you need to do is with the device put
into your pot you submerge your food
into the pot itself it circulates the
water a very precise temperature and you
always get the desired doneness you want
what would make this better than say
grilling I love that questions for all
my favorite grilling is all over the map
you have hot spots you have cold spots
and everything in between with precision
cooking you don't have to worry about
any of that you set your device to
whatever doneness you like Myanmar steak
129 degrees Fahrenheit you set the
device you hit play and when that comes
out it's gonna be exactly 129 degrees
all the way through you nova precision
cooker is easy to use first you fill a
medium sized pot with water then clamp
the Innova precision cooker then you
sink your cooker to your app put your
food in a plastic bag and then clamp the
bag into the water when the water is at
the set temperature
so the cool thing about our device is
that you can start a cook from the
interface or you can use our app the app
itself has time temperature guides to
create that perfect day we were talking
about or you can use the hundreds of
recipes that we have in the app to
choose the device the app itself all you
need to do is just press Start and you
chose the recipe and we have to take
care of the rest
so the best part is you never have to
wave it over it's always gonna be the
exact same results every single time you
don't have to worry it if you have you
know kids if you have a light you will
still be able to come back and your food
will be ready at the exact temperature
you set it up and then the other half is
that you will never waste it's always
going to be the exact same results every
single time all right the moment of
truth perfect meal rare edge-to-edge
delicious mmm
that's really good that's better than
being at a restaurant they did it myself
this is awesome
hi i'm giacomo stroll oh i'm the
president and owner of the stroller
design company stroller design is
product development firm located in San
Diego California we've been developing
products for our clients since we were
founded in 2006 our goal though has
always been to develop and launch
products of her own and for the last
several years we've been developing
smart jars what we think is the best way
to get stuff organized markers will help
you get organized asked our product
consists of three components a jar a lid
and a dock that snaps into pegboard
the jars are just over 10 ounces in
volume and are ideal for storing parts
and pieces like nuts bolts buttons craft
supplies small stuff like that they're
also great for storing spices that's why
we first developed them scar jars are
durable transparent airtight and food
safe they're also patented and
trademarked in the USA the smart card
dock snaps firmly into pegboard and then
the jar slides in for storage this gives
you full view of the contents through
the lid the jars are easily removed from
the docks
but they'll securely hold what's inside
them you can rearrange smart jars on the
pegboard to your liking but for a lot of
storage jars can be tightly packed to
hold many different items in a small
space to date all the parts and the
injection molds have made in the USA and
we're going to keep it that way we're
really proud of this product how it
looks and how it's been received we want
to raise $30,000 to help defer the
upfront cost of our first production
order to make some minor tooling
modifications to flush out our packaging
and shipping strategies and to gauge the
interests of the early adopters in the
Kickstarter community thank you for your
interest in smart jars and thank you for
helping make my dream a reality
you
trip out is an elegant iced drip
coffeemaker designed to make cold brew
coffee easier drip o is a three-in-one
iced drip coffeemaker that can also be
used as a cold brew coffee maker or
tumbler it has a compact size a simple
design and is easy to use all you have

more importantly it can quickly convert
drip o into a coffee tumbler so you can

drip o extracts coffee with cold water
dripping compared to brewing coffee with
hot water the coffee would taste sweeter
due to its lower acidity and less
caffeine as a result iced drip coffee is
something healthier for your body and
tastes a whole lot smoother and richer
than hot brewed coffee
drip Oh was developed by a group of
designers and coffee fans for months
starting from its concept design and
prototype countless hours and coffee
beans have been invested we proudly

Kickstarter's we will need your help to
make it into the manufacturing stage
