hey guys three years ago we had an idea
a simple idea we developed a keyholder
the solve our own frustration with
traditional key chain we love the
concept but we didn't know if others
will feel the same way too so we
introduced it to the crowdfunding
community and to our surprise we
gratefully had five thousand supporters
that believed in our vision to
revolutionize the King Karen experience
soon after we delivered the first
release of products we were thrilled to
see our hard work paying off with such
overwhelming positive feedback from our
supporters and even more wonderful along
with the praise came valuable
constructive feedback on how we can make
all the key Bella will listen
attentively to our original supporters
and our customers and we have taken your
feedback on board to help shape the Near
Orbit key the uber key is now even more
comfortable for you to use the overall
thickness of the fasteners has been
reduced by forty percent so that fits
perfect in your pocket the form has been
simplified so that the surface is
smoother and your thumb sits nicely into
the concave it's also more compatible
than ever the screw diameter is thinner
so that it is able to accommodate a
larger variety of peace and the coin
slot has also been in large to allow
liquor coins the new wave washer which
provides the tension clear keys
automatically captures the fastener
making it easier to assemble
unlike its aluminium brother the new or
baqi is made from stainless steel for
improved durability for the leather
version we're introducing a premium
d-ring where the edges have been
softened and curbs so that is friendly

excited to introduce to you a new lineup
of band chases this time around we are
replacing the old flat leather band with
a cushioned leather band making them
stronger and more sophisticated than
ever the newest addition to our line is
the canvas band which is light and
durable and securely prestige to prevent
frame last but not least we have
enhanced our line of accessories we now
have the USB 3.0 which runs up to 10
times faster than our previous USB Drive

tools in a very compact form all of the
designs felt move and that grunt work
has been done and we're ready to go into
