i was born in the pastoral countryside
of heaven on earth it was a peaceful and
beautiful land as a child I was orphaned
early on and at the end of the day I lay
down to sleep on our porch under a
canopy of stars sparkling and twinkling
until the break of the morning today I'm
able to bring to the world but beauty of
my everlasting evening sky through
starsailor it's only through my
never-ending dedication that I'm now
able to bring everyone the chance to
sleep with the stars of the night to the
moment that we drift off to rest our
minds and our body
in our fast-paced world we overlook the
most important component of our game

are in the wrong phase of sleep can be
as harmful as no sleep at all we all
have to wake up on time but how we've
been doing it is unnatural and needs to
