hi I'm Matt I'm really excited to try
the Innova precision cooker I haven't
cooked sous-vide before but I can't wait
to give it a shot all right I've got the
wand and you got the clamp and we're
ready to go before I get started I had a
couple questions but thankfully have
bill Clark from Innova here to answer
them for me so bill what is sous-vide
good question so sous-vide or precision
cooking has been around for decades and
use the world over by top chefs
everywhere all you need to do is with
the device put into your pot you
submerge your food into the pot itself
it circulates the water a very precise
temperature and you always get the
desired down as you want what would make
this better than say grilling I love
that questions from my favorite grilling
is all over the mountain you have hot
spots you have cold spots and everything
in between
with precision cooking you don't have to
worry about any of that you set your
device to whatever doneness you like
medium rare steak 129 degrees Fahrenheit
you set the device you hit play and when
that comes out it's gonna be exactly 129
degrees all the way through you nova
precision cooker is easy to use first
you fill a medium sized pot with water
then clamp the Innova precision cooker
then you sink your cooker to your app
put your food in a plastic bag then
clamp the bag into the water when the
water is at the set temperature
so the cool thing about our device is
that you can start a cook from the
interface or you can use our app the app
itself has time temperature guides to
create that perfect stay we were talking
about or you can use the hundreds of
recipes that we have in the app to
choose the devices the app itself all
you need to do is just press Start if
you've chosen recipe and they have to
take care of the rest so the best part
is you never have to worry it's all if
you be the exact same results every
single time you don't have to worry it
if you have you know kids if you have a
life you will still be able to come back
and your food will be ready at the exact
temperature you set it up and then the
other half is that you'll never waste
food it's always going to be the exact
same results every single time all right
the moment of truth
perfect medium-rare edge to edge
delicious mmm that's really good that's
better than being at a restaurant they
did it myself this is awesome
