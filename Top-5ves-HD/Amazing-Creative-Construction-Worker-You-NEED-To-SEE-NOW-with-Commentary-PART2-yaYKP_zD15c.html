top-five construction workers
number five indoor tech firm designed by
Gucci our floor tech if you've had
enough with traditional floor heating
technology here is the advanced and
budget-friendly system for you
before initiating the installation
double layered blocks are applied at the
edge of the wall so that the concrete
cannot damage the bottom of the wall
Kuchar has planned the bone plates
accurately so that it will not let a
single drop of water spoil your elegant
floor
the thermal plates have well-designed
loops that hold tightly the pipe and do
not allow the pipes to pop out
you've probably heard or seen a number
of floor heating systems but Gooch our
indoor tech therm is far better than all
once the plate installation work is
completely done the base is totally
secured and you can start flooring the
tiles happily
number 4 matrix splitting effect
designed by Rives beginning of cracks in
the wall is always irritating but when
we do it intentionally it turns into an
artful structure so here it is an
exquisite and attention-grabbing crack
art that can mesmerize you within a
couple of seconds the artwork begins
with the application of synthetic
plaster let it dry for a couple of hours
when you're done you will start noticing
artificial cracks on the wall but relax
it's just a kind of texture now as the
texture is ready we can start painting
on it at first paint the entire wall
with a matte color tone
here you can find we take copper but you
can go with what you like
after the first layer of color is
necessary to cover the cracks so we
apply here the same synthetic plaster we
used before
now it's time to shine the wall so let's
use some glossy colors here we have
copper as a first option will you dip
your duster into the color rub the
surface a little so we can avoid
dripping
the color is ready to shine
next choose a contrast color so we can
give an outstanding look to the wall
here the silver is a perfect option for
the copper
hooray the human made crack is ready to
enhance the look of the wall
number three brick form decorative fan
patterns designed by brick form doing
such kind of beautiful patterns is not a
child's play but brick form makes this
possible for you with a team of experts
it starts with planning a perfect
concrete block then we make the surface
clean and smooth before it dries our
enthusiastic team members keep the
printed patterns ready and place them on
the surface of the block some of the
imperfections can be aligned by a little
effort - and the brick pattern is ready
to go number two hydraulic tile border
designed by bulldozes Paulo Moka and
here it is the symbol of the human art a
hydraulic tile this micro work is done
in a pre-designed container the
container is divided into three sections
a worker fills various colors to make it
attractive and colorful
once the color filling process is over
the structures removed and now they add
sand and other materials that will hold
the color tightly the final part is heat
pressing and here we have an attractive
tile laying stone by live copper fede do
you know laying stone is one of the most
beautiful but top artwork in the first
step workers apply the cement paste and
then start placing stones one by one
the work is really tough because a
worker must be accurate while arranging
the stones
once the arrangement is done the work
seals the cracks
after finishing it he smoothly wipes out
the extra paste using a wet duster
finally you have a mirror-like shine
