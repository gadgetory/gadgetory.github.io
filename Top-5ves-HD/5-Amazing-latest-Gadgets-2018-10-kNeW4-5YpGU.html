unbelievable
I feel more aware and coming well yeah
like an ice bucket challenge I feel much
better look at that guy seems popular
right hi I'm Johnny and this is Norville
we've taken a lot of time perfecting our
little knives we find them so handy not
just use them in a studio but also in
our day to day lives too we hope you
like use them as much as we do
so please back or share our product and
we look forward to seeing how you use
yours this unassuming ordinary looking
microbe is a dinoflagellate or dino for
short as a group dinos are incredibly
diverse and can be found in oceans and
lakes all over the world although their
existence may seem trivial from our
macroscopic world view these fascinating
tiny creatures offer us a beautiful
example of what makes life itself so
exceptional inspired by the ability of
these dinos to bioluminesce or generate
light from life itself we set out to
create a product that would enable
people not only to witness this
beautiful phenomenon but interact with
it from the comfort of their home or
classroom after countless hours of
sketching prototyping and testing we're
so excited to finally introduce bio
glove
letting it bubble creates a calming
effect to relax you into sleep or swirl
the bio glow for a sensation of glowing
vortex this Kickstarter will enable us
to purchase the tools and molds
necessary to bring bio glow to life
thank you so much for your support
sometimes your temper breaks sometimes
your snowboard binding breaks or your
bag strap breaks
sometimes your suitcase spills open
sometimes you need to protect something
fragile for transit or stop something
getting damaged in use sometimes you
need to stop a leak sometimes you need
to make stuff smaller sometimes you need
to tie stuff down or dry stuff out
sometimes you need to fix your boot not
a sort of boot that's better
we'll simply hold up your socks it's
times like these you need adventure tape
we spent the last three years developing
and perfecting adventure tape and it's
got some amazing properties
which means that you can replace all of
this stuff
with adventure tip it's so strong it's
stretchy you can do this with it because
adventure tape is self tacky it doesn't
slip meaning you can fasten it with a
simple tug and because there's no
adhesive it will leave no gluey residue
on your kit will rip apart your bubble
wrap unlike regular packing tape
adventure tape is also highly abrasion
and cut resistant meaning you can use it
to stop wear or damage to your precious
items or equipment it's completely
waterproof so you can use it to fix
leaks and in fact if it gets dusty or
dirty just wash it off under the tap or
in a string adventure tape has hundreds
of uses and outdoor activities and
adventures as well as in sports
weekend's away or to help you out with
day-to-day fixes we know adversity is an
amazing product among which once you've
used it your wonder how you lived
without it so please support our
Kickstarter campaign and make adventure
tape a reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
