steps turn on the mobile app and place
your phone in front of your guitar place

completely different tuning like open G

the quality and let you know when it's
time for new ones so when it's time to
restring roadie can quickly unwind and
wind the strings for you our goal is to
offer you the musician not just a tuner
but a system that can help fuel your
passion for music this is what roadie is
