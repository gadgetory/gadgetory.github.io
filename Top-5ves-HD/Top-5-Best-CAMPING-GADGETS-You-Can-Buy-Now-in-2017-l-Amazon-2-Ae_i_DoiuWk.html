can immediately turn it on and as you
can see it works in petrol to ensure
that the lantern works perfectly we've
tested it in many different scenarios

perfected version as the one you can see

port charge allowing you to charge it

hi I'm Dale karakasa with mountain
safety research here today to show you
our reinvented mother hubba NX 3 person
tent it's part of our best-selling line
of three season backpacking tents and
now we've made it even lighter and more
livable backpackers will love the three
season tent new ultra lightweight and
ultralight 2.1 kilograms 4 pounds 10
ounces is considerably lighter than
previous method above autos if you're a
minimalist you can go even lighter by
setting it up in one of two fast and
light modes not only is the mother hubba
NX ultralight it's the most livable
ultralight tent for three and here's why
the symmetrical pole geometry maximizes
head and shoulder room throughout the
tent so you have more livable space
inside storing gear not a problem when
you have two large vestibules for
ventilation
we use lots of mesh and put in kickstand
rainfly vents to help reduce
condensation while increasing the air
flow and you can even roll the best
appeal part way up from the bottom to
let in fresh air even when it's raining
the freestanding tent is easy to set up
with this unified hub system with DAC
Featherlite poles one of our goals with
this tent was to make it as easy as
possible to set up that's why we use
color-coded webbing on the rain fly and
the stake loops making it really easy to
orient to the rain fly to the tent we
chose 22 near and 30 denier high
tenacity ripstop nylon along with our
waterproof Duras shield coatings to make
sure you stay dry and comfortable on the
inside and we've designed the two large
stay dry entrances with built in rain
gutters to channel water away so you
don't get drift on getting into or out
of the tent when it's time to break camp
you just load the tent into the wide
mouth stuff sack and use compression
straps to pack it down ultra compact and
there you have it the new mud the hubba
NX rms are designed for you to enjoy
your time inside of the tent almost as
much as your time outside of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
