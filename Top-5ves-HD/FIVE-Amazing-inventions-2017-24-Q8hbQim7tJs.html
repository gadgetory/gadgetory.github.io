health is not thrust upon us it's
something we build every day
when it's about our health we don't
compromise
we refuse to settle for mediocrity and
best guesses
we inspired new tools so we can move
beyond the uncertainty
we learned how to set the right goals
how to work hard to get at the top
to let them know how we fare when we are
to give the new insights and we're not
feeling well so they can make smarter
decisions about our health and behavior
we set out to explore
to build something bigger than us
a world where we all know what health
looks like
because we owe it to our humans to get
them off the couch to keep hounding them
to stay active and healthy so we can
wake up every day of our lives
