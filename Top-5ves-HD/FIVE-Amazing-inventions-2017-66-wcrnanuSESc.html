I wondered why is the record always
spinning while the stylist desperate I
decided to flip that around there are
beautiful objects that have played
records you know references that already
exist how do we stand out because by
standing out are we honoring what's
already been done we're not trying to
replace it we're trying to be a new
experience love is the world's first
intelligent turntable it's easy to use
and it's controlled by your smartphone I
strongly believe that you can have a
fine sound you can have an audiophile
sounds and make it easy to use
you
you
the needle is what's convinced people
for over 150 years is warm the soulful
sound that is unique and that cannot be
replaced by it something digital so we
used in the most widespread industry
standard size cartridge we've kept those
elements and we just augmented them in a
way that allows you to do things you
could never do before you can play pause
skip to the next track let's select the
next drug you don't need the afternoon
love but it's app mixing revolutionary
once you've captured the sound what are
you doing well you process it in a way
that allows you to communicate to a
Bluetooth speaker to phone in a very
high quality way
streaming of the sound does not change
or harm the analog sound because we're
using the very best cadet available with
a very best transmission there is so the
sound stays the same that's really well
a great wireless some connectivity means
I would love the look turntable to be a
synonym for quality before anything else
there will be a WoW moment of look at
this object that's starting to turn but
as soon as the sound will come on I
think it's still divine or still the
record sell the music that is what
you're looking for
you
now it can do more
whoa and of course
and also not now
