from smartwatches to self-driving cars
technology is growing at an incredible
rate every day becomes an increasingly
integrated part of our lives but one
area remains where we haven't yet seen a
consumer accessible and affordable tech
solution our food supply that's why
we've created the world's first fully
automated smart planter introducing
robot with grow bot you can grow
everything herb arrange means two
lettuces kales peppers fruit trees or
even a combination of plants and it's
designed so that you can add any medium
you'd like to the top to reach your
desire to step first you choose the type
of plant that will be housed and grow by
then fill the water and nutrient
reservoirs that's it
robot works through an intricate system
of pH sensors nutrient level indicators
and a pump for dispensing organics into
your water the app keeps detailed data
for your plants feeding schedule and
even allows you to override and feed
your plant yourself if you'd like robot
has the capability to fully regulate and
care for your plants minimum work from
your end required the maintenance robot
is easy the planters LED display panel
on the pot will notify you of its
current pH and nutrient level and when
water needs to be change the planter
will notify you via one of two minutes
either the planter will emit a
non-intrusive sleeping
or you can opt to be notified through
the application on your smartphone tell
your friends about this innovative
affordable technology so that they too
can grow more and grow better with
global with robot you're always good to
grow
the swimbot score is based on two stroke
aspects keeping your head still and
avoiding excessive vertical movements
when you've completed your test you get
your swimbot score are you the best
swimbot ranking the first ranking based
on swimming technique
hey can you navigate me to home sure it
will take us 40 minutes
you have a message for mom are you gonna
make it to dinner tonight can you text
her back and tell her I'll be there at
7:00
damn you're sweating oh sorry
dan watch out
that was close you know at that time we
had cars without seatbelts yeah that was
stupid
well how about just yesterday when you
were texting while swerving all over the
road that was pretty stupid too wasn't
it
today we're no different even though we
have the technology to make our cars
safer and smarter
you still drive very primitive stuff
introducing drawing the all-in-one
driving companion that will transform
your driving experience dry it is so
much more than a dashcam starters it
makes you arrive completely hands-free
navigation texting there's no longer a
reason to take your eyes off the road II
eat installing drive is simple just
stick it on your windshield and plug it
in worried about safety don't worry
drives got your back with real-time
forward collision and lane departure
alerts your chances of an accident are
greatly reduced drives non stop HD
videorecording
can help prove when you're not at fault
as well as help the driving community
report reckless drivers
above all these amazing features dried
has created an open community allowing
developers to work together and make the
vehicle apps of the future built on the
Raspberry Pi dried as a familiar
platform for any in-car app you can
dream up have an idea
now is your chance to make it a reality
create an app to prevent babies being
left in cars create an app to notify you
of cool events happening around you the
options are endless now it's your turn
make Drive as intelligent as you are
it's time to get out of the Stone Age of
driving drives gonna get us there but we
need you make it happen what do you say
are you gonna drive or are you gonna
drop we started this journey three years
ago to make your phone work more like a
camera because it's creatives the camera
has become our common tool in an era
where it's nearly impossible to get lost
the Camerons fires us to try
it is our compass our anti GPS device it
leads us to explore and discover in
highly personal ways it gives us pause
in a world that is speeding up around us
it reminds us that when hits likes and
comments fade away we're in the presence
of something bigger
we are moment we believe that the future
photography is in your pocket
hi Kickstarter we're back three years
ago you backed our first project the
moment lenses a year later you enabled
us to make the world's first case for
mobile photography and today we need
your help to introduce the next
generation of moment products this is
our most ambitious project yet
introducing not one but three new
products photo case the battery photo
case and our brand new wide lens these
are the best products we've ever made
that we think you're going to love them
the more we shoot the more battery we
require constantly on the go we don't
always have time to find a wall plug or
space to carry a pocketful of cables and
power bags so we created a new type of
battery case one that brings power and
photography together like never before
with 2500 and 3500 milliamp power
batteries these cases are powerful
enough to double the life of your iPhone
7 and 7 plus the two-stage DSLR like
shutter button enables focus lock and
rapid shooting in the moment app or
faster capture in the iPhone camera app
shooting moving subjects just got easier
with a redesign lens interface you can
now rotate and click a moment lens into
place and if you're shooting on the 7
plus you can now mount our glass over
either lens on the phone unlocking even
more creativity but it's the strap
attachment that truly turns your phone
back into a camera if you love to take
pictures this is the battery case for
you the photo case is everything we love
about minimal photography adding only
three millimeters in thickness to your
phone this is the thinnest lens
mountable case you've ever made it's
slim and unobtrusive in your pocket yet
readily available when you want to shoot
and just like the Profoto case we have
included our new lens interface and
camera strap attachment turning your
phone into an even better camera to all
the customers who ask for a thin
non-electronic moment case this one's
for you
when Apple introduced iPhone 7 they
change the landscape of mobile
photography their use of high-speed F
1.8 next generation 12 megapixel sensors
an optical image stabilization brought a
new level of image quality to your
pocket in order to deliver the best
quality imaginable our only choice was
to redesign our glass from the ground up
this glass a sphere improves on our
already class-leading distortion
correction and maintains razor sharp
images on iPhones f 1.8 aperture in
order to accommodate the larger iPhone
aperture we made this lens slightly
bigger enabling us to take advantage of
every photon without compromise a larger
lens also makes the optics more tolerant
to misalignment so unwanted dark corners
are a thing of the past our new moment
wide lens is without a doubt the best
lens we've ever made each moment
products start with the customer
inspired by travel the new moment cases
were still in subtraction realizing that
thickness is everything we design a
custom battery to maximize power and
reduce physical size we also
dramatically improved the tactile feel
of the shutter button trying to match
the precision feedback of a professional
camera using the Lightning port allowed
us to remove Bluetooth for a more
reliable connection
we then subtly soften the foam language
and expose a variety of textures to make
one-handed shooting easier everything we
learned from creating the first moment
case has gone into making these ones our
best work yet
we're now ready to bring these new
products to life but we need your help
this is the most technically advanced
project we've ever embarked upon which
means that the tooling and manufacturing
costs are significant the money we're
raising goes directly towards covering
these costs as we move from a prototype
through production with your help we can
take the next step in making your phone
an even better camera join us
