you
is inside them for years but that hasn't
really improved the way that we drive
them in creating automatic we set out to
unlock our cars potential and redefine
people's relationship to driving making
it safer more efficient and fun we did
this by introducing your car to your
smartphone it all starts with the
automatic link just plug it into your
car's data port and follow the simple
instructions on screen now your car and
smart phone will connect wirelessly
whenever you drive most people don't
realize just how big an impact their
driving style can have on fuel
efficiency you can save up to a third on
gas with only a few adjustments to how
you drive an automatic helps you do that
without being a back seat driver it
learns about your driving style and
gives you subtle audio cues when you do
things that waste gas like accelerating
quickly the app shows your weekly drive
score and trip timeline so you can track
your progress and see where to improve a
high score could save you hundreds on
gas every year when you drive automatic
monitors your car's health and warns you
if something's wrong so if your check
engine light comes on you'll see a
description of the problem and possible
solutions you can even clear the light
yourself and save a trip to the mechanic
because Adam Attic connects to your car
when you drive it always knows where you
parked your family can even access that
location for seamless car sharing
accidents happen and far too often there
isn't someone there to help if you're
ever in a crash automatic alerts 911
with your location it can even contact
your loved ones to let them know what's
happened and that help is on the way we
wanted to reimagine what driving could
be and I think we did that with
automatic we believe that cars should
live up to their potential and that
every driver can be a smarter driver
that's why we created automatic the
smart driving
no better no better pace you
I was
hey mr.
stop
we use technology we rely on it it
connects us to what we care about yet
there are times when we find ourselves
on our own again
what if you could charge your device
using alia can
all you need is water
in in charge
it's dependable
and provides an instant source of power
when you need it most
now no matter where you are or whatever
happens to the electricity the candle
charger will be there to keep you
connected
I Kickstarter it's adam from store we've
been really happy with the progress
we've made since our first campaign and
we're excited to bring you something new
the candle charger is an emergency
preparedness product which means that
you don't know that you need it until
you really need
we can't wait to see what you guys do
with it
[Laughter]
hi I'm Jay and I'm Eric we're graduate
students at MIT Media Lab we have a
dream that everyone is an inventor so we
created makey makey to let you invent
just by alligator clipping alligator
clip stuff like bananas to your Mickey
Mickey when you touch the banana your
computer just thinks you're touching the
keyboard the front has arrow keys
spacebar and mouse left click when
you're ready for more flip the makey
makey over and you've got more keyboard
keys and support for the mouse you can
even use the board like an Arduino when
you are ready no programming no
breadboarding you don't even have to
install software just plug it in USB
order your Mickey Mickey today
and start changing how the world works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
