my name is Bruce Kidman and I am Stephen
Atkinson and we are the creators of the
cradle tree staking system
this product has a few key features that
really differentiate it from anything
else on the market and that would be
that it supports your tree without
possibly ever having to touch your tree
this is just simple and fast with a
click extend the poles to the right
height and you're set I don't know of
any other product that has a tripod
system that doesn't have to even touch
your trees it's only there for a backup
so this creates a healthier tree a tree
isn't meant to be tied that it's got to
be able to move so it can develop its
spine or backbone whereas you buy a tree
from maybe a retail store they'll have a
stake in it if you get home you take
that stake out the tree will fall over
and look at this one where it's got the
ring it lets it move no matter which way
the winds blowing and develops itself
this is where we need you we are at the
point that we've got the design we've
got the manufacturers we've got
everything in line to do this but we've
got to get this into production we need
your help to cover those manufacturing
costs to get this initial order so that
we can begin production we're excited
about the product we hope you are too

Design Academy in Eindhoven and together
with van mahkum we started to develop
the product sound skins with sound skins
we wanted to maintain the sound quality
of your speaker so we had to make a
product that is acoustically transparent
while still being able to transform your
sonís speaker into an interior object
so we collaborated with the textile
museum who won the prize of Museum of
the year 2017
the textile lab is a specialized
workshop at the Museum and they are the
absolute experts at knitting innovation
in the Netherlands here we developed a
3d netting technique with many materials
tests done by the laboratory of
acoustics at the Technical University
Eindhoven ensured that the skins are
acoustically transparent and don't
affect the sound after two years of
researching and testing sound scans came
to what it is today
a 3d knitted cover for your sonís
speaker sounds kins is designed to
perfectly fit the shape of your sono
speaker this is what makes it so special
if you look closely you can see all
details and the 3d knitted edges because
of this you still have full use of
sona's pushing swipe functions while
wearing the skin sound skins is
available for your play one play three

colors so they can easily blend into any

founded the company Vaughn mocha from
their studio in Amsterdam they design
developed and admire beautiful and
unique products besides owning their own
labels they distribute over 14 other
brands to high-end design and interior
stores in 34 countries worldwide we are
