I'm bar and I'm Hannah
in 2014 I ran a successful Kickstarter
campaign for the make Smith CNC
today I'm super excited introduce you to
our new project massive Maslow is a four
by foot
CNC cutting machine designed to change
the way we build everything from art
projects the houses and it's cheap you
can get one now for under $500 masa lets
you print the things you can find around
news that are made from wood this could
be anything from furniture to the
world's coolest treehouse to rebuilding
after a natural disaster we want to
create a game-changing tool which allows
people from around the world to
digitally collaborate to make amazing
things we want to create a tool which is
cheap easy to use inclusive and powerful
basically we want to help you build cool
stuff to make that possible we knew we
had to make a machine which work with
materials and their natives for buying
form without taking up your entire
garage or workshop it needed to be
affordable
both the purchase and
it had to be easy to assemble with no
soldering no programming and mil fancy
tool it needed to be just as accurate as
a person using power tools even when
cutting complex shapes our solution masa
masa uses gear reduce easy motors with
encoders and a closed-loop feedback
system to achieve high accuracy and high
torque more details for nerds can be
found below Maslow spans only 19 inches
out from your garage or shop wall
leaving plenty of space to park a car
mouse hook comes as an easy to assemble
kit which includes every piece of
hardware you need except for two bricks
two sheets of plywood and three two by
fours we couldn't get those to fit in
the book also if you don't already own
one you'll need to purchase a fixed base
router
maslow's can be put together in a
weekend using only a phillips
screwdriver a pair of pliers and a
handsaw razzo connects to your Mac
Windows or Linux computer using a
standard USB port excited for your first
project plugs now to reserve your
massless B&amp;amp;C
can't believe it read and learn comes
more about the project below building
things digitally is the future and we
believe it should be for everyone this
is an important technology and we're
making the choice not to patent it all
of our designs PCB layouts firmware and
software are available for free right
now
on our website to anyone in the world
when you design something to print
whether it's a kayak a tiny house or
light aircraft we encourage you to do
the same and share your digital files so
anyone can benefit check out our videos
and content below to learn how easy it
is to assemble your kit and to find out
how to turn your digital files into
real-world objects and most importantly
build something amazing
