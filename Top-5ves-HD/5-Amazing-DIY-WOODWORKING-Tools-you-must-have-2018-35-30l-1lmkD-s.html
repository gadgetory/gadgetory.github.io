new possibilities when screwing or
gluing boards together and 90-degree
angles for example picture frames simple
one-handed operation leaves the other
hand free for work
the Corner clamp achieves a strong
clamping force and provides a flat
surface it is suitable for boards with
the thickness of 10 to 22 millimeters
and automatically adjust to different
board thicknesses when building a shelf
for example drilling and screw driving
can be carried out in one operation the
corner clamp is non-slip padded your
grips to hold the material firmly in
place without marking designed to help
woodworkers quickly and accurately set
the height of saw blades and router bits
or the depth of drill bits and are also
great for the setup of fences all sizes
from 1/32 of an inch to one inch in 1/32
of an inch increments plus ten metric
size blocks with this many sizes the
need to stack different blocks is
virtually eliminated set you'll find
eight set up blocks that fit today's
most common plywood widths use them to
set your dado cutter width and then use
them to check your des toes and rabbet
joints for a perfect fit the set up
blocks are a great way to set up the
distance between your table saw blade
and fence or even use it on your bandsaw
and now you'll be able to set your fence
at 1/16 of an inch for cutting thin
strips for that special project and
setting the space between your router
bits blade and your router fence will
take no time at all
woodpeckers set up blocks will make your
cutting routing and drilling setups more
accurate
expandable powerful versatile the
connect modular clamp system from
Crescent redefines expectations of what
a clamp can do 500 pounds of holding
power secures your work with almost 60
percent more force than comparable
clamps that's strong enough to hold
heavy objects upright with confidence
but the real power of the connect clamp
is its integrated connection system that
lets you join and rotate multiple clamps
to achieve almost any position odd
angles and difficult corners like those
on cabinets and furniture are securely
held in position Crescent twin locks
allow you to easily add additional
clamps expanding your connection options
simply attach a twin lock on the end of
the rail and slide another connect clamp
into place connect clamps are equally
useful as a spreader lift the bar lock
slide and reverse the position of the
head the trigger action now applies
force in the opposite direction large
pads provide maximum surface contact and
protect delicate surfaces pads can be
removed to gain additional clearance
when working in tight spaces or around
overhanging edges an integrated pipe
grip is molded into each connect clamp
round objects are locked down tight
preventing twisting when cutting and
drilling the combination plane was
created to replace shelves of wooden
planes Veritas has released their own
version of that shop or a course that
uses both our existing plow plane blades
as well as the new ones that are
specific to the combination plane the
Veritas combination plane has three key
components the body the sliding section
and the fence assembly the body holds
the blade the blade adjustment knob one
of the scoring Spurs the depth stop and
the handle the sliding section travels
on two rods that's secured to the body
it also carries a second depth stop in
scoring spur this component provides
support for wider blades the fence also
slides on the two rods and carries to
fence knobs the
Vence the sub fence adjustment knob and
the two sub fence locking knobs the
combination plane comes with a set of
five inch and 8 inch rods that can be
installed for either left or
right-handed use to deploy the scoring
spur loosen the retention screw and
slide the cutter down no deeper than
1/32 of an inch then tighten the screw
to lock it into place a convenient
feature is the through-hole that allows
access to the scoring spur adjustment
screws without dismantling the plane the
death stops are set by loosening the
depth stop lock knob rotating the depth
stop adjusting knob then tightening the
lock knob again you can set the fence by
sliding it on the rods then locking it
close to its final position using the
fence knobs then loosen the sub fence
knobs and gradually bring the fence into
final position now let's take a look at
how to configure the plane for different
tasks the key to success with beading is
setting the depth stop such that the
bead ends up being slightly below the
surface
setting up the plane on a scrap piece
will allow you to get this setup right
fluting blades come with a notch that
positions the skate in the center of the
blade this is essential for the blade to
cut properly reading is essentially a
number of beads cut simultaneously the
key with these blades is to place the
sliding section in line with the second
quark this will ensure maximum stability
of the plane while working whether
you're adding a small detail to a
furniture project or sticking mouldings
the Veritas combination plane is a great
choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
