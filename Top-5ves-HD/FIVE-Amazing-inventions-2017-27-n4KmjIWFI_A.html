blast what's not fun is filling our bags
with underwear or worst of all running
out of a fresh pair just when you need
it that's why we created silver air a
revolutionary new underwear that doesn't
smell so you can pack wider and stay
fresh longer our secret is pure silver
the same silver that's used in hospitals
and even in spacesuits for its
antimicrobial properties it prevents the
growth of odor and keeps your gear fresh
over long periods of time so go ahead
grab two pairs put them in your bag and
you'll be set for the week to create the
most comfortable fabric we use two 17.5
micron premium merino wool which feels
softer than your most comfortable cotton
underwear while delivering better
performance than anything you've ever
worn it even regulates temperature so no
matter where you go your jewels will
stay cool dry and insanely comfortable
best of all the silver is permanently
bonded into the fabric and will last the
life of the product
finally there's this something all guys
can relate to so we created smart grid
which uses soft silicone beads to
provide just the right amount of hold so
your underwear doesn't write up and
instead of being these guys you can be
that guy from the smart design to the
beautiful craftsmanship we've thought
about every single detail and trust us
in the process of creating the ultimate
travel underwear we just made the best
BAM underwear for daily wear boom
hi I'm Sean and I have a dream I believe
everything in the entire world should be
connected to the Internet to make our
lives easier the thing is you go into a
store these days and there's usually an
internet-enabled version which basically
means it's five times more expensive and
takes an engineering degree to make work
plus I don't want new things I buy to be
part of the Internet I want everything
to be part of the Internet so I got to
thinking what if there was a little
device that I could put on anything that
will allow me to monitor it and thus
control something based on that I think
that would change the world so there's
one day I'm out with my buddy James and
they say hey James you think we could
make this happen
well Sean you're a software guy I'm a
hardware guy we can definitely do this
can you imagine what would we want to
monitor and control a restaurant could
put them on their chairs and count how
many times they've moved or put one of
their beer taps and count how many beers
have been poured
hey we could even put one in a fridge or
freezer and monitor the temperature at
all times or hey can you put one on my
beer so nobody steals it hey Sean think
about where we could use this around the
home you could put one on your front
door or garage and be notified anytime
it's open yeah I'll put one on a mailbox
and get a text if your mail arrives what
about putting one in your child's
bedroom to monitor the temperature at
all times
oh yeah I'll put one on a windowsill and
get alerted if your teenager tries to
ask a great idea just think about all
the places we could use this inside like
in a kitchen that's right like on a
dishwasher to make sure it's on or make
sure people aren't getting into the
wrong cupboards hey we could count how
many times the fridge is open or put one
in your wine fridge to make sure the
wine is staying chilled exactly or put
one in the cookie jar so you know when
your kids grab snacks before dinner
what about at work yeah you could
monitor the temperature from office to
office instead of just one place can you
imagine putting one on your chair and
being notified if somebody's been
messing with it or more importantly
somebody's not messing with your desk
and tries to steal your stapler you know
there's already products like this out
there but they're little circuit boards
that feel like they're gonna electrocute
you or stab you or kill you in some way
let's just stop talking about this shot
and let's make it happen
introducing the Kubik the world's first
truly affordable internet of everything
device they will help you control and
monitor everything in your life from the
comfort of your phone this 1 inch cube
is large enough to be found easily yet
small enough to be attached to almost
anything cubic is easy to set up
connects to your Wi-Fi in a flash to
transmit data to the cloud and comes
with a rechargeable long-lasting battery
we're starting with four different
versions temperature movement humidity
and light and this isn't just an idea
anymore it is real we've spent a year
refining our designs and testing our
prototypes it's ready to go
we just need financial support to
complete the required certification and
tooling we believe this will change the
world
what do you think Kickstarter friends
it's up to you buy one and help us
change the world
hi I'm Matthew 10 years ago I set up a
company that sells coffee and coffee
machines throughout the UK as well as
being a business owner and a coffee
lover
I'm also an engineer and for the last
six years I've been working on a device
that can now lay claim to be in the
world's first perfect portable coffee
maker so what's different about this
device you can use it anywhere anytime
anyplace whether it's on the Tramp house
and about or just in the office this is
the on the world's first perfect
portable coffee maker have you ever
wondered why the coffee that you get at
home never ever taste as good as the
coffee that you get from your local
coffee shop well there is a reason for
that and the main reason is that you're
not using a machine that costs thousands
and thousands of dollars or pounds a
commercial coffee machine similar
probably to the one being used in your
local coffee shop is gonna be doing a
number of things to make sure that it
creates the perfect cup of coffee
number one it's gonna be pairing the
coffee correctly for the beverage is
about to be made number two is going to
be maintaining the correct pressure
throughout the brewing process this in
turn will lead to the correct flow rate
being used of the water passing the
coffee particles and last of all this
will in turn give you the correct
extraction and will also stop the coffee
from over extracting okay so that all
sounds very technical and quite
complicated but this little device
controls all of those aspects without
the need for electricity and just at a
fraction of the cost
so making coffee on the device is really
easy
add your coffee add hot water let the
level rise on the outside chamber top
off with hot water press down on the
outer casing brew the coffee on the
pressure and you're left with a rich
tasting perfectly brewed portable coffee
the omphh is insulated by design with an
air barrier around the entire device a
smart turbine corrects for variations in
ground coffee so you can use a range
different grinds whatever the user
drinks the dynamic mixer stirs the
coffee so that it tastes the same from
beginning to end
Colleen Young is fast and simple add a
small amount of water pump up and down
to internally clean
and you're ready to use again so after
six years of development we've got
working prototypes making great coffee
we've had it tested by all the experts
and what we need help with now is we
need your pledge to help to bring the
honor to market thanks for listening we
do in almost every morning and over 33%
of us do it at least three times a day

irresistible urge to snooze the stain

every morning and it makes us late brush
up the house that's stuck in stressful
traffic and lose valuable morning time
