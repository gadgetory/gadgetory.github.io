lithium-ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy outputs of almost any storage
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
River releases you from the shackles of
an outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging ports which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means you're good power to iPhones to
iPads to MacBooks a mini-fridge a
lantern a drone battery a mobile Wi-Fi
unit and stereo speakers all at the same

port with the storage capacity of 416
watt hours River gives you more powers

car charger can replenish the battery to
full capacity in just eight hours with
eco flows portable solar panels River

a documentary filmmaker a lot of my
shoots happen outside a lot of times our
locations are way out in the middle of
nowhere first time I use River I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI T station a battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra lights could never
have to worry about the noise and the
pollution of a generator applications
for battery power are endless River
isn't just an accessory it's your power
companion for harnessing clean energy
anywhere so you're free to go everywhere
and by the way this isn't just a concept
river has been tried and tested and as
you can see this entire production has
been lit by River
