that your stock is perfectly square to
your router fence holds down your stock
securely provides quick and easy setup
and repeatability and safe operation
your coping sled starts with a large
eleven and a half inch by eleven and a
half inch by 3/8 of an inch thick
phenolic base which will accommodate
stock up to five and a half inches wide
and one and a half inches thick then at
a 16 inch aluminum fence position
perfectly square to the edge of the sled
base now add the phenolic top plate
sliding it towards your stock to lock it
against the fence forcing the stock to
stay square throughout the cutting
operation now let's add the dual track
top tracks and clamping beam this design
gives you positioning flexibility in
extreme haul downforce
it allows positioning of two massive
hold on clamps
anywhere along the width of the stock
making it easy to position the clamps
dead center over your stock finally the
fence guide
place your sled three quarters of an
inch from the fence then slide the fence
guide against it that's it the clear
fence guide provides visibility and
allows the sled to track along the fence
rather than the mitre swamp
and since what peckers coping sled has
no disposable parts to replace like
other sleds do the only thing you'll
have to provide is whatever scrap you
have laying around the shop uses a
backer board to prevent tear-out
and with the new optional extended fence
guide letting tenants and lap joints
with a perfect finish is now a breeze
whether it's rails style doors tenants
lap joints or other ingrained cuts the
woodpecker's coping slide makes your job
easier spent on decks should be a time
of peace and relaxation not time spent
looking at all the problems warped
boards split ends and nails or screws
popping up traditional built decks
constructed with nails or screws driven
through the face of the board cause not
only eyesores but they can be dangerous
as well now the Kreg deck jig system
puts a brand-new angle on an old
approach to building decks utilizing
tools and basic skills that you already
have this concealed fastener system
allows you to build a beautiful long
lasting deck you have always wanted
combining the strength and durability of
face screwing with proven pocket hole
technology to hide the fasteners this
system is the perfect one-two punch for
a deck that is simple to build gorgeous
and safe the core of the Craig deck jig
system is its solid metal drill guides
which allow you to drill holes and drive
screws at the precise angle and perfect
depth time after time the angle of the
guides not only hide the screws on the
edge of the board but are optimal for
maximum holding power while the screw
depth is precisely controlled which
eliminates over driving and blowing out
the board or under driving leaving
exposed fasteners and loose boards this
process is made fast and worryfree by
the included depth collars on both the
driver bit and drill bit that are set
using the gauges molded right on the jig
once set just drill the hole load the
screw and drive it home we've got a
shelf tin template is cnc machined from
3/8 thick phenolic material with
three-eighths diameter holes that are
compatible with most shelf bin drill
guides and three-eighths router guide
bushings
the Shelf pin template is easy to use it
comes with 6 referencing pins
three-quarter inch and three 5
millimeter one side is 4 inch space
falls with three setbacks one and a half
inch to inch and two and a half inch
flip it over in its metric with 32
millimeters space holes and one setback
of 37 millimeter let's drill some holes
using the snappy shelf pin guide and are
set back at one and a half inches the
Shelf pin template is symmetrical so you
rotate it to the back edge of your board
and both sets of holes won't line up
perfectly
now that was quick and easy and the
spacing of the holes looks great now
let's use a 3/8 runner guide bushing and
punch router with a quarter inch down
cut spiral bit with a setback of two
inches for doing fine woodworking this
method will give you perfect holes if
you're building a cabinet or bookcase
with fixed shelves it's hard to beat
dado joints for strengthen ease of
assembly trouble is cutting a tight
fitting dado isn't as simple as it might
seem a classic example is when you're
working with 3/4 inch plywood which
isn't actually 3/4 of an inch thick it's
usually a bit thinner but the actual
thickness can vary that means you'll
need to make multiple passes with a
smaller bit and mess with multiple
setups if you're off by even a little
you'll end up with a loose joint that
can wreck the appearance and compromise
the structural integrity of your project
Rockler has a solution to those
challenges the perfect fit dado jig it
works with your router and the popular
all-in-one clamp guides to allow you to
cut a precise dado of any size from 1/2
to 1 inch with a half inch bit one set
up and two passes of your router
just follow the included instructions to
position the clamp guide on your
workpiece and set the jig for the data
width you need
you're ready to cut your dado fit the
fixed side of the jig in a channel of
the clamp guide and make your first pass
the lip and channel design ensures that
the router won't wander guaranteeing a
perfect cut for your second pass rotate
the router and jig and make the cut to
widen the dado the result is a dado
sized precisely to fit your stock and
with that single setup you're ready to
cut a whole bookcase worth of matching
dedos the durable base has been
pre-drilled with a three hole pattern to
fit many common routers and can be
drilled to fit others and it works with
any length of all-in-one clamped guide
so for dead-on dedos with quick easy
setup check out the perfect fit dado jig
