especially in big cities heavy traffic :
ozone and fire smoke it all inflicts
your daily air quality and in the end
your health at University of Southern
California graduate student Frederic
craft came up with a solution when he
was exercising outdoors around campus
during my workout I realized I couldn't
breathe because the pollution level was
way too high at the time I wished it was
at all I could show me when the best
time to do a physical activity would be
so I decided to create the smartphone
app inhale inhale shows you the
recommended start and stop time for your
activity depending on the duration I've
tried the inhale app for a couple days
now and it's really convenient for me to
plan my outdoor activities according to
the time of day when I inhale the least
amount of pollution since I'm allergic
to pollen it's important for me to avoid
exercise outdoors when the amounts are
too high inhale is really user friendly
and you can plan up to four days ahead
type in your zip code and the duration
of the activity and you're good to go
inhale can be connected to a pulse meter
such as a SmartWatch and calculate the
exact amount of pollen or pollution
inhaled throughout the day or during a
physical activity it will also tell you
when you've reached a dangerous level I
have tried it in hay lab for some time
now it really helps me to plan my ride
to and from downtown LA where I work
what I'm biking to work I can feel how
exposed I am to pollution I recommend in
health to everyone traveling in immature
of volatile areas inhale is made even
more powerful by placing an air quality
sensor on the back of the new Motorola
modular phone by having the sensor on
the back of the phone users are able to
collect data on the air they breathe in
real time no matter where they are our
sleek design does all the work for you
by only measuring the air core
when your phone is out of your pocket
you are the signal to the world that
this is important in hell the average
smartphone user unlocks their device
over 80 times a day 65% of Americans
agree on the importance of a periodic
digital details only 28% actually go on
to do so yet these powerful and personal
devices help us connect with the world
at large

better way forward how about a more
subtle digital experience that Clues us

paper and in virtual space and
