and each day is dependent on its
unfortunately for one out of five people
this is not a reality they suffer from
sleep deprivation my name is Julian one
of the founders of some looks and we
made it our mission to bring the world
better sleep with world's first sleep
robots meet the Sun look sleep robots
your ultimate sleep companion that
improves sleep by soothing body and
minds reducing stress and anxiety so you
can fall asleep faster deeper and wake
up feeling refreshed it does so by
providing a range of effective and
proven features breathing regulations
sounds and affection by hugging the Sun
look sleep robot at night you will feel
it breathe and by feeling the rising and
falling sensation of its breathing you
will subconsciously adjust your own
breathing rhythm accordingly years of
research have proven that breathing is
essential to naturally reduce stress and
increase relaxation to help you fall
asleep in addition to breathing the
sonic sleep robot provides the user with
sounds hear the sounds of heartbeats
guided meditation lullabies or upload
your own turning off automatically the
mobile app can be used to set your
personal preferences during the day so
you can have a tailored approach to
improve your sleep at night
with over-the-air updates we will make
some looks the rowboat smarter over time
soft and durable fabrics provide
ultimate comfort and can be easily
washed
the battle for sleep is a frustration
that I've personally experienced through
family and friends rather than reach for
addictive sleep medication I was
introduced to breathing and audio being
an effective and proven method to help
me sleep and relax over years of
research and development we have built a
dream team of various dedicated
engineers sleep enthusiasts and
researchers who are passionate about
bringing better sleep to the world after
developing many prototypes and a lot of
testing in collaboration with tests
sleepers an hour high tech incubator yes
Dell we have designed the ultimate sleep
companion we are proud to announce our
partnership with royal out being the
leading circular mattress manufacturer
in Europe helping help disco design this
unlock sleep robot to a sustainable
product with high quality materials we
are fortunate that we can manufacture to
some look sleep robots and outings
reliable manufacturing facilities in the
Netherlands everything to make sure you
gets wood you pledge for we need your
help to purchase tooling and realize our
products support us today by
pre-ordering your own some Knox sleep
robots and help us bring the world
better sleep
what if you had a desk that worked for
you it knows you and it's ready to work
just the way you like it knows when
you've been sitting too long and tells
you to stand up
it keeps you synched with your team and
sharpens your mind to help ideas flow
best
it anticipates when you're hungry and
places an order of something you'll love
it encourages movement to help you focus
throughout the day and even finds you
the time to relax it stays in harmony
with your body to keep you healthy and
fit and at the end of the day it's got
the fastest way to get you home
now what if I told you that this isn't
the office of the future but the office
of your new every day say hello to the
AI powered smart desk 3 say hello to a
workspace that works for you Bob is on a
mission to get serious about being
secure online but every solution out
there is either convenient or secure not
both only key is the solution for this
problem that provides the perfect
balance of both serious about security
and getting things done only key stores
accounts securely offline this means
that unlike software only key can
protect your information even if a hack
occurs if you lose only key no problem
its pin protected and useless without
the pin only one pin to remember for all
of your accounts plus only key supports
two-factor authentication
touch a button to log into online
accounts your computer or practically
anything if you can type the password
only key can type it for you it works
practically everywhere Windows Mac
Chromebook Linux Android and even iPhone
it's waterproof durable and about the
size of a house key that easily attaches
to a keychain
Bob's password drama is over now if he
could get serious about secure
communication all of his emails and chat
messages are unencrypted this means they
could be intercepted by a hacker or even
a government intelligence agency but
every solution out there is either
convenient or secure not both instead of
complicated solutions secure
communication is as simple as
highlighting the text to encrypt and
confirming on only key Bob just needs to
know Alice's Facebook Twitter or email
to look up Alice's key base account and
send a secure chat or email to Alice Bob
and Alice can keep using the email and
chat they like Facebook messenger slack
Gmail and others Bob highlights text to
encrypt and confirms on only key Alice
confirms an only key to decrypt it works
practically everywhere with the key
safely offline on the only key
now Bob is making real progress but what
about the future is he ready for
whatever comes next
only he is ready with an adaptable
future ready framework crypto currencies
like Bitcoin and aetherium can be
secured with only key with quantum
computers current encryption may soon
become obsolete if we meet our stretch
goals only key will build cryptocurrency
support can be the first commercially
available post quantum crypto device
while other devices unable to adapt will
be left in the dust only key will be
ready to secure the future immediate
device allows you to freeze your best
moments without breaking yogi with no
stress of using invasive technology or
screens that distract your mind that's
why we created clip a wide-angle camera
to welcome
click recognize the odd moments and
deterrents on just one top to take high
quality photos to job for full HD video
straight from your wrist
so you can easily capture You're
Expecting moment anywhere at any time
flip automatically send your stories
with wireless thinking you can relive it
whenever you want
hey I'm Robert her and I'm the CEO and
co-founder a few bucks
my name is Dan Friedman I'm co-founder
and chief marketing officer of fuel
boxing the concepts started with
building our phone charger into the wall
then we realized wait why be tied to the
outlet anymore why not bring the outlet
to you power station is a two-part
system featuring the dock and the boost
pack each component has Universal
chargers that allow you to power any
mobile device the dock includes an
additional USB port a secure resting
shelf surge protected outlets and
magnets for attaching the boost effect
this mobile life saver carries over 25
hours of battery life which is indicated
by LED lights it can also be recharged
from any USB port fuel bucks is better
simply because of the combination of
both stationary power and mobile power
on the go we've been developing fuel
blocks for almost three years testing
and building model after model we
finally has something that's gonna make
all of our lives a little bit easier
throughout each rendition we focused on
creating a sleek and ergonomic product
while constantly testing the limits of
durability we're really excited about
the team we've assembled here at fuel

are the people working hard playing hard
to bring new products to market well
your traditional everyday charging cords

something you have to add to your device
