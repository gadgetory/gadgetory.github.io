do you stay comfortable when you're not
in control of the temperature he'd like
to know so is she
finally the solution is here
ember wave
the first wearable that lets you cool
down or warm up when you need it most
sending personalized waves of cooling
and warming to help you feel more
comfortable
hot or cold for once the choice is yours
ember wave the notebook project with
mindful is a tool that we are putting
into the world that when used can help
us live better lives
I know in my own life I get super busy
and I'm super busy using technology
everybody right now is getting fed a
technology world get distracted by
Instagram or a notification I want to
stay connected with people I want to
grow my brand with technology but at the
same point I don't want to forget that I
can write and I can put things in a book
I think it resonated with me because
here was this kind of old-school
throwback way of doing something that
has withstood the test of time the first
element that the Corso notebook contains
is at the top of every page is a daily
thought or quote it's a good kick start
to the day on where our heads at the
second element to the notebook is your
own creative space to list tasks to plan
out your day the final piece is the
daily gratitude section at the bottom
and this was super important to us
because it's easy to forget the good
that happens within a day we feel like
the corso notebook distinguishes itself
it gives you three different elements
all wrapped into one it kind of puts
together the pieces of the puzzle that
we feel are important each day to help
you be successful we discovered mindful
org online and through chatting with
them and doing a little more research we
discovered that they would be a great
fit for what we wanted to do with
notebook we all just put our heads
together on why we were doing it why we
saw value in it and went from there
the whole concept works really well with
with our mission what we're trying to do
continue rise of digital experiences to
me says all the more need to ground
ourselves slow down a little bit limit
being just sucked into the speed of
whatever's in our face
it definitely helps me to be more
organized it helps me to focus on the
goals I want to accomplish that day
whether it's being a dad and a husband
whether it's you know in the workplace
chasing the dream I have with our
business whatever it might be
another thing we do is starts with that
thought or that idea but then you've got
to put it into action and to me the
notebook is that first step we are
really excited about the course on
notebook and we've worked really hard on
our end to make sure that the first
10,000 backers will receive their
notebook by Christmas so back yes whoo
so open your mind and back and share our
project today do it
you
we all know what it's like to leave our
dog at home every day when we need to go
to work they have to stay alone from
nine to seven and that's not fun for
them or for you so for you and your dog
we created Lika Lika is a life companion
for your dog it is similar to a mobile
terrestrial robot that you can control
with your smartphone from anywhere like
us equipped with a camera a microphone a
speaker and the tree tosser that can be
used to reward your dog this makes your
dog love Laika while having fun playtime
standard we also developed a tracker to
keep tabs on your dog and adapt based on
your dog's behavior so if you're busy
and your dog needs attention like this
autonomous mode turns on and take care
of your dog until your back

the co-founder of kam toy and I'm a dog
lover since my childhood when I started
college I couldn't spend as much time as
I used to with my dog this is how I
first thought about lekha a smart dog
companion the kam toy team has been hard
at work conceptualizing lekha we
gathered amazing partners and were ready
to go over the industry ization process
and here we are now in Paris in the
biggest startup campus in the world the
station death I'd like to introduce you

from the beginning to better understand
dogs I was very lucky to meet tomorrow
Marvin and all the team of kam toy lekha
the companion of the dog the companion
of his life is the best solution the
most ethical solution to prevent boredom

we do and you want to improve their
well-being please support project and

to help us do imagine thing together we
hope you join the Laker community thanks
for watching
introducing the arc lighter the world's
first electronic candle lighter powered
by our patent-pending
our glider technology
when we first set out to design a new
CAD letter we started by reinventing
everything we know about candle letters
today from its design to how it works
even replacing the traditional flame
simply press a point and light blenny
canvas will never be the same
unlike an open flame that can reach
extreme temperatures as it rises our
patent-pending art letter technology
creates a super high intensity electric
arc that focuses of energy in the other
tip and because it's flameless it can be
used in any direction without any
flare-ups and lights perfectly every
time
why settle for hard and use disposable
candle lighters when you can have a
rechargeable lighter designed to be seen
always Within Reach
always charged and always ready thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
