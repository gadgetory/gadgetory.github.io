Bluetooth and work with a native iOS and

mounting system for a blazer -
smartphones and tablets clip with a
silicon coating that will work with
devices from 0.23 inches to 0.3
right
enhancements for two years we are a
small team of young aspiring people who
build products solely by our enthusiasm
and love for photography now we are
looking for funds to start I blazer to
mass production and need your help
we have never raised investments and
this is actually what we are very proud
of that is why we've come back again to
Kickstarter join us and support the I
blazer to project
you
what is a record to some they represent
audio reproduction in its purest form to
others
they're nostalgic timepieces connecting
music to memories and to many that is
the thing that hipsters purchase from
time to time whatever they mean to you
we'd like to present a new way to enjoy
and maybe even discover your favorite
records here's what it sounds like need
a bigger sound connect your favorite
wireless speakers or headphones with its
built-in Bluetooth this is what it is
this is all it does this is rock block
hi i'm jason and i'd like to introduce
the girl m in this tiny stuff sack
contains an oversized 11 foot long
hammock designed to be the most
comfortable one you've ever tried I call
it the go hammock because it's designed
to go anywhere with you and it can be
set up in a snap the level of comfort it
provides makes it perfect for sleeping
napping or relaxing it's lightweight and
portable and is great for camping hiking
picnics or just lounging in the backyard
if you back this project you'll be among
the first to experience the amazing
comfort of this hammock and at a great
price over the years I purchased mini
hammock but I couldn't find one that was
really comfortable as a matter of fact I
can only assume them for a few minutes
before feeling discomfort so I set out
to design the most comfortable hammock
possible after extensive research in the
building of many prototypes I came up
with the go hammock and it's so well
built it may be the last hammock you've
ever buy made from extra strong deputy D
nylon you can count on the go hammock
for years to come the go hammock
eliminates uncomfortable pressure points
by distributing the users body weight
more evenly than traditional hammocks
its generous size allows freedom to move
around and makes it easy to find lots of
comfortable positions even for side
sleepers to reduce the curved body
position that's associated with hammocks
experts recommend lying at a diagonal
angle to enable the user to lie even
flatter we made the go hammock extra
long and wide at 11 feet it's much
longer than most hammocks this extra
length helps flatten out the body
position dramatically at 70 inches wide
one can lie at an even greater angle
flattening the body position even
more large hammocks can sometimes have
annoying loose fabric on the sides to
eliminate this problem
I designed removable fabric tensioners
that pull the loose fabric out of the
way the tensioners make folds in the
fabric giving the hammock its unique
shape every go hammock ships with a
carabiner and a rope loop to use with a
suspension system of your choice our
optional tree straps with cinch buckles
make setup a breeze and they're easy to
adjust simply tilt the buckle pull the
strap and you're good to go
these heavy-duty polyester straps won't
stretch like nylon straps that are
commonly used with hammocks to take the
guesswork out of setting up your hammock
I recommend using our optional ridgeline
you see in order for a hammock to be as
comfortable as possible it must be set
up with a certain amount of sag our
ridgeline sets the sag for maximum
comfort every time it also makes a great
place to hang items while enjoying your
hammock I've been designing and
manufacturing outdoor equipment since
2007 and I know what it takes to bring a
product from design to production this
prototype was made the same Factory that
we making your go hammock everything's
in place for us to begin production and
we should have our backers ownership
this summer but we need your help to
make this project a reality so please
check out the rewards below and reserve
your go having today because you deserve
to be comfortable
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
