offers full-size features and unmatched
versatility including the ability to go
directly from table routing to handheld
routing without having to switch base
plates to different base plates who are
available one pre-drilled to fit most
popular midsize routers and one
pre-drilled for compact routers if
worktops faces tight the router table
can be mounted to wooden wall studs and
be secured for compact storage or easy
transport
check out the Rockler convertible bench
top router table and base plates their
unique pull through conveyor design
simplifies operation the diecast
carriage gives the operator the support
needed for demanding projects the stand
increases stability with its 20 inch by
37 inch footprint and also has a storage
shelf for operator convenience jets and
smart technology continuously monitors
the drum motor load it automatically
maintains the highest feed rate without
overloading the motor there
industry-first
tool free table parallelism adjustment
simplifies the process of bringing the
drum sander in and out of parallel
quickly and accurately a quick turn of
the knob makes your adjustment so you
can get back to work with minimal
downtime Jets patented heavy-duty molded
dust hood baffle is engineered to be
both lightweight and durable this
industry-leading design provides a
better cleaner sanding experience 97% of
all dust is extracted changing abrasives
is quick and easy
thanks to jets tool-free take up clips
easily adjust the drum height in
increments of 1/16 of an inch by
rotating the top position hand we
your projects finishing touches deserve
the proper finish our compass uses a
pair of precision machined telescoping
body parts that lock to your desired
dimension with a twist of a knurled head
screw our pocket compasses are very
accurate and easy to set up
they feature precision laser engraved
Imperial and metric scales and a pivot
hole on one half of the body and on the
other you can easily slide the alignment
mark to set your dimension to draw your
circle or arc simply insert the center
pin on one end and a mechanical pencil
in the first tapered hole on the other
swing the compass to draw your circle or
arc and you're done our compass also has
additional precision machined pencil
placement holes to conveniently increase
the compass setting diameter in one inch
increments to draw even larger diameter
circles another point of our new compass
design is the point unlike the common
dividers style compass with its pin
sharp centering point you can tote our
pocket compass in your shop apron
without feeling like a pincushion when
not in use the stainless steel centering
points securely stores in the compass
body keeping you out of harm's way we
make our quality pocket compass in two
sizes for drawing a wide range of circle
diameters the original pocket compass is
compact about the size of a disposable
lighter it can strike circles from one
inch to seven inches in diameter the new
larger sized pocket compass XL tackles
circles and arcs from two inches all the
way up to 21 inches in diameter while
functionally the same as an F style
clamp and price to compete with typical
one-handed clamps the handle has been
moved to surround the clamp bar while
still operating the Acme screw at the
end of the arm
what makes this possible is an
innovative gear train sealed within the
clamp arm allowing for the Acme screw to
be operated remotely a feature not found
on any other clamp this means that in
tight locations where an F star
I'll handle maybe obstructed the handle
of the gear clamp is outside of the
working area allowing for a proper grip
and reliable clamping in addition the
arm of the gear clamp features a clutch
mechanism which allows the arm to be
closed with just a push then released
with a simple trigger allowing for
presetting the arm position when needed
the unique gear clamp comes with a
protective pad for the jaws that is
easily removable exposing the molded in
clamping grooves there are many
situations around the shop where a clip
needs to be applied in an obstructed
area and the first-of-its-kind remote
handle of the gear clamp allows for a
full application of the clamping force
in these situations the t-nut hand tool
has been economically designed to be
comfortable to use it is well balanced
and easy to handle the safety lockout
mechanism prevents accidental firing
when simply pulling the trigger the
safety lock is still effective even when
the t-nut feeder is pulled back
t-nuts are supplied pre-mounted
inconvenient strips these are easily
slid into place along the t-nut feeder
to operate the hand tool simply position
over a pre-drilled hole push down to
locate the team in the hole and squeeze
the trigger
the t-nut is immediately fired into
position the T knot is accurately and
securely fastened
the power of the hand tool is capable of
securing T knots into a range of
materials including hard MDF
p'tee not gone saves time and money by
allowing operators to insert tea knots
in rapid succession with ease</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
