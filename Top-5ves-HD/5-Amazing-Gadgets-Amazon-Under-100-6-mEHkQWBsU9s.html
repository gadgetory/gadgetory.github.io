stepping on the foot pump the tank
cannot over inflate Giulio has many uses
for all kinds of outdoor activities the
size of a campsite Helio is perfect for
rinsing off salt water after surfing or
paddle boarding Phillip Helio before
heading to the beach and enjoy five to
seven minutes of steady clean water when
you're done with your session squeeze
the spray nozzle while pumping
occasionally to maintain desired water
pressure
unlike gravity camp showers that need to
be hung overhead and produce dismal
water pressure Helio rests on the ground
and delivers the pressure you need with
the 7-foot hose you have plenty of reach
for rinsing off
julia was also great for rinsing off
dirty paws after exploring the trails to
keep your car clean from sand and mud
extremely versatile uses for Helio are
only limited by your imagination
you're trying to get things done nothing
is more frustrating than working where
it's hard to reach or where you can't
see till now meet the cordless flip out
an incredible power driver its compact
to get the tight spaces other drivers
can't get drives the same power and
torque as much larger tools but here's a
real magic would flip out you'll always
come at your work from just the right
angle flip out delivers torque and power
using a design based on industrial
robots there are three pivoting joints
the top one pivots to reach into tight
spots the middle joint lets you reach
around or over and the third joint gives
you all this flexibility with 360
degrees of rotation the result flip out
locks into over 380 divisions giving you
power and tight spots power in
hard-to-reach spots power where you need
it flip out gets the job done use a
drill driver at the wrong angle and
you'll quickly stripped screws flip out
adjust to drive screw straight on and
with the drill driver you just don't
have control for RTA furniture a
flip-outs variable speeds which gives
you the touch you need to assemble
furniture quickly flip out runs on a
built-in eight volt max lithium ion
battery you can fully recharge it in
just 45 minutes and even if it sits for
a full year flip out still holds its
charge and maybe the best thing about
the flip out is it only weighs one pound
so whether you're working in
hard-to-reach places on electrical or
plumbing or just need a powerful driver
around the house flip-out is a tool for
you
you
in today's world people have access to
numerous digital services through the
use of various devices if you do the
math a person may easily have more than
15 different accounts security experts
agree that for a password to be truly
secure it must contain a random
combination of letters numbers and
symbols remembering such a secure
password is not a job meant for us
humans in the past few years hackers
have proven over and over again just how
vulnerable our computer systems can be
major companies like eBay Dropbox and
LinkedIn have reported cyber attacks
that have compromised users information
and passwords this is why we created
passport it's a security device that
allows you to generate store and use
unique and secure passwords for all the
services act and devices you use
passport is small enough that you can
comfortably carry it in your pocket or
purse along with your keys passport is
easy to set up and simple to use it can
connect to your devices via USB or
Bluetooth and it's recognized
automatically on all major platforms
here's how you use your passport first
access your passport by entering your
master key
the only password you'll ever have to
remember then access the login screen of
the service you'd like to use on your
preferred device finally browse your
passport for the appropriate account and
select it passport will automatically
log in to your account
say goodbye to using unsecure passwords
and having to remember any of them ever
again should it fall into the wrong
hands top 4 incorporates several
security mechanisms to protect your
privacy it encrypts your data using the
same encryption algorithm the US
government uses to protect top-secret
information our free synchronization app
also allows you to create and store an
encrypted copy of your accounts for easy
recovery in case of loss or theft

learn CA quality products in a
reasonable arrival time for the market
therefore we intercept work with your
help we'll be able to cover the initial
setup and certification path and also
for the median production volume
necessary for passport to reach 3-1 and
at affordable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
