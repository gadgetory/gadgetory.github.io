blade precision machined stainless steel
internal parts and solid CNC machined
aluminum handles this modern version of
a classic tool delivers true
craftsmanship to today's woodworker one
of a couple innovations includes a
simple blade pre tension adjustment and
improved handle design for blade
tightening instead of the classic little
tab type the new wood peckers bevel
square has a vice-like handle that
delivers increased leverage and better
clearance woodpeckers bevel squares come
in a 7-inch and larger 12-inch size the
smaller 7-inch version is perfect for
many cabinet and furniture making
projects when working with wider boards
or even carpentry projects the 12 inch
size delivers the necessary capacity set
your angles perfectly with wood peckers
new angle reference plate on one side of
the 3 by 16 by quarter inch thick
aluminum plate is engraved angle
reference lines from 0
to 30 degrees and on the other side from
31 to 55 degrees all in quarter degree
increments the widely spaced
easy-to-read lines are differentiated
with solid lines four whole degrees
dashed lines four half degrees and
dotted lines four quarter degrees the
whole lines are also marked with three
angles the main angle when perpendicular
is zero as well as the related acute and
obtuse angles depending on what edge of
the plate the handles up against
woodpeckers new angle reference plate
gives you a quick and reliable starting
point for easily setting or reading your
beveled Square every time whether you
are transferring the angle of a miter
joint or in sidewall corner woodpeckers
high quality of american-made bevel
square is the ideal tool to use to do
the job right
it's called the trim puller and that's
exactly what it excels at doing the trim
polar by zenith Industries was designed
to remove wood trim without damaging
either the wood or the walls the ground
bevel on the edge allows the tool to be
easily driven between the trim and wall
the integrated center wedge then
continues to separate the materials in
some cases this wedging action alone is
enough to complete the job the trim
polar is designed to be leveraged side
to side because of the wide contact area
and greater leveraging effect trim
removal goes faster while wall surfaces
remain undamaged the tool quickly easily
and safely removes shoe molding
baseboard chair railing and door casings
it's ideally suited for lifting carpet
tack strip and edging the trim puller
can also be used for prying off molding
from decorative panels or doors without
the risk of damaging either it's also
quite effective at removing ceramic tile
the integrated center wedge combined
with the tools wide surface area enable
it to quickly pop tile away from the
surface beneath the trim polar can be
used as a temporary shim when leveling
base cabinets or for prying off cabinet
counter tops that have been glued or
nailed in place it even comes in handy
when replacing damaged floor planks

Becker's equal space divider takes the
math out of the job by instantly
positioning six lines equidistant from
each other at any spacing between
three-quarter and four inches based on
the mathematical theory of the
parallelogram the equal space divider
works by moving perpendicular to the
space line meaning you can draw a
crosshatch instead of just a point once
you have the spacing locked in you can
repeat the pattern as many times as
needed for your project
constructed out of 301 fullhart
stainless the equal space divider comes
in a custom cut protective case along
with one of our handy 0.9 millimeter
mechanical pencils the equal space
