let's be honest upgrading your home is
hard home automation should be easy but
today's products are difficult to
install and use that's why we created
switch mate switch may turns your
current light switch into a smart switch
simply install it with a snap and
control it from your phone or what's
Happ simple right switch mate attaches
with magnets which means no rewiring or
modifying your switches perfect if
you're renting or on the move with
switch mate you can set timers for your
lights to come on when you're away from
home it's simple to control any device
powered by a light switch for the
additional ability to control your
lights from anywhere an optional hub can
be added and finally the comfort of
knowing that you never have to come home
to a dark house again so let's make our
home smarter one switch at a time
starting with yours
we worked hard over the past year to
makes which made a reality but smart
lighting is just the beginning we want
to create a suite of products that are
extremely simple to use and our users
can take right out of the box and
install in seconds by backing us you're
joining our mission of making home
automation simple
Alexa turn on the kitchen
for thousands of years humans have been
filling their notebooks and then just
buying more say the notebook industry
has given up on innovation hey what's
this
the notebook Hemingway wrote on that's
cool I guess we're from rocket book and
we make notebooks from the future
at rocket book we are already famous for
inventing the wave notebook the smart
notebook that can be erased in the
microwaves we've shipped 100,000 waves
to satisfied customers around the world
others may stop there but we are maniacs
obsessed with blending old fashioned
notebooks with future and awesome so
we've spent a year in the rocket lab
designing a new notebook that appeals
like pen and paper but is endlessly
reusable and completely integrated with
your digital lifestyle
introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast brings cloud
scalability to pen and paper simply
write scan and a race
imagine one thousand of your favorite
notebooks in one sleek design that fits
in your backpack here's how it works
Everlast pages look &amp;amp; feel like paper
but they're actually constructed from a
polyester composite rather than would
you write on the Everlast using any pen
from the pilot FriXion line which are
available in-store and online writing on
the Everlast feels perfectly natural and
smooth and as the ink dries it forms a
complete bond to the polyester page so
it won't rub off but what makes this
formulation so unique is that each page
can be wiped completely clean with a
moist towel so it can be used over and
over and over again the ever last
notebook is also compatible with the
Rocket book app so before you wipe your
notes off the page you can blast them
online
to your favorite cloud services in a
fraction of a second rocket book machine
vision scans enhances and sends each
page to the specific destination they
belong on the cloud services you already
use
each Everlast notebook page has seven
symbols set up the rocket book app to
assign each symbol to a location within
Dropbox Google Docs Evernote or many
other services you could configure your
diamond to send meeting notes directly
to your shared team folder in Dropbox or
students could configure their star
symbol to send notes right to a math
folder in Google Drive so you can make
your list break out that diagram or
color in that drawing then tomorrow
start your day with a brand new notebook
with the ever last one notebook becomes
one thousand notebooks the utility of
the cloud and the joy of pen and paper
that's rocket book
