every day millions of people all around
the world to use dry erase whiteboards
but taking notes or photos is not the
easiest way to save and share and they
don't work well remotely or with
videoconferencing cap TiVo is a new
accessory that transforms any regular
whiteboard into an online collaboration

evolved during your meeting and when
you're done you can download and share
the whole meeting as a multi-page
presentation all with no need to replace
the whiteboards you have clear simple
and smart Captiva
my first impression of the tick wise
tool is it fits great and it looks good
on my wrist each little point that you
touch it's very specific and I like how
it goes from being a traditional type
function looking down at it to really
being able to interact with it my first
impression was that it was a neat watch
but outside of that I didn't really know
that I'd explore the functionality or
get to use it in the real world
normally I wouldn't consider answering
any phone calls while I'm riding my bike
but with the tick watch - you just flip
your wrists twice
answer the call flip another two times
and hang it up it tracks my workouts and
it fits with my lifestyle I'm not really
what you call tech savvy but the tick
watch - it's been really easy to use
okay Tico we want sushi I can ask it to
find a nearby restaurant and it shows
the rating and the review and how far
away it is whenever I want to go for a
run I can always track all of my fitness
goals on it it's really important for me
to be able to track how I want to do my
workout if I want to use it by calories
or with distance or based on my heart
rate I was really impressed with how
convenient it was the scheduled tasks to
meetings responded my voice commands
very easily okay to go schedule a
meeting with Bob Williams for 7:00 a.m.
tomorrow I thought was pretty awesome
that you call an uber by just saying :
Eber into your watch and it would
request one for you it's great to be
able to focus on the tasks I had at hand
instead of having to check my phone all
the time I receive the texts I simply
glance in the watch I can dismiss it
until I'm ready to reply later you know
I don't see how I've really been able to
function without it it's really helped
me be more efficient it's made my life a
lot easier when it comes to my workouts
or even just my daily life okay Tico
house of weather when I'm selecting a
watch it actually matters to me how it
looks it's cute I like it overall I was
really impressed with the tick box -
it's fast its intuitive
it recognizes my voice faster than the
other SmartWatch I've ever seen so I get
to keep this right
[Laughter]
