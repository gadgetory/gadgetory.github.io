excellence for future cities and to be
transformed into the world's smartest
city
the Roads and Transport Authority in
Dubai RTA adoption of autonomous
vehicles technology reflects the dubai
smart autonomous mobility strategy which
aims to transform 25% of the city's mass
transit system to autonomous driving to
enhance people's well-being and
happiness and strengthen Dubai's
reputation as a hub of innovation
technology and the future
to achieve that RTA has announced the
signing of an agreement with the German
below copter company a specialist
manufacturer of autonomous air vehicles
to launch the world's first autonomous
air taxi
AAT capable of transporting up to two
passengers
the AAT is characterized by its
autonomous flight this enables the
movement of people from place to place
without human intervention or the need
for a flight license
powered by electricity the a eighties
design of 18 rotors ensure safe cruising
and landing of the taxi in the event of
any rotor failure
the a eighties trial run will begin in
the final quarter of this year the trial
operation and certification program will
continue for five years RTA will work
with the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority
to develop the world's first AAT
legislative and operational guidelines
our TA is steadily marching towards the
future by implementing the latest
autonomous driving technology to
establish Dubai's position as the city
of the future
Roads and Transport Authority we keep
Dubai moving introducing Coppa an
innovative 3d printer designed to give
you an experience like never before by
creators for creators Coppa is the
world's first 3d printer utilizing the
Scott Russell straight line mechanism
used in pick-and-place robotics this
precision technology guarantees quality
consistently our proprietary design
feature is the linear movement of the
nozzle to the bed the result a large
build volume with the small footprint
print more with less the modular design
requires simple assembly and can be
completed in a few minutes this
modularity keeps kapa compact for easy
storage the customized mold and CNC
milling process used to produce the
aluminum unibody tower ensures our
technical specifications are met exactly
every time incorporating a detachable
bed make sprint removal effortless and
has eliminated the need to recalibrate
the machine after each use working out
of the National University of Singapore
we have been developing coppa for over a
year each iteration was driven by our
focus to achieve accuracy and
reliability
have worked with our manufacturers and
suppliers to produce our prototypes on
the actual machinery using the final
materials so that our transition to
full-scale production is seamless our
design for manufacturing and assembly
approach is to provide flow on benefits
for production delivery and customer
experience we are now ready to share
Coppa with you with our OEMs on standby
we need your support to make Coppa a
reality experience something new
experienced Coppa back us on Kickstarter
today
Oh
two years ago I left France to research
robotics at MIT in Boston but now she'll
say she was staying in France behind I
really thought that he was romantic
actually because the event wait for his
girlfriend I went back home with this
and when I gave it to her she loved it
everybody here in the team has one goal
create happiness for the end-user
what if technology could help create
happiness and bring people closer
together when you see the earth spinning
meaning that this special person's
thought of you you already know that you
received some love it's a little totem
that you have at home
I've been thinking about the and many
people said I want to use it with my
children
I want to use it with my grandma
you know that there is a lock box
somewhere connected to your
it's encouraging you to send some love
the wooden box the electroni ball the
hearts and the final assembling it's all
made in France
you really want to build a bridge
between ecology and happiness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
