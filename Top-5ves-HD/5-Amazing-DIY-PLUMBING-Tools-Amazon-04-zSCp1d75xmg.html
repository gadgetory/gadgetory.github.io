tool and you get a consistent expansion
every time and you're confident with
your joints and it helps you move faster
the Milwaukee expansion tool does
provide a consistent expansion on all
the way around inside the pipe the tool
itself when it expands and it does auto
rotate it doesn't allow a seam to be
built in to the pipe which when it would
constrict back would actually leave
solid rigid pipe where it didn't expand
it but where the Milwaukee expansion
tool when you pull it out what they'll
turn and it takes away that seam which
makes it consistent all the way around
inside and it grabs onto that barbed
fitting much nicer it seals much better
it's pretty foolproof
you're just holding a tool in the
stationary position and the expander
does all the work for you you obviously
can do more fittings and you don't have
to worry about it not expanding them
properly because it's very consistent so
it saves time money you can take them
put them on your lip and just go right
to the next job job to job the job
fitting to fitting and it's just that
much faster if you're using in a
tabletop position
you can work all day it's a lot easier
and your body is less stressful you're
not carrying it around stands up on its
own and if you have awkward fittings to
prefab but you could do it all day long
after I've used the Milwaukee expansion
tool I do feel very confident because it
has been put together with great
craftsmanship when it turns and auto
rotates the expansion is going to be
consistent on every fitting no matter
what you do with the Milwaukee expansion
tool with the automated rotate it makes
it so much simpler to do and it's what
you're looking for I think it's
excellent
I think they exceeded my introducing the
