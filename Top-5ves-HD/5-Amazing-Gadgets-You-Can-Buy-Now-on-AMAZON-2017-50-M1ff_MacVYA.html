experience I've been using a chair
outside of the house since 1992 I tire
really easily so going up any sort of
slope in the obstruction wears me out
even more what I love about loot wheels
is I don't have to put so much effort in
to move myself I don't need to be pushed
by so many people anymore and I can do
it myself
and that's what it's all about it gives
me the independence that I want my
name's Bob Briggs and I'm a former
Paralympian and GB sledge ice hockey
captain I think the main benefit of loot
wheels has been able to put more power
and drive through the actual wheels
themselves it was actually lived in the
front casters off in the first instance
with a suspension element within the
wheel allows you to control over rough
terrain and actually stops the
wheelchair from jolting around and being
uncontrollable so it does give that
little bit more control I do trust the
wheels I think there is a very clear
difference when you first try loop
wheels to a standard wheel
in that you do have the built-in
suspension and they do actually move a
little bit more that confidence in trust
is soon built up hi my name's Sam pace
I'm the inventor of lube wheels back in
2013 you helped us get a bike wheel to
production since then been working hard
on a bigger wheel chair wheel
we now need your help to get this the
first production of this wheel out
Annabelle
the biggest challenge in going from the
20-inch wheel to the to the larger 24 25
inch wheel is the lateral stiffness of
the wheel the lots of testing it fires
at the wheelchair users want very stiff
Springs with only a little bit of
movement we've had absolutely fantastic
feedback from people who've been
trialing our loop wheels for wheelchairs
I honestly believe that these wheels can
make a real difference to people's lives
that's something very close to my heart
and I really want your help to get these
wheels out to people who need them it
would be great if people could support
this campaign for luke wheels not just
for the individual but their attendants
and carers as well the thrill that I get
from using these means that I don't have
to worry so much about have to fight so
much and other people are going to get a
similar benefit so your prezi's are
really gonna help us to get our wheel
production up and running and get our
wheels out there and improve people's
lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
