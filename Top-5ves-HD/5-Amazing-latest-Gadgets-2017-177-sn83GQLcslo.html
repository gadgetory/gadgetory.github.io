daily action we performed since
childhood experts recommend washing
teeth after each mill and brushing for
at least three minutes but honestly who
really doesn't and who bothers always
performing the right movements both
manual and electric toothbrushes have
been the same for decades often in a
hurry we brush our teeth mistakenly
which overtime forces us to turn towards
expensive and painful visits to the
dentist have you ever thought you could
brush your teeth perfectly in just three
seconds it's time to change your habits
for the better with an eco
towels are one of those things that we
use every single day
unfortunately towels get wet and they in
warm steamy bathrooms which turns out is
the ideal breeding ground for bacteria
and fungus but why are we cleaning up
just to dry off with a musty towel that
hasn't been washed in days introducing
Silvan towels so on towels combined soft
absorbent organic cotton with pure
silver to naturally eliminate bacterial
growth on your entire towel the result a
towel that never gets musty
requires less laundry and can provide
critical benefits to your skin and
health silver is one of our planet's
most remarkable materials it naturally
carries a positive charge that has
attracted the bacteria destroying it
before it has the chance to reproduce so
we thought why not use silver to improve
something we all use every day our
microfibers are carefully coated with
pure silver and proven to eliminate up
to 99% of bacteria these silver fibers
are then twisted with the softest
organic cotton we could find to create a
super plush self-cleaning - home from
beautiful design to material sourcing we
set out to create a towel that looks and
feels as great as it performs our
organic cotton is soft absorbent and the
perfect fit for sensitive skin unlike
similar products all of our designs rely
entirely on natural materials we don't
use any harsh chemicals or treatments
and because the silver is woven right
into our fabrics the antimicrobial
properties will last a lifetime
last year Kickstarter help bring Silvan
bedsheets to life so we're super excited
to expand our products into something
else that we all use every day all we
need is your help to bring this product
to life
so stop drying off with dirty towels and
make the switch to Sivan the only towels
that stay clean thanks to pure natural
silver

would you ever carry gesture pencil no
sharpener no case for days months
probably not right pencils need support
this is why I create the pencil plus
when your pencil eventually breaks the
pencil Plus is your sharpener
the pencil plus is your extender making
your shortest stubs feel brand new the
pencil plus is most importantly your
transporter making sure your pencil
always arrives sharp carry a pencil for
days or months with the pencil plus he
now can i grew up drawing days were lost
my sketchbook
drawing was and still is the ultimate
freedom you can draw anything you want
one night in 2013 my pencil broke I
spent the next 20 minutes trying to find
the sharpener as I own I got nowhere
grabbed my kitchen knife this wasn't the
first time either
I was determined to change that I've
worked to develop the pencil plus for
the past three years it all started with
a simple sketch then creating the Alpha
prototype while studying in 2015
spending the next two years developing
the metal final design depends of + now
features an improved sharpener and
replaceable blades the pencil plus will
be available in aluminum while if we hit
our goals brass will be unlocked
packaging has been a big consideration I
want the packaging to look good while
being completely purposeful I got the
pencil plus up to here I draw every
chance I get I love it and I think you
will too
if you really love drawing with wooden
pencils the pencil plus has been
designed for you I want to solve the
focus on what we are drawing unless with
the challenges of her pencil
an investment to last your lifetime no
extra cases no active sharpeners or
extenders to carry just you your
sketchbook and your pencil Plus thank
you in advance for all those I've been
so patiently awaiting the launch and for
all those I've been actively a part of
it I couldn't have done it without you
thank you so much I'm so happy that can
finally offer this to everyone let's get
up there and let's draw something
amazing Retina shields required three
minutes of counting over negative
unwritten the shield's switch to backup
power immediately problem is obvious men
carry certain items every day and
everywhere they go but do not have
enough pockets for them well there are a
lot of laptop bags on the market most
are too big for EDC only the more space
you make available the more stuff you'll
end up carrying small items get easily
lost and disorganized fitting in between
a holster and a laptop bag bolster fills
a sweet spot in the bag market for men
bolster is a small carry EDC bag that is
perfectly sized and minimal it is
designed for your smartphone wallet
