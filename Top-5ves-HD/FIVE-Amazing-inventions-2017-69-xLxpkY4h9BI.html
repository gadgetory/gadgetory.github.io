as we refine the design over the past
year we never lost our focus on creating
a product that is lightweight and ultra
portable we applied human factors
engineering to ensure monkey bars fit
perfectly in the human hand
our earth-friendly finish protects the
wood and preserves the wild we developed
an incredibly strong system built around
an aerospace grade aluminum core and a
hard maple grip each bar contains 18

designers product engineers athletes and
climbers that all share love of the

connect and share to listen to our
favorite music and to watch our favorite
videos so how come we never seem to have
a charging cable when we need one
maybe it's because our phones are
portable but our long and bulky charging
cables are not well now there's a new
class of charging cable introducing
lifelink by plus us the world's thinnest
ultra portable cable finally charging on
the go is easy and stress-free because
taking lifelink with you is as simple as
tucking it in your wallet slipping it
into your purse or handbag or putting it
on your keyring so wherever you find a
USB port in an airport or hotel room on
your laptop or gaming console in your
car on the back of your TV
your life link will always be there to
keep you charged and connected
