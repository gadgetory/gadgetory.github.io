we are so low stove since 2011 we've
been making super efficient wood burning
backpacking and camping stoves our
unique patented design doesn't require
any bulky batteries or fans all you need
is a handful of twigs or sticks year
after year we enjoy interacting with the
growing number of solo stove users we're
grateful that they trust our products
enough to take with them on their most
memorable adventures we believe that
time spent outdoors with family and
friends can create some of life's most
precious and meaningful moments but with
our lives becoming busier and busier
spending time with those we care about
is becoming more difficult so we're
making it easier for you to spend more
time with family and friends outdoors
introducing the solo stove bonfire a
backyard fire pit like you've never seen
before the bonfire uses the same
patented design and technology as our
other solo stopes but it's her largest
model yet it's designed with unique
double wall which allows air flow
through the bottom poles of the bonfire
to channel air to the bottom of the fire
and up between the walls this preheated
air allows the fire to burn more
complete which results in a more
efficient fire with very little smoke a
more efficient burn means you'll get
more fire from your logs compared to an
open fire pit the bonfire is super
durable made out of premium 304
stainless steel and is backed by a
lifetime guarantee
we can't wait to bring the soothing
ambience the dancing flames and the
rustic smell of a glowing campfires
