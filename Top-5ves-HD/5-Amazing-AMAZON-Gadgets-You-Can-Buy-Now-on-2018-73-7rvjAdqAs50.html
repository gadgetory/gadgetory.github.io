imagine adding an electric wheel to your
bike travel point of 50 miles on a
single charge at all when you want said
back when you don't he'll no sweat it's
500 watts of power available at the
press of a lever easy to install and
intuitive to operate designed in
Cambridge Massachusetts and built in New
England
two years ago I was watching Tron
thinking about all that empty space
inside the orbital wheel really kept me
up at night why don't we put a motor
where we put a battery in that space I
managed to make a mini prototype but I
basically have two left tongues and a
limited knowledge of engineering 18
months ago I was working as a propulsion
development engineer at SpaceX when I
met Mike and saw the gyah orbital wheel
prototype I loved the concept and one of
the helped make it a reality
since then we've created five
generations of prototypes given hundreds
of test rides and logged thousands of
miles from all that user feedback we've
integrated all sorts of features into
the wheel installation takes only 60
seconds and requires no tools the
battery is easily removable even the
tires are made of high-density foam they
ride just like a normal tire but they'll
never go flat the motor will take you
zero to 20 miles an hour in six seconds
the feature set goes on and on we've
only just got rolling
this is forum card handy pocket-sized
card of meltable bioplastic that you can
use to make fix and modify the world
around you you can mold it quickly and
simply to make little solutions to
everyday problems
when it school is really strong like
nylon so you can make solid durable
solutions with it
and then you can reheat it again and
again to adapt and change and reuse it
because it's handy card size you can
keep one in your pocket wallet kitchen
drawer or toolbox so that it's there
whenever and wherever it's needed and
because you know it melts in a cup of
hot water that might be in a cafe to fix
a broken umbrella all around a campfire
to fix broken tentpole it's strong
enough for quick solutions to emergency
situations like when you've forgotten a
tool for a job or handle grates on
something
plastic has got a bit of a bad name it's
associated with a cheap disposable world
in which things break easily and then
end up in the bin for card is the
opposite of that world when it's very
hot it sticks to other plastics so you
can actually use it to instantly fix
things say a plastic shovel when you're
on holiday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
