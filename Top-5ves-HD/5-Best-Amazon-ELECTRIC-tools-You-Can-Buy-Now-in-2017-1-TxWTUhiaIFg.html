productivity with client tools
magnetizer quickly and easily magnetize
your screwdrivers and bits to hold your
fasteners on the tip of your screwdriver
and get the job done fast no batteries
required it uses powerful rare earth
magnets to provide a fast strong
long-lasting charge it's easy insert the
shaft fully into the top slot avoid
rotating the shaft as you draw it out
slowly to demagnetize insert the shaft
into the smallest fitting
demagnetization slot near the bottom
again avoid rotating the shaft as you
draw it out slowly it fits a wide
assortment of tips from precision sizes
up to number-3 phillips and a quarter
inch slotted with a square shank this
compact tool with a very strong magnet
is great to have on hand when you need a
magnetized screwdriver or demagnetize
when you want to keep the screwdriver
tips free of metal shavings for
convenience it easily attaches to your
tool bag or backpack with a stainless
steel keyring just double tap to
activate the Taser another stunning idea
of yours seriously now look here the re6
from our friends at rigid one tool three
interchangeable heads
let's putting your heads together wires
cut nubs crypt
boxes punched
they're all three heads and the tool are
handy in this single case you will have
power up in time to disrupt the missile
watch I said hurry up or we'll miss
lunch cut wire crimp plugs in punch
electrical boxes with climb tools is
proud to introduce the NC b t2 dual
range non-contact voltage tester the NCP
t2 is designed to detect and indicate
both standard voltage between 48 and
1,000 volts ac and low voltage between
12 and 48 volts ac unlike competitive
non-contact voltage testers the NC b t2
can detect between the two ranges
automatically when the blue LED light is
illuminated the NC b t2 is in dual range
mode and can automatically detect both
standard and low voltages the NC b t2
indicates low voltage with the low
pitched beeping tone and blinking red
LED light a steady red LED light and low
pitched beeping tone indicates the
tester is detecting standard voltage the
NC b t2 can be switched into NC b t1
mode which detects standard voltage only
after powering the unit on press and
hold the power button until the blue LED
light turns to green again the NC b t2
will produce a low pitched beeping tone
and steady red LED light when standard
voltage is detected in addition the
power on blue or green LED visually
confirms battery sufficiency system
integrity and active NC b t mode and the
high-intensity light is great for
illuminating workspaces the n CV t2 is
also equipped with a silent mode
function which is useful in noise
sensitive environments like hospitals to
activate silent mode
make sure the tester is powered off then
press and hold the power button until
the LED light illuminates no audible
indication should be heard the NC b t2
uses standard 1.5 volt triple-a
batteries and is equipped with an auto
power off feature to conserve battery
life introducing the Hammerhead driver
the world's first powered screwdriver
with
patented circuit sensor built in voltage
detection to help keep you safe around
electricity the Hammerhead drivers
compact lithium-ion battery allows you
to work faster longer and charges with
any microUSB car
it's non-contact live wire detector
alerts you to electric currents and
outlets switches and fixtures
while the built in wire stripper and
wire bender save you time and steps -
and with Bic rip your screw stay
attached so you can work with one hand
the Southwire simple fish tape provides
a faster easier way to push and pull
fish tapes to EMT and PVC conduit the
low friction spiral extruded polymer
allows the tape to easily glide through
conduit without binding it turns joints
or couplings the simple fish tapes are
kink and break resistant combining the
strength of a steel faced tape with
greater flexibility than fiberglass fish
tapes the non conductive material is
also rust resistant and will not deform
when bent like other fish tape materials
these fish tapes are lightweight and
greatly reduce user fatigue and downtime
on the job due to fish tape breakage the
simple fish tape features two different
leaders on various models the flexible
metal leaders with a swiveling tip
allows the fish tape to roll off turns
and continue moving without binding in
tight radius turns the fish tapes also
feature a non conductive
glow-in-the-dark leader making the fish
tape non conductive from end to end
allowing for easy installation over
existing wires simple fish tapes are a
must-have for any professional
electrical contractor pushing or pulling
wire or cable through conduit
