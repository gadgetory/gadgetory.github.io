I've always loved writing the feeling of
being one with the road until your
headphones fall
I see deal with this all the time I'd be
riding earbuds on in the zone and then
all of a sudden it was like somebody
turned up the wind noise 211 when Eman
told me about this I knew exactly what
he was going through there were so many
times when my earbuds would fall out I'd
miss a call while riding but I couldn't
hear anything was on highway I knew
there had to be a better product out
there for riders so we looked and looked
and looked nothing we immediately
decided to solve this problem once and
for all we wanted to create the best set
of earbuds for riders what we came up
with is one of the most unique designs
this space has ever seen introducing
slim buds slim bots are ear buds
designed with the rider in mind sitting
flush with the ear you'll never have to
worry about your helmet interfering with
your listening experience ever again and
with strategic microphone placement your
calls will always be crystal clear
without having to worry about windows
we've built slim BOTS with passive noise
isolation technology allowing for the
most immersive audio experience you've
ever had while riding at us safety is
very important to us as good as our slim
bud sound we are equally focused on
keeping you safe while riding inside the
chin mic there's a secondary microphone
dedicated to picking up and relaying
environmental noise this means that
you'll hear horns sirens and anything
else you need to hear while riding if
riding in a pack is more your speed we
know how important communication can be
use the eos app to add your friends to
your chat now you can talk to them with
just the push of a button using the slim
remote our Wireless handlebar controller
the slim remote connects via bluetooth
and allows you to control your audio
make phone calls and activate voice
commands all while riding
are you ready for the best audio
experience you've ever had while riding

butts to the market thank you

it's all about balance between walking
and flying between the body and the
machine to the fun and safety we all
know about hoverboards there are soda in
a millions last year
some say you'll soon be one of the main
means of bulky transportation it could
be if it's done the right way if we find
the right balance that's what I told the
engineers are receiving a small team
enthuses that has become the world
leader hub for technologies the patents
are totally first generation of
hoverboards was fun but it lacked
precision someone produced by amateurs
who gave this great invention a bad
reputation
a totem let's make it more fun more
precise and absolutely safe
revolutionising
I think they heard they were introduced
with the inventor
take it slow because I'm a girl
no because you're beginners safety first
that's low the PI's unique in many ways
which is design a sleeping smooth
pleasant to the eye may be pleasant to
the touch a specific shape makes it
awesome aerodynamic and very sturdy as
elegant and a solid as a circle we had
to call upon but hold on the chic class
I just cute
it goes up to 7 miles per hour and climb
15 degrees slope easy as a turning
radius of 0 feet and a range over 15
minutes and all that control thanks to
the slip-resistant redesign footprints
you can change them any color you want
I like are the most precise AI driven
pressure sensors on the market you can
have fun in dust sand and yes
the cheek pie is wonderful so we got the
look the power the fun what about the
safety this is what our dedicated team
worked the hardest a few remaining
happiness this is the traditional
mainframe made of two parts a nice
deacon solid aluminum cylinder is the by
enabling mainframe

bus and an exclusive PI battery no wires
