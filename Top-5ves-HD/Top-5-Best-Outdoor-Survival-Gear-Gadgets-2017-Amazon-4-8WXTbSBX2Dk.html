I love going outdoors staying connected
with great Mother Nature and staying
connected with family and friends I love
sharing my adventures but I've realized
that it's really hard to get access to
electricity to stay connected outdoors
the thing is today's mobile devices use
significantly less power than
traditional consumer electronics so one
day I came up with the idea what if we
could convert every energy resource into
personal power I want to introduce you
to e stream it's a portable water
powered generator it converts any type
of running water into stored energy you
can get personal on-demand power with
nothing but water energy this is how it
works
remove the cover unfold the turbines and
lock them
hook and release eastream into running
water let it spin freely to generate
electricity and it charges the built-in
battery it takes approximately 4.5 hours
to fully charge one
eastream which can charge up to three
smartphones GoPros or tablet PCs two
times faster than charging through an
outlet
you can also use it as a lantern with
four different modes even underwater
eastream works well even in wheat
current for behind a kayak and
regardless of the weather or time of day
it fits perfectly into any sized
backpack it's ideal for use while you
enjoy camping fishing kayaking biking or
any other outdoor activities we didn't
start it just to charge a smartphone at
the campsite we wanted to provide a
personal on demand energy our goal is to
discover every energy resource around
you and convert them into your own power
we've been working hard to get here to
meet you
our journey has just begun please join
us in our adventure let's embark on this
journey together to stay connected as
one
