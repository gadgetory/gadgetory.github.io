mountain I use Highline here's how it
works put your iPhone into the Highline

the tap the slim case is made of impact
resistant polycarbonate and textured for
an improved grip the leash is made with
grated Kevlar meaning it's thin but
tough and it stretches so you can easily
access your iPhone letting you take
calls check in with your friends record
video and of course take selfies all
