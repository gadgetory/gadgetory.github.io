Kickstarter's I'm Bill Mitchell and I
want to show you something you
definitely haven't seen before
great beer I know you've seen great beer
before but I brewed this one myself took
less than an hour of my time and I
brewed it at the touch of a button the
innovation that made that possible a
pika brews I'm addict the world's first
fully automatic all grain beer brewing
system
the biggest reason people probably stop
homebrewing is because it just became
too time-consuming into the Boreas for
them there's no heart in scrubbing out a
kettle there's no art and sitting in
front of a crab cooker and reading a
book
we started envisioning ways to improve
the quality and the consistency of the
beer and the entire process in effect
what we have done is invented technology
that provides the quality and
repeatability of large-scale brewery but
we shrink it down the countertop size
it is essentially an espresso maker for
beer
so you'd load up malted barley hops and
water you dial a recipe that controls
very specific temperatures and
automation throughout the process and
then you can walk away you come back in
about three and a half hours and the
water that started in your keg has been
magically converted as soon as you
ferment it it's beer so it logs the data
while you're brewing and it also allows
you to create recipes so that you get
precise repeatable beer every time the
process was great you set it and forget
it rather than have to stand outside for
four or five hours making beer the
average home brew the most time you
spend on anything is cleaning and prep
time the cleaning is super simple you
pull out the drawer and just lap in the
dishwasher
nothing is quite what the peekaboo
system is
we're excited about the picker brews I'm
addict because there's a lot of value in
there for commercial breweries testing
the quality of the grains and the
quality of the hops the amount of time
that we can save using this is
incredible I mean it basically allows us
to do the pilot breeze that we can't fit
into our our big brew system it's pretty
cool machine dialed in and put
incredible engineering having our own
machine shop lets us have design and
test cycles on the order of hours
instead of weeks working with the same
vendors from prototype to production
makes the design better with every
iteration our recipe crafter makes it
easy to create perfect beer batches
exactly to your own specifications and
what people can do with this machine is
it is filling the gap that's been
between home brewing and commercial
brewing because a home brewing setting
was not allowing you to control those
variables as tight as you can on the
Pico brew people have been wanting to do
this but this is the first time I've
actually seen it been done tied together
with the technology of temperature
control and timing the computer
integration the recipe sharing and the
ease of brewing so I think that's what I
saw about this that excited me filling
that gap is really important and I feel
like that has a huge value and will help
a lot of home brewers make better beer
I was always an early advocate for
technology in craft brewing this is the
next step the craft brewers addressed
small audiences but not down to
individual human tastes of one or two
individuals this does that's a
breakthrough now home brewing has the
potential to cover the entire waterfront
of beer production that's what this does
and there is nothing like it
with the Picaro cymatic we've invented
the easiest way to craft your own great
all grain beer but we need your support
please pledge today and join the picot
brewing revolution
you
you
you
life is full of amazing moments you
capture it all on your phone but now you
can own those moments with print the
first ever photo printing case for your
phone just connect the case to your
phone and get quality photo prints
anytime anywhere but there's more hand
the photos to your friends and they can
scan them and bring them to life each
free
peel and stick paper that will make you
the life of any party on the moment with
print the instant photo printer that
brings your memories to life
we're the creators of airdog the world's
first autoflow action sports drone this
aerial camera gives sports performers
the solution they've been needing
incredible footage with unbelievable
ease and accuracy
hi I'm Edgar I'm going to show you
something that changes how actions falls
into this capture the most epic moments
we're a group of innovators who are
passionate about action sports we use
gopro cameras to capture our own sports
action until now you needed somebody to
follow you around and to film you but
the performance never looked as good as
it actually felt that's about to change
action sports deserve the explosive
power of mind-blowing action shots
aerial perspective and super smooth slow
motion
we're ready to show the world what it's
all about
take this airdog is a quadcopter that
automatically follows the rider and
captures the action using a GoPro camera
airdog fives and follows making sure
that your every move is perfectly
captured a dog follows the rider by
tricking the arish a release sends
control commands and tracking signal to
the drill
why can find yourself two stationary
videos or a ground level perspective the
air dog takes things to a whole new
level it's a totally hassle-free way to
get unreal footage
you don't need remote control skills you
don't need to operate the drone you just
need to concentrate on your best
performance air dog does the rest
put the air leash on your wrist or
helmet turn the air dog and remote on
press takeoff and you're done let the
games begin air dog is now in action
you can make any necessary altitude
adjustments or set the distance and
angle and you're good to go
more advanced features like track or lap
recording or specific flight modes can
be configured or uploaded from a
smartphone app
it doesn't matter what I'm doing
skating surfing snowboarding or even
filming my indie movie air dog is right
there it's like my personal cameraman
you don't have to worry about framing
the shots or getting the right angle air
dog has a gyro-stabilized gimbal that
will do everything for you it's never
been this easy to look this good on
camera
our engineers developers and designers
have done everything to launch the
production of the initial batch of air
dogs we have it we use it already and
now we need your help to launch this
awesomeness into the world of action
sports this will change the way action
sports are captured you can be the first
owners of the air dog whatever your
passion air dog is in the moment whether
you're craving insane aerial shots or 30
mile-per-hour downhill speed motion you
simply can't get footage like this any
other way
air dog lets you show the world what you
care about how you kick ass and what
extreme sports are all about we're
looking for backers who share our
passion our enthusiasm and our thirst
for adventure so here it is the air dog
we have it we use it and we want it to
become available for you that's why we
are in Kickstarter with your support of
air dog will achieve perfection and
launch production so the future of air
dogs is now in your hands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
