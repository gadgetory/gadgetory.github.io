hi I'm Wroclaw the inventor of trunking
the original ride on suitcase for
globe-trotting tiles four years ago we
set off on a journey to create the
ultimate luggage for teens and create
something we think has much wider field
journey is a carry-on suitcase for the
next generation of connected travelers
the cabinet style storage and adjustable
dividing shelf offers flexibility or
protected in a durable hard plastic
shell find what you want when you want
it the portable pod keeps your
essentials close to hand pop it and go
create your own space on the go and
immerse yourself back into the digital
world glide on through q busting just
got easier the removable pod is made
from a durable plastic composite with a
splash proof seal the inline and pollen
on wheels are custom designed skate
wheels with smooth gliding ball bearings
designed for longevity with simple to
fit spare parts which will also provide
future upgradeability trunki took off
because no luggage solution really met
the needs of parents and children our
journey started with two simple
observations young people love their
tech and they're constantly glued to
their mobiles with mini tablets when
traveling they also crave their space
and independence we wanted to solve
these insights by using classic product
design not throwing in gizmos and
gadgets and building an app for that
which would just drive up complexity in
cost we collaborated with
industry-leading engineers to create a
super strong but incredibly light
structure we call it the IV and its
patented design can take up to 220
pounds of sitting wait we built tons of
prototypes and lined out all the
technical challenges while styling its
form to be both streamlined and
functional designing a product to be
really cool really intuitive yet fully
manufacturable
my team has successfully bought loads of
award-winning products to market where a
design-led business with a passionate
about making family travel easier with
our pioneering travel products I
launched trunki nine years ago on the
lse TV but left dragons den that shark
tank to our American cousins
empty-handed and humiliated but the
public sore throat were hugely
supportive and the overwhelming backing
allowed me to sell over two and half
million trunk ease by backing us on
IndieGoGo you'll get one of the very
first journey suitcases to hit the
market you'll have also helped influence
future product developments and together
we'll be able to make every journey
Febreze journey it's your face flying on
a paper airplane must be so magical with
your help magical is about to become
un-freakin'-believable this is shai a
pilot an industrial designer and an
inventor he is a world known expert in
cool stuff that flies two years ago shy
was challenged by his friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
thanks to 21,000 backers on Kickstarter
he made it happen people all over the
world are now controlling paper planes
from their smartphones with power of
three I proudly came back to his friend
and his friend said wow that is magical
but you can't put a live streaming
camera on a paper airplane shy thought
for a minute and said challenge accepted
now after two years of testing and
prototyping me Chai's new on freaking
believable invention power up fpv
the first ever paper airplane drone with
a live streaming camera using
state-of-the-art technology powerup fbp

it in different words you feel as if you

a plane and attach the module put your
phone in the cardboard viewer and you're
ready to fly the camera streams live
video to an app on your very own
smartphone sitting in the head mounted
goggles to control your plane just tilt
your head light and there's also a
gamepad mode for when you feel like
handheld control power up FPPs camera

get wing view and back view so you can
see this defining moment in your life

Wi-Fi from over 300 feet to make the
experience really smooth power up ftp
has a ton of sensors and an on-board
computer with real-world autopilot mode
making it nearly on crash a ball nearly
power up fpv is ready for production so
