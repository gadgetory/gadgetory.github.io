after a long day of work traffic meeting
with friends you deserve a good night's
rest but what's keeping you up at night
ah the snore one of the most annoying
and uninterruptedly keeps you awake so
what do you do to solve this problem
that's right poke poking solves the
problem until it starts again to solve
this problem we need to know why someone
snores in the first place in most cases
snoring is caused because your Airways
are partly obstructed by lying on your
back the smaller airway results in the
vibration of the soft tissue this causes
the snoring sound by being poked you
will turn to your side and your tongue
will no longer if struct your airway
because it falls more sideways this is
why the snoring will stop snoring is a
complex problem then in the end will
give you both sleepless nights and we
know you need your sleep of course there
is an old fashioned solution to stop
lying on your back but it isn't very
comfortable how about a device you can
wear around your arm that's comfortable
stylish and most of all effective
introducing the anti snore wearable
simply connect the wearable via
bluetooth with the sleep AI app you can
adjust the power of the vibration and
the sensitivity of the snoring detection
depending on your personal preferences
when you're asleep the app will pick up
snoring sounds and make the wearable
vibrate replacing the pope your partner
usually gives the product is designed in
a way to be effective to stop snoring
but nearly effortless to start using
today so you both can get your
well-deserved rest
my name is Mickey lse and I'm a dentist
for the last 16 years and I specialized
being a steep dentist so I treat a lot
of people with sleep disorders like
snoring or teeth grinding and sleep
apnea
we've been working on this project for
the last two years together with my data
scientists and hardware colleagues we
first made an app that the text snoring
and after making the algorithm we looked
for a solution to make your turn to the
side and we came up with the using the
vibration that's also in the phone and
we tested that on the skin of patients
and so it makes you turn to your side so
the team is big of course it's me in the
team as being asleep that this knowing
what snoring does to throat and how the
the medical part works secondly that
yeah the data scientists to data
scientists and they work together for
over two years to get algorithm the
level that we can use a medically scope
and then we have the designers that make
the wearable together with the hardware
guys and that's that's really difficult
so you want to have our co device
connected to the software the app yeah
and we've been working to get this done
and get the prototype working and tested
thanks for watching this video and i
hope you'll back our projects i will
make you or your bed partner stop
snoring
