with power introducing kurihama the
black flower Japanese steel
combined with futuristic London design
finely crafted 67 layers of Japanese
steel angular design smooth transition
pieces of our yet supremely shot for
enquiring cooking hello I'm Freddie
founder of edge of Arabia we're a small
london-based nice company we have
launched over five night ranges we have
BOM great acclaim by design bloggers and
magazines to name a few
the wide magazine GQ for group and
monocles we've used this experience to
launch our most ambitious product ever
the Kuro hammer the black flower this
design makes references to contemporary
design cues angularity smooth transition
impact
the finally gets floral pattern on the
blade is reminiscent of the perfectly
manicured Japanese garden although they
look fantastic the question is how good
are they to use we decided to put our
prototype to the test with our one of
London's most wanted chef a leader booth
he agreed to put them to the test
in his Michelin star restaurant Daboo so
the cutting ability we used various
items to test on from sort of crisp
things like apples or onions kind of
softer ones such as salmon each time
zero resistance just went straight
through the thing you chopped a lot of
in kitchens and peel a lot of his onions
but simply I want to test our the chive
curls here we split chives him into
about forces literally almost like
splitting a hair you're taking something
very thin making it thinner still
everyday items you know bread salmon
onions whether you're a professional
chef for cooking at home these are
things can be chopping you know probably
quite regularly and this is good good to
make the test relevant from the smallest
knife to the largest just just makes you
like that little bit easier when you're
cooking and if you've got good kit sort
of like a treat to be honest like I come
in the kitchen cook every day you know
it's kind of like you know driving to
work in a Ferrari that kind of thing you
know just yeah yes make something simple
you know feel special we believe that
this is the key to inspiring cooking
instead of a single chef's knife we have
defined a full set of six knives for
this project each knife is suited to a
specific task and has a specific purpose
big is better versatile for bread for
precision because it rock and for
slicing the wire we on Kickstarter kuroi
hammer with its high quality Japanese
steam is our most exclusive range today
unfortunately the working capital
commitments are very large being a small
but fast-growing company we simply
cannot afford to launch production the
design and tooling is ready but we need
your help to run the first production
batch
we need at least $30,000 to make this
happen
