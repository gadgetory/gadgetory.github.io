chisels most users will have three
bevels one cutting and suicide bogies
this one has two cutting edges and have
a flat side you can actually hit with a
hammer so this becomes a good everyday
wrecking chisel bashing chisel you may
notice as well we have some grooves in
the side or a little bit of paranor
trying out or whatever you want and even
straight out the box there they're
pretty good too I just put an edge on a
pencil to be honest it's got a good
economic handle it's got the rubberized
end language means it's not a very good
comfortable grip it's got a steel strike
caps you can really hit it with a hammer
really give it some so it's got all the
features in the chisel which will give
it guaranteed tough that you'd expect
from the divorce table the chisel itself
comes in three sizes 32 millimeters or
inch and a quarter
we have 25 millimeters or an inch or 80
ml 3/4 of an inch another nice thing is
they come with these removable plastic
covers so you can take it off use it and
put it back in so when you store it in
your box or when you put it in your
trouser pocket your long pocket you know
that the sharp is attached is not gonna
do any damage to make our life easier
right well Milwaukee know if you have
the correct tool and accessory for the
job life doesn't get any easier than
that combining Milwaukee's flagship
source or with a scraper blade with a
universal reception and you get
productivity whether it's paint glue or
lino that needs to be removed the
Milwaukee scraper blade takes the hard
work and the skinned knuckles out of the
job available in 37 mil and 75 mil life
just got a little easier thanks to
Milwaukee's thirst for innovation and
finding solutions to suit every trade
available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
