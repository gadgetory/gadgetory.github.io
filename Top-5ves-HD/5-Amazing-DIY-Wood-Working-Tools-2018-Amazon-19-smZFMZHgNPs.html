beautiful hinges what's not so simple is
installing them you need to cut precise
perfectly aligned mortises in the narrow
edges of your box and lid it's a
challenging task and because it's one of
the last steps a mistake could ruin your
entire project Rockler has a solution
that lets you make these nerve-racking
cuts easily and accurately with your
plunge router the jig eight hinge
mortises
this award-winning system consists of a
jig base and individual templates
customized to create mortises for
specific hinges setup is straightforward
the jig base rests on the edges of the
lid and bottom of your box a long spacer
guarantees there the proper distance
apart lines in your jig base make it
easy to set the fence so the mortise
will be perfectly centered on your stock
lock it in and you're ready to cut not
only that mortise but also the one for
the hinge on the other side of your box
install a couple of clamps to hold
everything in place and you're ready for
the template all templates are the same
size and they make cutting the mortises
simple start by aligning the a on the
template with the a on the jig base
using a plunge router with the correct
guide bushing and a straight bit set to
the proper depth just follow the slot in
the template to hollow out the mortise
if there are additional slots in your
template just rotate it to match up the
letters and then make the cuts for the
hinge on the other side just reposition
the jig remember it's already set and
make the cuts before you know it you'll
have clean matching mortises and
beautiful hinge installations worthy of
a family heirloom the thought of using
your hands to push small work pieces
past the bit at a router table makes you
shudder
we've got just the thing to set you at
ease the rocklers small piece holder it
securely holds small work pieces to give
you the best possible cut results all
while keeping your hands far from the
cutter the keys are its stability and
ease of handling the two outside bases
and the interior adjustable fence
are solidly connected by two plain steel
rods and a steel lead screw the results
are a sturdy assembly and a footprint
that's large enough to resist tipping
the smooth bottom surfaces reduce
friction for easy movement on the table
and the large rounded handles provide
both comfort and complete control
securing your workpiece in a small piece
holder is easy to the interior fence has
a quick-release mechanism that allows
instant positioning up against your
stock and an adjustment range that
accommodates pieces up to eight and a
half inches wide a knurled knob on the
lead screw lets you dial in the pressure
for us to cure hold and the abrasive
clamp phases keep the stock from
slipping and to keep the workpiece from
lifting during machining the small piece
holder incorporates adjustable hold down
pins that secure tightly against the top
of your workpiece if you're concerned
about tear out while routing you can
sandwich a sacrificial block between
your stock and the adjustable interior
fence or attach the block with a couple
of pan head screws driven through the
slots in the fence and if you're working
with thicker stock that won't allow the
bases to make contact with the table
surface you can attach an outrigger
block to the outer base to ensure
stability and an even cut all told the
rocklers small piece holder will help
you work more safely and achieve better
results when shaping small work pieces
woodworkers no chisels and plane blades
perform best when the working end is
square to the size of a blade so the
edge tool sharpening gauge starts with a
built in square that's more precise than
all other brands
we accomplished this accuracy by making
the tool out of special 17-4 stainless
steel each tool is precision laser cut
finely milled and then check on our
state-of-the-art video optics system for
tolerance of point zero zero eight five
degrees plus this tool features nine
commonly used bevel angles that are cut
into the outside edge of the gauge these
precision bevels start at 15 degrees and
progress in five degree increments to
fifty degrees with the ninth being fifty
four degrees and the notches have relief
cuts where your sharp edge is placed so
it won't be damaged the edge tool

the 1/8 1/4 3/8 and 1/2 inch square end
paddles have been sized to work in just
about any box joint dovetail or groove
the offset paddle is highly flexible and
ideal for filling small nail holes with
wood putty and the angle tip of the skew
paddle is perfect for scraping glue

anodizing process that adds decades to
the tools durability put it this way you

what sets this tool apart is hard coat
anodizing which yields an extremely hard
surface with a rockwell hardness rating
of 65 Plus this coating will never
appeal the finish is smoother and its
corrosion abrasion and wear resistant
and it won't fade from prolonged
exposure to sunlight
we manufacture every 1281 from cast
aluminum tool plate on state of the art

8-inch handle then we ensure each 1281
square is perpendicular to at least 85
10 thousandths of a degree
