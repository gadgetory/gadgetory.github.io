and getting a good night's sleep has a
hugely positive effect on our health and
well-being beacon is a multi-sensory
cube to help you live better three of
the biggest problems we face a bad air
quality noise pollution and artificial
lighting so is it any wonder that when
most of us spend ninety percent of our
lives indoors in urban environments that
our well-being mood productivity stress
levels and sleep quality are all
compromised beacon was created because
we wanted to help people sleep better
breathe better and as a result have a
better life with the spire rhythmic
light that mimics the Sun it makes
drifting off to sleep easy and waking up
natural the built-in sensors constantly
monitor the air to check that your room
is clean and safe it plays sounds that
block out unwanted noises that may
disturb your sleep or work life has a
huge impact on our well-being with a day
life keeping our internal body clock on
time there are many of us that live
where the weather will see them makes it
even harder beacons light helps you get
to sleep it with a relaxing like by
mimicking natural sunrise it wakes you
gently refreshed and naturally in sync
with your biorhythms while air pollution
is on a monumental increase worldwide we
often forget that indoor air quality is
up to ten times more polluted often due
to poor ventilation beacon has air
quality sensors that monitor the air for
harmful gases and pollutants the logo
color tells you the status of the room
or get an alert via your phone telling
you it's time to take action adapting to
your day be things like color and
brightness can be set to suit your task
or your mood this can be safe from the
app or manually with the buttons
there's nothing worse than being
disturbed in the night with a racket of
analog clock affecting our mood for the
rest of the day so we builded speakers
for the selection of south to help you
sleep focus and relax better with fewer
interruptions or with the Bluetooth
function listen to your favorite music
through the speakers sport headphones so
for the past two years we've been
working hard drawing I experience and
expertise and commercial lighting I key
and sensor technology we have an amazing
team of engineers designers and
passionate people that helps bring
beacon to life having them countless
designs we now have a working prototype
and we've got manufactured lined up
ready to take beacon to the next stage
it is with a spinal push that we'll need
your help to get there with your input
together we can shape beacon to make a
change in our lives and help us all this
better thank you for supporting us
please pledge and thank you you ever
have I think a five engineers and
cyclist with a care goes make cycling
paper it's amazing to see how many
people have join us since the beginning
of our journey we are being when we are
working on our first project malinka we
cycle are the most vulnerable users of
the road two wheels to balance no
Chester protectors and we still need to
use our hands to communicate with cars
blinkers is the one thing that was
missing for cycles to be safer and to be
a natural para controlar
it starts with the regular like life
that you know the blinkers actually
backed everything you need to be seen on
the stoop and respected by everyone else
in the road with blinkers cars will
always know when you are turning and
when you are breaking
a laser projection makes you even more
visible and allow scars to understand
better what is your space and what's
their space blinkers were designed to
fit in your life it has no buttons turns
on as soon as you plug it in blinkers
also have a powerful battery and it's
very easy to retouch blinkers is the
ultimate safety solution for cycling
hey Bobo it has been a long journey but
it's thanks to all the people that have
join us that we made it so far we have
successful Kickstarter last year in
which we use the funds to take the
product to the level where we are now we
team up with Sookie a top Swiss
engineering company for the technical
development of the product in which we
take blinkers to SH but it's ready for
serial production and that's not what we
come to it evolved within your support
with the last push to blinkers and make
it a reality let's make typing paper
Oh
yes
Oh
Oh
cycling for the city is an amazing
experience but there's one problem that
all cyclists share and that is
navigation we are very active cyclist
ourselves and we've often experienced
how using your phone while cycling is
both awkward and sometimes even
dangerous and having had found in your
ears telling you where to go just makes
you lose some of the sense of freedom
that cycling normally give that is how
they IDF hi sir was fun we wanted to
create their simple affordable and easy
to use product that will help find your
way to the feeling I suppose like a
magic compass but instead of pointing
North it points to your final
destination in that way you are free to
choose your own routes for the citizens
just open the app set your location and
attach Heiser to your bike the LEDs of
the outer circle show you the directions
and the central LED indicates the
distance to your goal so now you can
find your own way through the city
without being in danger of getting lost
and who knows what amazing places and
experiences you can find by not choosing
the route most clever Heiser is made out
of machined aluminium making it sturdy
and waterproof and when you are not
using the device you can simply hide the
rubber bands within the device and put
it in your pocket that way you can
always bring it with you be it to find a
new restaurant after work or to discover
when cycling abroad
if you have a day where you feel more
like sticking to the main road I'll of
course also offer turn by turn
navigation we have to spend the last
year developing the simplest possible
products to find your way through the
city and now we're very happy to have a
working prototype and we need your help
to develop the first production run so
please support our campaign and make
sure you will be one of the first owners
of this magical compress that will
change the way you navigate the 50
forever
