world the dresser is basically the
uniform of successful men you wear to
work when you have a important interview
even at your own wedding left versus
using smart exams to make your life
easier
our research shows that men basically
prefer to have three provinces in a
dress no stains no smell and as little
irony as possible we found a way to
offer that in a fabric that's also soft
and breathable we get a lot of questions
about how it's possible for sure to have
such symmetric properties and still feel
natural well it implies working on every
aspect of the fabric from the carbon
selected to the way the yarns are spun
and then we'll win our carbon is also
treated so that the fibers are
transformed that they're very cold this
allows the shirt to block out all fluids
and bacteria before it enters the fabric
which is unlike other existing
technologies where it's only added to
the surface and can be washed off so
together with our designer we created a
great fit we did it in a minimalistic
design so it will never go out of style
that verse is more about just making
life easier for busy men we also care
about changing irresponsible consumption
patterns true sustainability is when you
wear the same shirt for years instead of
buying new stuff all the time
the biggest hassle of wearing a shirt is
not buying it but keeping it fresh
when napkin when you eat bike slower so
you don't sweat maybe even do laundry on
a Tuesday a leather shirt can be worn
for many days in a row and you still
don't have to wonder if your bacon smell
