of factors one of them is being
optimally hydrated but in reality

of the day each of us had unique needs
the change moment-by-moment depending on
who we are what we do the time of day
and a lot more we brought together as
years of research on this variable to
develop a personalized dynamic estimate
of your unique hydration needs we call
it prime when you check your vessel
throughout the day you'll notice the
prime line rising or falling basically
it's telling you how close you are to
meeting your hydration when you see the
blue light you're at your prime you can
also check your status in the app by
pairing with wearables our best-looking
even take into account activity level
and other factors that change
continuously whether you're prepping for
an interview or even training for a
triathlon we want everyone to experience
the benefits of optimal hydration that
includes things like better mood higher
energy levels focus and even endurance
