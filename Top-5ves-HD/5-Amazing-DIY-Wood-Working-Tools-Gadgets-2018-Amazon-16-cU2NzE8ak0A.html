each with a different angle on one end
and 90 degrees on the other you get a
45-degree 30 degree and 22.5 degree and
to cut perfect crown molding miters at
thirty three point eight five degree and
a thirty one point six degree to set
your compound miter saw of course
the gauges can also be used at the table
saw to set your blade tilt and miter
gauge with blade gauge you not only get
gauges with precision laser-cut accuracy
but a clever and stout gauge holder so
you could make machine adjustments with
both hands-free just slip the solid
aluminum base over the blade and then
move it into position that's it blade
gauges are individually laser-cut from
heavy 16 gauge stainless steel each
gauge is given a no glare satin finish
and has the angles laser engraved on
both sides
the main angle is shown on each end and
complementary angles are engraved in
their respective corners for example the
30-degree angle also displays the 60
degree acute and 120 degree of two
sangil's blade gauge for 10 inch and 12
inch saw blades are at generous 12
inches long the width of the gauges vary
to maximize angle contact with the blade
angle contact for 10-inch blades is
about two and seven eighths of an inch
and for 12 inch blades angle contact is
four inches
combine it with your table saw and the
eye box makes even difficult to cut
materials like plywood easy to join and
the results are always perfect you can
even use the eye box to locate glass
smooth cross-grain cuts like these for
an unlimited selection of decorative
moldings a great way to put a little pop
into your next cabinetry project and at
the router table you'll discover many
new joinery possibilities to add to your
skill set did we mention handmade wooden
hinges will it's all possible with the
new incra eye box the eye box is
designed both as a carrier to hold and
move your workpiece safely through the
cut and as a precision positioner to
locate your work if you move from cut to
cut across the width of the piece as a
carrier the eye box feature set is
substantial the hard anodized aluminum
fence is bi-directional for use on both
left and right tilting saws and is self
supported featuring its very own incra
glide lock miter bar for precision
tracking in your miter channel just a
quick turn of the fastener will
fine-tune the bar to a whisper smooth
glide in your table saw our router table
and you'll never have to tie up your
favorite miter gauge just to cut a few
box joints t-slots provide an easy means
of attaching and adjusting the included
backing board for Terra free cutting and
the wide flat top of the fence was
designed to provide support for a wooden
hand screw clamp during cutting
operations front and rear blade guards
follow the number-one tenets in
woodworking safety keeping your hands
safely well away from the area of the
cut and the acrylic deflector shield
increases operator safety by deflecting
sawdust back down to the table the front
guard doubles as a vertical stock
support and is adjustable to provide
support for material thicknesses from
1/8 to one and a quarter the u-shaped
view cut out on top allows the operator
to easily see the engagement of a
previously cut groove over the position
pin plates the forward-mounted stock
ledges provide optimum support for your
stock on both sides of the cut they are
adjustable in or out depending on the
cut width and pin plate positions and
include a T slot for locking down the
front blade guard but the real magic is
in the eye box pin plate positioning
mechanism just loosen the locking knob
and zero that pin plates to your cutter
we call this kis calibration then simply
turn the red knob to adjust the pin
plates to fit a test cut mate with your
blade the eye boxes dual pitch lead
screw based positioning engine does the
rest simultaneously setting the
all-important correct distance between
the pin plates and the blade tighten the
locking knob and you'll be ready to cut
some perfect fitting box joints and
here's the really great news when used
with a standard stacked dado blade at
your table saw you may never need to 0
again that's because the zero position
for a narrow dado setup is exactly the
same as the zero position for a wide
dado set up after your one-time kiss
calibration just open the pin plates to
fit a test cut made with any cut with
you select in the included DVD wheel
detail setup and basic you said both the
table saw and the router table so you'll
be comfortable with either choice as
your workstation then we'll apply some
method to the amazing magic of the eye
boxes unique features to produce some
interesting new joinery each of the
joinery sections as most of the info
covered in the first few minutes but
will make the entire box so you can get
a better feel for the routine and the
tips and techniques sections will offer
some quick tips to help you get the most
out of the new incra eye box dental
molding adds a classical element to your
cabinetry and the eye box is the perfect
tool for making just about any size
imaginable after setting the desired
depth of cut make a test cut and adjust
the pin plates to fit you can then
change the space between cuts by micro
adjusting the pin plate positions a
great variety of profiles can be
attained by experimenting with different
cut widths and spacing between cuts
after cutting a series of grooves along
the edge of a board just use your table
saw to remove the strip of dental
molding with this method you'll find it
easy to produce enough dental molding
for your next project in minutes how
would you like to add finely crafted
handmade wooden hinges to your next
cabinet design these hinges are just the

combined with the incra hinge crafter
the eye box can be the ultimate wooden
hinge maker giving you the ability to
make hinges in four different sizes and
just about any length just cut out the
blanks as described in the incra hinge
crafter owners manual using your router
table fence or the auxilary fence design
shown on page 8 of that manual then use
the eye box as a substitute for the
incra vent system to cut the finger
joints it's really as easy as it looks
and the hinge crafter makes drilling
perfectly centered pivot holes a simple
task using your hand drill
give it a try and these beautiful hinges
will make a spectacular addition to your
next box project your new incra eye box
is just one of many exciting innovations
