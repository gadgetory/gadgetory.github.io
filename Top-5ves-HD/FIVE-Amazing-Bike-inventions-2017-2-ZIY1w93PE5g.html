places wasn't the painful and
time-consuming ordeal it often turns out
to be what if you could get door-to-door
in a quick and effortless fashion and
what if you can even enjoy the commute
introducing ampler ampler is a smart
electric bicycle for the modern commuter
it makes personal transport effortless
cheap and fast antlers electric
assistance takes you further without
breaking the sweat while giving you all
the freedom and fun of a regular bicycle
bride Amy employers hassle-free you
simply cycle it's effortless the
electric assistance expelling Leiter
giving you superpowers and a smile you
can easily pick it up and place it where
you need it because of clever materials
and technology we've made the bike
thirty-five percent light
the average electric bike it makes
paddling so easy even Hills become flat

charge and if you need to go even
further it works just like a
conventional bicycle and you simply
pedal on by regulating how hardy pedal
you control the extra earth this means
you will always have control of the bike
the minimalist looks hold all premium
components
we've also made it super affordable by
cutting off the distributor network and
getting the bike directly to you all of
us in the founding team have been
looking for an effortless way to get
door-to-door without breaking a sweat
being avid cyclists we saw that the only
way to introduce an accessible high
quality and great looking electric bike
into the world was to build it ourselves
by using premium parts and fitting the
battery into the frame we've come up
with a great-looking and lightweight
commuter bike that's tons of fun to ride
with
all of our bikes are hand assembled in
Europe and thanks to an already
established supply chain they will be
delivered on time help us bring antler
into production be among the first to
receive one thank you
we are luminous a brand creating
next-generation intelligent clothing and
accessories designed to save lives our
tech laced apparel will illuminate to
help solve a major problem facing our
communities today the problem that
luminous addresses is the alarming
number of bike injuries and deaths from
motor vehicle crashes in 2013 there were
743 cyclist kills and forty-eight
thousand injured by motorists and that's
in the US alone now get this twenty one
percent of those occur in just three
hours of the day between six and nine pm
the solution is evident be brighter we
embedded LED lights and clothing and
develop software that optimizes them to
maximize visibility all you do is enter
your route into the patent-pending
luminous app and the jacket does the
rest as you approach your turn the
indicator lights engage and flash amber
when you slow down your brake lights
will automatically flash over one third
of cycling deaths occur at intersections
so we designed our line to Stroh as you
pass through them we've also included a
feature that allows you to input your
desired pace and get immediate visual
feedback from the performance meter the
world is embracing cycling that's
awesome what isn't is the growing risk
associated with just riding a bike so
take a ride with luminous and be
brighter

we set out to bring a new level of
engineering and craftsmanship to the
bicycle Bell our goal was simple create
a compact versatile Bell with powerful
sound the bowel design process started
crafting the perfect dome for this we
worked with Bevan brothers in
Connecticut a company with over a
hundred years experience in the art of
crafting bells together we've developed
a dome that is compact but with an
unexpectedly loud and lasting ring
no bail is complete without a proper
hammer we've crafted an elegantly simple
wire lever
we wanted a bell that would mount any
handlebar this meant engineering an
entirely new mounting system
you
all components come together to create a
thoroughly better Bell Kickstarter
helped us launch grip rings last year
now we like you're backing to get valve
production going
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
