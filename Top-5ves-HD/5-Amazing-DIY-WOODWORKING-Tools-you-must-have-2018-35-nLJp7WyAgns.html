or cumbersome to pass over a stationary
cutter on a table saw or a router table
you will also need a six-inch bar clamp
for the first and last cuts on the work
pieces as well as a workbench and a vise
or a series of clamps to hold the work
down securely the box joints are cut
using a series of incremental passes
for cutting the joints you'll need a
half inch collet router a three-quarter
inch diameter bushing and a half inch
diameter bit spiral up cut bits are
excellent for cutting solid woods and we
recommend them selective router bit with
the shortest possible cut length
Jerrica Borissov place add the Borissov
plate to your wtx clamp edge ensuring
you get an even more precise cut with
practically no effort that's because
with a Borissov plate your circular saw
cannot drift off quartz the Borissov
plate is specially designed with an
adjustable guy that fits straight edges
up to three and a half inches wide now
your circular saw will glide smoothly
and in a perfectly straight line along
the wtx clamp edge rail your saw can't
wander or twist during cutting so
there's no binding or stalling when a
blade goes slightly off line the
Borissov plate works with any right or
left handed circular saw first adjust
the saws plate for the depth you want to
cut then slip the saws base plate under
the two plate clamps and tighten the
screws secure the back of the saw plate
by tightening the adjustable spring
clamp slip the Borissov plate onto your
wtx clamp edge and align your cut
utilizing the saw plate blade indicator
which is aligned directly with a saws
blade now you're ready to make perfectly
straight cuts every time so we built a
versatile six in one shot gauge that
utilizes stainless steel gear racks with
thirty-second inch and swappable metric
steps to precisely lock in the tool
scales we also added handy layout
features that make the tool perfect for
these six reference options
lock in the desired height then adjust
your router bit or table saw blade then
on the opposite side of the tool you can
use the same scale and integrated
v-groove to bring a stop collar up to
the end of the sliding block find the
exact center of a board by placing the
feet on the opposite sides of a
workpiece move the sliding block pass
the end of the feet and you have a
marking gauge plus there's a notch in
the center at the sliding block keep
your pencil properly positioned using
the same scale and positioning as the
marking gauge mode you can check the
depth of rabbits and shoulders to make
sure they match your desired setting
it's a perfect go/no-go gauge last but
not least there's a 3/16 inch diameter
rod with the scale to read the death of
any hole or narrow groove these
revolutionary new turning tools feature
razor-sharp replaceable carbide inserts
that have been carefully engineered to
cut cleaner and last longer than any
other carbide insert on the market
shaping your project with ultra sheer
tools couldn't be simpler first adjust
your tool rest so the cutting edge is on
the centerline of your lathe keep your
tool level with the floor and press into
the stock moving side to side creating
the profile you want
use the square insert tool for initial
roughing and for outside curves or beads
use the round insert tool for inside
curves or coves the round insert also
works great for homing polls the sharp
detail tool inscribes precise lines to
accent your work there's also an
optional radius detail tool for fine
beads and coves now here's the feature
that separates ultra sheer from all the
others when your project is nearly
complete roll the tool right or left on
your tool rest until it's sitting flat
on one of the alternate bearing surfaces
now the cutting insert is on a 45 degree
angle to the stop make another wider cut
still keeping the tool level with the
floor you'll notice the cut is much
cleaner needing little or no sanding
let's take a closer look at how each
component of the ultra shear tool comes
together to make the best carbide insert
turning tool on the market the tool
shank is milled from a special chromoly
steel tough enough to be used for NASCAR
roll cages after machining the shanks go
through a two-stage heat treating
process that makes the shaft rigid and
smooth minimizing vibration and making
the tool glide easily across your tool
rest and the sides are tapered to
prevent interference in your tightest
cuts the seats for each insert are
carefully designed to provide full
support bracing the insert with at least
three points of contact the tool handles
are turned from rock maple with a hand
rubbed oil finish aircraft grade
aluminum Ferrell's support the handle
where the tool shank is pressed in and
the end cap protects the handle from
splitting and indicates the tools shape
and size you'll never pull the wrong
tool out of the rack
the cutting inserts are formed from a
nano grain carbide and the materials in
the carbide matrix have been carefully
blended to make sure the inserts are
topped as well as fine grain when an
edge finally dulls just loosen that
screw and rotate the cutter to a fresh
edge when all edges have been worn
simply replace the insert with a new one
available everywhere ultra shear tools
are sold plus each tip is laser engraved
with its replacement part number no need
to try and hunt up an old package when
it's time for a replacement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
