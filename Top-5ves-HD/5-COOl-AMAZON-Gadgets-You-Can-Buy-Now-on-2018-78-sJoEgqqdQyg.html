hi
we are Blue Wave I'm Kira I'm Stefan we
love music and good sound
we love our wire dead phones but we also
love the convenience of wireless we've
been working for a while now on an
elegant solution that combines both meet
get it's small it's light and it's the
best wireless headphone amplifier ever
made headphones
just like speakers need to be driven
they need an amplifier for them to work
so there's a tiny employer in every
smartphone but it's not powerful enough
to properly drive your high-end
headphones up to now carrying a
headphone amp meant strapping a bulky
brick to your phone the solution only
hardcore audio files would contend with
no more get brings a solution that is
the best of both worlds it will drive
your headphones beautifully and
wirelessly in a nutshell the headphones
will sound better plugged in to get then
plug directly into your smart phone
we packed an awesome amount of
Technology in this tiny device every
single component in the electronic
design was chosen with audio performance
in mind we spare no details to achieve a
crystal-clear sound you'll see the specs
great specs but having worked in audio
all my life I also learned to use my
ears an audio device is much more than
the sum of its parts I'm sure you'll
enjoy this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
