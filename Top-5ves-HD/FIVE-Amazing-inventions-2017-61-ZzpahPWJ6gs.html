hi I'm Mitch I'm an industrial designer
at a small firm called human scope I've
been developing products now for about
10 years and one of the very first
products I worked on that went to market
was a night light night lights come in a
wide range of styles they all have the
same cheap materials lackluster
aesthetics and minimal functions with
all me we want to develop a nightlight
that has a wide range of functionality
that not only looks great in your home
but it's made and designed well like
most other night lights omie has an LDR
sensor in it which allows the lights
come on automatically when it gets dark
however only also has fully adjustable
RGB LED lights which offer over 16
million options via IMEI the app will
also let you turn only on or off
dim or brighten the light set timers and
more
unlike traditional night lights only is
better it has a built-in rechargeable
battery which means when the power goes
out
your only stays on it also means you can
take all me with you or put it on your
child's bedside table so when they wake
up in the middle of the night they can
take on those monsters and with the
folding prongs safe they're not grabbing
at it out of an element the team at
human scope and I are really excited
about this product we have a prototype
now we need your help to move into
production please check out our campaign
below let us know if you have any
questions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
