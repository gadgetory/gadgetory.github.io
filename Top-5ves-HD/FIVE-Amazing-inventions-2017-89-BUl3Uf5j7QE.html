have you ever felt uncomfortable when
speaking over the phone in public places
or open space
introducing Hashmi the world's first
mask for mobile vowels
hush may is a personal acoustic device
that protects speech privacy and open
space environments by using exclusive
passive voice suppression and active
voice masking technology
a stylish economic design for a
long-term where
Hashmi keep talking
Oh
about a year ago we began to wonder what
if you could charge your phone wherever
you wanted whenever you wanted without
any cables or wires what if we could
find a way for everyone to charge all
their devices at once no matter how many
people you had over what if we could
free people from wall sockets and
integrate true wireless charging into
our lives
no more cords bulky battery stations or
charging cables and that was the
inspiration behind Juice
the world's first all-in-one Group
charger built for millenials and young
professionals instead of being tethered
to a two-foot table or wall outlet Joost
allows you to grab a pack and enjoy the
knife you already need a charge so why
not do so in a way that's Wireless from
an always charge pack that you can take
whatever having multiple people over no
worries juice can charge up to six
phones at once three four more battery
packs and three more from our patented
base a system that allows each slot to
be transformed into an additional phone
dock but what if you're on the go juice
packs are small and portable we created
a battery pack that you can take web
small enough to fit in your pocket yet
big enough to give you 50 percent more
juice wherever whenever
we also gave it an extended tip
attachment so you can get juiced while
keeping on that favorite case
we came to Kickstarter because we need
your help so if you order in the first
15 days of our campaign we'll make sure
to get you your juice by the start of
summer thank you for helping juice
become a reality don't you just hate it
when your phone runs out of juice when
you're on that important call or trying
to get directions say hello to Koki
go keys battery is capable of charging
your phone for up to two hours
keep it on your keyring for easy access
then use it to boost your phone on the
go to charge it plug it into any USB
port on your laptop in your car or write
into an outlet when you need to give
your phone a full charge you can use it
as a USB cable
goki charges itself while your phone is
charging and it can sync your data too
we also included flash memory
to store videos pictures music and files
the USB 3.0 feature allows much faster
file transfer now your keys are
connected to your phone through
bluetooth whenever you lose them use the
go key app on your phone to locate the
signal and then make your go keyring so
you can find and when you can't find
your phone your go key will make it ring
if you lose your keys go keys GPS app
helps you locate them
use goki as a camera remote and let it
snap the picture for you
goki lives on your keychain and it will
always be there when you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
