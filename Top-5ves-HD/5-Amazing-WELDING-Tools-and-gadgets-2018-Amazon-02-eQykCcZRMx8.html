jobs the turnkey Rhino cart package
includes the mobile welding table with a
clamp and component fixture kit that
mates to the CNC precision board holes
on the reversible 48 inch by 30 inch
nitrated tabletop the Rhino carts robust
steel table legs include casters and
leveling feet for mobile or stationary
use inside or outside the shop shelves
racks and a pegboard panel provides
convenient space-saving storage of the
Rhino cart clamps and components so the
tools you need for each job remain
within easy reach clamp down work pieces
or fixture at any position on the Rhino
cart tabletop create accurate repeatable
setups for each new project whether the
job is repetitive short run or a new
one-time project you'll be able to
quickly set up a fixture for each new
project the Rhino cart is easy to use
all clamps and fixturing elements are
designed to be placed and adjusted from
the top of the table place the Rhino
cart clamps and components at any point
on the table to clamp or position work
pieces securely and accurately
quickly reconfigure your table setup as
work requirements change use the Rhino
cart to set up simple fixtures for
common frequent projects such as framing
to improve dimensional accuracy for a
higher quality weld hold down oversized
work pieces or weldments for grinding
sanding measuring or other tasks the
Rhino kart tabletop is heat treated with
a protective hardened work surface that
is resistant to where weld spatter and
rust the Rhino kart tabletop is
reversible turn it over to expose a new
work surface
the micro weld clamp from Werth is
designed for when your plate replacing
panels on the vehicle either spot
welding them or MIG welding the two
vertical panels together it simply slips
on to the panel and then you tighten
down using the wing nut the wedge on top
increases the clamping forces so you
don't need to bear down as much on the
clamp to make it tight this flexible
face on it allows multiple angled
surfaces to be clamped together securely
utilizing several of them in a row you
could securely hold on the panel they're
also very unobtrusive unlike a regular
vise grip they take up a small area the
wheel arch clamp from Werth is
especially useful in the wheel arch area
where you have a pinch weld between the
inner panel and the outer panel the
there's a lipped edge that rips along
here so economically it would be hard to
get a clamp to the inside this because
of the special shape of it allows you to
hook around the backside and then spin
it down to tighten and pinch the two
panels together holding it securely for
welding when welding to structural
panels together using the new big bronze
welding it's you need to weld at lower
temperatures but that means that you
need a capillary action of the weld
flowing through to the backside of the
panel
these butt welding clamps are perfect
for holding the panel together a certain
distance allowing the weld to flow
through to the other side and then
allowing the top to be dressed you can
see here underneath how the piece holds
the two panels firmly and securely
together we also have these adjustment
screws that allow if this were a thinner
piece of metal and this is a thicker
piece of metal you could still maintain
the tension and tightness on it with
these micro adjust screws a very unique
clamp nothing else like it on the market
