at fuser we live action sports and we're
obsessed with technology but in the past
the two haven't worked well together
we're about to change that the product
we've created is called mohawk it's an
action camera communication system a
navigation unit black box and emergency
response system all wrapped into one you
can capture high-res photos and HD
videos with the press of a button on
your wrist or handlebar mounted remote
your media syncs directly with your
smartphone for easy viewing and sharing
if something really cool happens and you
aren't recording press two buttons to
initiate a hot shot it saves the last 15
seconds of action it pushes it to social
media live in real time you'll never
miss a shot again our cloud-based
push-to-talk comms allow up to 12
friends to chat with one another over
any distance and using any Bluetooth
headset a world-first mohawk is loaded
with onboard sensors that allow it to do
some really powerful things it can
record all sorts of information how fast
you go what routes you take your airtime
lean angle and much more it can also
detect if you've been in a collision the
black box feature locks down the last
two minutes of audio video and telemetry
information giving you a full record for
happened leading up to the incident it
sends text message and email alerts to
your emergency contacts and provides
them with your exact GPS location on an
interactive map as well as the local
phone numbers for the three nearest EMS
dispatchers
hi i'm ryan sherman founder refuser this
campaign is for you our early adopters
back us today be one of the first to
experience with mohawk and come along
for the ride
I have a stomach I'm an architect from
Belgium this project started a few years
back I had a friend who was getting
married and I thought that making a nice
personalized gift
I've always been playing around with the
piece of paper and geometrical forms and
was interested in producing something
which came really from the method of
fabrication it's satisfying
something really quite minimalistic in
some ways but which would just produce a
maximum effect and to me this idea of
starting from a blank sheet of paper
scrunching it up you create really
something quite organic in some ways
almost mineral so for the lamp inside it
blows and you've got it it's it's your
bomb depending on funding there's
something I would really would like to
do is get people involved with this
project bring them in get their own
creativity mixed with my product and
make it something new explain it again
bring it to another step I thank you for
supporting this project
how many times a day do you type in your
password can be both easy to remember
and secure enough to protect your
computer well choose a short and simple
one and your online security can be
compromised which is a long one and it's
just not convenient and we aren't
talking just one password here right how
many do you have one free local account
one for the mail one for the Facebook
don't you just hate we need to memorize
every single one of them they may seem
to be necessary evil to ensure your
privacy but in reality all protection
you need isn't the tip of your finger
fingerprint identification is not a new
technology for years it has proven
itself to be a reliable method of
securing valuable things from military
facilities to smartphones but as of now
in order to use it you either need to
buy an expensive laptop with
pre-installed scanner or a separate
skimming device and all of them are just
too big and clunky they rely on old
swipe technology plus if you need to use
your device you have to plug in or
connect USB cable and then disconnect it
and keep it separately but here is
another way I present to you the I touch
ID it's the first fingerprint scanner
that is secure and efficient on the
inside while being small and compact on
the outside yes I touch ID the world's
smallest USB fingerprint scanner edge is
6 millimeters thin is easily the world's
slimmest scanner it is incredibly thin
you can plug it in and keep it plugged
in forever the body of the device is
made out of a single piece of aircraft
aluminium with hard anodized finish and
laser-cut sapphire glass when creating I
touch ID our priorities were security
reliability is a usage compact size and
best quality materials all these are
parts of a new philosophy of using a
fingerprint scanner for computers my
touch ID has no buttons or cables you
just plug it in and start using skin of
our fingerprints takes only half a
second
and the fingerprint data is stored
inside the I touch ID security core
where it cannot be accessed by anyone so
it's hid you'll be able to access your
computer's user account your Facebook
Twitter Instagram or any other website
online accounts that you previously
would lock onto the password and all of
it with just one touch you can use much
stronger and longer password 12 or more
symbols without any problems just put
your finger on the eye touch ID and
you're in you don't need to worry that
people around you your classmates
colleagues business partners buddies
your wife or husband would see your
password your private photos videos
documents and any other information will
always be protected even from hackers
from North Korea the eye touch ID is
compatible with both Windows and Mac
operating systems everybody has a unique
identifier which gives you the new level
of security and ability to encrypt your
data or communication with two-level
authentications with just a touch of
your finger high touch ID is might
withstand both digital and physical
dangers the device's impact scratch and
water-resistant so it will always
maintain its functionality and outlook
we touch team truly believe that I touch
ID is the best alternative to passwords
and the best fingerprint scanner of its
kind but in order for it to become
reality we need your help by supporting
our project and sharing it with your
friends you will enable us to deliver
the best product we can so everyone can
cross into the password free future
