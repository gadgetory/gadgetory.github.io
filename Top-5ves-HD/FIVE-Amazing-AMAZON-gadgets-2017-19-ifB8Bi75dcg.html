had one lands on your sandwich we have
and having to throw food at ourselves is
what inspired us to create something
everyone can use to capture the fly in
and around their home you might not
realize but fly here you eagle matter
from your pets waist or your neighbor's
cat ways into your home and appositive
food prep services and food where they
excrete digestive enzymes and then slurp
it up yes the garbage can fly chef works
because flies are naturally attracted to
your garbage it doesn't require a
chemical attractant unsightly flypaper
or chasing a fly around with its water
the trap also includes a disposable
cartridge and a quick release button
that allows for hands-free disposals
directly into your garbage can and it
also works for those annoying little
supplies so interested let Dennis show
you how it works
the garbage can fly trap is a device
that is installed in the lid of a
garbage can flies being attracted to the
scent of your garbage seek the easiest
route to gain access we have designed
the garbage can flytrap to let fly think
they have found Oh No
they enter through the center of the
trap on the exterior of the garbage can
under the quick release box and follow
their nose the disposable cartridge
below located on the interior of the
garbage can
the disposable cartridge is line with
flypaper which prevents their escape to
replace the disposable cartridge simply
press the quick release button allowing
the cartridge to fall into your garbage
and snap on a new cartridge and you are
ready to capture more flies after seven
prototypes and receiving valuable
feedback from product testing we are
finally ready to introduce this
innovative provider to the market
as a team with more than 40 years of
professional experience between us we'll
draw on our engineering design
manufacturing marketing and sales skill
to deliver a superior product I receive
my MBA from San Diego State University
and Dennis received his engineering
degree from University of California San
Diego we would love to make the garbage
man flytrap available to everyone that
has ever been bothered by a fly but
especially to you and this is where you

manufacturer's minimum initial order

are you trying to get things done
nothing is more frustrating than working
where it's hard to reach or where you
can't see till now meet the cordless
flip out an incredible power driver
it's compact to get the tight space as
other drivers can't yet drives the same
power and torque as much larger tools
but here's a real magic would flip out
it'll always come at your work from just
the right angle flip out delivers torque
and power using a design based on
industrial robots there are three
pivoting joints the top one pivots to
reach into tight spots the middle joint
lets you reach around or over and the
third joint gives you all this
flexibility with 360 degrees of rotation
the result flip out locks into over 380
divisions giving you power and tight
spots power in hard-to-reach spots power
where you need it flip out gets the job
done use a drill driver at the wrong
angle you'll quickly strip screws but
flip out adjust to drive screw straight
on and with the drill driver you just
don't have control for RTA furniture a
flip-outs variable speeds which gives
you the touch you need to assemble
furniture quickly flip out runs on a
built-in eight volt max lithium ion
battery and you can fully recharge it in
just 45 minutes and even if it sits for
a full year flip out still holds its
charge and maybe the best thing about
the flip out is it only weighs one pound
so whether you're working in
hard-to-reach places on electrical or
plumbing or just need a powerful driver
around the house flip out is a tool for
you
