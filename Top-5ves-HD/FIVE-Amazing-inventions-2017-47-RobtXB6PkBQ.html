security and payment industry has
completely opened my eyes to how
antiquated and messed up our digital
world really is seriously think about it
in terms of functionality it's like
we've been stuck in the 90s for the past
couple decades I mean why are we still
entering the same personal information
over and over again every time we go
online endless amounts of street
addresses account numbers URLs first
name last name credit card info
birthdate email address postal codes
frustrating huh what about logging in
how are we supposed to remember endless
usernames and passwords it's a waste of
my time and it's only getting worse and
don't even get me started on security do
we really think that our personal
information is secure the web has way
too much control over us but what if
there was a world where you control your
online experience after several years of
research and development we've harnessed
the power of Chip and PIN technology to
create a new intuitive digital
experience that's fast user friendly and
more secure than ever before with
kyookie you control the new internet
you
no more keyloggers then we're purchasing
on corrupted browsers the more phishing
scams it all happens on the key we've
assembled a team of the best technology
experts in the world to help bring cute
key to life after years of engineering
continuous improvements and rigorous
testing we're ready to change the
digital world forever
an intuitive online experience is just
the beginning please back kyookie and
share this project of your friends and
family welcome to the new internet
you
you
this thing's cool I mean it's so stable
for your attic hi i'm derek from
promotion it's hard to capture smooth
video using your smartphone we've all
been there the camera is so good then
you can make a hollywood movie to this
thing but your phone is almost
impossible to hold steady and that's why
we are developed flow motion one the
world's most versatile smartphone
stabilizer developed by engineers and
athletes but made for everyone one keeps
your phone study even when you're not it
enables you to capture smooth cinematic
videos when your smartphone one is
compact you can take up the grip hold it
together and fit it in your pocket and
one works even without the grip allowing
you to attach it to any camera and gopro
mounts
with the power of your smartphone one
becomes a lot more than just a
stabilizer in the form oh snap we built
in advanced tracking technology so it
automatically follows any object person
or even yourself create stunning mostly
thomas's to create amazing panoramic
photos livestream your moments directly
to Facebook or YouTube or even make
cinematic snapchat Instagram stories one
is super easy to use just slide in your
phone and with one click you're ready to
go we've gathered an amazing team of
business developers engineers and
athletes we've iterated and tested over
and over again and I finally come up
with something we can be truly proud of
our mission is to help people tell
better stories and make professional
videography available for everyone
anywhere at any time go back us today
and help us put an end to shaky videos

technology gives children the ability to
create wonders
they can plan a unique birthday surprise
for a friend play songs of their choice
when curtains are open or turn their own
cardboard creations into smart creating
cards
they can even design a magical crown
which glows in the same color as their
clothes
creation has its own rewards
be the star of the show and play drums
in thin air or even bow down to a lion's
roar we asked ourselves how can we
empower children to be makers with
technology with plasma they can
plasma is a platform of building blocks
for electronics and logic children can
get started with plasma in minutes
plasma elements pair wirelessly with the
plasma appt just pair them once and they
connect automatically every time you
want to use them plasma elements are
small intelligent wireless secure
rechargeable devices that offer plenty
of different programming blocks to
choose from plasma apps allow children
to program their elements by using an
easy to use drag-and-drop visual
programming interface children can
perfect their logic before they apply it
on plasma elements just test with a
built-in simulator bring your
imagination to reality with plasma the
plasma platform broadens your canvas of
creations you can even program Lego
Mindstorms Sparrow and many more
children can share their projects with
others using the plasma community the
community is about getting ideas
collaborating inspiring others and
inspiring yourself when you combine
technology with creativity you can
really make magic happen children have
the most vivid imagination and they see
things around them they want to emulate
those things but the tools that they
have today are not adequate to make that
happen and that's precisely when we
thought of bringing cutting-edge
technology to everyone to children to
make us so that you just unleash all the
creativity and add technology into the
mix so you can enable the next
generation of creations the approach
that we wanted to take is we put
children front and center when we're
thinking about this when we are
designing this product the entire design
as a whole lot of touching field built
into it so that you you feel like
playing with it it's it smooth to touch
the whole idea was that it should be
comfortable for a child to carry it
around
many of these things are very advanced
you get these in your smartphones in
your variables in your fitness trackers
this is the same kind of technology that
is used to make plays more do you learn
to drive a car because you want to drive
a car no you learn to drive a car
because you want to go places so
learning programming is a by-product it
should not be an objective the objective
should be doing something exploring
something experimenting with something
tomorrow you can also think of creating
your own 3d printed design and just
fitting plasma elements with it and
creating any form and shape that you
want let's move is like a laboratory for
your logical thinking programming is
like practicing logic and you get better
with practice but there has to be enough
incentive to practice the incentive
comes from the fun the enjoyment that's
why we have to make learning coding fun
true plus no we want to be a part of the
journey that helps our children create
the same future that we are promising
them
