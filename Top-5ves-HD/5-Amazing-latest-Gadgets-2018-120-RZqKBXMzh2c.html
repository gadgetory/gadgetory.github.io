system just having a regular too rarely
is not good enough for me I said I'd
have to add something at some sense of
nature into it so I started adding
lights and they said no what just light
is not enough let's try to make it rain
and that wondered the hardest part to do
is making it rain when designing smart
air product we really wanted to capture
the essence of what the client really
wanted to do and that was a sinful open
peaceful atmosphere when I'm thinking
about for this project is a small
theater and we're thinking about
bringing all of these theatrics into
play like some upfront lights in the
back the color of tone sounds this is
really a little theater and the actors
are plans and we want to give them the
best production possible working through
hundreds and hundreds of designs we went
through iteration and iteration and what
we really found was that anything that
calls too much obstruction to the
viewing angle to the experience that the
interior environment the natural
environment was going to deliver to
people we really wanted to step away
from so what we arrived that was a
really simple really elegant uplifted
platform that really kind of puts this
environment on a pedestal and that's
really what we wanted to do one of the
great things about putting all the
circuits in a circuit board is that it
gives us the opportunity to make a great
app it's beautiful that allows us to
direct all the actions of the tank
whether it's the fog with the fountains
or the lights and their color
or making it rain and having special
effects like lightning thunder these
things allow us as a director through
this app to design our setting and plan
our day this system is by design
something that you don't have to take
care of it's minimal effort involved on
their part but you still get this
beautiful high-tech exciting product to
have on your desk and your bedroom
wherever you like it this is really a
full life support system for these plans
to create a full natural environment
that you can bring indoors and you don't
have to worry about it I create smart
Terra to bring a better version of
nature to everyone's home with your
support I can begin manufacturing thank
