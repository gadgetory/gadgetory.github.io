I've been building drones since 2007 and
since then I knew that I wanted to
create a drone that was water
we made a waterproof drone with all the
sophisticated features allow you to take
beautiful shots and remove the fear of
flying over water the splash zone is
rugged easy to fly and as a timeless
features that make it a blast we put
months you can making share that the
features don't add complexity during
flight the splash zone can be formed by
anywhere from a phone or they include a
remote control these of users at the
core of every added feature we think
that you shouldn't have to be an expert
to allow your creativity to extend the
idea is to remove the barriers and allow
you to lose the fear of flying in
different conditions including flying
over water what we wanted to do is one
of your furnesto for all people we
already make quadcopter that's
waterproof but it doesn't have the
features that make it a real drum so
we've added a waterproof camera gimbal
and integrated video transmitter and a
live video feed directly from the GoPro
by displaying location battery voltage
altitude and distance right on the
remote you'll always know where this
class drone is and how it's doing we
wanted to make it practical so we added
an emergency flare adapter that allows
you to deploy an emergency flare for 15
minutes rather than 15 seconds its
payload release mechanism is not only
fun but can be used in emergency
situations this flash dramatic onymous
functions like followme mode plan
mission flights and return to launch
location at the clip in the switch
we put a lot of work time and energy
into the tooling and injection molding
process with your help we can make this
classroom reality
we're introducing a new fleet of
high-tech smartphone controlled gaming
drops for real gun fights stunts air
races single and multiplayer game
not all these
target destroyed
activating emergency i am 18 brittany
place
you host
Kickstarter at Toby rich we have to an
awesome smartphone or go gathered over
the last year's and now we are
introducing a completely new experience
of drones we call it gaming drones use
your iOS or Android phone or tablet to
experience single and multiplayer gaming
through our free to be rich red gaming
and dogfights races stunts earn gaming
points virtual plane upgrades like cool
maneuvers play til your phone to fly or
use your gaming joysticks flying a plane
has never been so easy learn how to fly
it step by step tutorials and choose
your flying level from beginner to
expert and advanced auto pilot an
emergency buggy to auto recovery your
plane in a big package of sensors make
it all very real 365 days of fun and
action thanks to our amazing speed
abilities from super frost to hover mode
on top we built it very durable using a
special foam normally used for auto
shoes we grip the plane with a 9 exit
sensor a pressure sensor and the flight
time of up to 20 minutes we're using
bluetooth smart standard radio
technology the Tokyo edition features
GPS and a cool HD camera and the special
guru edition features 4G LTE for
infinite range of course there will be
an SDK available we finish the design of
our new gaming rose we're just about to
start production now we need your help
to take off we hope you join us thanks
do more to be able to track your
movements and follow you around to be
able to bowl strikes for you to be able
to fly custom routes autonomously and
free from a remote code rijn is the
drone that can be programmed to do
anything you want it's part code and
part drone if you've ever wanted to
learn how to code there's never been a
better time to start because with code
room your code can fly and come alive
we've partnered with by robot to launch
a high quality drone that is both
affordable and easy to program the kit
comes with all the parts you need to
build and code for your very own drone
you can program your drone to fly within
minutes after assembly out of the box
our community site offers more than just
easy-to-follow tutorials and videos you
can receive additional help share new
creations and connect with other robot
lovers learning how to fly drones and
code is now more fun and accessible than
ever before because of the previous
success of our Kickstarter campaign co
drone is already a reality we at Robo
link are a team of designers engineers
and teachers united by our love for
building robots and we are continuing to
develop and optimize the best drone
coding experience possible supporting co
drone means you're not just getting an
awesome drone but also investing in
learning a valuable new skill with
unlimited possibilities so get coding
and take flight that's the code row
there are rip current warnings this
morning for swimmers on both coasts in
Southern California a middle-aged man
was found facedown in the water off
Malibu lifeguards and other surfers
tried to save him but he later died it's
one of the oceans most deadly threats
more deadly than lightning hurricanes
and tornadoes combined in an average
year it is a rip from film our
lifeguards this morning for care for
swimmers who are willing to brave the
ocean despite warnings of dangerous rip
currents channels of water that can drag
the unwitting far out to sea big nine a
lucrative a key welcome to project
Riptide for the past couple months we've
become aware that tens of thousands of
swimmers in the United States were
cotton rip tides last year currently the
only solution to this problem is another
human being risking their life to
venture into the Riptide to save the
swimmer in crisis we plan to use drone
technology to add to the arsenal of the
lifeguard our mission here across
Riptide is to save lives in the best
most efficient way possible here we've
got all these waves right through all
that white water coming in piles up
along the beach
comes along and it goes out right behind
us
gaap see behind me is your return
groans of everywhere it's about a
million in on the air today run our
robotics class our teacher introduced us
farm mentor Phil theater he told us that
the primary use for drums is photography
he then posed the question what if they
give you something more riptide is a
drone accessory that can carry an
automatically inflating life room to a
swimmer in trouble in just a few seconds
Riptide isn't a drum as an accessory
designed to attach to existing drums in
just a few seconds the device is super
simple to operate and can be deployed in
less than a minute Riptide isn't meant
to replace lifeguards or other
life-saving program but we think it can
be used to augment the other life-saving
tools that are already used now anyone
with a drone can be like our team is
prized of several high school seniors in
one successful business owner and
entrepreneur we the students are in
charge of programming developing and
producing this solution while the
business owner provides advice and
guidance we are proud to say we can make
a difference in the world at this young
age we use 3d printed parts to carry a
depleted lieferung that can be folded
into a package that weighs 385 grams
this package carriers a co2 canister
that will cause drink to inflate as soon
as it makes contact with the water there
are multiple ways Roger grips I could be
used water rescue highest rescue voting
rescue or any other activity on the
water ripped I can also be used to save
your drone when flying over water the
Reptoid device will imply automatically
and save your drone in the event of an
unscheduled water land
we thought that combining a compact life
raft like this with a common drone like
this we could save someone's life
there's a half a million of these drums
in the year today that means that's a
half a million potential lifeguards
right so it's got these little holes in
it and when though when it fills with
water that green tablet that you see in
there is made out of salt and it
instantly dissolves and when it
dissolves it fires a little spring that
pokes a hole in this gas cartridge and
boot inflates the life raft in five
seconds even if you don't own a drone
when you back our project you can help
save a life
reinvention that represents a marked
enhancement over rigid in cage protected
drones where drone ball go sets itself
apart is with its fully flexible ball
shaped outer cage and its patent-pending
stabilization system these innovations
allowed room ball go to remain stable on
its multi-axis running ring track making
it crash happy yes it's a literally
impossible to crash the cage didn't
rigid protected drones currently on the
market are adversely affected by
collisions since they are not decoupled
from their protective cages and usually
cannot recover before hitting the ground
drone ball go is a high-speed
high-powered brushless technology drone
that's miles ahead in terms of
innovation and fun other cutting-edge
professional grade components include
1080p camera gps brushless motors hobby
grade advanced flight controller thanks
to its intelligently designed rotating
frame drum ball go bounces in rolls
effortlessly this special design allows
for a small 34 centimeter diameter outer
cage enabling drone ball go to access
tight spaces that other drones can't
also thrown ball goes running track is
fixed in position and the cage bars in
front of the camera are minimized
ensuring a clear camera view drone ball
goes remarkable stability allows it to
drive fly scale walls and zoom across
the ceiling in full six axis of
direction drone ball go has a 400-meter
fpv operational range and a 400-meter
2.4 gigahertz range you can even conduct
building inspections beyond
line-of-sight thanks to real time lag
free video streaming direct to the LCD
screen supporting all of this technology
is drone ball goes quick release easy to
change low-cost rechargeable lipo 3s
battery which allows for 10 minutes of
flight time and minimizes downtime
hi I'm Andrew and I'm excited to tell
you about our new product drone ball
this proven concept has been in
development for 18 months we're now
ready for production that sort of junk
parts should deal with walkera drone
ball go really offers an invincible
feeling it lets you fly roll and bounce
wherever you please unintel control
that's our patent-pending stabilizing
room Joe borgo nimble in set like
reflexes make it a lot fun to operate as
it constantly adjusted surroundings by
the flying or rolling these innovative
mechanics are complemented by drone ball
goes ability to operate beyond
line-of-sight drone borgo that's exactly
what it says on the box with reliable
5.8 gigahertz real-time video feed a
built-in 5 inch LCD display
incompatibility with fpv bubbles for a
full immersive experience and whether
used during ball go professionally of
the fun you're getting an all-in-one
plus leading products we're happy we
drain ball goes current design and with
your help we can make the necessary of
mold to leave and product development
investment it will make jungle girl
reality drone ball go can be deployed
indoors or outdoors incorporate auto
takeoff landing in altitude hold and its
protective cage makes it safer people
and animals with your help trivago will
usher in a new era of drone technology
one that can be enjoyed by everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
