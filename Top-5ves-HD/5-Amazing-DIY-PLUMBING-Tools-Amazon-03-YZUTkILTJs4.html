all the power of a corded tool if not
more it's all electronic
there's no brushes there's no
maintenance on it it's the stuff that's
coming around in the future I was
surprised at how good it was I I kind of
expected there to be at least a little
bit of a drop-off come accorded to this
one but I could find none whatsoever
still cut everything that I needed to
and and more I mean there's a huge
benefit to not having to string cords Oh
in the past I've used other cordless
band saws and they just haven't had the
power and the battery life builds pretty
quick the new fuel saw has the power and
battery lights that I need to get
through anything that I need to cut the
most amazing tool I've ever used now you
can do everything on the lift it saves
time and cuts fast haven't run through a
battery in one day yet the fuel more
versatile don't have to always have a
cord really accurate speeds are higher
to cut with I would carry this tool
around with me all the time it has such
a universal use to it that's that's the
huge benefit to it I can do so much with
it and I mean it's built like a ride in
Milwaukee tool
