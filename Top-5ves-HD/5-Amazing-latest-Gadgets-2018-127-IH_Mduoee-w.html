exciting news for you guys today we are
filmmakers and for the longest time we
wanted gear for our phones that matches
the quality of our big cameras and today
we're super stoked because we finally
have that we are introducing the moment
filmmaker collection it's hand alright
so why are we so excited about today and
what is the filmmaker collection
essentially we have a few different
products if you haven't scroll down the
page yet to check them out we have an
iPhone 10 battery case a universal
gimbal counterweight and a filter mount
and last but certainly not least an
anamorphic lens
what this is on a phone but if you're
still not convinced or want to see what
an anamorphic lens really looks like how
it works how all this collection really
comes together stick around on this
video and we're gonna show you all of
that so all right so let's talk
anamorphic lens
why are we so hyped on this why do we
think all of you guys will love this
lens and if you're a mobile filmmaker
why you should shoot on anamorphic so
you know in everyone's videos when
they're like alright it's gonna look
cinematic and they put in black bars on
the top and bottom of their image all
they're really doing is covering up the
image to give the look of what this lens
does naturally so this lens also gives
you those trademark anamorphic flares
that you see in like Hollywood movies
when you're going by the cop cars or the
sci-fi movies you get that awesome like
blue flare that goes sideways across the
screen yeah we love that too and you can
probably see it from most of the footage
in this video that we are just flare
hunting
cool sunset spot and you know here at
the right spot when you see a bunch of
people on tribal we came to her body
this filter mounts specific for the
anamorphic lens because it's like a
rectangle so literally just swishes
right on there and you're searching star
sac
that's pretty snazzy - initial
impressions are great have a look at
