and what is in that roller working as
well as it once did but it needn't be
like that this brush is just dissolved
but it works like new so what's the
difference
simple the dandy pro cleaning system for
brushes and rollers look he's just
painted this banister Magnolia and next
he's going to repaint this radiator blue
but there's no need to change brushes
just watch this step one
he just clips the brush into the dandy
probe and spins in a container to catch
the paint about seven seconds is all
that's needed step two
for this oil-based paint he washes the
brush in white spirit step three he
spins again for another seven seconds or
so there is no step four it's as simple
as that there's not a trace of the
Magnolia paint left not even right down
between the bristles so it's straight on
with the blue paint in less than a
minute without a hint of Magnolia
let's face it the worst part of staining
any deck is all those hard-to-reach
nooks and crannies that can take hours
to finish and often have unsatisfactory
results that's what the wood mates
contour and double end stain applicators
were designed for the contour stain
applicator gives the user the easiest
and fastest way to stain balusters
handrails spindles and other contoured
surfaces it can even flex out to be used
as a brush nearly every deck has
Troublesome angles and spots that are
almost impossible to stain effectively
the double end applicator makes staining
these areas simple ensuring the entire
deck is protected our deck is pretty big
so we're using the 12 inch premier our
most robust deck staining solution the
extra wide pad stains two boards at once
to get the job done fast
our unique edging guides provide clean
crisp edges and keep staying off your
home siding the built-in gap tool stains
gaps between boards via a locking 180Â°
swivel head and the front wrap pad also
stains side boards stairs kick plates
and other raised surfaces finally wood
mates flextech foam pads save you time
because they hold and release more stain
than ordinary pads they are tear
resistant and replaceable and with the
hook and loop system zipping pads off
for easy cleaning and reuse is a snap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
