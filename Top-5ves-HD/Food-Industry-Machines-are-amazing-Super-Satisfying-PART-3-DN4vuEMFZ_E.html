today I'm going to introduce you to the
top six amazing food industry machines
that will make your production faster so
stay connected to the last number six
Peck machina biscuit production the
dough mixer produces soft or hard paste
as per your requirements the rollers
consistently keep mixing the paste and
discard the product to reuse moving
further dough is transferred to a dough
thinning group
it works with the logic of passing the
dough between the roller and gradually
thinning it the thickness can be
controlled via the touchscreen according
to the requirement the equipment can be
set to give the dough the shape of the
biscuit the equipment works on dual mode
hard mode to produce hard biscuits and
soft mode for softer the biscuits can be
baked using the direct flame oven or
indirect fire oven the direct flame oven
can cook all kinds of biscuits except
for the cake here the biscuit is cooked
using flame located in the cooking
chamber the indirect fire oven can cook
anything including a cake in this oven
the biscuit is baked passing through a
hot air cycle
number-5 Toblerone chocolate bar
following a traditional recipe a giant
roaster heats up cocoa beans until they
turn dark brown it then peels crushes
and grinds the beans until they look
like liquid chocolate moving further a
machine mixes other ingredients like
sugar and milk powder the chocolate
dough is still not ready another machine
keeps melting it so ingredients are
ground very fine and small large
containers constantly stir the chocolate
liquid and make it softer like cream in
the end the small pieces of nougat the
mixture of honey and sugar are poured
into the liquid
finally some small triangles come out
and are sent to a roller to be packed
here it is the yummy tasty Toblerone
triangles number four finish onion
processing and peeling onions are fed by
an automatic feeding belt and
consistently being transported to upward
sliding plates that carry onions to
another section
in this section continuously rotating
wheels set onions top tail wise now the
onions are brought into indexing plates
the advanced feature of the peeling
machine removes the top and tail of
onions in the next section rotating
axles blow off the brown skin with a
minimum of compressed air the peeled
onions are then taken to the next unit
where rotating axles separate the
uncovered onions in the final stage
these onions are sliced and cut in
various sizes and transported to the
last unit where the packing machines
seal them in plastic bags
number three baked on gear wheel
depositor high accuracy in depositing is
controlled by gear wheels a variety of
attachments allow you the option to
choose different shapes for cookie dough
to prevent tripping the gear can be
turned backward the movement of the
nozzle can be controlled by a
programmable controller that is equipped
by drop TT
the multitasking depositor is also
convenient to cover a bread sheet with
marzipan or more b-type or you can use
it for overlaying cream or butter
drop TT is able to work with 50 products
using the various language supported
touchscreen the parameters like
depositing volume speed vacuum and
production speed is changeable number 2
mic sells potato chip factory
the potatoes are poured in a large
pillar with a rough surface while the
potatoes are spinning the moveable
pillars remove the potato skin when it
is done in the next step quality and
size are inspected by human hands
and the slicer potatoes are cut in
accurate size and style
the slices are washed and taken to dry
for removing the excess water
the removed slices or potato scrapes are
sent to farmers for animal feed
the potato slices are sent to heated oil
where they are fried in 330 degree
temperature this is the reason behind
the crunchy taste the fried chips are
now moving to qualify the final cooking
process in which they are sent to a
revolving roller for adding delicious
spice
now the delicious chips are taken to a
packaging machine where the chips are
distributed to preset plastic bags
the final bags need to pass one more
examination if a bag is too heavy or too
light it is dropped down by a blast of
air in the end the qualified bags are
packed in reusable paper boxes and sent
for delivery
number one apple juice production a
large amount of harvested apples are
shaken and drop down using high-tech
machines millions of apples are carried
via trucks a car or other vehicle they
are continuously thrown into flowing
water in order to remove soil or other
harmful components after washing apples
are transformed into mass the mass is
heading to the powerful pumps where the
Apple liquid is pressed out and sent to
another unit through the tubes every
year about 6 billion litres of apple
juice is manufactured in Germany before
resuming the process the quality and
components of the juice sample is
examined the process is done by
high-tech equipment under expert
supervision
initially the liquid is unclear or
cloudy
the advanced saturation process filters
the juice and then the natural golden
yellow color appears the freshly
squeezed juice is concentrated by
evaporating its water content and stored
in its natural color
now the extracted juice is ready to be
bottled before going into the bottle the
juice needs to heat up to 85 degrees
this 85 degree heat breaks the process
of fermentation and maintains the flavor
and nutrition of the apple juice you pay
for
now the packed bottles are sent for
cooling down the temperature and finally
the labeling process ends the journey
