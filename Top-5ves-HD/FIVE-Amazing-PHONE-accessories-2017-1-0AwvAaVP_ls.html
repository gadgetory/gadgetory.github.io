okay so all of us own a few phone
accessories right and some of them can
actually do some really impressive
things but right now if I asked you to
get one you'd probably say I don't have
it with me so most of the time you end
up leaning your phone against some
random object instead of actually using
that expensive tripod that you left at
home so because there weren't any real
solutions we made our own and back in
2013 we launched our first Kickstarter
campaign for the pocket tripod a fully
adjustable stand for your iphone and
holds our device in both portrait and
landscape without covering the school
asked part is that it transforms into
the size of a couple of credit cards and
hides away in any wallet or purse until
you need it again people loved it we
raised more than our hunting goal by
almost double and even Apple co-founder
Steve Wozniak the was said why didn't
someone do this one for what a great
idea that I wish I thought I put one of
them in my backpack which is always with
then a few of our very clever backers
realize something that we missed told us
I've got a case on my phone I'm not
going to take it off every time that's
just too much work and someone else it
so what you guys some kind of Apple
fanboys you know some people rock
Android right back got us thinking can't
make a pocket tripod for every phone
case model out there there's at least a
million different combinations who knows
so as soon as we shift all rewards to
our two and a half thousand backers we
started working on a universal pocket
try body instead of limiting it to only
bear iphones for months we studied
chases us got feedback from our backers
and tested ideas once we had a universal
opening shape we made it in a range of
sizes so that it fits as many case in
phone combinations
this is the new universal pocket tripod
does it work with the Apple silicone
case perfectly how about the Galaxy Note
yep towards fantastic and landscape and
halfway in portrait does it work with
every case almost unless it's gigantic
we've also created this guy that lets
you know exactly what pocket tripod you
need just by knowing with case and
device combination okay but what if I
like it bare but also sometimes with
protection do nhe pocket tripods nope
because whenever you swap your case or
your phone you can also get the adapters
to match their new size good to go the
pocket tripods been used and tested from
the past two years by thousands of
people worldwide they use it as their
primary tripod every day to take amazing
timelapses for making video calls and
even to create light paintings we've
made the pocket tripod with the highest
standards of engineering materials and
manufactured they say the best camera is
the one that's wiki and the same is true
when it comes to tripods the pocket
tripod is now a proven product and with
your help we want to make it one of the
most practical smartphone accessories
for as many people as we can we hope you
join us thank you
you
let us introduce charges the world's
most advanced universal travel adapter
that also charges your mobile devices
without any additional chargers it works
in the USA UK Europe Australia and over
150 other countries the idea was born
out of the everyday struggle of people
on the go every time I go on holiday I
want to focus on what to wear but I also
have to carry around a lot of devices
that I don't want to think about but I
can't live without or when I am on an
important business trip abroad and I
want less luggage but I need my smart
gadgets all these devices require many
chargers that take up half of my space
and don't forget the countless number of
adapters around the world yeah I always
get those confused and there are never
enough outlets in hotel rooms to charge
all my devices at once that never
happens anymore because we have charges
charges conforms to plug standards in

the same time

the same charging standards charges also
has three additional USB ports to make
it the most convenient universal travel
adapter and you still have the outlet
ready to use in addition we created the
charges bank it's a power bank that
charges my phone up to three times and
has a USB port for any other device it's
been a great journey so far we'd beta
tested our ideas and pack them into an
awesome compact design we built the PCB
and model the design then we 3d print it
and test it some more this led to the
final working prototype that we sent out
to 10 people to test for two weeks we
got their feedback and now we are ready
to go into mass production I love
traveler world I always find
difficulties in the outlook standards of
each new country to I visit yeah I found
charges and solve that problem forever I
