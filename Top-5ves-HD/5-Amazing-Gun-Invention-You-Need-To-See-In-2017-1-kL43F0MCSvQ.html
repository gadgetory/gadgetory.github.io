mounted to the top of the weapon
there is no obstruction to the sight
picture for the operator and there's no
obstruction to the functionality of the
weapon or the rail system it still
allows an officer the ability to attach
a flashlight on their weapon once the
weapon is fired the bullet travels down
the barrel embedding itself inside the
alloy projectile with no chance of
escaping instantly becoming one solid
unit the projectile immediately
separates from the weapon as the docking
unit is instantly ejected then a new
bullet is cycled in for follow-up shots
if necessary
the alternative is as accurate as the
operator using it once the projectile
impacts the threat it will send a shock
wave of pain to the suspect without the
internal damage that of penetrating
bullet would cause and now here's a
simulation of police training and when
to utilize the alternative the salvo 12
contains a system of rods and baffles to
contain the blast of a shotgun
the rods allow gas to escape into the
baffles while preserving the function of
the wad after it exits the barrel
the modular system of Rods baffles and
caps allows for the customization of the
salvo 12 depending on your desired
weight and noise reduction specs this
also allows for easy cleaning of the
suppressor
we have seen significant reduction in
decibel levels making the blast of a
shotgun quieter than an unsuppressed 22
rifle
the salvo 12 also significantly improves
the perceived recoil of a shotgun making
shooting a more enjoyable experience for
all the salvo 12 attaches to your
shotgun through a removable choke system
a variety of chokes are available to fit
your specific weapon
always be prepared have to be trained
you are your gun scene
when it's not on you you want to know
it's secure and accessible safes are not
always accessible or easy to open
especially in the dark and locks are
nuisance to operate as for smart guns
while smart guns are a dangerous concept
taking an unreliable technology and
embedding it into your gun is not a
smart decision our mission is to bring
you the perfect solution introducing
sorex the new generation of gun storage
saw Rex's caliber specific and has two
modes the first mode is awareness if
someone tries to tamper with your gun
you're immediately alerted and when you
need your gun charging it will eject
sorex
and chamber a fresh round the second
mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel szura's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it
you can also open zorax from your phone
but you can only lock it by physically
pressing the lock button zorax normally
communicates with your phone directly
through bluetooth it also comes with a
zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2 Wi-Fi router
when plugged into the wall near your gun
you'll be made aware from anywhere in
the world if your gun is being tampered
with now if your home is your safe and
you don't lock your gun but you still
want alerts we have a solution the zone
watchdog the door watchdog is not a lock
but rather a notification device its
sole purpose is to notify you if your
weapon is tampered with sole purpose is
to notify you
and here today I'm tell about my project
called rubberband mission
my 16 Reynolds machine gun is
constructed according to the Gotham skin
the final speed of which is 14 shots per
second and maximum emission in 672
robbers so this machine gun hit the
program operator on the record it's very
easy to change your machine gun you just
need two strange rubber bands one by one
what are the forms but in fact it takes
a lot of time so this is the machine gun
I created a special fast charging device
using this device you can charge the
machine gun in meals just mount a bunch
of rubber bands onto the fast charger
attach it to the world and start to
charge a gun put in bands per second now
you can enjoy the shooting not wasting
too much time under church to get the
record ammunition on 672 robbers it is
necessary to put on each for free
robbers you can do both single shots
with one two robbers or in turn
only to do is Charlie Michigan and
majoring in cars
no matter who your family is we all want
to keep the people we love safe and
that's why we made salt the first safe
gun for a safe home hi I'm Adam this is
Andy we're the creators of salt salt is
a gun but it's not like any gun that
you've ever seen it was designed around
the belief that a firearm shouldn't have
to take a life in order to protect a
life from that simple idea we started by
completely rethinking the bullet instead
of LED salt was designed to shoot a
specialized round filled with a powerful
toxin so instead of killing the target
salt opens up on impact in a cloud that
instantly causes respiratory and visual
distress so while an intruder or a
curious child will be incapacitated
encounter wouldn't be fatal
this rethink also lets salt be used not
only offensively but defensively as well
so if an intruder is kicking down your
door
salt allows you to shoot the area around
it before the danger is on top of you
this creates a protective cloud of toxin
between you and the intruder before he's
ever a threat to you or your family our
last big idea was to make salt easy to
use for everyone so we replace the
violent bang of black powder with the
silent power of compressed air the
result is a fear free user experience so
the only person that should have
anything to be scared of is an intruder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
