run out of it
either because we choose to enjoy nature
away from the grid or in disaster
scenarios the grid chooses to get away
from us that's why we designed this the
callee pack of portable solar energy
kits that meets dozens of off-grid
energy needs nature trails photography
trips all-day picnics disaster scenarios
and electricity shutdowns daily use in
areas with unstable electricity supply
the callee pack is completely autonomous
and can fully charge from either the Sun
a car or a wall charger it's 38 a H
battery is powerful enough to charge
your iPhone up to 120 times and powerful
enough to provide energy for our entire
set for a whole day including a fridge
until we ran out of beer you can even
add a rain cover to keep the power going
in case of rain in a Bluetooth app for
easy management when designing the
callee packs our team focused on
developing a seamless off-grid user
experience with an all-inclusive kit an
optional daisy chain solar panel for
double charging power a cool app and
storage for your devices and accessories
the calli pack is a must for every
off-grid scenario fully portable
it provides you with Metro free energy
wherever and whenever so may the power
be with you when you need it
hi I'm andreas peernock and I'm here at
our labs at the National Design Centre
in Singapore to tell you about Korea pop
and really cool 3d pen that we are
working on we have been following the
space of personal fabrication for quite
some time and the evolution has really
been amazing just think about what has
happened with 3d printers and 3d pans
however there are a couple of problems
specifically when you look at 3d pan all
of the pans out there melt plastic too
dangerously hot temperatures just think
about what would happen if someone gets
melting plastic onto your skin or into
their eyes it would be really bad in
addition we get a quite unpleasant smell
when you use pans that melt plastic it's
simply not nice in a home environment
that's how we started thinking would it
be possible to do things in a different
way couldn't we make a 3d pen without
hot plastic and without the bad smell
this is our Korea pop was born we came
up with the idea of using
light-sensitive ink that is solidified
by shining ultraviolet light on it in
the industry this is called photo
polymers with Korea puffs you get a 3d
pen without any hot parts without any
melting plastic and without any bad
smell with Korea pop cooling pops up
magically people just love to create
things we see this all the time with
artists and with designers we also see
it with kids to love coloring books Lego
and clay dough Korea pop is the perfect
tool for anyone who wants to create
their own designs in different shapes
and different colors with Korea pop you
can use some really cool ink we have
inked in
different colors so you can create multi
color design we are ink that is elastic
so you can make a dress for a Barbie
doll there is magnetic ink that you can
use for making fridge or whiteboard
magnets
we have aimed that glows in the dark
if you want to make objects that radiate
light in a dark room you can use our
aromatic ink to make items that smell
good for your car or for your bathroom
we have got ink that changes color with
temperature so you can for example paint
a teacup and see how it changes color
when you pour in hot water
we have ink that conducts electricity
that you can use for science experiments
and since Korea pop is using cooling we
have got body paint ink to make tattoos
and hammer designs you can use Korea pop
in different ways you can use it just
like a regular pen to make lines or you
can also use crea pops to create an
outline and then fill it with ink of a
different color or with a different
property when you use Korea pop like
this it feels more like a brush than
like using a pen Korea deposits cordless
and battery operated there is no cable
getting in the way of designs you charge
clear pop using micro USB so you can use
it anywhere in the world as long as you
have access to a computer or micro USB
adapter we started working on Korea pop
last year and this is what a first
prototype looks like and this is what
career path looks like today as you can
see we've gotten rid of the cord and we
made improvements to the design over the
next few months we'll make further
improvements to the design and to the
functionality until Korea pop is ready
to the ship we have come quite far
already and now we need your help to
make clear popper reality if you think
Korea pop is cool please sign up from
Korea pop comm for our early bird offer
thank you
you

use your hands see for any other part of
your body to keep it in the air patented
motion sensing technology that's what's

manual trigger control and see how close
you can get to the ceiling or floor

can you save fly autoflight an awesome
light show only hi I'm Daniel from
engineer bowl after the release of our
product focus shifter users requested an
additional handle for operating the zoom
without Paula focus accessories blend
shifter is the solution designed for
both photographers and videographers
blend shift to provide smoother more
precise focusing and zooming
photographers used lens shifter to
fine-tune their focus and zoom quickly
to capture that perfect shot it's quick
and easy to install and videographers
use lens shifter to precisely adjust
focus and zoom red and blue colors make
it simple to distinguish between each
function using the included balanced
counterweight the lens sugar stays in
place when the camera is moved and can
be stored away ready for your next shoot
it just gives you that mechanical
advantage and look at that that doesn't
mean you can't make that move really
it's great definitely have to know every
starting videographer should have in
their camp I really do love the smooth
motion you get if you take this on one
shoot and use it for three shots you'll
have gotten your money back focus on
your craft using lunch shifter thank you
for your continued support
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
