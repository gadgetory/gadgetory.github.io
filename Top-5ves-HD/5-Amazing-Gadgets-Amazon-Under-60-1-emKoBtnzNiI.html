you
sitting we do it for over nine hours
every single day and because of the way
we're doing it 90% of us will get back
pain in our lives
seriously when we hunch and slump it
affects our mood our happiness even how
optimistic we feel look at yourself
right now
how are you sitting how's your back and
your neck probably not too great huh hi
my name is Catherine and I started
working on my posture two and a half
years ago when I started having terrible
sciatica pain I have spent so much time
and money on doctors visits therapy
special pillows and all these ridiculous
products but I couldn't find anything
that just worked so for the past year
I've been creating a real solution with
the most amazing designers and
prototypers and dozens and dozens of
people with really bad backs it was
important to create something small
enough I could fit in my purse and
something effortless so I could just
count on it working in five seconds flat
something reliable and something that
would help me improve my posture even
when I wasn't wearing it this is better
back it allows you to effortlessly sit
in perfect posture easing back pain and
training yourself how to sit use it when
you're sitting at your desk on an
airplane watching a game or even when
you meditate basically use it anytime
you have to sit you don't have to go far
to find people with bad posture or back
pain a friend a parent someone you work
with or even people you meet product
testing around San Francisco every
Friday here's what people think about
better back
oh so that's how the palabra feels off I
mean feels awesome it's so easy to just
sit up straight this is gonna sound
weird back and like feel my my body you
know I can feel my my organs not being
squished I can feel that it's right here
but it's not like oh I have all this on
me it's just like I am just like
relieved pain-free I'm sitting straight
upright it's like it forces your torso
to stay upright where can I get one of
these can I have this one simple it's
easy I put it on and I feel immediate
relief so that's how it feels and this
is how it's actually helping betterback
gives you better posture it allows you
to not fatigue the muscles that you use
when you're sitting down so when you do
stand up your posture is literally
changed good posture can change who you
are it affects your attitude it affects
your decision making good posture
changes who you are literally sitting
correctly over time does more than stop
slumping stress on your spine it also
retrains your body's natural default
posture so whether you're standing or
sitting without better back your posture
is greatly improved let me show you how
it works better bag zips itself into a
portable case throw it in your bag and
unpack it when you're ready to sit wrap
the back pad around your back and the
new straps around your knees all there's
left to do is to pull on the adjustable
leg straps to stack your spine into
perfect posture so if you're going to
spend nine hours of your day sitting you
might as well be doing it right when
you're pain free and your body is
perfectly aligned you feel happier more
confident and you regain your ability to
focus on whatever it is you want out of
life
