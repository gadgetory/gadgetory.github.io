are found all the time in dressing rooms
hotel rooms public bathrooms apartments
locker rooms and places you didn't think
possible

concerns of privacy invasion by
instantly uncovering all hidden camera
lenses which are spying on you this
easy-to-use pocket-sized detector can go
along with you anywhere to use the spy
finder pro look through the viewfinder

they may be now with maxie boost LED
technology there are three LED intensity
modes that allow you to better control
and hone in on the area you are sleeping
pi is best for larger rooms and open
office or living spaces and glow is best
for smaller rooms bathrooms dressing

containers the world's first 100%
platinum silicone reusable he double

was designed with the environment in
mind one zip top can replace over five
thousand plastic baggies which could say
the who knows how many fish it also
might save some sharks too but for a
container that doesn't need a lid it is
worth the risk
and unlike baggies the zip top
containers are tough heat cold cars even
kids can't destroy it and they will try
they will always try but you'll rest
easy knowing that the zip top can take
whatever you throw at or in it need the
store scalding hot soup this laughs in
thesis this makes soup feel bad about
itself look at it stand upright your
liquids are secure now see if you're
worrying for the Sharks plus it's easy
to get excess air out of zip top
containers which will keep your food
fresher longer zip top it's freezer safe
microwave-safe and even oven safe if it
were any safer we'd be calling it Mister
Rogers neighborhood and when you're done
just toss them in the dishwasher
as if tops are fine easy and because
it's 100% platinum silicon it won't lead
to harmful chemicals like plastics can
but maybe you're saying hey I like
leached chemicals in my food this
product is not for you
also please see a doctor and if storing
your food perfectly wasn't enough zip
tops are great for taking meals or
snacks on the go
with eight different shapes and sizes
zip top containers can be used anywhere
