from her unity and I've been skiing
since I can walk I'm especially
passionate about frisky but what I'm not
fashion about is searching for lost ski
gifs now we from / unity have been
developing novel is a Bluetooth device
that helps you find a lost skin faster
in case you lose one in deep snow
additionally Netherlands is also an
empty cache device for your skis
snowboards or other valuable sports
equipment such as your bicycle never
loses aim is to make your time out in
nature memorable we want to let you
enjoy the moment as much as possible
before you go skiing simply attach the
two alarm tracking devices to each
scheme and pair them to your smartphone
using Gucci if a ski detaches from your
boot an alarm will trigger on the never
lose unit now you can hear your loss ski
and locate its exact position never lose
recognizes the separation between skier
and ski through Bluetooth signal
strength in most cases you don't even
need to pull out your phone and freeze
your fingers off never lose also works
as an anti-theft device activate guard
mode on your smartphone before you leave
your skis snowboard or other sports
equipment unattended then it doesn't
matter if you are ten feet or 500 feet
away from your beloved gear never lose
has a built-in acceleration sensor if
disturbed it will recognize the movement
and trigger an alarm this mode does not
require any connection to your
smartphone we have developed a mount for
bicycles to as an advanced security
option for your bike you're never loose
solution can be used in all seasons
year-round never lose is the perfect
option in cities that demand extra bike
security you can define the level of
protection by using a mechanical lock
and additionally movement recognition
was sound the alarm will even sound if a
wire lock is gud join us and getting
never loose on the slopes this season by
supporting our campaign today with your
help we know that we can achieve our
goal of eliminating loss and theft so
that we can all focus on what matters
most when we're on the mountain please
share our campaign with friends and
family and never lose your valuables
again
let's face it water can be lots of fun
until we need to drink it sure we know
it's healthy but it just doesn't taste
as exciting as all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more of that Chuck hey
and that's a problem a very big problem
so we decided to put some fun into
drinking water with the right cup it's
the world's first ever fruit-flavored
cup designed to get people drinking more
water sure it might look simple but it
actually took six years of research and
patented technologies to get where we
are today and we believe it's going to
be a real game-changer so how does it
work well for starters our brain
identifies flavor using two main senses
taste and smell that's why we inserted
innovative fda-approved fruit scent and
flavor directly into the right cup so
when you drink water from it your nose
picks up for fruity aroma your tongue
senses the hint of a sweet taste and
your brain yells when in fact you're
only drinking natural water wow sounds
great but does it work well we asked
ourselves that very same question so we
put the right cup to the test with our
orange flavored prototype
whoa okay wow you're kidding me right
what's in this it's not just water
tastes like something else just water
it's crazy brilliant just brilliant now
that we know that it works let's meet
the team behind the idea for years I've
been researching a lecturing about scent
marketing showing how easy it is to
manipulate the brain with smell when I
was 30 I was diagnosed as diabetes and
my doctors told me to drink only water
but I hated the taste that's when I came
up with the idea for the right cup
after years of research and development
we've reached the stage where we need
your support to turn the right cup into
reality the right cup is great for
anyone who wants to cut down on sugary
drinks and drink more water which is
basically everybody please help us
change lives of millions of people by
supporting our project on IndieGoGo
together we can make a real difference
and turn the world into a better and
healthier place one cup at a time let's
make drinking water fun again

its unique characteristics wake up

coffee in disposable capsules cause up
to 100 euros per kilo for a product you
don't even know the original thanks to

price of 10 disposable capsules you can
make hat to 100 cups of espresso
interesting right but there's more
I'm going to talk to you about the
capsules environmental sustainability in
fact wake up solves the problem of
having to throw away disposable capsules
insofar as they're infinitely recyclable
the only waste product the coffee grinds
which can be recycled in different ways
especially in the home for example as
compost think it's a good idea there's
more
you
I'm going to talk about the third
advantage of wake up capsule the return

revive bus stations and apply them to
the new technologies in fact the capsule
works with any blend on the mark from
the roster down the street to the
supermarket from the organic food shop

also very practical our manual dispenser
allows for quick loading leaving no
residue it takes 30 seconds just enough
time for the machine to warm up the

there's something about being in the
natural world it's like magic it has a
certain feeling to it we all love
technology but what was life like before
it it was an era where people had time
to enjoy the outdoors and soak up
Earth's natural goodness today we live
in a world overflowing with technology
that benefits mankind but what about its
dangers from pollution to radiation to
electromagnetic waves technology affects
the way we think feel and even sleep but
what if there was a way to enjoy your
cell phones tablets and televisions
without the harmful effects introducing
zen cube
the healthiest lab ever inspired by the
purest places on earth we used our
expertise to create and build something
pure that we would be proud of bring the
benefits of the outdoors into where we
spend the most time our homes and
offices being in a waterfall or the
beach or in the countryside gives off
lots of negative ions which is what the
body needs to feel great technology does
the opposite gives off lots of positive
ions which make us feel tired stressed
agitated himalayan salt is one of the
Earth's riches substances Zen q
harnesses lists to bring the benefits of
the outdoors to you it chemically and
physically transforms a room and has
unique healing effects the zen cube is
designed to admit negative ions which
cleans and deodorizes the air reducing
allergies coffee reduces radiation and
neutralizes electromagnetic waves
emitted by technology it's also reduces
static in the air increases energy
levels improves mood and concentration
increases blood and oxygen supply to the
brain resulting a better sleep patterns
Himalayan salt lamps are not new they
traditionally come with their own
problems it often melt their hot to the
touch he's a bottom of tricity and can
be messy not to mention they didn't
always look the best zen cube stays cool
does not melt his long lasting not to
mention its style we wanted it to look
stunning they had to inspire relaxation
a sense of Zen the shape had to be
original but had to be big enough to
exhume the right amount of goodness
remind a single block of pink salt
crystal all the way from the Himalayan
mountains wien case it no robust and
sleek outer shell we fitted it with an
RGB LED light source to have the perfect
glow with amazing efficiency the RGB
bulb is controlled by a nap turn it on
or off change the color or intensity
while setting comfortably on your couch
nature isn't just about the way it looks
but how it feels and smells we also
fitted a an essential oil compartment so
you can smell a pleasant fragrance
everyday looks and functionality weren't
enough materials had to be top-notch as
well the plastic is made of premium
polycarbonate and robust buta thing so
it'll last an even the toughest
conditions
the salt exposed on each side is made
from the best and pure Himalayan crystal
we wanted everyone to have the ability
to add a personal touch so starting from
day one you can choose the color to
match your room we've put our heart and
soul into bringing you the zinc you to
be able to produce it and make it
available we need your support together
