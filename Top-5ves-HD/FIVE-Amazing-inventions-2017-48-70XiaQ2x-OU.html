it was so much fun especially that crazy
setting where it just shoots everywhere
I'm kind of sweating a little bit right
now within 20 seconds I was already
starting to make small adjustments to
how I was holding the paddle it was very
efficient with that started out and it
seems easy but then it got so much
harder I mean there's something for
every skill level I've actually played
pingpong robots before not actually blew
my mind hi kickstarter i'm alex and i'm
harrison me and my brother always tried
to kick each other's ass while we play
ping-pong so we start shooting first

just search for us to smash but later on
we find out with app and software you
can do a lot more you can simulate games
you can create your own drills and the
coolest part is you can share those
drills with anyone in the world three
months ago we decide to join acts which
is the world's largest hardware
accelerated we source a lot of motors
and we also designed all the mechanism
from the ground up to give you the fun
experience that we want you to have we
have talked to many manufacturers now
now the last part it's just cooling and
Kickstarter that's why we need your help
