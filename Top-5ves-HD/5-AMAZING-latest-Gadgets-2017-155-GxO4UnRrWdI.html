our dream is to create the ultimate
virtual reality flying experience we
want you to feel like you're really
there as you glide maneuver and destroy
your enemies to make our dream of
reality we're building the highest
resolution VR headset to date with an
unprecedented 200 degree field of view
introducing Pi max AKA dr when you put
on a conventional VR headset the first
thing you notice is that your vision is
narrow and surrounded by darkness but
with power headsets 200 degrees of view
you get an expansive natural view of the
virtual world so you are free to move
your eyes and use your peripheral vision
to own every corner
or defeat every enemy a view this wide
requires maximum clarity so we're using
a 4k display for each eye totaling over
16 million pixels more than six times
the resolution of current VR headsets
we've worked hard to make pi max a KVR a
smooth experience with a high refresh
rate and low latency even on modest
harder to deliver a complete VR
experience
hi max a KVR support sphere the
positional tracking and includes two
positionally tracked controllers so you
can pick up objects and wield weapons
we've also built in speakers to bring
realistic sound to your experience and
even added optional eye tracking and
hand motion support this isn't yet
another VR hardware product we're
committed to building a complete and
open VR system that's fully compatible
with mainstream VR content platforms and
existing accessories our goal is to make
VR better for everyone so we are
collaborating with industry partners to
foster a culture of open innovation and
the global VR community and we've
already published our open SDK so you
can create your own projects for a KBR
we aren't new to be R we have already
delivered over 30,000 of our PI max 4k
headsets in less than six months we've
built close relationships with
manufacturing partners I've been
traveling around the world demoing our
new a.k headset and getting feedback
from researchers gamers and developers
to make sure that we're building a VR
system that you'll love and we're
already working with partners like
Disneyland to take VR beyond the home by
designing our products with these
amazing experiences in mind we make sure
that they're more than capable of
delivering a world-class home VR
experience we're very excited to launch
our new theater ok data we are looking
for friends and partners to support us
