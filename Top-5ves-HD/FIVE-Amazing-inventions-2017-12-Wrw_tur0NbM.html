mountain bike but all of our gear was
taken up too much room in our garage so
much so that I couldn't park my car in
there many of the storage solutions that

hey we're 30 minutes late sorry it's not
like I'm a master at ironing what's a
big deal get a flipper what a flipper
time is the most valuable thing we have
going to the cleaners or ironing your
shirts on your own takes a really long
time I found iron is difficult after
looking at product in the store I had
the idea of creating and revolutionary
360 degree flipping available we've
shortened the ironing time from eight
minutes to two minutes by eliminating
the unnecessary steps of traditional
ironing we've completely redesigned the
board to the modern consumer featuring
pan clips sleeve detail board and many
other remarkable features and benefits
for the very first time since the 1800s
the ironing board has been completely
redesigned with a human being in mind he
is both side iron both conferred like
human body we need to secure enough
demand to ensure that we can bring this
innovative product to market
in time for the holiday season with your
backing and your support will be able to
make this dream a reality and bring the
flipper to the masses worldwide
you
mr. Smith's please
even I hate that sound then just like me
would likely comes out people helped my
turn up let√≠s what we do mostly is
repairing T's whether it's too late the
germany over 12 million teeth had to be
expected last year we want to change
that I tell all my patients that for
healthy teeth it's mandatory to use
floss or interdental brushes using the
toothbrush only is not enough the
problem is people just hate to do
internet to clean all devices like floss
or irrigator and interdental brushes are
too inconvenient to use them every day
this is why we invented doing wash with
the intelligent feeler you can easily
find the interdental spaces and slide
from one gap to another by pushing the
wing brush together the brush runs
through the fila in between your teeth
we are mark lewis and Barack we founded
our company last year mark and I have a
business background and Louis's a
dentist he convinced us of this
incredible idea combines the easy
handling of an oral irrigator with the
effectivity of an Internet proportion
today the wing brushes the revolution of
into dental cleaning we did a scientific
study on 1,000 interdental spaces and
decided to bring the ring brush on the
market ourselves the results were clear
with the wing brush test process could
reach significantly more interdental
spaces than with a conventional
interdental brush and top the test
persons preferred a wing brush over
common interdental brushes scientific
research has shown that victoria
responsible for the most all diseases if
we find a way to eliminate these
bacteria we are able to prevent carriers
and hold on Titus various cleaning aids
exist to fight this bacteria but how
come that over fifty percent of all
people have periodontitis and ninety-two
percent of all grown-ups head experience
with carriers using floss is cumbersome
it is really hard to reach all
interdental spaces even more important
is that floss does not have effective
cleaning power interdental brushes have
the highest effectivity
unfortunately their usability is more
difficult the wire inside the brush can
hurt your gum and advance in all
directions the winged brush is the
solution
yah fan and fan hamburger is dead the
idiot so simple Lewis divine Tata he is
probably he asked photo to conventions a
group above a half knots at it see one
film I'm over Kazakh mint and they are
one and report in living Russian
following guns education within survived
concurrently collection started we are
ready to start we need your help to
reduce winger support us to really find
a little care make it more simple the
wing brush is just the beginning
I'm just so known a nutshell what is
this all about so what's special about
it yeah everything look at it it's
gorgeous
how do you use it first time you open it
well how do you have you turn it on and
get the music going so simple to connect
you just literally twist it it's the
only moving function on the actual
device twist it select whether you want
wine in or bluetooth pairing up to your
phone and then you're going to get
exploring you'll find the best surface
that you want for you the best surface
for the type of music you're listening
to if you place it on the back of a
window and you'll hear sound through
both sides bigger the surface you're
placing it on as well but bigger the
sound you're going to recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you got
to take home and put them aside and
think it sounds great you're going to
show people that love so the other
feature we've got that's inside there as
well that I think is really quite neat
and so if you're in a space like this
you could place two speakers either side
you've got the stereo sound coming out
of it makes it amazing
we've done things really differently I
think for this campaign we want people
to be able to get hold of this product
quickly we've got 5,000 of the sizer our
products there it's done you want this
by Christmas get it signed up before
december the tenth and worship the eve
of christmas
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
