around town and it keeps you fit and
it's great for the environment but also
often we hear the sad news of cyclists
getting injured every year over 19,000
cyclists are injured in the UK alone
with 75% of these accidents occurring at
junctions as traffic has increased road
vehicles have developed signalling
systems to keep them safe and prevent
accidents this is not the case for
bicycles that still use hand signals not
the best way to be safe and secure as a
team of designers and engineers

lights wing lights are directional
indicators for bicycles the flash amber
at the ends of your handlebars just like
any motor vehicle they are designed to
make sure that you are seen and stay
noticed when it's most needed when
turning or changing lanes in all light
and weather conditions with a single
chap they admit a bright LED amber
signal visible by day and night they are
easy to fit once the mounts are
positioned the wing lights snap on in
seconds and when you secure your bike
they snap off and you leave with them

clear ring with a carabiner to hang
anywhere with multiple usages even as a
hazard light the lightweight aluminium
design makes for a robust water
resistant and durable product that is
both elegant and functional it took us

never gonna have to deal with a dead
phone again the solar bank is a
removable unit which has a solar panel
and a battery with enough power to
charge an iPhone 6 up to 12 times you
can charge the solar bank via USB then

panel keeps the power topped up the
solar bank also has built-in Bluetooth
speakers so you have great sounding
audio with you when you're on the go
life pack has an integrated lock this
means you can lock the zipper shut when
you're on the go and what's really cool
about this lock is that you can actually
unlock the bag to something when you're
sitting still because of the unique
design of the zippers you can also lock
the zipper shut while locking it to a
fixed point the bottom of the cable
cannot be removed and the exit point is
reinforced so it's super strong also the
end of the lock works is a bottle opens

separate section for your laptop iPad

a key hook business cards pens there's

separate pocket so you don't lose
receipts in the life zone is a protected
pocket for your sunglasses is room for
clothes and any of your non-work stuff

compartments on this bag on your
shoulder straps or 2 pockets these are
big enough for credit cards travel cards
