supply the bar of the pipe in the form
of 1/2 inch or 3/4 black iron pipe the
rear jaw slides over the end of the pipe
and can be positioned anywhere along the
pipe as needed for spring-loaded catch
plates inside the rear jaw allow for
quick one-handed positioning but hold
the jaw extremely firmly when released
the front jaw with its Acme threaded
screw and moveable faceplate screws on
to one end of your threaded black iron
pipe
the extra tall legs on the H style pipe
clamp allows for plenty of clearance for
the client handle and your knuckles they
also keep your pipe clamp standing
straight and stable as you work when
using your pipe clamp for glue ups a
strip of painters tape applied to the
top of the pipe keeps excess glue from
sticking which can interfere with the
adjustment of the clamp now you may
think that pipe clamps are a bit old
fashioned but if you know the tricks to
take advantage of them they can add
capabilities to your shop not found in
other styles of clamps to begin with you
can of course always use them in
traditional clamping applications
and they can be assembled onto any
length of pipe you need allowing you to
tailor the size of your clamp to the job
at hand
and you only need a few basic sizes of
pipe because they can be attached end to
end using an inexpensive coupler no need
to keep 12-foot sections of pipe hanging
around your shop that you might only use
once a year
you can connect sections of pipe
together to create as long a clamp as
you need with just the single set of
pipe clamp heads
this saves you from having to buy and
store long pipes that you may use once a
year or less
and allows you to quickly adapt the
clamps and the pipes that you already
own when that oddball clamping job does
come along
and even shorter pipe clamps are
versatile table legs that need to be
cleaned up or carved can be clamped into
your pipe clamp that's being held in a
vise allowing you to adjust your work
angles while leaving the leg free from
obstructions
Desi's h style pipe clamps come in two
sizes to fit 3/4 or 1/2 inch black iron
pipe and can expand your clamping
capabilities in ways you may not have
thought of from traditional clamping
jobs to that once in a blue moon need
they will earn their place in your clamp
