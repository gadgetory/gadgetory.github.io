use the matter port 3d media platform
connect your iPad to the matter port Pro
3d camera the camera host sits on Wi-Fi
network so you can connect and scan
anywhere the matter port capture app
stores the depth and visual data
collected by the camera now you're ready
to start scanning after each scan a
preview will appear on your iPad this
mini-map will help you decide where to
place the camera as you scan
when you're done scanning indicate the
windows and mirrors on the mini-map at
your convenience connect your iPad to
the Internet to upload your job
the Madhupur cloud does the heavy
lifting and will process your data into
a dimensionally accurate 3d model this
takes about one to two hours you're now
ready to view your model you can share
your 3d showcase as a web link or embed
it on your website it's that easy
you
we live in an age of on-demand boobies
can now be watched anywhere anytime on
various devices such as mobile phones
tablets and laptops but with that
there's a problem none have been able to
capture the magic of a cinema movies are
losing their magic but what if we could
have the comfort of watching films at
home but with an experience that would
exceed that of a movie theater
introducing sanera the world's first
fully immersive personal cinema a
headset that brings you an IMAX like
movie experience in the size of a book
while a normal cinema on average gives
you an angle of around 54 degrees the
scenario screen is considerably larger
and on par with a 70 degree angle of the
IMAX screen to guarantee the image
quality on its super wide screen Samara
uses groundbreaking dual 2.5 k displays
with a resolution three times that of a
cinema and eight times that of an iPhone
7 plus
driving such high resolution is beyond
the capabilities of any existing mobile
processors in the market unlike existing
products which split a single screen
into two and only use the central part
of the screen saneras dual screen
architecture utilizes up to 95 percent
of the screen area which achieves four
times the sharpness and fully alleviates
the screen door effect
sanera is also super easy to use it
works like any Android smartphone you
can install your favorite streaming apps
like Netflix or HBO or play from a
microSD card it also works like a TV by
simply connecting the headset to a
blu-ray player gaming console or a
computer with a simple click sanera
upgrades your conventional entertainment
to an immersive and cinematic experience
because of comfortable experience using
sanera has always been one of our top
priorities we designed an ergonomic
hands-free arm to take the weight off
the headset the burden free arm can be
easily adjusted to any position and can
be attached to different surfaces it
allows for a new way of watching movies
burden free truly immersed in the movie
without discomfort
besides video the audio has been
fine-tuned to recreate the acoustics and
sound effects of a movie theater
the scenario 3d mode is easy to turn on
and provides more vivid and brighter 3d
images than those in theaters without
the need for 3d glasses it is a much
better way to watch 3d movie to see we
are lucky to be selected in Fox cons
hardware accelerator program kicked to
real Foxconn is the world's largest
electronics manufacturer and is famous
for producing iPhones for Apple saneras
every step from supplier selection
product design tooling manufacturing and
quality control has Fox cons mentoring
by leveraging Fox cons world-class
supply chain and years of experience we
are unscheduled to deliver a world-class
product with the highest quality we are
the team behind scenario we started this
project because when we returned the big
screen back to movie love us like you so
you can enjoy the true movie experience
anywhere anytime please support us and
be the first to experience the future of
home cinema and furthermore we designed
to stretch goal to make your sanera
more personal so what are you waiting
for peck us

technical video let's tackle it's my
invention so ultimately all in one mail
