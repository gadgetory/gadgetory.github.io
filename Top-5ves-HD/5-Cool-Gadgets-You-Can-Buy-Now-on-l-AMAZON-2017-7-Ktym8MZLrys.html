hello I'm Chuck Martin general manager
of innovation here at Bissell Bissell we
know pets and the message they make
around the home and when it's time to
bathe them
the messes they get even bigger we focus
on cleaning up the messes that Life
brings including the pet messes now
we're bringing these insights to the dog
baiting process the Bissell bark bath
truly is the next generation of bathing
your dog a faster easier and less messy
way thistle strengths are really around
understanding the consumer in the needs
of the consumer especially the pet
parent and we know pets we know how pets
interact with the household and the
messes that they make in a home and we
realized that people are very frustrated
with the bathing process and we took a
look at that and we thought well if
we're cleaning up after the dogs when
they come into the house and they leave
spots and stains on the carpet and
upholstery and we're never really
addressing the animal itself that is
dirty we started taking a look at the
technology and the knowledge we had of
both pets and cleaning and we found this
great new idea and this new concept
about bathing your animal anywhere in
your home so marrying the insights that
we have around the consumer experience
and around the consumer with the
engineering knowledge is the perfect
match as we know pets you know pet
parents we know messes we know dirt bark
bath is really important because it
gives the consumer a new way outside of
their traditional way of bathing to
actually bathe their dog anywhere in the
home that they want whenever they want
what it also allows people to do is
clean more frequently in ten minutes I
can have all three dogs just just a
slight cleaning and the smell goes away
and everything I mean it works great
because you could actually bathe your
dog every other day if you wanted to and
it wouldn't be a chore where we're
before it was a charge of aid three dogs
you can use it in your kitchen and just
within less than 10 minutes you can wash
your dog this is different because we're
actually changing the way that you wash
the animal normally you would wash from
the fur down and what we're doing is
we're cleaning from the skin up that's
how we can actually use less water
because in a traditional bathtub method
of
you use about 19 gallons of water to
wash an 80 pound dog we use less than 48
ounces of water because we're much more
efficient at the process so our no rinse
shampoo is really unique because it
doesn't have a lot of the harsh
chemicals that other shampoos might is
and it's really safe and effective on
the animal are you gonna give yourself a
bath it was perfect
there was no mess and that was about an
hour shorter than what it would have
taken me to give him a normal bath it
was great and he dried a lot faster when
I first saw the product I thought that
there was no way that this was actually
gonna work on Oreo she just got too much
care it really really worked good it's
better for the homeowner because they'll
use a lot less water it's better for the
homeowner because they won't have to
wrestle the dog to get them in and out
of the bathtub and it really delivers on
the promise that it's supposed to give
to the pet parent which is we're going
to take care of your dog in a way that's
never been done it's easier for you and
easier for your dog please join us in
this new adventure in caring for your
dog be one of the first to get your bark
bath order now and keep checking back
with us as we'll be posting new videos
and updates
