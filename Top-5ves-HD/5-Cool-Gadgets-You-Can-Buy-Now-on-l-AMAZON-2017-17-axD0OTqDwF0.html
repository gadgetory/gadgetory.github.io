better making good iced coffee at home
quickly is nearly impossible until now
we've all been stuck with two main
options use a cold brew recipe that
actually takes all day to make or try a
brew over ice recipe that's so
ridiculous you'd think it was written by
a chemist I've tried them both and I
went back to spending time and money
each day to swing by the coffee shop
that was until last year when I came up
with a better solution the hyper chiller
is a simple patent-pending product that
enables you to turn fresh hot coffee in
the perfect iced coffee in one minute
flat the hyper chiller was designed to
be compatible with my single serve
brewer and all other traditional brewing
methods it works when the hot coffee
flows into the center cooling chamber
which is surrounded with food grade
stainless steel and ice on all sides the
surface area to volume ratio and they're
through the roof so the hot coffee is
cooled by over 130 degrees in one minute
with 0 dilution at that point it's cold
enough to pour into your regular glass
over ice and will still be strong or you
can just leave it in the hyper chiller a
bit longer and it'll be cold enough to
drink without any ice at all convenience
was a big influence on creating the
hyper children it's completely machine
washable and constructed of durable
stainless steel and bpa-free plastic I
like a big cup so I made sure it can
hold a lot it can chill up to 12 and a
half ounces at once start saving time
and money and enjoy perfect iced coffee
at home today
you
everyone goes what at the end of a
rainbow a unicorn but it's beautiful as
you know what you don't know is it makes
your poop smell good really good humans
have been pooping for over 100 years
it's embarrassing terrorizing toilets
and making things messier than unicorns
playing leapfrog and the smell isn't
just men even a duchess can drop a puke
with all that shame that comes with it
the problem is nothing gets rid of the
stench not candles not chemicals not
together even toilet sprays only block
what's below the water not above so in
the end we fight go to the honorable way
by blaming it on a baby you stink what
one day we had an approval what about a
product that truly makes poop smell good
introducing unicorn gold from squatty
potty the before you squat toilets pray
to slave poo stink each time a unicorn
custard skittles we bottle a data source
and send it to you beautiful yeah like a
Monet masterpiece if Monet were a magic
spotting horse you look on gold
eliminate odor into eco-friendly ways
first like other sprays it forms a film
on the water before you squash just miss
it onto the surface and when you pay
your taxes to Prince John the odors get
tracked but unlike other sprays unicorn
gold also protects the drop so our
patented formula is infused with gold
molecules by gold because gold molecules
are scientifically proven to cling like
magnets to poop fumes and transform them
in the air obliterated odor somewhere
under the rainbow now you don't have to
smell the icebergs stalactites mud
slides or anacondas unicorn gold has got
you covered
Oh before a unicorn go every time I
released for fracking a woodland
creature died but with unicorn go they
simply smell the natural blend of
essential oils unicorn gold comes in a
delightful array of magical sets citrus
squeezed tropical tropical pinch of
vanilla mystic forest and fruity boogie
excuse you and thank you unicorn gold is
not a joke it's real it has real
freaking gold and it's fresher than a
prince of bel-air so for the best
smelling poop of your life go to unicorn
gold calm and order your spray today if
it doesn't completely extinguish your
stench we'll give your money back no
buts about it but your butt will be all
about it
why are we so confident because studies
show unicorn gold lost virtually all
Marylanders stench gone embarrassment
gone unicorn gold has an average Amazon
rating a core point 9 star gatekeeper is
a wireless key fobs it automatically
locks your computer when you walk away
when you walk back to keeper will have
unlocked a computer by the time you sat
down
thanks to gatekeeper your computer is
never left unlocked and vulnerable to
snooping you don't have to waste any
valuable time locking and unlocking your
PC when you get up from your computer
there's nothing to stop a colleague
helping themselves with gatekeeper the
computer will lock as soon as you leave
your desk using gatekeeper couldn't be
easier simply insert the included
battery and download the software pad
the dongle and you're ready to go there
are three unlock modes the first of
which is automatic when set to automatic
gate keeper will unlock your PC within a
customizable range anywhere from three
to thirty feet this mode is beneficial
for people such as item professionals
where frequently leaving and returning
to their workstations providing security
without wasting precious time the second
option is touch to log in when in this
mode gatekeeper requires a user to tap
gatekeeper against the Bluetooth
receiver in order to unlock the computer
this mode ensures that only the person
with the key fob can access a computer
even if gatekeeper is in range finally
log in using gatekeeper and pin requires
the user to enter a password alongside
the presence of gatekeeper before the
computer can be unlocked this two-factor
login option is the most secure as it
adds a second layer of security to
logging in this is ideal for use in
hospitals and healthcare facilities by
doctors and nurses for any other
industry that needs to protect
confidential information
but what happens if you lose your
gatekeeper thankfully the gatekeeper
also functions as a Bluetooth tracker so
you can find it and your keys with the
gatekeeper app on your phone this works
while you're within 30 feet of
gatekeeper providing it not connected to
your computer when located gatekeeper
shines and the app will give you an idea
of how far away the key fob is to learn
