hi I'm Daniel Green and welcome to the
gourmet kitchen today's discovery
something that real tea lovers like
myself have been waiting for meet the
gone Mia t-square the t-square uses go
Mia's own IT technology to automatically
handle everything from boiling to
brewing to the all-important sleeping of
the tea leaves that means loose tea
lovers like myself can finally get rid
of all of this and for those of you who
are still using these and say hello to
the first fully automatic loose tea
brewed that's right the t-square
recreates and automates every part of
real tea making boiling brewing and of
course the magical mystical steep where
the rich leaves and the delicate flavors
fuse with the water to produce that
truly perfect cup of tea and all you
have to do is fill this easy accessible
4 cup firmly insulated tank with water
and then place your favorite loose tea
leaves inside this exceptional
engineered blue basket it's designed to
ensure to maximize that saturation with
superior steeping without bruising the
leaves or contaminating that delicate
steep and the brewing process now you're
ready to turn it on select your
preferred strength insert the special
who asks carafe and by the way don't
forget to insert that carafe because
you'll see that the t-square is also
designed for safety so if it senses
there's no carafe then is no tea
now we're seconds away from
understanding why we Brits and all the
world's tea-loving cultures positively
insist on loose-leaf tea because the
only thing that belongs in bags is
groceries perfect
all the taste and richness none of the
weight
you
