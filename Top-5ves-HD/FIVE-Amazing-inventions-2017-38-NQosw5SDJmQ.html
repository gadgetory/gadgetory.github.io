my name is Michael Varga for some years
now I have a problem every evening and
sometimes several temps a day I have to
put my mobile devices on charge and what
is the most inconvenient about it either
the battery goes out when I have a huge
necessity to is one of them I think I'm
not the only one who get bothered by
this problem I'm pretty sure that every
one of you got into this situation when
one of the deserts run out of battery
the moment you needed it the most you
should not worry about this anymore
because I got in that solution the
solution is in hand energy this is your
device of unlimited energy it's
unlimited because you can generate it to
yourself and you can generate this
energy as much as you need can
deserves energy inside of itself that's
why you can use it anytime we need it
and of course you can charge your device
during the rotation and energy as well
as energy is very easy to use jars to
recharge a snare in an alleged goal then
was given
it may be a surprise but
which is inside the and
device rotates with the average speed
for 5000 current filming that's why your
smartphone
but in Tennessee
take the intelligent device
we'll be safe No
and energy is indispensable for the
people living in the areas with limited
access to electrical grid thanks to Kant
energy your energy is in your hands
it's one of the most effective energy
generators and what is more it looks
nice you may choose the hand energy
device according to a taste or style
developing the container G device we
have performed a huge amount of
experiments created a huge amount of
prototypes and now and energy is finally
done and ready for production and we
need your help
by the way internally divided
synchronizes with an app where you can
observe your statistic and also achieve
particular goals to win competitions and
get prizes before the league started
you
doing something where I really need to
go into deep thinking then I really want
my body to be comfortable so what we're
trying to do is how do you get the
computer to move to where the body wants
it to be and to be able to do that at
the press of a button so there's no
barrier to movement and your work just
keeps flowing so what the workplace of
the future looks like in ten years
on one hand not predictable because less
than 10 years ago we didn't have iPhones
right think about that now on the other
hand it probably looks a lot like it did
ten years ago which on the surface is
very similar but in the details and the
way we interact with stuff very
different we think that more and more
people will be saying I want to the
computer to move with me I need movement
throughout the day and we're looking to
support that kind of vision
we first came up with the idea of
chalice for several reasons really we'd
been looking on the market to see what
was out there and although there are
some things a little similar there isn't
anything that has all the key
requirements that the chalice has
because we invented and designed the
only true snack and drink vessel that
can be used domestically and
commercially the chalice has a thermal
barrier save get your chicken nuggets in
the top there and then you've got a cold
drink here by the time we get to the
bottom those chicken nuggets are still
going to be warm the bowl is sitting on
top of the cup it's for your snacks so
we've had fruit salad we've had fish and
chips we've also had self-serve we tried
everything that was the fun bit about
the chalice we got to experiment I don't
think anyone likes food or crumbs in
their drink and what we have here is a
watertight connection to say for
instance you're eating that choice and
that chose you've got those tiny crumbs
you've got salt you definitely don't
want that in the drink with the
watertight connection it's going to
prevent any of that falling into your
drink or any of your drink coming into
your nachos all you have to do is pick
it up
drink your drink eat your snack you can
be walking you can be sitting down
you've been watching your favorite
sports game and you never have to take
it apart just keeping it how you have it
all set up and good to go we've created
compartments so that you can put all
different snacks in your container at
any one time there are so many different
permutations of the chalice because in
everyday life we're always doing
different things so say you're going to
a sporting event you want to load up the
large chalice with
snacks and your favorite drink or if
you're going somewhere small you want to
take the smaller Tallis because you
don't want to be carrying it around all
day you just want to have it around your
neck on the land yard
you've got your snacks in there and your
drink and you're good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
