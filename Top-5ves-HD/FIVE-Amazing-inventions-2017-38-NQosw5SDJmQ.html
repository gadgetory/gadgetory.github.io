name is Michel Vaillant for some years
now I have a problem every evening and
sometimes several times a day I have to
put my mobile devices on charge and what
is the most inconvenient about it either
the battery goes out when I have a huge
necessity to is one of them I think I'm
not the only one who looked bothered but
this problem I'm pretty sure that every
one of you got into this situation when
one of the deserts ran out of battery
the moment you needed it the most you
should not worry about this anymore
because I got that solution the solution
is in hand energy this is your device of
unlimited energy it's unlimited because
you can generate it to yourself and you
can generate this energy as much as you
need can't energy preserves energy
inside of itself
that's why you can
at any time we needed and of course you
can charge your device during the
rotation and energy as well as energy is
very easy to use stars to entertain
marine and Latin God then just give the
patient it may be a surprise
which is inside the and
device rotates to
average speed put by thousands per
minute that's why your smartphone
that same speed as
take the intelligent device with you of
the Train
and what we do and energy is
indispensable for the people living in
the areas with limited access to
electrical grid thanks to Kant energy
your energy is in your hands it's one of
the most effective energy generators and
what is more it looks nice you may
choose the hand energy device according
to a taste or style developing the
containers a device we have performed a
huge amount of experiments created a
huge amount of prototypes and now and
energy is finally done and ready for
production and we need your help
- by the way internally divided
synchronizes with an F where you can
observe your statistic and also achieve
particular goals to win competitions and
get prizes before the gig starter
campaign we've made a tour around Europe
to support and energy being shown the
device to people let them take a close
look at it and use it to see what it's
like you will learn about the impression
regarding this experience for yourself
you can get more information about an
energy apartment or about our plans on
Kickstarter page on our website or
follow them that edge tech can and
we need your support
now along with awesome dimensioning
features of the light app we give you
Pro app the fastest most affordable and
most portable way to scan 3d curves and
we're including five years pro for free
only on IndieGoGo my 3d peeps this one
is for you
more and more of the world is moving to
using machines first we had typewriters
and calculators huge improvements over
pencil and paper after the so-called
universal machine the computer comes in
for the majority of people they're going
to a screen and they stay at the screens
we're seeing people show up in the
workforce with injuries in their 20s
you know stress repetitive injuries that
we didn't used to see until their
forties so little problems developed
over a long period of time we went
through this phase where sitting is the
new smoking etc and so people said oh
well it's the opposite of sitting is
standing so we should just stand and now
the research is really going towards
this idea of prolonged physical
inactivity being problematic and
relatively small changes in motion can
have a big effect on that if you take
people working in cubicles and what we
found was the people pretended to have
obesity was seated to the quarter hours
of war than people who were leave don't
worry nothing will follow and yeah we
wanted to make a system that was really
easy to move throughout the day by
lowering those barriers to movement and
making it very easy for the person to
move but without interrupting their
workflow what we believe is different
tasks are best done in different
positions if I'm on the phone I want to
be standing I want to even maybe be
pacing but if I'm doing something where
I really need to go into deep thinking
then I really want my body to be
comforted
so what we're trying to do is how do you
get the computer to move to where the
body wants it to be and to be able to do
that as the press of a button so there's
no barrier to movement and your work
just keeps flowing so what the workplace
of the future looks like in ten years
on one hand not predictable because less
than ten years ago we didn't have
iPhones right think about that now on
the other hand it probably looks a lot
like it did ten years ago which on the
surface is very similar but in the
details and the way we interact with
stuff very different we think that more
and more people will be saying I want
the computer to move with me I need
movement throughout the day and we're
looking to support that kind of vision
we first came up with the idea of
chalice for several reasons really we'd
been looking on the market to see what
was out there and although there are
some things a little similar there isn't
anything that has all the key
requirements that the chalice has
because we invented and designed the
only true snack and drinks vessel that
can be used domestically and
commercially the chalice has a thermal
barrier
save get your chicken nuggets in the top
there and then you've got a cold drink
here by the time you get to the bottom
those chicken nuggets that are still
going to be warm the bowl is sitting on
top of the cup it's for your snacks so
we've had fruit salad we've had fish and
chips we've also had self-serve we tried
everything that was the fun bit about
the chalice we got to experiment
I don't think anyone likes food or
crumbs in their drink and what we have
here is a watertight connection so say
for instance you're eating nachos nachos
you've got those tiny crumbs you've got
salt you definitely don't want that in
the drink with the watertight connection
it's going to prevent any of that
falling into your drink or any of your
drink coming into your nachos all you
have to do is pick it up drink your
drinks eat your snack you can be walking
you can be sitting down it could been
watching your favorite sports game and
you never have to take it apart just
keeping it how you have it all set up
and good to go we've created two
compartments so that you can put all
different snacks in your container at
any one time there are so many different
permutations of the chalice because in
everyday life we're always doing
different things so say you're going to
a sporting event you want to load up the
large chalice with all your favorite
snacks and your favorite drink
or if you're going somewhere small you
want to take the smaller chalice because
you don't want to be carrying it around
all day you just want to have it around
your neck on the land yard
you've got your snacks in there and your
drink and you're good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
