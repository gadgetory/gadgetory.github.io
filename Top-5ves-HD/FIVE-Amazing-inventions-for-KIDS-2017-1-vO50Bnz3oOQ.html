traditional construction bricks are a
work of genius when it comes to building
rigid structures but when you add flex
oh and the little creativity a new door
opens to a world of flexibility
flexo when added to regular construction
bricks changes the dynamic of building
and adds new functionality flexibility
strength and support we have seen but a
fraction of what the system can do in
their hands of Master Builders my name's
James and I'm the son of my creator of
Flik sir when I saw the product I just
thought you know this is something
pretty special pretty amazing and really
wanted to get on board with it and be a
part of what flexo is and what it can
offer Wynn flexo was designed we wanted
to give people the opportunity to really
unleash their creativity and that in
turn would just absolutely maximize the
enjoyment they get out of their sets of
construction Brooks what led me to
develop flex though was that I was
enough physio and I had a torn arm
tendon and I was just amazed absolutely
amazed at the beauty of the body and how
our bones and tendons work together it
was a bone as a very fixed construction
and then a tendon allows a fixed
construction to move with elegance so
how does flexor work it's really simple
the ends of the flexor tendon fits
snugly into the openings of the flexor
brick and when you want to get really
extreme you can further secure the
flexor tendon by placing another brick
flexo or otherwise on top then you can
twist Bend stretch and flex to your
heart's content
the only limitation to what you create
is the vast expanse of your imagination
and your flexor collection so flexo is
an add-on to regular construction bricks
it was designed to add to the experience
and the opportunity that regular
construction bricks allow in terms of
creativity as well as design and ideas
it allows you to for a very small
investment basically and twice if not
three times the functionality to the
existing brick collection you already
have new ideas and users are coming up
every day with flexo and how it
interacts with construction bricks
it can provide rigidity flexibility
stored energy playability and even bling
ability just like you we love
construction bricks and we love our
collections and what we can build with
them we want to add to that with the
release of flexo all we need now is a
little help from you pledge today to get
your flexor
