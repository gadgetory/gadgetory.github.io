little paint jobs or trimming everybody
hates the mess associated with working
from a one-gallon can of anything paint
varnish auto body filler the constant
dripping the contaminated groove those
problems are now a thing of the past
using your drip crown cover is so easy
just line up the slots with the bolt of
a paint can pull up your bail wire lock
the drip crown into position
you can grab these tabs move your can
around the room and you're ready to
paint
now that the drip crown cover is on your
paint can
the paint can groove is completely
protected from any loose or drippy paint
getting in and contaminating this is
called the paint brush wiper it's one of
the great features of the drip crown
cover dip in your paintbrush wipe off
the excess it perfectly loads your
paintbrush while allowing any loose or
drippy paint to be fed directly back
into the paint can
another great feature when you want to
move around the room simply clean up
very simple this paints been dried for
several hours watch how easy the paint
just peels off with a thumbnail you'd
start with a handy painters tool this
slips right over the roller and you
strip most of the paint right off your
roller cover back into the paint can
after you've used the
any painters tool and you want to finish
cleaning everything up that's when we
use the roller cleaner it attaches to
any standard faucet you attach it to the
faucet turn it on and then all you have
to do is take your roller cover and run
it up and down as the water's running
through it cleans the outside of your
roller cover perfectly every time
