think adventures should be enjoyed until
the very last bite
meals are an essential part of being in
the outdoors and to us the sports on the
market have never quite measured so we
decided to create one that does
introducing morsel a versatile utensil
for cooking eating and quick a tool
designed to rethink the way we eat on
the go morsel has a unique rubber edge
that allows you to easily scrape every
last bit of food the ergonomic
asymmetrical shape its plates pots bags
and bowls all shapes and sizes the
extended length is perfect for digging
deep without getting your hands dirty
more so also features a full sized fork
and a safe cutting edge for slicing
through tough foods
we spent last year designing prototyping
contestant
the result is the best camping utensil
we've ever used
if you've been hungry for a better
utensil your search our ways of
listening to music have evolved through
time but in pursuit of the best audio
we've been limited at a listening sweet
spot what if we can expand the sweet
spot what if we can create a sweet zone
where you can roam freely and still
enjoy the best sound in every corner

upstage 360 merges all the best
qualities in one hi this is Harry my
name is Paul we are the founders of Mac
pipe and we would like to introduce you
today our magnetic pedal innovation
well it's a real new innovative panel
which was designed to give you solid
performance a Suicide Club with
supporting force without fear
hassle-free by key this is one of our
first prototypes we have to do a lot of
innovations to come to this product
exactly and what's really good on this
panel we can equip with different magnet
sizes so what you see here is our
standard paddle this gives you a pulling
force of about 15 kilograms
click on solidly and you pull up
straight but as soon as you start to
shift your foot a little bit even in
case of a critical situation you will
get up very easily in fact you will
almost not feel the magnet
on the shoe we have a metallic plate it
fits on every SPD compatible shoe one of
the big advantages of this setup is that
it is totally insensitive to dirt you
will not scratch any floors because this
is all inside the sole without any
elevations it's a much lighter pedal and
we have a stronger neodymium magnet
which is the strongest magnet that is
available in the market we have a
similar damper unit on it which gives us
the ability to adjust the magnet height
to fit the shoe and also to give you
that solid feel when you connect onto
your shoe and when you write
hey I'm Katherine I'm so excited to be
back here with you on Kickstarter so
have you ever done this with your bath
bath you don't realize it but your
backpack is straining your shoulders and
back and your neck and hips to a strain
is a stretching or tearing of your
muscles or tendons doing this day in and
day out causes serious damage so it's no
wonder that four out of five people will
suffer back pain and 45% of today's
office workers have neck pain pain that
totally disrupts our lives but it
doesn't have to be this way we've spent
the last year designing the perfect
minimalist
and surprisingly effective solution so
today we introduce super straps the
world's first and only backpack booster
that instantly relieves shoulder and
back tension and lifts 27 pounds of
force off your neck super straps will
act as your super muscle literally
making your backpack feel lighter it
improves your posture when you walk and
instantly makes your everyday backpack
ergonomic we've tested super straps all
year long check out what folks had to
say Wow
what's the cute
yeah it feels way more comfortable it
feels like I can actually like walk
around with this without any strain or
like I can run to if I wanted feels
lighter I don't feel as much wear and
tear on my shoulders feels a lot more
comfortable actually I can't really feel
like my backpacks on my back anymore
definitely feels lighter and more
balanced if that makes sense I feel like
it's like it's almost like doing my
posture for me don't feel slouchy I feel
a little more free in my back and my
neck and my shoulders as well there's
less strain it's great it's a magic
trick because it definitely made a
difference when you put it on so how
does it work
super straps is minimal so when you're
not using it it's sleek behind your
backpack straps it activates in one
second flat and the arc distributes the
force of your backpack on up to five
times the surface area so you feel
instant relief in your back and
shoulders most of us use our necks to
counterbalance the weight in our bags
but even a 15 degree head tilt is like
walking around with a bowling ball on
your neck every single day
super straps fixes this our pulley
system poise the weight in your bag
moving it closer to your spine where you
can carry it ergonomically so you don't
need a slump and hurt your body every
step you take many of us carry two three
even four times the weight doctors
recommend in our packs each day if your
backpack ever feels heavy throwing on a
pair of super straps will give you
instant relief and long-term comfort
I've worn super straps every day for the
past five months and it's a total
GameChanger

pain free and light walking upright and
confidently able to truly enjoy the
moment so please hit the green back this
