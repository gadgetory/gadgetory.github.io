introducing iron but a robot your kids
can make at home
iron bot is a DIY robot learning kit
which can be assembled by kids over
eight years old it consists of
structural metal adapting piece mini
controller and battery module by iron
bot kids are able to assemble three
kinds of robots robotic arm biped robot
in the humanoid robot by the controller
in our app kids can control arm but in
real time and use it to play various fun
games kids can also set iron bots
movement track and let it act in
according to personal setting like the
widely used to robots implant when kids
finished a humanoid robot assembly they
can directly put smartphone on robots
head as his brain then he will become an
intelligent robot who can listen speak
and act hello Daniel nice to meet you to
be like a new friend who can talk dance
and play with kids I am the picture okay
one two three cute every kid can DIY
Erin but as peripherals by setting its
name character voiced and expression and
create a unique iron but blowing to him
or herself by x-linked graphical
programming app kids can program and
design robust thinking or they can even
write a script by X link in a request
iron but to perform drama together with
kiss themselves she's Snow White
a princess who was poisoned by her
vicious stepmother arm but will helped
kids start to know to understand and to
assemble robust by their own ways so
that they can learn stem in robotics in
a simple in funny way all these will
develop his interests for robots and
open them
we have activities now we can do in
Diego for his time and join us to open
Adele of local orchids he'll support we
are pouring elements into both kids
lives and open a chance to experiment
happy knees in love thank you for
watching one two three cheese yeah my
name is Tracey Howell and I'm from
Overland Park Kansas
my son Britain is six years old and has
autism
so I'm Eileen I'm Charlie's mom
Charlie's a little boy who is three
years old he's severely autistic
well what's great about lekha is that my
son immediately connected with this
robot is this ball that was running
around and coming back to him and
responding to his call when I saw
Charlie playing hide-and-seek with it I
mean that's something that a
neurotypical kid we just kind of do
anyway but Charlie doesn't usually do
that I've noticed my son had a very
rough day at school today he had some
some really challenging times but came
home and took 30 minutes to spend with
lekha and is a much more calm and
relaxed child
I think it's shown hey there's reproof
it's a pretty remarkable product and to
have it in the home of the outstanding
I'm gonna dismiss I know
and together we want to have exceptional
children live exceptional nights that's
why we created this little guy Nick yeah
meet Lika the first robotic interactive
smart toy designed specifically for
children with special needs children
with autism live in a world where they
are constantly overwhelmed with sensory
stimulation it is often hard for them to
connect to other people or focus on a
single activity for a long time
that's why parents and therapists often
use reinforcers to teach the children
for summit will be music for others
colors and lights or just vibrations
using these reinforces to teach rules
and guidelines to the children is
paramount as it helps them understand
and interact with the world around them
Leckie's unique strength is in combining
both the activity and the reinforcer
within one toy like I can play music
move around change colors and even has a
screen to display images icons or
emoticons this makes the child more
motivated and engaged because their
attention is focused on the toy and the
task at hand not just the reinforcer
lekha has been tested with more than a
hundred children in France and in the
u.s. it's been trialed at home with
parents with therapists and specialized
centers and hospitals and the results
are quite simply amazing this could be a
great great tool for therapists to
connect with these kids keep them
engaged which is the second very
difficult thing to do and use it to
connect and teach them we really think
that we have something that will truly
make an impact on the whole community
working with exceptional children and
that's the data that Lika collects and
passes back to our monitoring platform
identifying what's the next step in
therapy or what is something that maybe
the child is mastered it would be
remarkable to be able to share that data
and also be able to share that with
educators now we're we're actually
getting into the field of technology and
how it can work with individuals with
autism how it can empower therapists to
work with those individuals and
ultimately I believe will help us from a
research perspective Lika is not just a
toy it's truly an education that Ed and
we are working hard to bring you the
best application like a will have
numerous apps and activities available
on the App Store
right from the start and new apps will
be developed and released continuously
it's important to us that each child
makes the most out of his amazing toy
but it's really more than just a toy
it's a companion an interactive robot
and a wonderful educational tool
it's lekha from the beginning of the
project we went to schools special
education school and I was seeing kids
playing with the robot and we loved it
and I wanted to go further and make the
project we haven't seen it anywhere else
besides you guys with Leica there are
some of course apps or games but nothing
that is an emotion censored or nothing
that is really interactive with the
child in that respect I think that like
is really coming upon something new and
inspirational for children we really
believe that we have to get this
technology into the children's hands as
quickly as possible and that's why we
are here to ask you to give us a hand
you can help us by spreading the word
and if you are interacting with
exceptional children or other people
around you are you can all relate that
now they gain Swedish means to play in
to heal and that's exactly what we are
going to do with love from the legal
team
I want to call with an engine on top
orange wheel this is an alien rock 3 9
and away clean
can I make a ballerina her name is
Cristina this is my fam ride Jack car I
want to dance on wheel
my name is a sub I've been designing
toys for the past 10 years 3 years ago I
was invited to teach at a school in
Harlem as part of the city arts program
that marked the beginning of the toys
journey working with the kids on toy
building and witnessing the level of
creativity really inspired me I returned
to the studio with a new approach my
focus became on how to recreate that
feeling of accomplishment where each
child got the chance to express their
uniqueness after countless hours in the
studio brainstorming sketching and
modeling the idea for toyish was born
playing with toys she's fun and
intuitive there's no right or wrong way
to play it enables kids to figure out
what they want to do make it happen and
then play with a very own toys creation
each toy skate is made out of four
elements a coloring playbook
a clear capsule think play parts and a
magnetic character that locks it all
together this is how I make my ballerina
yet a coloring shoot from the book any
shape you want you color it in you put
the paper inside the cup the legs next
you put the base the body and just spin
it and that's how you make your
ballerina now have a nice day the name
of our product is an extension of our
philosophy the product is like a toy it
is toy ish it is not really a toy until
a kid makes it one until they use their
imagination and bring it to life
in the past year we've tested toys with
over 100 kids parents and educators we
have since won several awards and are
now ready for production my hope is that
more kids will play with toys express
their ideas gain confidence in feel
special
with your help we can launch toyish and
make the first production round your
pledges will allow us to develop and
create more choices for kids to play
with we have so many exciting plans for
the future so please support this
journey share it with friends and let's
make it happen if we were asking the
dinosaur questions or your question
my name is Amy your name is Sparky tell
me a joke right why wouldn't the shrimp
share his treasure
I don't know me a story
like I'm ciphered the designer vortex
vortex is a revolutionary product for
children it is a smart and responsive
robot that kids can play with and
program using the vortex and apps kids
can play different games learn about
robotics and even create their own
playing with vortex is incredibly fun
and easy thanks to its unified system
and intuitive app for example the
bumping flight is a sumo-style party
game suitable for multiple players the
computer inside vortex has sensors to
detect motions like hitting spinning or
being still vortex embraces new
technologies and allows users to
experience them the fugitive is a unique
game with augmented reality and motion
tracking technology children already
love playing with our vortex prototypes
and we can't wait for kids everywhere to
get their own vortex vortex is
compatible with both iOS and Android
devices and comes with an open SDK
anyone who wants to develop a game for
vortex is empowered to do so because
every vortex is a death kit the only
limits your imagination vortexes app
allows kids to learn to program their
robots in a fun simple and educational
environment by abstracting complicated
actions and visualizing the process the
app teaches the basics of programming
without any coding or advanced skill
learning by doing has never been easier
just drag drop and hit upload that's
simple
we wanted to make a great product and to
do it we gathered the best people from
industrial design user experience
hardware software and game development
for the past two years
vortex has undergone countless revisions
and improvements and we know that only
through this process can we create a
product that won't disappoint our future
inventors
vortex is built on arduino an
open-source hardware platform it can see
and speak by using infrared grayscale
and sound speakers vortex can find its
way around obstacles detect lines and
report back to you we've pre-installed
the program and done the assembly vortex
is fun right out of the box just open
the app switch it on and start exploring
vortex is also designed to be highly
customizable with colorful parts
stickers and maps
we've come a long way in creating vortex
and now we need your help to make it
real thank you
