probably sitting down to watch this
video for the next two minutes it's okay
but hey an average person spends almost
eight hours each day sitting with our
bodies are just not built to be still
we're bout to move hi I'm Justine we are
industrial designers and the team behind
levitate like many of you our job
involves a lot of time on our laptops we
thought about buying a standing desk but
they were too expensive and mostly
stationary we wanted something that's as
portable as our laptops something quick
and easy so say goodbye to the bulk and
the club this is levitating simply open
cross twist and reset it's slimmer and
half the weight of a macbook air it all
started with this piece of paper we
prototypes with many many materials in
search of the best and found this the
main
canvas that was extremely tough and
water-repellent inspired by the level of
craftsmanship durability and
timelessness of the bookbinding
technique we sought help from
traditional book combining experts and
crafted the first levitate don't worry
it bears more than 20 times its own
weight and a stain proof levitate your
laptop anytime anywhere
so we can't wait for you to be part of
the story so join us and I move towards
a healthier and more fun way of working
in a world where we are constantly on
the go fueled by the caffeine we drink
why are we still wasting time in line
and settling for substandard coffee we
asked why not make coffee portable where
you could brew a delicious cup in the
palm of your hand so we did just that
this is the jolt a portable coffee
brewer that can brew anytime anywhere we
have developed the most compact and
efficient design possible pushing the
limits of current battery and heating
element technologies in addition to
convenience taste is paramount we've
modeled our device after the traditional
french press brewing for a truly
delicious cup of coffee so how does it
work simply fill with water and within
minutes it will reach the perfect
brewing temperature load the coffee pod
with your own coffee grounds or use our
biodegradable packets wait for the green
light and your coffee is ready to drink
as a mechanical engineer with a
background and electromechanical
packaging and heat transfer I've had the
opportunity to transform our concept
into a functioning prototype
incorporating feedback from friends
family and coffee lovers into every
iteration over the last three years
unlike other portable Brewers our
product utilizes the latest technology
to reach the proper correct temperature
of 200 degrees Fahrenheit so you can
brew anytime anywhere we pride ourselves
and not only our speed but also our
ability to deliver a quality great
tasting cup of coffee but the coffee pod
was equally important to us as the
device itself it's estimated that over 9
billion keurig k-cups end up in
landfills every year but the jolt is
different we've developed a
biodegradable coffee pot that bruise
great coffee and leaves no impact on the
environment leveraging our team's
background in mechanical and electrical
engineering we've solved some immense
challenges and after three years of
development we're finally ready to share
our product
we've come to indy gogo after perfecting
our technology and partnering with a
great manufacturer our goal is to raise
enough funds to meet our manufacturers
minimum order quantity and that's where
we need your help so please join us
today and help make portable brewing
