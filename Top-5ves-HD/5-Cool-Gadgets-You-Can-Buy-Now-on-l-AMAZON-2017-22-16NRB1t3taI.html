years we've kick-started for products
that expand your camera's capabilities
and now we've built the best remote
trigger we can imagine this is pulse the
most powerful way to control your camera
from your smart
Hulse lets you take a photo without
having to touch or shake your camera so
you can get sharp images in any
conditions or capture moments where you
can't be next to your camera but pulse
isn't just a trigger it gives you all
the functionality you expect from
shooting with your DSLR or mirrorless
camera but remotely from your smartphone
you can change all of your camera
settings through the app or just check
your histogram and make sure everything
is looking good unlike other triggers
pulse lets you start and stop video too
and because you can control up to 3
cameras at once you can get all the
right angles for your shot even if you
are just a team of one
pulse is also the most powerful
time-lapse trigger on the market so if
you are taking your very first time
lapse or getting the holy grail of time
lapses a day-to-night transition we've
designed pulse to give you maximum
control we started Alpine labs because
Kickstarter backers like you believed in
our ideas initially we were inspired to
make better tools for time-lapse and
this year we started focusing on camera
control and remote triggers the products
out there were either cheap or lacked
functionality and some solutions just
wouldn't fit in our camera bags we
wanted a product that was sleek fit
beautifully with your camera and gave
you complete control wherever you were
shooting so we got to work and design
pulse your support gives us the ability
to build the best products we can
imagine and to continue to work on new
ideas from all of us at Alpine labs and
to keep a bit of control I got the new
eco before smart thermostat now I can
control the temperature of my home from
anywhere with my phone and eco be as
room sensors that help manage hot or
cold spots and best of all it has a LexA
built-in alexa ID stain remover to the
shopping list stain remover add it to
your shopping list the new eco before
make your home work introducing Flickr's
the world's first flickable flying this
it's easy just rip it and flick it
and catch it - flickers were designed
for maximum distance and accuracy flies
over 70 feet use it indoors and play
catch like never before
collect all six new designs in the
flickers collectible series also comes
and glow in the jar master the advance
tosses like the card the seeker the
riser
we see changes the flicker started net
set comes with six flickers test a score
pad and pencil and a bunch of cool games
to play
compete head-to-head with a friend while
have fun with the whole family take
turns clicking and see who can score the
most points the target net holds flat so
you can take it anywhere
challenged each other to get creative
and setup trick shots and seem to be the
first to knock them down
whicker's play em anywhere
