our loon case users loved its power of
illumination but they've been asking us
for more designs and colours we started
creating looking for ideas in everything
seeking advice from our clients and
partners the light gave us unlimited
possibilities and we did not want to
stop creating something unusual
something exciting and sometimes
surprising we have the best feature ever
the light and this is what makes Spectre
unique developing illumination
technology that shines bright and lasts
for ages was at the core of our mission
Spectre is clearer and more vibrant than
what came before we utilized a brand-new
polycarbonate materials blend that gives
more transparency and rigidness to the
case we increase the duration
illumination takes place added animation
and broadened our lighting palette our
first generation product changed the
iphone case industry but it was just a
first step on our journey we developed a
solid production base and production is
what we've been up to for some time now
think sketch discuss build test and do
it all over again lots of late nights

this is John while his neighbor is
yelling about how his dog ate his paper
this is John in the same situation using
brick so what is brick so it's an
awesome version of building blocks that
makes your designs come to life with
electricity sensors and Bluetooth let's
see some prototypes from our testing lab
closing a circuit this is Bluetooth
sound sensor light sensor proximity
sensor how amazing is using brick so
this is Kate making her morning coffee
while discovering Roy used all the milk
for his cereal this is Kate same
situation with Rick cell brick so has
three types of locks connectors action
blocks and trigger blocks use the
connectors to make a circuit then embed
the action box to give your design light
or movement now you can use trigger
blocks to control your design with sound
proximity and light brick so can also be
controlled remotely which means you can
connect your design to your phone and
even to the Internet and automate stuff
if you're into that sort of thing but
who likes to automate stop right oh and
there's a battery block which will is
the battery here's Mike while his
coworker turns off the air conditioner
even though it is 90 degrees outside
this is Mike same situation with bricks
all you can use brick so to upgrade
designs made with regular building
blocks which will make them like a
hundred times cooler no wires needed Oh
break so block components are built in
bricks that was also an amazing
educational tool for your kids but know
that they'll forever mock regular
building blocks buzz and Amir have been
working on brick so for a long
time they're both physicists so they
know a thing or two about electricity so
if you like building stuff and don't
mind getting addicted support them and
get your own brick so it'll change your
life or just make you happy brick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
