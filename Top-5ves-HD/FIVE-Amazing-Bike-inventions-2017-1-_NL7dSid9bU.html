hi Kickstarter I'm Lydia I'm an engineer
by training and a former director of
software development I also love riding
my bike I inherited my love of the
outdoors from my dad being outside made
him feel alive unfortunately it also
killed him my father lost his life to
skin cancer which is why i've created
the blue clear visor it began looking
for a bike helmet that protected my face
from the Sun and found aerodynamic cool
and fashionable helmets but I couldn't
find one that protected my entire face
often I see people wearing baseball caps
under the helmets so I knew I wasn't the
only one who wanted protection I spoke
with dermatologists and worked with the
team of industrial designers and product
engineers who hailed from renowned
Silicon Valley design firms together we
developed a visor that blocks
ninety-eight percent of UV rays it's
simple to install and it's super easy to
put on and take off it has peripheral
vision and lets you choose a degree of
coverage skin cancer is the most
diagnosed cancer in the US with five
million people treated each year but
with skin cancer protection can mean
prevention mount means the world to me
because bike riding and sunshine are
supposed to make us healthy not sick but
making a reliable quality product is
expensive to be cost effective the
durable uv-blocking polycarbonate can
only be purchased in extremely large
quantities also the rubber edging and
helmet mounts require tooling which is
why I need your help
my project every day more and more
people are riding their bikes I don't
want another person to lose their mom or
dad or anyone to this preventable
disease so please join me in my mission
and back my project
cycling is fun extremely fun however for
cyclists safety always comes first as
crazy cycling fans we understand all the
problems that you may or have already
encountered during your ride that's why
we made the live all bling helmet the
smartest bicycle helmet for safety live
all has many features that can simplify
your ride and keep you safe the LED
outline lights on top of the helmet will
make you stand out in the night while
the taillights will indicate directions
for your fellow teammates never worry
about falling behind anymore find the
shining helmets and you will find the
team the built-in Bluetooth speaker and
mic enable you to take phone calls or
communicate with teammates directly
using the walkie talkie function and of
course you can listen to music with
blingee helmet and cycle to the beats if
the built-in gravity sensor senses an
internal strike SOS signals will be
displayed on the helmet in emergency
contacts will be alerted automatically
we call this multifunctional remote
control bling jack it can simply be
mounted on the bike and is very easy to
use bling jet will connect to both your
phone and bling helmet so you can use it
to control the lights on the helmet use
the walkie-talkie take incoming calls or
play your favorite songs beside that we
designed a live all phone holder so you
can easily take your phone the phone
holder also contains a battery so it can
also be used to charge your phone no
more running out of power during your
rides the best part of the live all
products is the live all riding app
it's compatible with different wearable
devices to measure and display different
parameters of your body or your ride it
measures slope ring gradient altitude
cadence speed etc and shows the stats
directly on your phone we've also
invented the live all nano cadence
sensor the smallest single unit cadence
sensor in the world besides analyzing
your ride the live all riding app can
also be used to take photos or shoot
short videos by processing the photo
taking button on bling jet with all this
awesome looking data and fantastic
photos or videos will help you to map
your unique road book and share on
social media platforms we spent a lot of
time to design the live all products and
are using materials of the best quality
we've already gone through all the
design work the R&amp;amp;D process beta testing
and the refining process we produce the
bling helmet and the bling debt and
small amounts the product is here and
ready but we need your help to bring
live off to mass production and thereby
bring the joy of cycling to more people
so pledge now let's go on a ride and
make live all a blast hi we really
appreciate all the help you give us we
give you support video feedback we'll
try our best to pull the line of
products to you come up like oh right
I'm mark this is Tom and this is V line
v/line cycling device that will change
the way you think about City navigation
by putting the fun and adventure back
into your ride we'd be line simply pick
a destination and you're good to go the
device shows you the distance in the
direction to head in the rest is up to
you know turn left turn right no route
you choose your turns based on the
direction of the arrow you're quite used
to being told go this way go that way
goodness we go that way and you actually
don't enjoy the journey you just want to
get to where you're going whereas I
think when you just know the bearing and
you're just cycling you actually think
oh that rose more interesting I'm gonna
go down here or I fancy weaving through
these roads it just makes it a bit more
relaxing but more of an adventure so I
like the fact that you're sort of
involved in the navigation and you're
actually trying to align you know the
route you're taking exactly with the
VLAN arrow and when you get that sort of
spot time it's actually quite fun you
never feel like you missed a turn if
it's dangerous you don't have to take
that turn it just takes the stress out
situation having lived in London for
four years I was very fixed on set
routes in and out of work rely on has
opened up the city for me let me
discover new areas a new path I would
have used before this morning I knew who
wants to come over on the bridge I like
the fact that i can add that as a
waypoint on the afternoon this didn't
even start as an idea for a product we
were just getting lost and forward
sticks and compasses on our bikes to
help out let me call we made a better
obviously this compass idea is a little
bit different to conventional navigation
so we weren't sure if it would work we
made an appt to test that and we were
just like whoa this is way better than
we thought it would be we thought we
might get stuck down little streets
whatever just didn't happen everywhere
we went it just seamlessly got you
through there in a really nice fun way
where you were exploring the city we had
this idea about a year ago and since
then we've brought into the team all the
expertise that we've needed to get
beeline to where it is today we may be
line visible under any conditions by
giving any paper screen and the back
line its shockproof its rainproof
another normal usage is batfish you lost
around for weeks the next step is to go
into full production and that's why
we're here on Kickstarter so if like us
you wants with the fun back into your
ride place today to get your v line with
your help we'll bring beeline to the
masses thank you very much
I'm mark he's Tom oh yes completely lost
it we may be like do you remember the
first time you rode a bike the places
you would go on your new wheels the fast
forward a few years and somewhere
between your first date traffic jams and
global warming bikes just don't feel the
same anymore this is flux electric bike
we started drugs because you found one
of the ultimate joys of our childhood at
times just felt like a crime we're on a
mission to put the fun back into cycling
and more happy riders on two cycles flux
is simple just turn it on and go in
pedal assist mode flux is exactly like
riding a normal bike just easier and
faster don't want to pedal you don't
have to to push the throttle and your
speed through the city with no effort at
all the location of the motor is a key
factor than making this bike so special
unlike most electric bikes of the market
which other motor in the hub ours is
located in between the pedals this takes
mechanical advantage of the bike shimano
9 speed gears meaning you can climb
hills easier and hit top speeds quicker
couple this efficient drivetrain with an
industry crushing 17 Empire lithium
battery and you can flux for 46 miles on
full power the battery has a keylogger
security and can be removed in a second
take it with you and recharge wherever
you want they even features a USB port
so you can charge all of your devices on
the go by harnessing advanced technology
and elegant design flux parts of your
wheels for the modern world giving you
the power to zip past traffic floor
further and climb higher than ever
before we put these bikes through their
paces on the most challenging courses we
could find their battle tested and
designed to take a video stay in control
with powerful hydraulic disc brakes and
suntour suspensions when you get to the
bottom you can just power back up in
record time ready to go again and again
we've got three exciting models ready
for production we need your help to
build critical mass and bring the cost
of production down with your backing and
our expertise we're going to bring you a
bike that will change the way you think
about riding forever to stop wasting
money on gas leave the car in the garage
come flux with us to a more sustainable
future happy writing guys thanks for
watching
you
me
imagine adding an electric wheel to your
body travel 20 to 50 miles on a single
charge at all when you want sit back
when you don't he'll no sweat it's 500
watts of power available at the press of
a lever easy to install and intuitive to
operate designed in Cambridge
Massachusetts and built a new england
two years ago is watching tron thinking
about all that empty space inside the
orbital wheel really kept me up at night
why don't we put a motor when we put a
battery in that spin I managed to make a
mini prototype but I basically have to
love thumbs and a limited knowledge of
engineering 18 months ago I was working
as a propulsion development engineer at
SpaceX when I met Mike and saw the geo
orbit a wheel prototype I love the
concept and one of the help make it a
reality since then we've created five
generations of prototypes given hundreds
of test rides and logged thousands of
miles from all that user feedback we've
integrated all sorts of features into
the wheel installation takes only 60
seconds and requires no tools the
battery is easily removable even the
tires are made of high-density foam they
ride just like a normal tire but they'll
never go flat the motor will take you 0
to 20 miles an hour in six seconds the
feature set goes on and on we've only
just got rolling how many years I work
driven and road at ridiculous first it
forward and then for a bike store
involved and I first saw the gerbil
wheel I was hooked we've got this
advanced design sleek a Dominion frame
and simple operation
you just pop on the wheel clip on the
throttle and go it's very brilliant
we're gonna be great if you could use
your bike whenever you want it to
without sweating all the engineering is
done got a great product got a great
team but we need your help we really
want to keep these built in the United
States but we need to order a batch
large enough to keep dacosta please
support our project in any way that you
can thank you Kickstarter
