on Kickstarter thank you for your
support our lives so we create solar
powered devices to feel the world today
we're excited to release the go son go
a solar stove that roasts a meal in
minutes can be taken anywhere works any
day yet remains cool to touch no matter
how hot just like it's named the go son
go comes in a bomb-proof package ready
for outdoor adventure or relaxing at
home with friends if you're craving a
hot drink or need to sterilize water
flip the adjustable stand and use it
vertically to boil 14 ounces are ready
in as little as 30 minutes the secret to
our breakthrough technology is the solar
vacuum tube which acts as a perfect
insulator trapping your food's moisture
and flavor cooking made us human and it
continues to bring us together
it's an international language and an
art as a kid I was encouraged to explore
and pretty much do whatever I wanted and
I was really attracted to cooking
because of the creative process involved
it's like my creative outlet even to
this day and I love gathering friends
and family together and serving up a hot
plate of food
I'm Patrick Sherwin and I'm a solar
energy guy I've been working with
renewable energy for a long time and I
came up with go Sun five years ago and
we rotation a big dream trying to fit
fuel free cooking into the bellies of
people around the world it's clean easy
and healthy and for some people this may
be the only alternative where they're
not burning something for dinner tonight
most people think that solar is too
expensive or that it doesn't work so go
Sun has made an affordable solution
that's four times more efficient than
solar panels and works its magic
whenever needed
packed of power and free from batteries
the gosun go is something you can take
anywhere to cook up a hot meal or drink
with a no effort
no gas no fire no safety hazard and no
mess to clean up
the gosun go is like a ticket to an
adventure with no strings attached
there's no fuel to burn there's no mess
to clean up it's in this tiny little
case that you can take anywhere you can
cook just about anything through the
clouds through the freezing cold all
just with the power of the sunlight and
what more could you want
when it comes to outdoor cooking we're
just getting better at burning and
smoking meat that's the same thing we've
been doing for 350,000 years go son
invites you to join the 21st century
solar revolution we want you to
experience the magic of the Sun and
share its goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
