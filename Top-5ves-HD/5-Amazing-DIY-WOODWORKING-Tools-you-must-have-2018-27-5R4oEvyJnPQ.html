introducing the miles crafts and double
family no more struggling with
traditional hand Sanders or traditional
sandpaper sheets the sand devils come in
several different sizes the 16:05 which
fits your standard three inch by 21 inch
sanding belt the 16:04 which fits your
standard two and a half inch by fourteen
inch sanding belt and the 16:07 which
fits your one and a half inch by 12 inch
sanding belt there's also one more model
that is for the European market that
we'll discuss later in the video the
sand devil comes with an 80 grit sanding
belt miles craft does offer replacement
sanding belts for all sizes an 80 grit
120 grit and 150 grit you can also use
sanding belts from other manufacturers
many of you are probably thinking well I
already have something like this made of
wood in a sandpaper sheet with your
homemade sanding block you can never
truly get the sandpaper tied around the
board and you're constantly having to
stop standing to readjust your hold and
to ensure the sandpaper is tight not to
mention the sandpaper can easily tear on
the edges I can personally say this is a
pain
the sand Devils have a patented clever
lever feature that ensures that the
sanding belt is tight every time and
allows you to easily change or rotate
your sin email when your sandpaper
starts to get dirty just open the clever
lever and rotate the sanding belt until
you have a clean surface the sand Devils
allow for multiple different sanding
applications that one may not easily be
able to accomplish with your traditional
hand sander sanding block or even
orbital sander with two flat surfaces on
the top and the bottom you can easily
remove blemishes on your flat workpiece
if you're using the 16:05 you can sand a
wide board with the large flat edge that
is 9 inches long allowing for a smooth
flat surface every time the angle flat
surface allows you to apply maximum
pressure when doing any flat sanding the
small rounded surface is for those tight
spots on molding or trim pieces the sand
devils have a ninety degree angle on the
back end for getting into those really
tight corners we need to remove burning
or gluing a hidden feature of the sand
Devils is that you can offset the
sanding belt from the sand devil body
which allows you to get into those tight
interior angles with ease
a large radius corner that allows for
intricate sanding to those curved
surfaces whether it be a large crown
molding large trim pieces or bevels of
any sort all of these sanding
applications will provide a smooth even
surface unlike using your hand with
traditional sandpaper which can lead
pressure inconsistencies in the surface
the sand devils are made of a durable
plastic meaning the only thing you
should ever have to do is change your
sanding belt no maintenance needed the
sand Devils also extend the life of your
sanding box cleaning your sand belt has
never been so easy with the sand Devils
simply grab a cleaner block and rather
across your felt surface and your belt
will be like brand-new again the lead
box join and be hi Jake
model B 975 is a simple easy to use jig
for making 1/2 inch and 3/4 inch box
joints before using the box join in B hi
Jake
you will need to make a simple beam the
jig template which has a 1/2 inch side
and a 3/4 inch side is attached to the
top of the beam the 1/2 inch and 3/4
inch side stop assemblies are attached
to each side of the beam we recommend
using 2 pieces of 3/4 inch MDF glued
together to make the beam a standard 2x4
with the edges squared off may also be
used
positioning ridges are located on the
other side of the template with the
positioning ridges against the beam the
template is centered and the screw hole
locations are marked location marks for
side stop positioning are then added the
side stops are set in position and the
screw holes are marked a drill press or
hand drill is used to drill pilot holes
in the beam the template is aligned with
the pilot holes and the beam is secured
in place with the provided screws the
side stop assemblies are then secured to
the beam
to prevent tear-out of your good
material grooves should be routed into
each side of the beam a 9 and 3/4 inch
wide piece of stock is used to aid in
routing the grooves the bit depth is set
at 3/4 of an inch
roading is then done straight in and out
of each template opening through the
board and into the
the other end of the board is used to
wrote the grooves in the half inch side
of the beam you now have a groove routed
in each template opening the beam and
jig are ready to use for use on a router
table handles must be added for safe
operation house craft joint mate can be
used to drill matching holes on mating
components for projects and several
configurations quickly and easily rotate
the drill stop until the set screw is
over the outside diameter of the drill
bit and then tighten the set screw now
let's demonstrate the joint mate and use
with these common dowel pin joints to
drill for a corner joint where two
boards are joined along their length
with one edge 90 degrees to the face of
the other board align your boards to
their finished position and then mark
them one until now clamped board one
with the edge being joined facing up
choose the correct drill bit that
corresponds to the selected delpan size
then using the body of the joint mate
determine the proper depth to drill for
this matey piece and adjust the depth
stop to start drilling your holes hold
the joint mate upside down and position
it over the board so the self centering
posts straddle the board's edge then
rotate the joint mate until the posts
are pushed firmly against each side of
the board in the desired location of the
first dowel pin starting at one of your
board firmly hold the joint mate and
then with the power off insert the drill
bit into the guide bushing and drill
your first hole
next move the joint mate to the
additional desired locations and repeat
until all the holes have been drilled
after you've completed drilling all the
holes place the properly sized dowel
pins in each hole without glue these are
going to be used to assist in
positioning the guide fence for drilling
holes in board two to drill the holes
for board two we start by attaching the
guide fence by sliding it into the
dovetailed ways on either side of the
joint mates body then insert the guide
fence knobs on both sides with the guide
fence attached place the appropriate
guide bushing over any one of the dowels
on the edge of board one adjust the
guide fence until it rests square to the
face of board one then tighten the guide
fence knobs this establishes the
distance from the edge of the board to
the dowels Center unclip board one and
then plays board to flat on your work
surface with the side being joined face
up then place board one on top aboard
two with the installed dowel pins
pointing towards the area of the holes
that will be drilled in board to advance
the joint mate towards board one until
one of the dowel pins is in the same
size dowel alignment slot on the body of
the joint mate and the fence is resting
square on the edge of joint two with the
boards in the correct position ensure
they're properly aligned with surfaces
being joined parallel to each other and
securely clamped both boards in position
before drilling the corresponding set of
holes with the joint mate you'll need to
adjust the drill stop for the depth of
board to including the recommended extra
one-eighth of an inch to ensure you
don't drill through it then starting at
one end of your board firmly hold the
joint mate in position and with the
power off insert the drill bit into the
guide bushing and drill your first hole
then move the joint mate to the
additional desired locations and repeat
until all the holes have been drilled
when all the corresponding dowel pin
holes have been drilled apply wood glue
to the dowel pins and assemble your
joint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
