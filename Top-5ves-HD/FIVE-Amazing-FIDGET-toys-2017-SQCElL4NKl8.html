anything like me you probably do even if
you're not like me you probably do don't
you wish there was something that could
alleviate this desire all the time
actually there it is called a fidget
spinner they're kind of all the rage
right now lots of people are making them
being 3d printed you can make your own
I myself have made some this one's a
little bit different this one's
different because only five dollars look
at me wrong there are a lot of options
out there they all seem to range between
$15 to hundreds of dollars and that's
completely fair
even myself selling these 3d printed
ones there's not much margin to be
making any money so I have decided to
try and mass-produce these for as
inexpensive as possible
I created a number of different designs
to find out which is the best one I even
held a giveaway combined to the poll
asking people to pick the best one turns
out that it's this one which I call the
trauma I find this the nicest size it's
really easy to carry around not too big
it's got a great weight to it and it
spins really nicely and most importantly
it's all I got a single bearing which is
why it's able to be so inexpensive so
I'm doing this Kickstarter to get the
funds so that I can get an injection
mold made I've already been speaking to
suppliers I already know how much I need
and basically once this Kickstarter gets
funded then that's it
parts are already designed prototypes
are already made all the hard stuff is
done just need the money and then you
get your fidget spinner this is for the
people that don't want to pay twenty to
thirty dollars or hundreds of dollars so
by backing this Kickstarter you'll be
helping to create the most inexpensive
quality fidget spinner out there I think
that's pretty cool let's make it happen
you
and yeah I know it's $5 us $6 Canadian
I'm Canadian $6 fidgets spinner doesn't
sound as good what can you do spigen
Weiss to digit digit is the combination
of digital spheres spheres were used to
create the outer mass to give the toys
its total mass
one of the things that I fell in love
with after I held it for the first time
is the way the light plays across the
spinning spheres
it just makes almost like an infinite
amount of concentric and intersecting
circles of light it's almost magical
when I was designing this I wanted it to
be as curvy as possible so when I set
out to design something that not only
that I wanted to be functional but I
wanted it to be beautiful
the stage is kind of hard to explain you
can see it on the screen you can see it
in the drawings I saw as I was deciding
it and it didn't really become real to
me until I actually held it so when I
first created spigen I didn't know what
it was going to be like to hold it and I
can't describe the very first time when
you rushing to put something together
and you finally spin it for the first
time it was really amazing that gives me
hope that this is going to be a pretty
unique product for for people like me
that that that appreciate beautiful
design and something that really does
blend the lines between form and
function
