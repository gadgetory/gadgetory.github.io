linger in our minds gliding down the
street switching the tools walking and
aiding with ease

be we knew we had to make walking a
reality walking was designed in
collaboration with seasoned shoe
designers and automotive engineers to
pair comfort with mechanical innovation
our product is ready but we need your
support to begin production we are not
merely asking for a handout by backing
our projects you will receive your very
own first edition fair of walking not
only that you will enable us to continue
development of cool additional features
we currently have plans but all this is
possible only if we meet our champion

7,000 meters 63,000 searches are
performed on Google and more people are
born all you can think about happens in
that measure of time that most people
consider significant the best thing we
can give us one second to react to keep
writing one second to change forever the
way you move because that's what we are
in seeing exclusively one second si an

created with precise detail to fulfill
all your needs as a cyclist only a
perfect product can give you that second
to react and keep writing that's the
only way to ride safe on the street the
hands unique design inhibits any kind of
vibration giving you a sharp and clear

vibration is dangerous in comparison
with other mayors we demonstrate that
the hand does not vibrate at all we want
you to ride the confidence and the only
way to do so is with a clear and precise
image for that reason we carefully
choose all the materials the acrylic

unlimited hand is the world's first
video game controller that allows user
to touch the virtual objects in the game
world by applying the electric pulse
signals to the users forearm muscles
unlimited hand controls the users finger
motions to make the virtual haptic
feedback unlimited hand also detects
each finger movements by using new
muscle motion sensor system with these
two patent-pending technologies combined
unlimited hand is brought to life now
user can directly manipulate and feel
the game world unlimited hands enables
one to fully dive into the gaming
experience reencountering virtual
objects and characters feeling and
interacting with them through the
extended dimension of touch with the
existing controllers user can't touch or
feel the game objects unlimited hand
gives users the ability to feel the
objects in virtual world not only touch
the objects in it after years of
research and development of feedback
technology we already finished working
prototype unlimited hand is made to be
easily integral with existing games
through unity plugins
moreover the circuit is designed as
Arduino compatible choose any platform
and enjoy hacking with unlimited hand
with backers support unlimited hand is
expanding for new AP eyes and many other
applications please support us and enjoy
touching and feeling the new world
