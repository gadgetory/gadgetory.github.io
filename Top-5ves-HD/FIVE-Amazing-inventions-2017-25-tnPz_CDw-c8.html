we've come an incredibly long way since
building prototypes in my garage almost
eight years ago we've got thousands of
one wheels out in the field and people
are riding them everywhere people of all
walks of life love this board and it
made us want to make something that
gives you more of what was already
awesome dude is that it did love it to
the pelle oh my god so I'm the first one
outside the company see this you are the
first person this is one wheel plus
everything the next generation one wheel
should be let's take it out and write it
feels much more instantaneous the motor
feels smoother to be even more like
flying the original one wheel who is
fantastic for what it was but it is such
a night and day difference as far as
stability and predictability a Ferrari
compared to a GTI as people push their
one wheels harder they want to go faster
they want to climb steeper Hills they
need more power we went back to the
drawing board to develop a whole new
motor traditionally hub motors have had
the problem of getting the heat out of
the core of the motor we develop hyper
core technology which is a new patented
way of pulling the heat out through the
axle that makes it more powerful
smoother and faster
forward
more and more we've been seeing people
using one wheel to commute to work or
school when you're actually getting from
point A to point B you always wish that
you want a little faster now with one
wheel plus that's not a problem
smoother at all speeds and it has a
higher top speed almost 19 miles an hour
one wheel plus is just refined in every
way you can be on any terrain in your
city and its said light everybody has
their own writing style when will plus
celebrates that our engineers worked
with some of the top shapers and riders
to extend digital shaping if you want a
floaty carving kind of ride or a stiffer
firmer tight trucks kind of ride you can
choose those from within the one-wheel
app with our new sure stands footpads
the whole front foot pad is a sensor you
wanna ride kicked out like downhill
slalom style you can do that now we also
have tip and tail kicks you're really
locked in for riding any kind of trains
there's no vibration it's totally quiet
sometimes you're not even sure there's a
motor in there plus is all about
rideability that means more control more
comfort and more confidence whether
you're beginner or an advanced rider
in 2014 mass fidelity came to you with
an idea and we weren't sure how the
market would accept it the response was
overwhelming we had an incredible amount
of pre-orders to date we've delivered
thousands of units to every corner of
the earth and they've been met with
amazing reviews from the most
prestigious media outlets to mass
fidelity the IndieGoGo community has
been a paramount importance we would
have never been able to bring the core

developed the rad to stand up and
provide incredible acoustic performance

the radial sound field technology
developed for the rad presents an
engaging sound field in any environment
using an array of for wide range speaker
drivers and one subwoofer we've
engineered a solution that will bring

stereo sound whether you're indoors or
outdoors the focus of the rad was not on
bells and whistles it was about creating
an amazing product that would stand up
in real-life situations it's rugged it's
weatherproof it's built to last the
feedback from our core campaign told us
that there was a demand for people that
wanted something even simpler they want
high-quality sound they want rugged
construction and they want it to be
portable they want to be able to bring
this experience with them anywhere
that's what the rad delivers the rad
includes mass fidelity's proprietary
networking technology this allows you to
stream uncompress music to any room in
your house without the need for Wi-Fi
because it leverages the same network as
the core you can simply and easily
extend your collection to include the
road since portability was key with the
rad we wanted to optimize the experience
for mobile devices NFC allows for
wireless pairing Bluetooth allows you to
enjoy all of the music apps exactly how
you've always enjoyed them analog input

USB can be used for charging we are so
excited to bring you the ride with your
