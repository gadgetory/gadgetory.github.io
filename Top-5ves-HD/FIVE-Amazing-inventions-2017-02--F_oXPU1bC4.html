Luigi we are the founders of Big C we

of Ixia near ago and my wife and I
wanted to control our smartphones and
tablets by cooking and biking with like
then I started out to design this
individual personal companion bixi that
can be used by anyone anywhere we have
assembled a talented and experienced
team that she's working hard at bringing
big sheet to you now to make it happens
we need your support pre-order your big
c today and be among the first ones to

are connected lives so what are you
waiting for online tutorials are so 2005

and dynamic way he lights up to show you

you are doing in real time this makes
spread x your own personal learning

oh come on Bacchus on IndieGoGo today
I'm help us revolutionize guitar learn
one chord at a time and you know that
special friend you used to play air
guitar web share this video with them
you'll be glad you did I'm just a
nutshell what is this all about so
what's special about it yeah everything
look at it it's gorgeous
how do you use it first time you open it
well how do you have you turn it on and
get the musical so cynical to connect
you just literally twist it it's the
only moving function on the actual
device twist it select whether you want
line in or bluetooth pairing up to your
phone and then you're going to get
exploring you'll find the best surface
that you want for you the best service
for the type of music you're listening
to if you place on the back of a window
you'll hear sound through both sides
bigger the surface you're placing it on
as well the bigger the sound you're
going to recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
going to take home and put them aside
and think it sounds great you're going
to show people that love so the other
feature we've got that's inside there as
well i think is really quite neat so if
you're in a space like this you can
place two speakers either side you've
got the stereo sound coming out of it
makes it amazing
we've done things really differently I
think for this campaign we want people
to be able to get hold of this product
quickly we've got 5,000 of the sizer our
products there it's done you want this
by Christmas get it signed up before
december the tenth and worship that you
for christmas
anything strange here
yeah quite unusual everyone is doing it
it appears and disappears
very curious
what you probably didn't notice is the
most important thing everyone is sitting
straight up
hello and welcome to cross your party
this is our test group proposed a small
silent and effective device that buzzes
when you slouch
simple and affordable
to show us when it triggers we asked our
participants to strike the funny pose
every time they feel a buzz
otherwise we would never notice because
hose is so discreet and invisible from
the outside here it is pose a magic
button that works much better than
countless reminders to sit up straight
and straighten up remember those so how
does it work first no apps no charging
no complicated diagrams we want results
in the mirror not on the screen with
pose it's simple you wear it at home at
work in school and no one will ever know
we'll repeat that no one will know place
it underneath your collarbone straighten
up and press a button that's it
post tracked your movement so if you
slouch for more than a minute it will
buzz pose also comes with an attachable
clip in case you find wearing it on your
clothes more comfortable start with 20
minutes a day and in three weeks you
will improve your posture here's why in
reality sitting up straight isn't about
you it's about your muscles they need
systematic and repetitive reminders over
time to memorize a new position and get
stronger pose does just that in a gentle
and discreet way a long time ago
Aristotle said we are what we repeatedly
do yes excellence is not an act but a
habit
we felt compelled to create a device
that will effortlessly get us into a new
healthy habit no matter for who you
order pose it will surely be one of the
most useful present you'll ever give the
best way to say sit up is not saying it
at all join us now and let's make it
happen strike a pose
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
