yeah waking up is never easy thanks to
big see one move and they could stop
their alarm and that's just the
beginning they can also control all
kinds of connected devices which simple
gestures sperry useful when alex is on
his bike and can't focus on anything but
the road or what lisa is so busy working
doing stuff that she just can't touch
her devices just like them any time you
want to do many things at the same time
bixi can help it's smart seamless and
easy well easier than cooking apparently
no need to stop doing what you're doing
no need to reach the device you want to
interact with you can even switch from
one function to another or from one
device to another with a simple gesture
told you it was smart and because fixie
is full of surprises it also lets you
control your environment
believe me that's something you will
like well you know almost everything no
good at all say oh hi this is Vijay I am
Luigi we are the founders of Big C we
know how busy hands are challenged to
control connected devices I had the idea
of Ixia near ago and my wife and I
wanted to control our smartphones and
tablets by cooking and biking with like
then I started out to design this
individual personal companion bixi that
can be used by anyone anywhere we have
assembled a talented and experienced
team that she's working hard at bringing
big sheet to you now to make it happens
we need your support pre-order your big
c today and be among the first ones to
enjoy the simplicity that it brings two
are connected lives so what are you
waiting for online tutorials are so 2005
imagine if anyone who's always wanted to
play the guitar actually could let me
introduce you to the fret eggs the prep
eggs is the first device that teaches
you how to play the guitar in a playful
and dynamic way he lights up to show you
where to place your fingers so you can
start learning chords and songs right
away Phil asked me how it works how does
it work just to slide and attach the
threat eggs onto the fret board of your
own guitar connected via bluetooth to
the mobile app and start having fun for
total beginners like field here we have
a set of exercises that will teach you
the basic chords in one hour once you
get those down just select a song from
the app one our fuel keeps from in
follow the lights and play your favorite
tunes the app also tells you how well
you are doing in real time this makes
spread x your own personal learning
experience
and for you guitar teachers out there
we've got you covered to Fred X is
teacher friendly unlike the pencil you
written your last guitar tab by hand
step into the 21st century and start
sharing your lessons be afraid x our app
is an open platform that lets you upload
your own content or share your favorite
youtube links with your audience great
for teachers and musicians alike I know
what your thing this sounds too good to
be true right yeah I'm a guitar guidance
but only in my heart let Fred x free
arena rock stop wanna play done a time
frame x only takes an hour there is an
easier way all I ever wanted was to play
the guitar but I'm cursed left-handed
Fred x is for lefties too I just want a
girlfriend we left them alone with a
fret X for a little while and look at
them now Fred eggs really is that simple
it brings people together to share the
love of music who knows maybe you'll
meet that special someone I still have a
girlfriend keep strumming filled with
red X you'll be able to get rid of all
that stuff that's holding you back from
Alicia your creativity you'll be happier
and you'll feel more confident
oh come on Bacchus on IndieGoGo today
I'm help us revolutionize guitar learn
one chord at a time and you know that
special friend you used to play air
guitar web share this video with them
you'll be glad you did I'm just a
nutshell what is this all about so
what's special about it yeah everything
look at it it's gorgeous
how do you use it first time you open it
well how do you have you turn it on and
get the musical so cynical to connect
you just literally twist it it's the
only moving function on the actual
device twist it select whether you want
line in or bluetooth pairing up to your
phone and then you're going to get
exploring you'll find the best surface
that you want for you the best service
for the type of music you're listening
to if you place on the back of a window
you'll hear sound through both sides
bigger the surface you're placing it on
as well the bigger the sound you're
going to recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
going to take home and put them aside
and think it sounds great you're going
to show people that love so the other
feature we've got that's inside there as
well i think is really quite neat so if
you're in a space like this you can
place two speakers either side you've
got the stereo sound coming out of it
makes it amazing
we've done things really differently I
think for this campaign we want people
to be able to get hold of this product
quickly we've got 5,000 of the sizer our
products there it's done you want this
by Christmas get it signed up before
december the tenth and worship that you
for christmas
anything strange here
yeah quite unusual everyone is doing it
it appears and disappears
very curious
what you probably didn't notice is the
most important thing everyone is sitting
straight up
hello and welcome to cross your party
this is our test group proposed a small
silent and effective device that buzzes
when you slouch
simple and affordable
to show us when it triggers we asked our
participants to strike the funny pose
every time they feel a buzz
otherwise we would never notice because
hose is so discreet and invisible from
the outside here it is pose a magic
button that works much better than
countless reminders to sit up straight
and straighten up remember those so how
does it work first no apps no charging
no complicated diagrams we want results
in the mirror not on the screen with
pose it's simple you wear it at home at
work in school and no one will ever know
we'll repeat that no one will know place
it underneath your collarbone straighten
up and press a button that's it
post tracked your movement so if you
slouch for more than a minute it will
buzz pose also comes with an attachable
clip in case you find wearing it on your
clothes more comfortable start with 20
minutes a day and in three weeks you
will improve your posture here's why in
reality sitting up straight isn't about
you it's about your muscles they need
systematic and repetitive reminders over
time to memorize a new position and get
stronger pose does just that in a gentle
and discreet way a long time ago
Aristotle said we are what we repeatedly
do yes excellence is not an act but a
habit
we felt compelled to create a device
that will effortlessly get us into a new
healthy habit no matter for who you
order pose it will surely be one of the
most useful present you'll ever give the
best way to say sit up is not saying it
at all join us now and let's make it
happen strike a pose
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
