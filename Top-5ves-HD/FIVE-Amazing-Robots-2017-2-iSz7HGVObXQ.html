you
hello I'm maker arm the world's first
multi functional robotic arm that fits
anywhere in your workspace I have
changeable tool heads that allow me to
do some really neat stuff and I can help
my humans make just about anything
I can 3d print freely since I don't live
in a box
I can auto level so my humans don't have
to I can make things up to 30 inches
long and 10 inches tall on any flat
surface I can make high quality 3d
prints with both filament and resin but
I can do a lot more than just 3d
printing I'm great at building the next
big thing like this I can cut sheets and
3d print corners I can pick and place
sheets and panels together and create a
custom PCB I can solder assemble
components I can even work with fellow
maker arms
voila
here's our finished project a custom
laptop I can be operated wirelessly on
all of your devices plus my humans can
teach me tricks and send me remote
instructions I was made for creative
people everywhere I can make really
impressive toys paint on canvas and
fabric and create custom invites I can
etch glass engrave plastic and leather
carve metal and wood I can also plot
design
and yes I can even decorate cakes
another cool thing my humans can design
their own custom tool heads for me it
feels great helping my humans build
their dreams and I would love to see
maker arms and labs garages and
tinkering stations everywhere that's why
I'm here on Kickstarter my makers have
spent two years perfecting me and my
fellow maker arms right now we are
working prototypes and need to be
manufactured so we can be on our way to
all you with your help together we can
make anything anywhere
hi my name is Tapia and this is a story
about me and my family hope you enjoy it

these are your things but these are the
things that matter and somewhere in
between is this guy introducing Chiba
the world's first family robot say hi G
Bo hi g bo g bo helps everyone out
throughout their day he's the world's
best camera man strolls by intelligently
tracking the action around him he can
independently take video and photos so
that you can put down your camera and be
a part of the scene he's a hands-free
helper you can talk to him and he'll
talk to you back so you don't have to
skip a beat excuse me and yes you bow
Melissa just sent a reminder that she's
picking you up in half an hour to go
grocery shopping
thanks to Bo he's an entertainer and
educator through interactive
applications g bo can teach hey where'd
you go there you he's the closest thing
to a real life teleportation device he
can turn and look at whoever you want
with a simple tap of your finger
check out my took you dinner mouth and
wish you wouldn't eat the whole year
I'm a turkey visa and he's a platform so
his skills he picks fear he'll be able
to connect to your home welcome home
Eric hey buddy
can you order some takeout for me sure
thing Chinese as usual you know me so
well and even be a great wingman you
have a voice message from Ashley want to
hear it absolutely better make that take
off her 2g bow we've jumped of it for
years and now he's finally here and he's
not just an aluminum shell nor is he
just a 3-axis motor system he's not even
just a connected device he's one of the
family G Bo this little bod of mine what
if technology actually treated you like
a human being
what if technology helps you to feel
closer to the ones you love
what if technology helped you like a
partner rather than simply being a tool
that's what she was about that's why I
created this company and I've got the
right team to do it people with a proven
track record of bringing innovative
technologies and exciting content to
market but now we need your help to
build Gebo to bring it to the world and
to grow the community let's work
together to make Cibo truly great and
together we can humanize technology
you
we're kids hack day and here in the last
two years we've been running technology
workshops for kids all over the world
based on this experience no work with
straw bees we have created a maker toy
combining programming electronics and
mechanics we call it a quirk but it's a
toy to make toys work but is the
microcontroller toy that anyone can
program it works with Arduino and the
construction toys straw bees would
squeeze on electronics you can connect
components to the legs of the quark plot
by simply squeezing a straw over them
snap on a backpack to add extra
functions with work but it's easy for
anyone to build an interactive project
in an instant the quark part requires no
soldiering or read boarding and you can
recharge it with a standard microUSB
working with kids we have designed an
easy-to-use visual programming interface
that runs directly in your browser so
you can create modify and share projects
with your friends quark but adds life to
your creations bringing motion sound and
light to almost anything regular straws
become the framework for your
imagination I'm an elephant we believe
that making your own toys should be as
fun as playing with them so order your
quark pot today and start making
[Laughter]
