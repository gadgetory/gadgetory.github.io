CSP so what is CSP well it's counter
surfing pets of course and millions of
pet owners worldwide could be afflicted
with it and we're here to help after
years of training and trying multiple
products our pets are stilled habitual
counter servers
meat cat nanny the little robot that
lives on your counter and teaches your
pet to stay off it's taken a lot of
design work mock-ups and prototypes but
we think we now have it figured out
after a few times being sprayed the
ultrasonic warning will be all that's
needed and eventually most tests will
learn to stay off the counter completely
be part of the solution help fund the
cure for CSP two percent of all profits
from cat nanny sales will go to the
Humane Society thank you so much for

push notifications emails text messages

serious you often confuse your food with
your phone then you need a banana phone
banana phone is a Bluetooth enabled
mobile handset that connects to your
smartphone so you can talk to your
friends and family on a banana we like
to think of it as a phone with appeal
and we're taking a bite out of the Apple
accessory market one banana at a time oh

robust banana handset with you in mind
based into this delicious design

again cinder is a kitchen countertop
grill unlike anything you've ever seen
or tasted watch oh we're about to cook
dinner uses advanced electronics and
software control inspired by satellites
so what you're seeing here is not a
standard grill with standard heating
coils syndra adjusts hundreds of times a
second to control your foods temperature
to within one degree
syndra is more precise than your
thermometer temperature precision is
required to perfectly cook your steak
chicken and salmon edge to edge without
guesswork when you pan fry at home it's
difficult to nail the temperature that's
precisely the difference of just five
degrees makes or breaks your food this
is even difficult for restaurants to do
but with cinder you nail it every time
what I'm showing you here is exactly
what your safe will look like all I did
was set cinder to my desired doneness
place the steak inside and wait 30
minutes for cinder to beep it knows when
the food has reached temperature as a
final step I cranked cinder up to for
250 degrees for a quick sear to
caramelize the exterior that makes it
look and tastes exactly like this in
some sense it's just a regular frying
pan except with precise temperature
control but wow that precise temperature
controller makes all the difference we
make salmon that melts in the mouth and
you know thick pork chops was that never
cooked before because it dried out while
we put it in the center and it's perfect
sakes perfect it gives you the precision
that should be but with the convenience
of microwave cooking anything you can
put into a normal grill you can put into
cinder and not only cinder is
to use as a normal grill it also makes
it impossible to overcook your food
because senders grill plates constantly
hold your food at target temperature
sender catches technology up with modern
food science this changes everything
