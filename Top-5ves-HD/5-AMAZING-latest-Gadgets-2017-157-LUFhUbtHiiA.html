are we ready yeah ready and actually
you
we have many goals in life from managing
stress to increasing fitness we want to
be healthier and perform better we work
hard and track progress because we know
that we can best improve that which we
measure but in order to make real
progress on all of these goals we need
to more deeply understand the true state
of our body and mind hi I'm Jason Moore
health coach and founder of the top
rated elite HR via and I'm excited to
introduce the courses the course sense
measures heart rate variability also
called HR v HR V is a deeper and more
comprehensive biomarker than something
like steps or heart rate it's kind of
like the check engine light for your
entire body in mind heart rate
variability examines the tiny
imperceptible changes and patterns
between heartbeats our advanced
algorithms analyze these precise times
between heartbeats and detects activity
from the nervous system which actually
controls processes like energy
regulation digestion mood and the
response to stress the core scent slips
directly onto a finger and connects via
bluetooth with any heart rate
variability out so you can capture an
HIV measurement in as little as two five
minutes each day that could be first
thing in the morning while waiting for
your morning coffee or even for live
biofeedback during much-needed
meditation with this simple daily
check-in the elite HRV app guides you in
optimizing your nutrition training
recovery sleep stress and more heart
rate variability plays a key role in
tracking the progress of my patients
today they come into my facility to get
their HRV readings but because courses
are so easy to use my patients can now
track their HRV at home this will help
me to regularly check their progress
adjust the treatment plan and speed up
their journey to better health and
well-being with course sense an HRV
our mission has been to help people
tackle their goals whatever they may be
and improve their lives but without the
discomfort and inconvenience of chest
straps and adhesives over the years we
heard from so many of our hundred
thousand-plus app users that's why we
partnered with experts and innovators
and sensitive technology
to come up with the course sense from
the ground up it has a rechargeable
battery that can go up to six months on
a single charge it has a flexible design
that will comfortably fit fingers of all
sizes and shapes the core sense doesn't
come with any buttons it is intelligent
and will automatically power on when you
insert your finger then it'll detect
your pulse and connect to the HIV app
accuracy and sensitivity are really
important to us you really need accuracy
in order to measure valid and useful HIV
that's why we designed the course ins
with medical grade sensors that are
comparable to a five lead ECG it has
built in an advanced signal algorithm to
help detect arrhythmia the topic
heartbeats and even false beats
attributed to signal noise you take a
two minute HIV reading in the morning
and instantly see your results which we
call our morning readiness gauge the
gauge gives you a green yellow or red
indicator of how able you are to handle
stress on any given day you can also tag
your reading with things like alcohol
consumption your mood exercise or sleep
to gain a deeper understanding of those
items that most impact you as you make
changes in your lifestyle or in your
exercise plan after years of research
development prototyping and rigorous
testing we're ready to bring core sense
to you the Kickstarter community we
simply need the initial capital to
complete tooling and start full-scale
manufacturing support our Kickstarter to
receive your own corsets and in just two
minutes a day start making vastly better
decisions for your health performance
stress and resilience Thank You
