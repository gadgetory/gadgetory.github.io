aftershokz Trek's titanium be open hi
I'm Scott Hyman heir three years ago I
fell in love with sous-vide cooking back
then the only sous-vide machines
available were $1200 repurposed
laboratory devices so I decided to
reverse engineer my own and post the
instructions for a $75 DIY sous-vide
machine online it was a crude makeshift
solution that required a lot of work to
build but that didn't stop over a
thousand people from completing the
project ever since my first taste of a
sous-vide egg it's been my dream to
bring this style of cooking to the world
in recent years a few companies have
marketed devices for sous-vide cooking
but nobody's produced a good-looking
affordable high quality circulator yet I
think we can do better together with my
teammates here in Seattle we've created
the songs air sous-vide circulator it's
powerful it's beautiful and it only
costs $199 it's also really easy to use
just turn the ring to set the
temperature the Sancerre uses a very
accurate thermometer and a
microcontroller to maintain the correct
temperature to within a fraction of a
degree the Sancerre also circulates
water to even out hot and cold spots the
motor circulates watering up to a 6
gallon bath but it is so quiet you can
barely hear it running when you're ready
to eat just remove your food from the
water bath if you'd like finish it off
with a quick sear
because we cook sous-vide all the time
we wanted to design a machine that looks
great in any kitchen we also made sure
the display was easy to read from across
the room in darkness or in daylight
Kickstarter we need your support to fund
our first production run of the Sonde's
air immersion circulator we've worked
our way to production samples built from
final components and we're ready to
start full-scale production but we can't
do it without your help please share
this video with your friends and back us
on Kickstarter so you can be one of the
first to have the sun's air in your own
kitchen thank you
