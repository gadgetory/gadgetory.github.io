all of these can be programmed to do
whatever you'd like with the help of our
extensive wiki library with the magnetic
and stackable M cookie modules we
eliminated the need for soldering messy
wiring in complicated coding our modules
can be programmed using either Arduino
or scratch for those learning to code
the color-coded modules include core
function communication and extension to
execute your commands and all of our
sensors and components have lego-style
brackets that are compatible with the
entire Mike road we know ecosystem start
by powering up the rechargeable and
battery with a micro USB connection then
