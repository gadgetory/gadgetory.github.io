so you might not been able to hear that
for using Ori I was able to have a call
and that's because Ori is avoid a
citizen ring that turns your finger into
a smartphone all through just a touch of
the year but why that's because the way
in which we're using the devices is
changing changing from a world where we
use screens and touch to one where we
talk now Ori uses a bone conduction and
bone conduction has been used in many
medical grade devices we package it in a
way that ascends vibrations through your
finger directly into your ears only you
can hear and that allows you to hear and
talk to just your finger amen
that's music like the thanks to bone
conduction and the dual noise cancelling
microphone you can hear and talk events
and lastly
so check this out or it is perfectly
private and discreet using it in a
futuristic a secret Asian Inori is more
than just a neat gadget for taking and
making calls because behind it is
powerful voice artificial intelligence
