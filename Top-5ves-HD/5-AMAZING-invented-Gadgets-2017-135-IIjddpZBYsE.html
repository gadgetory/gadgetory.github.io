hi my name is Olaf I'm the founder of
fields collective during the last year
we have created this miss world's first
digital pin with it you can create wear
and share and kind of get to a pattern
that you wish just open up the app and
choose from one of your friends or
followers design
why not define one of your own pin in
the crater here you can choose any color
text the pattern you can also take a
picture or upload one from your library
our team has created prototypes for the
pin in the app now we need you to join
pins collected at the compart of our
extended team please support us on
Kickstarter and help us reach our goal
yeah okay that sounds good I'll see you
in a bit
so you might not been able to hear that
for using Ori I was able to have a call
and that's because Ori is avoid a
citizen ring that turns your finger into
a smartphone all through just a touch of
the year but why that's because the way
in which we're using the devices is
changing changing from a world where we
use screens and touch to one where we
talk now Ori uses a bone conduction and
bone conduction has been used in many
medical grade devices we package it in a
way that ascends vibrations through your
finger directly into your ears only you
can hear and that allows you to hear and
talk to just your finger amen
that's music like the thanks to bone
conduction and the dual noise cancelling
microphone you can hear and talk events
and lastly
so check this out or it is perfectly
private and discreet using it in a
futuristic a secret Asian Inori is more
than just a neat gadget for taking and
making calls because behind it is
powerful voice artificial intelligence
our friends series in Google assistant
it puts them exactly where you need them
think about all the different things
that you can do and one of my favorite
translation all you have to do is just
remotion upwards and say already how do
I say where are the burritos in Spanish
hello Rodrigo understand los burritos
and just like burritos come in different
flavors Ori comes in three different
colors I guarantee you there's an Ori
ring for every outfit and every occasion
and even better Ori the splash-proof -
look guys I know how popular you are and
that's why you have the Ori app because
it helps you filter out everything else
and there's four LED lights that tell
you what kind of messages are coming
through come on let's hit the streets to
see what people think of Ori hey oh this
looks really cleaner
