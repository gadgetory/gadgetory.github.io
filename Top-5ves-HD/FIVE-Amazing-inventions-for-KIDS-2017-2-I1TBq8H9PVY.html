to seven hours in front of screams
everyday rocks is here to change that
we've been gaining action off-screen and
into real life imagine playing Mario
Bros in the backyard get kids active
with engage and entertain them in the
same way as video games and that's where
rocks come to play
locks are wirelessly connected super
durable high-tech pots each rocks has
several smart sensors inside and comes
with different sound and light effects
the rocks box comes with three rocks a
controller with a bunch of
pre-programmed games on it and three
holsters and straps to fix rocks to any
kind of object or person to start select
a game and one of the 50 player profiles
then put rocks on the ground or use the
straps to fix them anywhere there
different game categories kappa go games
such as the crazy chicken a target drone
brute games on capture the rocks and
different kinds of tag dogs zombie tag
for example is the game that kids love
the most
everybody straps a box on then one rocks
will hash I'm gonna start to make a
sound like a zombie the kid then has to
tag other tips and afternoon tags he or
she will become a zombie as well as the
goal is to turn all the other kids into
zombies the key thing is that kids come
up with new crazy ways to play all the
time
it's 2016 and videogames are part of
children's lives but too much is too
much
let's get kids away from screens and
bring the game into real life since kids
get distracted easily parents are always
concerned about how to best communicate
with their kids as education experts say
it is crucial for parents to help kids
form good habits in this stage now we
have honey but the first educational
family robot designed especially for
young kids distinguishing from other
similar products we have integrated AR
technology into interactive activities
for example kids can draw a picture and
then honey bots will recognize the
object and turn it into animation with
educational explanation and music we
have also prepared many flashcards of
diverse objects with AR technology
kids can show the flashcards to honey
BOTS and honey BOTS will display the
objects on the screen in 3d form with
explanation to help kids learn and
memorize honey bots habit-forming system
was designed to help parents guide their
kids to develop good habits easily kids
can keep a virtual pet with honey bot
like a real pet you will get hungry
dirty and tired as the pet owners the
kids will need to feed it give it bats
and put it to bed according to different
scenes from such interactions kids will
be able to gradually build good habits
besides it's educating function
honey bot is also designed to help
communication between parents and kids
be more fun and effective parents can
use the voice changing function with
smart phones and send a voice message to
honey pot honey Bob will then play the
message to kids with a funny voice even
when parents are miles away they can
video call their kids and talk to them
face to face
we hope that honey bot becomes the angel
of your home by providing good company
for your kids helping you and your kids
bond and helping kids gain knowledge and
develop good habits considering the
safety issues we only use the safest and
most environmental friendly materials to
make honey buck and we made it into more
of a round shape without sharp angles we
have already finished our MD and small
batch production now we need your help
and support to mass produce honey bot
please support us and make honey bot
into reality kids these days are always
out and about and we as parents need a
reliable way to make sure our kids are
safe at all times

doki washed like designed in a way that
appeals to kids design is fun cool and
functional at the same time and with
Yumi oxes full manufacturing support and
partnership we're confident that we'll
be able to reach full-scale
manufacturing by March 2016 and have our
first shipments ready for our backers by
May
thank you for taking the time to visit
our Kickstarter page

how'd you learn about robotics well the
best way is with a robot we'd like to
introduce you to Marty a fully
programmable and customizable walking
robot for kids for makers and for
educators Marty's not your standard
smart toy he's designed by robot assists
to be a real robot that you can do some
really cool stuff with while being as
fun as a toy you can use Marty to learn
about robotics programming electronics
and mechanics or you can build your own
stuff with a walking robot that will
hold a Raspberry Pi and which you can
customize with 3d printed parts Marty's
not like other walking robots his unique
3 motor and spring leg design lowers
costs but also makes him easier to use
and his battery lasts longer he can walk
turn kick a ball and of course do funky
dances
marty is Wi-Fi enabled so you can remote
control or program him from your phone
or computer you can also download apps
or games other users have made from our
robot app store marty lets you learn
real programming on a real robot start
off with scratch where the coding is as
simple as clicking and dragging blocks
you can make a dance routine or start
interacting with the environment when
you're ready you can move into python a
powerful but easy to use programming
language but robotics is way more than
just programming Marty lets you learn
about all kinds of things motor control
balance sensors mechanical design and
more marty is really customizable and
upgradable the electronics make it easy
to add all kinds of sensors and motors
and they leave a support to whole
computer like a Raspberry Pi at a camera
and you could even program him to play
football all the parts are 3d printable
so you can make whatever you can imagine
Marty started out and as a side project
during my PhD I've got nieces and
nephews who are starting to get to the
age where they can play with robots but
I couldn't see a walking robot Tori that
was more than a novelty or at least not
one I could afford so I'm able we can
actually use Marty to help teach
robotics at university but this is easy
to use as any other toy also as a maker
I wanted a walking robot that I could
use as a base to build cool stuff with
I've spent the last year and a half
working on this little guy and now we're
ready to go from the functional
prototype into a real kit that you can
buy we've spoken to manufacturers and we
know how to do it but we need your help
to make it
please help us make Marty a reality
