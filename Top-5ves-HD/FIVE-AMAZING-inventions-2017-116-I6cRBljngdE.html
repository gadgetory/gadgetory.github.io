augmented reality lets you dive into a
world where your imagination is brought
to life in everyday settings augmented
reality can bring anything from joy and
entertainment to real world practicality
such as optical learning hands-on design
and the visualization of models when
designing a Rising simplicity and
usability is at the heart of augmented
reality as we had imagined with the
cardboard Google brought virtual reality
to everyone with arisin we are doing the
same thing but for augmented reality
this led us to a product that is both
intuitive and its use and only a
fraction of the price of current
solutions we are a small and dedicated
team of designers developers and
programmers and what we have shown you
today are just some of the concepts that
we have built to showcase the
fascinatingly large potential that
augmented reality has to offer with
arisin we're giving you the chance to
truly experience augmented reality and
to combine it with everyday real world
applications we are excited to be
bringing augmented reality to everyone
what we need is an initial investment to
cover some of our production costs but
also to kickstart app development so

one of the hardest things about being a
parent is constantly worrying about if
your son or daughter is healthy and
whether or not they're being taken care
of kiddo is the world's first health and
wellness track of me just for young kids
kids all the way from 3 years to 10
years we really created this to allow
parents to have valuable insights about
the child's health and activity while
allowing kids to be kids to have fun
thrilled our technology that's design
and build to connect parents and
children together the kiddie rebel has
an accelerometer a PPG for heart rate
have sweat sensor to measure how access
they are and a temperature sensor we
combine all of these streams of data to
make these informed insights that the
parents can then learn sense there's
only so much information you can get
from a kid especially when they're
younger sometimes they're not able to
verbalize exactly what's going on the
kiddo app takes the data and provides
you not just VIN types of how they are
in that moment but how to make things
better it gives you steps to take to
help your habit with kiddo at the
beginning of the day I'm couraging
eating healthy and Holly habits during
the day when I'm at work and I'm curious
how my daughter is doing I can look at
the app to know my child is healthy and
being active and at the end of the day I
can get a sense of how much sleep
they're getting at night having that
objective data saying your child's heart
rate is at the appropriate rate they're
healthy they're doing well or your child
is actually feeling some stresses maybe
we need to talk to them and there's a
way to kind of intervene before things
go too far along I was able to gather
from kiddo that
childlike beginnings Nick I would be
more concerned with what they're eating
how much water they're drinking and how
much leaks are getting at night and make
adjustments to their schedule the goal
was to create a device for the kids so
they end up loving it it has to be fun
it has to be cool it had to be engaging
they can change the top covers depending
on their personality they can play tag
with it they can control the different
toys and kids can create music with it
