an extension ladder as you can see I'm
holding everything at once I have the
paint can and the extension mate paint
station Pro and it can even hold a
scraper and a couple brushes on
super-strong magnets now I have
everything I need to paint in one hand
that leaves my other hand free to climb
the ladder
this makes it super easy so you don't
have to go up and down the ladder over
and over again carrying your supplies
and getting where you want to be now
that you're right where you want to be
the paint station Pro slides right into
the side now I'm right where I want to
paint and I have all my supplies ready
to go this even has a magnet on front so
that while I'm painting it drips right
back down into the can this product is
perfect if you're ever gonna be painting
on an extension ladder I'm going to show
you how to set up and use the quick
painter the quick painter is a trimming
tool that has a pad a trigger and a fill
handle to fill it we're gonna remove the
pad attachment and put the tip of the
quick painter into our paint we're gonna
depress the trigger pull back on the
fill handle and wait for a moment while
it fills with paint when it's full we
release the trigger we're gonna wipe off
the excess paint from the fill tube and
now we can put the pad attachment back
on
I like the pad attachment opposite of
the trigger and I'll show you why
there's a little air in here so we'll
want to purge that and what we'll do is
we'll want to hold a rag in front of it
and we'll push the trigger and you'll
hear that air come out and now we're
ready to go you can see the paint is
coming out beginning to come out with
the holes now we're going to use the
quick painter to cut in along this
window to do that I'm going to put the
edge there's a guide on the edge of the
pad here right up against the trim on
the window I'm gonna give the trigger a
little push to feed a little paint as I
do that I'm gonna move it up and down to
work the paint into the pad now is I
need a little paint
I'll give the trigger a push I'm just
working it in I can cut right up to the
edge of the window
after edging is complete you can remove
the pad attachment he press the trigger
and return unused paint back into the
can this will save paint and speed
