you the indestructible Kevlar belt
this year our belt is not only
indestructible but has two more super
features for unparalleled comfort and
tailor-made sizes we call it the smart
belt
take a look our patented Kevlar core
makes the whole belt in destruction
coupled with beautiful Italian top grain
leather this belt will not tear stretch
or fail you in any way it's five times
stronger than anything we have tested as
well as like and more flexible a major
switch for this year is the elimination
of the classic holes on the belt our new
ratchet and track system works like a
zit type it has micro steps that really
lets you adjust to the exact that you
need in each moment of the day and each
activity
you will be blown away by how
comfortable our belt is let's be honest
holes are not really practical for
adjustment when you want to loosen your
belt and you go one hole up it's too
loose you're wonderful down it's too
tight not comfortable at all going from
five holes one inch apart to 32 steps
1/5 of an inch apart is a huge leap it's
a whole new level and a completely
different field our ambition is to make
a product that is the utmost quality and
beauty no detail has been overlooked
we have also done away with belt sizes
because they're not really precise
especially if you're in between no need
to worry about ordering the wrong size
or giving it as a present you'll get the
maximum size and you will cut it and
attach it to the buckle for a perfect
do-it-yourself kill inside in two colors
multiple puzzle finishes this belt is
covered in top grain italian leather for
universal elegance we are kickstarter
veterans with an experienced production
and fulfillment ticket our campaigns all
start shipping on time and we will have
our first belt out in no more than a
month shipped with dragon we're proud to
have put together the most advanced belt
ever made our very own smart belt back
our project so we can make it a reality
thank you for being a part to the
Kickstarter community

when traveling you already have a lot of
things on your mind now charging all
your devices won't be one of them we've
been working on this product for nearly
two years and with your support we can
scale production for worldwide
distribution order yours today
with my family I found that it was
really hard to share photos and videos
with everyone involved someone has an
iPhone someone doesn't someone is on
Facebook someone isn't so it's really
hard to find a common place where all
our families could share photos and
videos with the ally order you're just
one tap away from seeing them on the
biggest screen of your home which is
your TV how I mean home or house in
Hawaiian so it's a connected device for
the home to help family members share
their lives together you can see
memories immediately as they come or it
can easily scroll through thousands of
photos whether they're from yesterday
last week last month or last year we've
been working on the Hollywood for over a
year generating on both the hardware and
software the user interface is built
from the ground up specifically for the
orb it is designed to handle hundreds or
even thousands of images easily
we've been meticulously tuning not only
the way the orb looks but the way it
feels in your hand well the initial
design started as just kind of an orb
split in half but I felt that it was
still lacking some bit of personality
and so one of my favorite parts about
the design that we eventually arrived at
was having this tilt to it where instead
of being just sort of ambiguously
relating to the environment all around
it really kind of presented itself to
you and invited interaction with it as a
designer my goal with any project would
be to change the experience of the
actual users we wanted to help family
members connect with each other and
that's why we created the halyard
this is your smartphone this is your
wall charger the wall charger was
meticulously created with no one in mind
its massiveness makes it a truth hassle
to carry around and it's cables are
designed to get beautifully tangled in
truth very little thought was given to
the wall charger well it's a good thing
there's kado
the world's first truly slim wall
charger it's only 5 millimeters thin
less than any phone and it weighs just
21 grams with its foldable prongs cuttle
fits any wallet or back and behind any
so it has a 2 foot 9 inch long
retractable cable to keep you organized
and the cable detaches so you can use it
with any USB outlet caddo comes in US
and European versions coupled with its
micro U with v USB C and Apple certified
lightning cables you can charge any
Apple or Android device almost anywhere
in the world
the powers up to 10 watts has rapid
charge as a standard and there's also an
optional clip for your phone so you're
always prepared it charges phones
tablets and a ton of other device you
can't even imagine the engineering
efforts that it takes to make such a
quality slim wall charger for nearly two
years we obsessed about this technology
we wanted to make charges as sleek as
phones without compromising quality so
we combined a lot of brainpower and
experience to achieve what electronic
companies couldn't a truly slim wall
charger now it's here and it finally
makes sense your phone your charger the
way it should have always been
kado charging cable Bluetooth speaker
and holder stand
now it's time to combine them into one
unit this is a moon sonata the peaceful
atmosphere in full moon night inspired
us so we determined to compose this
sonata

artwork to give sadaqa an elegant
looking while a long lasting usage we
adopt high and aluminum simplicity is
