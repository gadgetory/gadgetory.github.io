shouldn't have to that's where capsule
comes in introducing capsule by nebula
the world's most advanced pocket cinema
a soda-can sized pico projector with
remarkable picture and sound when we
started building a powerful speaker into
such a small device without compromising

challenge so we had to get creative we
proactively built in a 360-degree
speaker with enhanced bass and boosted
treble and cut 9000 holes in the speaker
grill to make capsule the world's first
pico projector with omnidirectional
sound but we didn't just want it to be
small and loud we wanted to make it
really smart traditionally so called
smart projectors come with TV chipsets
which makes them big and laggy we
integrated the most advanced smartphone
chipset ever used in a pico projector
into capsule making it the smartest
projector the world has ever seen
capsule is the first projector ever

seamlessly watch Netflix YouTube and any
other streaming app directly plus
capsule can wirelessly mirror content
from virtually any mobile device to
