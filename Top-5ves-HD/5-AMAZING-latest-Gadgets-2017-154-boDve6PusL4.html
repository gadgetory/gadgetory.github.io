plane does there's flying and there's
flying meet powerup darts a paper
airplane that's not just flying it's
flying
this is shy a pilot industrial designer
and inventor shine loves everything
airborne four years ago he was
challenged by a friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
which I accepted the challenge and
created power up three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
then two years ago that same friend
challenged him to put a camera on the
plane so shy created power up fpv the
first ever smartphone controlled paper
airplane with a streaming camera shiz
friend looked at those creations and
said cool but you can't make a paper
plane that can do a loop and a barrel
roll and then stall turn then just shy
stops his friend before he
hyperventilated and said challenge
accepted now after a year of prototyping
and testing it's here
power up Dart the first ever smartphone
control paper airplane that can do
aerobatics
yes other planes can fly but they can't
loop or barrel roll or fly vertically
dark can it is incredible and it is
small just take a piece of paper fold it
into a plane catch the module download
the app and tell your friends GeForce
got nothing on you you're an aerobatic
pilot now powerup dark gets it's
incredible aerobatic capability from the
high thrust-to-weight ratio and unique
shape of the plane despite being so
incredible why the dart is easy and
intuitive
move the phone to any direction and the
wings will follow when you start the
plane goes to 70% of its throttle so you
can fly it like a regular player but
press the boost button and you give the
plane that extra kick that transforms it
into a flying monster a small flying
monster power-ups Bluetooth module
easily charges through its microUSB port
and the entire thing is made of carbon
fiber an island so it's nearly
indestructible dart invites you to make
many planes in many shapes because every
plane brings with it new tricks and with
them new gasps for air try 5 10 50
planes then fly them all together make a
real show arrange dogfights break every
barrier previously set by less
incredible planes and this little bugger
is so cool it can even fly around the
office yeah you just sent a love note
through a smartphone control paper
airplane you have lived powerup dart is
ready for production so if you want to
fly aerobatics with the most incredible
all incredible planes back power up dart
and start flying I'm Julie frost and I'm
from Queensland Australia I'm the
designer and founder of the hub chain
when I was designing the hub chair oh it
came very innocently and unexpectedly I
was sitting in my camping chair so I
kind of realized that everybody had a
common problem everybody wanted to take
their gadgets outdoors their cameras
their phones their music and all of them
had a common requirement and that was
power they all had batteries and
batteries died so it finally came to me
there had to be one device to charge
your gadgets and one device to play your
music and it would be brilliant to
connect that to the chair so I invented
the hello hub chair is perfect for
anyone who wants to enjoy the great
outdoors play music and keep their
gadgets changed you can share the table
with your friends you can even link two
together so everybody's enjoying the
party the hub chair is comfortable
durable and sturdy and everybody feels
great in it
I've taken my hub chair from Australia
to America to the beach to the picnics
of the sports games to the market stall
holders to the Car Shows to the
barbecues and everywhere I go everybody
is loving it I'm bringing hot chair to
Kickstarter so I can launch my product
and company to the world I currently
have all of my factories and
manufacturing resources lined up
including to link molding and materials
and they'll be ready for delivery by
April next year you can pledge for the
whole enchilada different configurations
or even just the cool bag by itself
choose the reward that best suits you
and please share our campaign with your
friends thanks so much for watching see
ya
the average person in the u.s. logs over
nine hours a day of screen time
nine hours whether working or relaxing
all that exposure to blue light waves
from your screens causes dry itchy eyes
eye fatigue blurred or double vision
headaches difficulty focusing and
increased sensitivity to light as a
result we have a harder time falling
asleep and once we do we still wake up
tired and from the moment we step
outside
we have harmful UV rays from the Sun
damaging our eyes so our teams set out
to make a pair of glasses with both
screen and sun protection to give your
eyes the round-the-clock protection they
need during our research we came upon
this new technology called bone
conduction which transmits sound through
your skull with no need to cover your
ears and that got us thinking what if we
added this to our glasses this would
revolutionize the hands-free experience
while keeping your eyes protected and
your eardrum safe from harmful loud
noises that's how we created waves
glasses the world's best glasses to wear
anywhere anytime while listening to your
favorite tunes easily transition from
indoor screen protection glasses to
darkened UV protection sunglasses while
listening to your favorite music and
making calls hands-free with our easy
touch side sensors all while still
hearing your surroundings and to top it
off we can personalize your pair of
waves glasses with prescription lenses
giving you full 20/20 vision with all
the protection benefits we've been
working tirelessly over the last nine
months in order to create this truly
remarkable product we've given it a
sleek design that is both fashionable
and comfortable enough for all-day wear
regardless of whether it's indoors or
out we need your help in order to bring
this project to life
help us make your life easier healthier
and more convenient please back us today

here at glossy technological innovations
we are currently developing a wearable
smartphone in the form of a glove our
main aim is to push the boundaries of
wearable telecommunications and move
into a new area of a fully wearable
world people who are into sports or any
other physical activities often struggle
to carry and use their smartphone in its
fullest usable capacity glove these
aimed at people who engage in sports and
other demanding activities whatever the
situation glove D is right for you
both founders are sparring athletes and
faced a major problem while exercising
the difficulty to use and carry their
smartphones smartwatches and fitness
trackers did not work efficiently for
them the reason these devices must be
paired with an existing smartphones
while operating them multiple issues can
arise no feasible way to initiate a call
or send a text message take videos or
photos or even be able to use popular
applications on a small SmartWatch
display and that's how glove D was born
a wearable smartphone in the point of a
glove can do so much more than just a
regular one we strongly believe that
glove D will exponentially increase the
quality of our lives not only in sports
but also in other activities of our
daily routine glove Z is not just a
product it's a platform aiming to close
the gap in emerging technologies in
Internet of Things
