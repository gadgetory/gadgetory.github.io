world dude sorry oh we wouldn't change
you for the world would we what are we
honey
yep we all know how hard it is to
entertain the entire family together so
I bought this The Roxy it's easy to set
up you just plug and play roxy is a
music entertainment experience for the
whole family
it's got unlimited music streaming
karaoke style singing music trivia games
worldwide radio and a therapeutic sound
machine
pretty cool huh really talking to it has
millions of tracks to choose from which
is over a hundred years of great music a
hundred years they look moved out by
then right
the roxy also has music quizzes so your
kids will finally be impressed with your
encyclopedic knowledge of all music
that's baby from Justin Bieber's
follow-up to his seminal classic my
world my world - Wow dad it's like you
know everything I want to be as cool as
you when I grow up
the roxy also has a bundle of
therapeutic sounds for those moments
when you just need to chillax
notice that it even has karaoke was
speaking fun if kids could recognize
talent when they see it what do you
think so that's the Roxy with the smart
voice search and a bundle of music
entertainment experiences I think it's
gonna make this parenting thing pretty
easy
we built the UNAM Ouse with the whole
idea that you should be comfortable in
control and efficient performance
ergonomics this is about a new way of
thinking simple quick
posture variation that is the key it's
just on the fly this design allows every
user to find a custom fit for them
ergonomics is about dynamics by creating
dynamic positions you're allowing the
muscles in your hand and your wrist to
really relax some support is adjustable
in all dimensions there's an unlimited
number of options and that's what makes
it such a unique design the best
available technology and the finest
principles of modern Perkins
we're designed to move so let's move
