jewelry to inspire the next generation
of coders hi I'm Sarah and I'm Brooke
and we created jewel BOTS to get girls
excited about coding there's been a lot
of talk about women in tech and getting
girls more involved in stem while
classes are a great start we're working
to architect the next step we want to
ignite girls curiosity and get them
problem solving and building solutions
of their own so we're designing jewel
BOTS friendship bracelets for the iPhone
era jewel BOTS allow friends to
communicate in exciting new ways the
bracelets vibrating light up some girls
can send each other messages using Morse
code or be alerted when their friends
are nearby and the setup is super simple
there's no coding required the girls can
use the jewel bats app to program their
bracelets so it works right out of the
box and once they get the hang of it
that's when things start getting really
fun jewel bots are open source so girls
can use the Arduino IDE to make them do
just about anything they can get an
alert when they have a new Instagram
follower or when their dad is about to
come pick them up they can even control
a drone our hope is to get girls so
excited about programming their jewel
but that they inspire one another to
create amazing functionality while
learning to code millions of kids have
already taught themselves how to code in
order to build mods for Minecraft or to
customize their myspace page back in the
day and we want to harness that energy
and build something for girls because
we're girly and being early doesn't mean
you can't also like science and
technology so let's get building
much better life can be smelly that's
why you need venti fresh the best weapon
to take out stinky odors it works let
add in ventilation to your trashcan
another closed spaces freshen up the air
so you can actually relax when it turns
into this guy who keeps a spell in this
area a lot more tolerable and it make
sure that you can smell the sweet scent
of this little devil right here rather
than this you can install fancy fresh to
your trash can easily within seconds
just leave it alone no maintenance it's
a high-tech ventilation system combined
in UV lighting and platinum dioxide
technology breakdown odor molecules and
yield fresh air a light sensor starts to
the organization when the trash can is
closed banty fresh adapts to all kinds
of trash cans and you can use any
regular garbage bags there's no
consumables that keep you spending more
and with an additional portable power
bank you can use vent fresh all around
the house such as treating the fridge
when needed under the kitchen sink and
of course your smelly shoe cabinets so
go get a banty fresh so easy to install
and one hundred percent hassle-free at
acid I call clean job
Lily used to climb the highest mountains
in search of the freshest air with wind
she doesn't have to anymore wind is the
world's first personal air quality
system that generates fresh and clean
air that's portable and is simple to use
its built-in sensor monitors the air
quality around lily and adjusts its
power to filter more or less wind helps
Lily keep the air around her clean and
fresh even when she's traveling wind
works by creating a bubble of healthy
air around it dirty air is drawn in by
vents pulled through a medical grade air
filter and clean air is propelled out of
the top wind can filter things like
allergens dust pet dander smoke pretty
much anything except that Lily can
adjust the amount of clean air wind
releases by simply twisting the wind app
allows Lily to check the quality of the
air around her gain insight about the
air she's filtered and check the air
quality of her friends and family win
knows when Lily's filter is used up and
can automatically ship a replacement
filter to her home and the air quality
tracker can even detach to keep Lily
aware of the air she's breathing while
she's on the go wind blends seamlessly
into Lily's life allowing her to breathe
easy no matter where life takes her
what we breathe matters we all have
experiences or know of loved ones who
have been affected by poor air quality
whether that's from allergens germs
smoke or industrial pollution i founded
wind because i've watched for too many
years as my relatives in beijing
suffered from poor air quality the air
problem goes way beyond China and we
want to enable everyone no matter where
they live or where life takes them to
enjoy a healthy air environment wind is
designed not just to clean the air but
also understand the environment so that
can proactively take care of any
problems and to do both wherever the
user goes the past 18 months we've been
working hard with an amazing team of
engineers scientists and designers to
bring wind to life today we're proud to
come to you to get your support so we
can launch the product spread the word
and grow the community thank you
how do you know if the pillow you're
sleeping on is garbage warning what
you're about to see is actual actual
garbage I'm as shocked as you are ah so
that's how you know if the pillow you're
sleeping on is full of garbage
unfortunately expensive or cheap most
pillows on the market are simply
terrible and this is exactly why the
real-life comfort scientists that
brought you the revolutionary purple bed
with their inventive genius to work on
designing a completely new kind of
pillow presenting the purple pillow the
only pillow designed to perfectly
respond to your individual sleep tight
huh interesting still comfy thank you
sir you're free to go
huh but before we get too far into the
purple pillow let's take a quick look at
what's inside other pillows on the
market you see four years pillow
technology has refused to grow up like
your brother who's still waiting for his
hogwarts acceptance letter I caught the
snitch yes they basically take some
loose softish stuff and put it inside of
a bag this is a problem though if the
inside of a pillow is just loose fluff
no matter how you shape and shift your
pillow to fit your neck as you sleep it
all falls flat this is the reason that
no matter what your bedtime pillow looks
like your morning pillow looks like this
the half pipe a u-shaped Gulch caused by
a complete evacuation of the pillow
fluffed to either side the wedge the
flattening of fluff resulting in no neck
support and basic sadness the untamable
bulge caused by an overstuffed or over
firm pillow results in the 90 degree
next sleep position and a future job as
an evil henchman the curvy girl these
curves are always either too much to
handle or there just isn't enough for
true neck support oh and its memory foam
so no thanks others though have tried to
fix the problem of loose fluff with this
memory foam but memory foam has its own
problems it starts softish then as it
warms the cells compact it loses its
shape and becomes a hot sweaty brick
unlike any pillow before it purple
pillow uses a patented comfort grid
system that gives locally but not
globally and even the design the grid
itself is specially engineered to sink a
bit more in the center where your head
rests while remaining comfortably
supportive under your neck where you
need it I mean just look at that
beautiful neck alignment and it doesn't
matter if you sleep backside or
undecided the purple pillow will give
you the exact support you need every
time and that there is the magic of
science everybody but what if you find
you need more or less support well for
those who crave adjustability the purple
pillow is equipped with an adjustable
air booster
that you can raise or lower to your
exact comfort needs it's a completely
new sleeping experience it doesn't feel
like the pillows of old it's got kind of
like a blobby feel like sleeping on the
belly of a friendly fat man Chesney is a
good thing also we said it before weight
is quality and the purple pillow is
quality and its adjustability makes it
the perfect pillow for everyone yep
that's 80 comforts per minute mama got
comfortable so you can go ahead and take
all your old pillows and burn them
actually don't because many of them are
full of toxic chemicals that we just
don't want to breathe and hate to all
you chronic pillow flippers always
craving the cool side of the pillow well
you are always sleeping on the cool side
of the pillow it reads much cooler and
post ly temperature than the competition
if you or someone you know sleeps we'd
love your support pledge um down here so
the one thing that we keep getting asked
over and over is we love our purple bed
but when are you going to come out with
a pillow that's made with this same
technology so we work really hard we've
come out with a pillow that's the best
pilote the world has ever seen we had to
introduce it on kickstarter because you
got us started a year ago so enjoy the
pillow purple no pressure

as a professional bartender my job is to
serve my customers the tastiest drinks
the biggest problem I have is that
regular ice melts too quickly no one
likes a watery drink
I decided to invent a better way to make
ice slow melting crystal clear ice
there are plenty of blogs on how to make
clear ice but none of the techniques are
entirely effective
you
after months of research and testing I
settled on the perfect design
the secret is to mimic the way I scree
lakes and rivers polar ice Craig it's
the beauty of nature into your drink
polar ice tray the perfect ice for the
perfect drink</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
