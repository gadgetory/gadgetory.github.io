you
say goodbye to boring hot dogs forever
with slot dog slot dog has a grid of
stainless steel blades which slice into
your hot dog and it's dishwasher safe
simply push slot dog down on a cold
skinless hot dog pull it away from the
blades and repeat on the other side
check out how slot dog creates these
perfect crisscross slices which expand
while cooking smoke and grill flavor
penetrate deeper juices caramelize on
the crispy edges and the slots grab hold
of your toppings with a kungfu grip ooh
delicious
the veggie chop is one of the most
versatile tools in the chef in line it's
one of my personal favorites it's great
for chopping nuts as we're gonna do
right now two herbs to doing salsa
batches guacamole I mean you name it it
does the trick
so you just take some nuts here inside
take the lid place it on top make sure
it's locked into place and then you just
turn this pull a few times the amount of
polls that I do is how finely or
coarsely chopped nuts will be we'll just
a few more unlock and within just a few
pulls look what we've done so you can
actually put it in here for storage if
you'd like or serving and let's show one
other thing we can do a very popular
item that the veggie chop is great for
it is onions so let's just throw a
couple in here and see how fast the
veggie chop can whip these into shape so
once again lock it into place just a few
coals on the cord and how many Poles is
that I wasn't counting but look at this
check it out you could just throw some
cilantro in there tomatoes you know a
little few spices whatever you want to
do you could make salsa right there all
in one batch and if you don't want to
use it right now or you have a little
excess it comes with a handy lid you
just pop on top and just push down and
you're ready to put this in the fridge
for later
hi I'm Ryan and I'm Valerie thanks for
checking out Lubitz we all of our shoes
but don't the laces present some
challenges there's the time the
squeezing the floppy bows becoming
undone
but double nodding
and the untying to get them off well
with your support leaving Zubat skin
health
zoo it's our small yet powerful magnetic
fits that you attach to your own
shoelaces making your shoes very easy to
run so how do you really want to put
your shoes on wouldn't it be great if
there were no laces at all I mean
nothing to get in the way
well this is what zubats are like when
separated and zoomits eliminate three
rows of laces so there is a huge mouth
opening to easily slide in
then just connect the magnets
and that's it
now go for a run
go to the playground
go to the gym
play some basketball
Zubaz hold securely for most
recreational activities
the two bits are not just for athletic
sneakers they're for your everyday
casual shoes with su bits you have a
clean looking shoe no ugly bows and
they'll never come undone
and how do you really want to take your
shoes off let's face it most of us do
what we are not supposed to do we step
on our heel and squeeze out of our shoes
this wears down the heel and leaves you
with a knot to untie later but with
zoomix stepping out of your shoes
becomes the right way to do it the
magnets will split as you step out and
now your shoe is open and ready for the
next time you want to slip in xue bits
are not ordinary magnets they've been
specially engineered to concentrate the
magnetic forces toward the face of the
magnet this gives them incredible
holding forces in a small size this also
means there's almost no magnetism on the
outside of the zu bits where you don't
want it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
