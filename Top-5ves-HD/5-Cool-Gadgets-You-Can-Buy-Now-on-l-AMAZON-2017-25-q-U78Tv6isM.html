hi I'm David laptops are getting smaller
and smaller with fewer fewer USB ports
two ports you've got two ports to plug
in your cell phone your tablet your
printer your mouse your keyboard
external hard drive there's so much to
plug in is just not enough to plug into
hot-swap and device doesn't work either
you can't use two devices at the same
time you want to transfer files between
your flash drives we've gotta unplug
your mouse and your keyboard that
doesn't make much sense and is going
through a crazy mess of tangled cords
just to get one that you need that's why
we're introducing infinite USB if an USB
is an open chain of USB ports granted
literally an unlimited supply of
available ports it's just that simple
it's just that easy
and what's the design later when I came
up with idea it was just a concept at
first but after hurting the Hyades on
Hawaii Germany the design caught fire
Pender's of solace of social media
websites and PEC logs like he gathered
baffled all my favorites but talking
about my design it totally blew me away
so why not I decided to make me captain
and partner with the most egregious USB
cable manufacturer in China I'm going to
make the need for a USB to be perfect
small Allegan tested which made lovely
small cosmetic prototypes
I'm determined for while that's the
possible product for those who love the
idea I've exhausted almost every method
I could think of to be the famous
circuit board and now I'm competent to
stay the product you just saw perfect
it's obviously cheerfully beautiful and
dependable a stable is even smaller than
imagine during conceptual design you can
put it wherever you want is yours
infinite USB is available in micro
lightning and female USB ports you can
charge your Apple or Android or any
smartphone or tablet all day by taking
up serial ports my favorite part those
are no more wild wires are crazy cable
nests and check this out it's so cool
it's so simple but mixed world
difference is the magnet design
we need your help to bring infinite USB
to life we've built the projects we've
built the partnerships now we just need
to build the capital we want to reduce
product costs for new customers and we
need your help to do it this is infinite
USB small design big change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
