pint-sized stainless-steel gauge blocks
that make dead-on accurate machine
setups a snap built with perfect 45 and
90 degree angles the G B 2 2 5 also
features laser engrave scales on both
edges to perfectly set depth of cut on a
saw blade router bit or drill with 30 60
and 90 degree angles the gauge block 3 6
9 measures one and five eighths by two
and three-quarter inches with the long
leg a half inch longer than the G B 2 2
5 so better references provided when
setting a bandsaw or scroll saw tables
both gauge blocks are precision machined
from a solid chunk of stainless steel
and they're three-eighths of an inch
thick allowing them to stand on their
own plus the edges of the tool are
gently eased and the surface features a
proprietary satin finish that makes the
scale easy to read and won't glare when
you're checking blade angles the

guides mounted to the flip stops just
set the rear flip stop to the desired
dimension it couldn't be simpler
each leg of the PGS consists of four
pieces of t-track that extend to allow a
52 inch cut or beyond center of a 4x8
