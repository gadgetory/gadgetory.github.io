up and that begins with race tech garage
flooring nearly twenty years ago I
created race tech a durable
cost-effective truly do-it-yourself
garage flooring system transform that
ugly garage floor in just hours not days
race decks multi patent design allows
for easy installation without all the
hassles and mess of toxic epoxy coatings
durable and easy to clean standing up to
the harshest of garage environments our
patented power lock system not only
makes installation is snap but it keeps
your floor locked in race deck is
engineered tough handling vehicle
rolling loads in excess of 80,000 pounds
proudly made in USA in our ISO quality
certified facility guaranteeing you the
best garage flooring system you can buy
you want the coolest garage on the block
air bubble is the first proven
technology that effectively removes more
than 95% of both nitrogen dioxide and
particles from inside a car it's now
well known that air pollution affects
our health especially those living in
cities however what most people aren't
aware of is just how bad the air in your
car can be nitrogen dioxide levels
primarily from diesel emissions inside
your car cabin can be 10 times over the
w-h-o limit sitting in a vehicle with
your windows up in traffic is not the
safe haven you might think that it is
that's why we've created the air bubble
the first proven technology of its kind
that removes all elements of air
pollution including nitrogen dioxide
from inside a car cabin the air bubble
is optimized to protect drivers and
their families in polluted cities
and professional drivers who spend hours
on the road designed to fit on the back
of the car headrest the air bubble works
by drawing polluted air circulating
inside the car into the unit before our
proprietary filtration technology
removes gaseous particles bacteria dust
and odors clean air is then released
back to the driver and passengers in the
most efficient way possible using
advanced air flow dynamics what we
breathe matters an a lab son mission to
reduce people's exposure to air
pollution light rays parents are always
conscious to avoid the high levels of
air pollution found on busy roads what I
hadn't realized is the levels of harmful
nitrogen dioxide can be even higher
inside our cars our research is a real
wake-up call as I realize the impact
this could have on the house my son and
other children and our labs knowing we
had the only proven technology to
effectively remove nitrogen dioxide I
knew it was our duty to divert the air
bubble giving people the power to
protect themselves and their families
