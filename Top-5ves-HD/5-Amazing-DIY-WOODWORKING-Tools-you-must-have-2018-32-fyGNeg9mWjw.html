options to complement your grid driven
workbench and the bench dogs come in
four heights designed to provide solid
support while staying well below the
surface of normal dimensions when you
need a wider clamping area just drop an
extended stop over a pair of dogs now
you have a 7-inch bearing surface plus
if you have a complicated assembly that
needs offset support to keep from
falling over the 1/8 inch bench dogs are
threaded to receive adjustable risers
woodpeckers deluxe bench dog kit comes
in two versions one with 20 millimeters
stems for Festool MFT and similar
systems and the other with 3/4 inch
stems the Box bench dogs face frames
give you the convenience of three tools
in one they work to draw the face frames
together side to side help to align the
frames across the front face and provide
a steel guide bushing so you can
pre-drill and screw your face frames
together while they're still being held
by the clamps the clamp body and side
jaw are cast steel for durability and
strength
they feature legs on the back side to
allow the pressure plate to align the
face frames front to back and the guide
bushing snaps conveniently out of the
way for driving the screw once the face
frames have been pre-drilled these
clamps are simple and effective engage
the legs of the side jaws against the
back of the face frames and tighten the
side jaws drawing the two cabinets
together before final tightening the
center pressure plate is used to align
the cabinet's face to face and this is
the time to align the cabinet's top to
bottom as well once the cabinets are
fully aligned tighten the side jaws
the guide bushing is automatically in
position for drilling the pilot holes
then it snaps out of the way
leaving plenty of room to drive the
screw
