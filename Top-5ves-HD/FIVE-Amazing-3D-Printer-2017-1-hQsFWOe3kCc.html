audio jungle
you
you
most 3d printers are expensive large
noisy complicated use and they have to
be tethered to your computer the eye box
nano is affordable it is extremely quiet
and it's very easy to use you can print
to the eye box nano from any computing
device that has a browser
most resin printers have loud pointy
they also require bulb changes every two
to eight thousand hours our printers are
Wi-Fi enabled and they also allow
browser-based printing from any browser
on any platform androids iPhones you
name it you can print without installing
any software do you want to there's also
a ten-hour battery pack that's optional
if you'd like to print on the go finally
the main housing is actually constructed
from acrylic which is a lot stronger
than glass about 17 times though weighs
about half as much it's extremely
durable the Nana uses UV LEDs designed
to last 17 years eight hours per day
that's a lot of green
so it actually really is surprising how
many different things you can make with
a 3d printer know I'm really excited
about 3d printer not just because it's a
affordable especially for a college
student like me but portable take it
wherever little figurines for
your kids I love to play chess so being
able to customize my own pieces create
my own set and if I lose a piece just
print out another way you can make one
little robot or you can actually make a
big robot with pieces that you actually
put them together and you have one big
robot and you really just don't know
what you can make until you get a 3d
printer bring it a coffee shop take it
to the library which is perfect because
it's really silent you never quite know
what you can do with 3d printer so you
actually get one yourself we didn't set
out to improve 3d printing we set out to
remove the barriers and get 3d printers
Hine Tico as inventors we constantly use
3d printers and create and test our
ideas but every 3d printer we used fell
short of our expectations they were
heavy over complicated and unreliable
we often spent more time calibrating our
printers than printing our inventions so
we came up with a simple solution
unibody this is Tico the unibody 3d
printer
most 3d printer frames are built using
separate rails unibody means the rails
are built into the chassis creating one
solid piece one solid piece you knit
body and with this simple shift in
design all the problems that came from
separate rail systems disappeared more
reliable and accurate Tico sets a new
standard for 3d printers and it doesn't
stop at unibody Chico has an internal
filament tray and closed bill chamber
auto safety shutoff a large print volume
a flexible base wireless connectivity
and cloud-based software so you can
print from almost anywhere on any
internet friendly device with Chico
we've not only set a new standard for
design but for price too
Chico is only one hundred and seventy
nine dollars yup one seven nine that's
the beauty of unibody design it's better
and it cost less to manufacture we could
set the price higher but we want
everyone to have at ego this is where we
need your help we use 3d printing to
create chico imagine all the ideas that
could become realities imagine what you
could build back us today and let's find
out
hi I'm Chris Gibson president and lead
architect at ORD solutions we've had two
successful Kickstarter campaigns our
backers support made those projects a
reality we've listened to their
suggestions we've made the printer
bigger faster stronger easier to use and
we've added a new dimension to 3d
printing full color blending introducing
the rova 4d the rova 4d is an
improvement in every way it has a 12 by
12 by 12 inch build volume aerospace
grade aluminum frame thk profile
bearings Zed ball screw dedicated
dissolvable support and flexible
filament extruders automatic bed
leveling a print layer cooling fan
liquid cooled hot ends and a wireless
interface
as a 3d printer it is the best value in
the industry but it's more than that
it's a full-color 3d printer it works by
using cyan magenta yellow black and
white filaments and feeding them into
one hot end where they are blended or
mixed together at various ratios to get
unique new colors CMYK like your office
inkjet printer you wouldn't think about
going back to black and white TV
full-color 3d printing is a better
experience instead of buying filament
and a specific color and then loading it
into the printer you simply select the
colors you want visually from an
infinite palette and the printer
automatically adjusts the color even
though our professional-grade printers
will please even the most critical
engineer we've made it so easy to print
in full color that even a child can do
it it's as easy as pick paint print
first pick your model from the millions
of free models that are already
available online then paint the model
angle paint a deco then print the model
we're still prototyping the rova 40 and
making leaps and bounds every day please
help us fund the successful completion
of our project by picking your pledge
level from the right side of the page
and sharing our project on Facebook and
Twitter
about six months ago we decided to make
the m3 D Pro based on getting feedback
from our existing users so we've already
gone through three iterations of design
prototypes and we're almost completely
done the engineering three months ago we
proved a lot of the important concepts
like making a heated bed that uses less
power proving that it can move a lot
faster proving the benefits of higher
quality and higher precision metal parts
and right now we're going through the
final phases of proving the feedback
system and finishing the next steps in
programming our goal with the m3 D Pro
is to make the most reliable 3d printer
in history and the way we're gonna do it
is by combining a full suite of sensors
what we call a sensor network with
precision metal parts the combination
allows the printer to become more
self-aware and it can correct for errors
that are common in all 3d printers the
cheap ones and expensive ones things
such as filament snags printhead crashes
even power outages first time I ever
heard about 3d printing was one of my
friends printed a ninja warrior training
hold and I thought it was really cool
the unique thing that you're getting
with them 3d pro that we have not yet
seen in this industry is that ability
for the printer to sense many different
things within itself it has the ability
to sense position and has the ability to
sense speed has the ability to sense
temperature in five different places and
if there's a problem it can be self
diagnosed and in almost all cases can be
self corrected ultimately that gives you
more time in the creative process with
3d printing I have right on my desk
where my granddaughters have right on
their desk they get an idea they can try
to make that idea
on a 3d printer right there they can
turn their ideas into reality this I
didn't have when I was a kid
really the greatest advancement the 3d
printing could accomplish at any point
in the future is ease-of-use making it
so that anybody can just go from an idea
to creating that idea within an
afternoon we've introduced this new
thing we call tutorial mode so what we
got from our feedback from original
backers was that they wanted more
detailed guides so they can grow into
becoming a expert user rather than
having a start as an expert user the
thing I think that needs to happen for
educators is speed is an issue how fast
we can turn around
so with M 3d Pro you have the ability to
print a single prototype with extreme
accuracy and high quality but you also
have the ability to take that prototype
and print it in quantity cover the
entire print bed with multiples of your
model and produce it at volume I am so
excited for the future not only for me
for my daughter to grow up being able to
use her mind to create anything she
wants to thanks to the 3d printer I've
been fascinated with just the whole idea
of 3d printing for quite a while now
focusing on just simple things that I
could print for around the house or you
know toys that I could print to play
with my kids really just the idea that I
could create something myself so the M
3d pro is already successfully funded
and is the largest crowdfunding 3d
printer this year due to popular demand
were opening up pre-orders using the
IndieGoGo in demand
and what m3/d is doing I think many
people are going to see is extremely
innovative and they're going to want to
be first to support it and to help
nurture where the technology is going to
go
they just also happen to get a printer
as one of their rewards very early and
at a deep discount
you
I've been using 3d printers for the past
six years and these are really amazing
tools for creating 3d objects right on
your desk but as an engineer
I really wanted to have those
capabilities for electronics as well we
wanted to optimize rapid prototyping in
a big way
by making a stable and reliable machine
that is future proof the next one would
change the landscape of 3d printing
because it's a first electronics and
multi-material 3d printer that's
affordable and fits every desktop
the next one is the first of its kind
being able to print any credit circuitry
moiety material and multicolor all in
one beautiful and similar design we have
to sign the next one from the grown-up
it created a totally new type of printer
that can be precisely calibrated to
print materials of many different
characteristics we can already print
conductive materials with super low
resistance and combine them with many
different ones that can be flexible
rigid transparent and much more we also
allow for the use of support material
that can be rinsed off easily with
regular water which will make printing
much more economical we achieved this by
using high precision nozzles that form
tiny droplets of material these droplets
are deposited on the printing bed and
then cured by UV laser in the design
phase we envisioned a printer that will
take off the volkl from the user in
making easier and more sweet experience
with the printer and mind that we take
any 3d model and slice it on water so it
will be printable in an instant we are
chairman company close debugging of
people at the Fab Lab in Berlin where we
streamlined our development by listening
to the consumer feedback and improving
the printer of each generation and we
hope to bring this amazing technology to
even more people than any other printer
before as the combination of many
functional materials extreme precision
and the printing of antiquated
electronics is now finally possible so
now that we have developed this amazing
machine
we need to kickstart the mass
manufacturing process of the initial
units for which we need the significant
amount of funding so we are asking you
to beg us and to help us achieve our
goal this will be the stepping stone to
getting the next one to as many people
as possible and bringing 3d printing to
the next level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
