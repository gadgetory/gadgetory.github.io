pelvis ticks always had potential to be
a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six or even ten feet high on but also
take anywhere you want to go the v4 is
the portable trampoline we'd always
dreamed up with the v4 you have the
ability to add or remove air and
completely change the stiffness of the
bounce someone who weighs 300 pounds can
jump on the same exact v4 as someone who
only weighs 80 pounds all you need to do
is change the air pressure in less than
a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family a fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the v4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
down stairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again obstacles and
features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards are perfect for the v4 so
those of you looking for a fun way to
stay in shape the v4 will work most of
the muscle groups in your body and get
your heart pounding immediately it's a
killer cardio workout and the best part
is that while you're having fun bouncing
around you won't even realize how
quickly you build a sweat in order to
achieve superior build quality and
maintain the high tolerances necessary
for the v4 to work we manufacture and
assemble it right here in our Southern
California shop we work closely with our
suppliers to become a part of the build
process and as each component is made or
right there to test them
this streamlines our manufacturing and
ensures that every v4 we make is up to
our standards if you're looking for the
portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it join us and help change the
way pogo sticks are seen forever
what if creating objects of easy is
imagine them complicated set of
procedures and software can offer to
hinder creativity making it difficult to
achieve the results you desire so we
simplified this process by creating Zeus

more and more industries from

food industry the adoption for 3d
printers started and we saw is that it's
a good opportunity to build the user
friendliest 3d printer on the market we
believe with the Zeus we created a
platform that's very very accessible for
the majority of people out there in the
market whether it's going to be
prosumers or consumers to start with 3d
printing or to use our shoes as an

you
hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hideaway the bottle you'll always
reach for because it's always within
reach so as a freelance product designer
I'm traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports and
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I could solve myself you know
once I had a solution for business
travel I realized this had great
application my personal life especially
in the outdoors going backpacking or
just on hikes I could bring water with
me and when the bottle was empty it it
collapses and goes away and takes no
extra space in my pack yeah it fits an
active lifestyle weather in the winter
when you're skiing and you can fill up
the hideaway in the lodge or in the
summer when you're backpacking or hiking
it collapses in your backpack and takes
no extra space no one loves buying
disposable water bottles it's it's
merely out of convenience and the
Hideaway makes a reusable bottle more
convenient in fact in some places
disposable water bottles are being
banned so we're all going to move
towards the reusable water bottle model
and that's why I feel like this is kind
of the next generation and hydration
this gives you an option to have a water
bottle all the time without having to
throw anything away the hideaway bottle
comes in two sizes 21 ounce and 12 ounce
which is great for kids and both their
water type I'm really excited to share
the Hideaway bottle with with the world
and Kickstarter is an amazing
opportunity to do that to be able to
show you the backers what this is all
about so please check out the rewards we
need to raise a significant amount of
money to get this into production
to get it on the shelves this year
and just as important please share it
with everyone you know tell them about
this great water bottle The Hideaway you
already carry your phone with you
everywhere but your case doesn't do much
more than offer protection an 8 and 1
multi-tool the in one case gives you a
bevy of instruments and features at your
disposal and within arm's reach the
durable case is made of a tough
polycarbonate so it'll protect against
dings and dents while also featuring a
blue and red pen a Phillips and flathead
screwdriver
nail file tweezers scissors and even a
toothpick so if you have to cut a loose
thread or fix your glasses on the fly
the in one case provides the tools you
need when you least expect to need them
the founder of in one case realized that
well your phone can do almost anything
in the digital realm
sometimes you're still stuck
empty-handed in the real world the idea
behind England the multi-tool utility
case was born out of necessity you have
a lot of tools incorporated in one handy
location instead of carrying around a
pocketknife with a lot of different
tools everyone carries a phone so it
will always be with you whenever you
needed it the in one case is easy to
install and removes from your phone with
two-piece construction it features a
felt lining so you won't scratch your
phone and it's TSA compliant so you can
travel freely without taking it off
while your phone can do almost anything
the in one case is like an insurance
policy it's there just in case you need
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
