I've dreamed of having a holographic
display most of my life not a RvR but
you know the hologram
my name is Sean brain I'm a longtime
holography
and one of the co-inventors of the
looking-glass the looking-glass is a new
type of light-filled display that
generates 45 simultaneous views of a 3d
world all at 60 frames per second
no VR headset required just go up to one
of these displays and you look at it and
you interact with it
there's no clunky headgear there's no
extended setup it's amazing
we're releasing a unity SDK and
universal model and animation importer
with a lot more plugins into other 3d
creation tools over the coming months
no matter what tool you use your work
will be able to come to light in the
looking glass so your loss of this
technology you are like interaction with
this display it's a real intimate
process of creation this is an
interesting feeling that like connection
between you and something that leaned
inside the glass I saw these things in
sci-fi comics and movies growing up it
seemed impossible like sending Holograms
of yourself to another country Looking
Glass is unique in that it fulfills kind
of what we've imagined in a lot of ways
around what a true volumetric display
would look like the Looking Glass
connects up to any modern PC or Mac with
couple cables and then you can either
create your own 3d content or explore
what everyone around the world is making
the single click my initial experience
with Looking Glass was really that it's
magic the way in which you experience it
is much more natural and instinctive in
terms of seeing how you can understand
the layers of the space
like making your habits in actual
reality but in a magical box the dream
of the hologram is finally here and all
of us in lookingglass Factory are
designing new and impossible things and
looking glasses every day so whether
you're a rocket designer 3d animator or
volumetric videographer get a Looking
Glass and bring your 3d creations to
life this is the lit more capsule a
one-of-a-kind ultra intelligent camera
floodlight it is unlike any security
system you have ever used before keeping
your home truly safe from unwanted
visitors retrofitted with your original
flood light fixture you can install the
lit more capsule anywhere around your
property are you tired of false alerts
yet the lit more capsule solves this
problem by integrating artificial
intelligence and radio frequency based
technology into this unique design
creating the most efficient and
sophisticated security system on the
market
by applying a four-level filtering
algorithm the 180 degree wide angle
camera picks out living things from
objects distinguishes humans from
animals isolates family members from
strangers and detects suspicious
behaviors from normal behaviors with
2,400 lumens the lit more capsule lights
up the surroundings with 360 degree
luminance
making full-color night vision a reality

intelligent and easy-to-use floodlight
