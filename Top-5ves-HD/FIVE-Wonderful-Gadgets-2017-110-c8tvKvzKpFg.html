travellers are you just working too darn

sweet maps are a great way to instantly
upgrade your sleep but most are

eyepieces simply lift adjust secure and
you have a personalized fit that's
comfortable with 100% blackout the
Hubble eye contours prevent pressure on
your eyes which encourage REM peace the
type of sleep that makes you feel well
rested we also did sweat the details
adding anti slip gel for better grip
integrating elastic stretch bands for
comfort and using micro velcro that
won't stick to your hair so whether
you're embarking on the most epic and
memorable adventure of the season and
need to catch a bit of sleep whenever
and wherever you can or just need to
recharge yourself with a 30 minute power
nap in the middle of a busy day or maybe
you just want to sleep in on a lazy
Sunday morning and have breakfast in bed

flights and halfway across the world in

earth you've got ek and ek fulfill
Turner's say you land in San Francisco
and there is your luggage in sweet

be damned did we mention each case is
impossible to lose the smart distance
sensors an alert to your phone the
moment it slips out of your vicinity
smarter lock smarter scale smarter
tracking each case is smart luggage
evolved
it is incredible how much we rely on
weather forecasts and so-called local
temperatures the truth is that those
values available online or through apps
come from weather stations that can
easily be dozens of miles away
nothing beats measuring the values by
yourself right where you are but that's
just not possible and silly so we have
created the world's smallest of weather
station that can easily fit in your palm
simply plug weather point into your
device and start the app simple as that
it consists of four sensors -
temperature humidity atmospheric
pressure and ultraviolet radiation with
this information you can have the most
accurate weather forecast anywhere you
are also by measuring atmospheric
pressure you can know your altitude more
precisely than GPS devices you can also
measure UV radiation and limit your
exposure to these harmful UV rays the
housing is made from aluminium and
titanium and ensures longer life time
when you're not using weather point it
is safely placed on your keychain so you
don't have to worry about losing it
where the point doesn't use a battery
well who likes them anyway it doesn't
even require internet connection the
building hardware is costly we invested
a lot of resources into making weather
point possible and now we need your
support to make it available and
affordable for everyone thank you
let's talk about taking the perfect
photo first compose the shot check the
histogram adjust the exposure focus on
your subject compute the hyperfocal
distance to keep everything sharp enable
bracketing to get more dynamic range and
a neutral density filter update the
exposure and then take the shot
we built a better way
today's DSLR and mirrorless camera have
amazing optics and sensor but they do
very little to actually help you take a
good photo
finding the right sentence involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence
I knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created Arsenal the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
Arsenal fine settings take the best
photo possible Arsenal's AI searches
thousands of images in its database to
suggest good settings next it fine Tunes
the suggestions by analyzing 18
different factors Arsenal uses
state-of-the-art machine learning to
help you take a great photo in any
condition
Oh
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo second with Arsenal
you can do this in second capture all
the details and scenes with high dynamic
range get everything in sharp focus
and create long exposures without buying
expensive filters using these advanced
techniques Arsenal lets you go beyond
the limitations of your camera sensor
Lindt four times when you want complete
control you can wirelessly adjust manual
settings see a live preview and trigger
the shutter all from up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone and finally
Arsenal makes it easy to capture
stunning time-lapse
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing lights giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your technique with Arsenal
Arsenal is already being tested in the
field now I need your help to ramp up
production by supporting our campaign
stay you can be one of the first to get
our we've got exclusive rewards for our
early backers and some awesome stretch
goals more I'm really excited about the
photos I've been getting with us I can't
