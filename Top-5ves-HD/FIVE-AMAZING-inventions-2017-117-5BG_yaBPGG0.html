economic keyboards for more than 25
years would always know the game is a
ton of stress on their bodies and we
knew that they could benefit from our
advanced economic keyboards so we set
out to engineer the ultimate split
gaming keyboard it took us more than 12
months of research and development that
this keyboard is going to change the way
you get
hi my name is Kane I'm a systems
engineer network architecture gamer
Kinesis contacted me and said hey it
should be interested in using a split
keyboard for gaming it's like I never
really thought about it
yes I would love to let's try it out but
now after playing with this keyboard for
several weeks now I've found that with
the split design I can rearrange my desk
to fit me and not so much rearrange me
to fit my desktop I can put the keyboard
in any position that I want it's great I
can move it wide apart really tight
together it's going to all the
specifications that you want from any
traditional gaming keyboard I love the
fact that it's got the programmability
is built into the keyboard you don't
have to install any software if you're
uncomfortable or don't want to use the
onboard shortcut keys to reprogram your
keyboard they thought of that and built
an app that will allow you to load up a
graphical interface to reprogram your
keyboard but you don't have to install
it it lives on the keyboard the split
design has changed the way I play video
games the freestyle edge is just the
beginning we are developing a full
lineup of premium Kinesis gaming
peripherals designed to enhance your
comfort and boost your performance join
team Kinesis and joined the revolution
with my family I found that it was
really hard to share photos and videos
with everyone involved someone has an
iPhone someone doesn't someone is on
Facebook someone isn't so it was really
hard to find a common place where all
our families could share photos and
videos with the halle order you're just
one tap away from seeing them on the
biggest screen of your home which is
your TV how I mean home or house in
Hawaiian so it's a connected device for
the home to help family members share
their lives together
you can see memories immediately as they
come or you can easily scroll through a
thousands of photos whether they're from
yesterday last week last month or last
year we've been working on the halyard
for over a year
decorating on both the hardware and
software the user interface is built
from the ground up specifically for the
orc it is designed to handle hundreds or
even thousands of images easily we've
been meticulously tuning not only the
way the orb looks but the way it feels
in your hand well the initial design
started as just kind of an orb split in
half but I felt that it was still
lacking some bit of personality and so
one of my favorite parts about the
design that we eventually arrived at was
having this tilt to it where instead of
being just sort of ambiguously relating
to the environment all around it it
really kind of presented itself to you
and invited interaction with it as a
designer my goal with any project would
be to change the experience of the
actual users we wanted to help family
members connect with each other and
that's why we created the halyard
backed by years of experience kudo 3d
has developed the beam to fit into any
design this high-performance 3d printer
is a truly affordable all profits 3d
printer created with the consumer in
mind uses decision simply pour in the
recipe Press print
what you desire come to me
the beam allows yourself the freedom to
view and control the printer from any
Wi-Fi device to being as a large builder
of 2.7 by 4.7 inches with a 50 micron
resolution and as a built right to 5.5
inches with a V resolution people 10
minutes
on with its stylish design the beam is
compacted at 8 feet by 16 inches slices
are protected by a 2k else is coupled
with the LED light minute our patented
PSP technology enhances the resolution
and surface smoothness
special formula for the beam tweeting sr
engines range from green correct black
yellow with treating SL bracket users
are able to print a variety of models
for different applications such as
miniature jewelry art engineering and
dental
Oh
Oh
with our previous experience and success
from our first Kickstarter we know what
it takes to meet the needs and fulfill
promises our engineering and production
team worked hard to deliver what we
promise to our backers and you'll do it
again the second time
couple satirical of revolutionising
between back to being 3d printer today
to to 3d unleash your creativity that
you're going to love or less
want to know what the secret is from
innovative technology is that created
100% real
first time you can experience they're
known so Jenna and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
