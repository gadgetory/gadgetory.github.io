foamy is way more than just a nightlight
hi my name is Mitch I'm a product
designer for a company called human
scope the last year the team and I have
been working on something called homie
homie is a smart rechargeable nightlight
we ran a campaign on kickstarter last
year and it did really well now we're
about to enter production and we've
teamed up with IndieGoGo to offer in
demand but we can sell it at a
discounted rate one last time we've
designed only to be safe and portable so
we've incorporated these folding prawns
in the back so that you can place it on
a flat surface only has a built-in
rechargeable battery but it's not a
dangerous lipo battery it's an iron
phosphate which is very stable and it
won't catch fire as a night light the
Omi's battery will last up to 10 hours
or you can crank the output and use it
as accent lighting for three hours a
great thing about owe me is it's
Bluetooth enabled so it works with our
iOS and Android apps that we've
developed with the app you can dimmer
brighten the light you can choose
between over 60 million color options
you can enable motion detection and you
can set it to turn on 25 seconds of 10
or however long you want you can also
program up to 8 smart timers 40 me the
smart timers allow you to turn the light
off or dim it down at a certain time or
you can turn the light on or have a
change color at a different time we've
also gone above and beyond with the
aesthetics of the design we've
incorporated this elegant aluminum bezel
which can be used to turn the light on
or dim it or turn it off completely I'm
really excited about what we
accomplished in the last year and I know
it took a little longer than expected
but we think we have a great product we
can't wait to start shipping it to you
you
