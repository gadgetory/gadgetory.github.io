was young it taught me a valuable lesson
about saving for what I wanted I know it
may look like just a piggy bank but it's
much more than that it's linked to your
own very first baby and there's no limit
what you can put into it you set up your
goals and what you want to save for and
then tactically it's time to do around
the house sure enough to get all right
now that are worth money toward you like
take out the trash it'll teach you about
responsibility while making savings fun
ready hey
same words and instill sense of
accountability as well you learn that
setback won't get in the way of getting
to those goals if you work hard sure
good sense of determination please
driven single friends now as I think of
approach things with options edit those
goals are the less that's the most
important one thing to never forget
attack that's why I want you to happen
hello you might be a little too young
but you'll get there
there are a lot of smart things in this
world a few smart people too and this
smart person looked at this dumb thing
and said I can make this something smart
why in the world would i want this dumb
thing to be smart because the easy part
is the online ordering the dumb part is
the tracking waiting stressing planning
to be standing by my front door during
the all day delivery window or the
carrier guarantees to show up while I'm
in the shower ring the doorbell one drop
off a misdelivery note because we would
want to leave something on this front
porch it's a real pain in my pony
express it's high time someone made the
thing that was invented 100 years ago
smart this is you Sela it's more than a
mailbox for letters it's a mailbox robot
that can see when a package gets dropped
off and send me a notification through
the app yes there's an app and yes it's
March even if you're nothing like me
you're probably a one-click purchaser on
the internet just like me so this thing
will transform itself to fit just about
any box so I can order more stuff
and always return it speaking of
returning I can put stuff in there as
well and you sellable at the carrier
know that it's ready to be picked up
it's also got other useful features like
a microphone for voice messages and
security features like a couple of
cameras and one time used access codes
all of which I managed through the app
plus package tracking online order
management and easy access to retailer
support the apps great I just didn't
like that phone you Stella is like my
own teeny tiny little post office right
there by my front door but you Scylla is
not a toy it's not an excuse to have yet
another connected device it's a
responsible way to protect and manage
the things that are meant just for me
the things that often get left out for
people who aren't me you fella my
personal post purchase package and
postal concierge

introducing my canoe the world's first
foldable origami canoe traditional
communities are cumbersome and nearly
impossible to travel with in a small
vehicle we wanted to experience the joy
of canoeing wherever our travels take us
or simply out our back door a canoe that
holds into a compact box with the best
solution my canoe is taxing carries to
any location easily without sacrificing
quality or performance and will fit any
lifestyle ma can do kind of was able to
make us moderate climate of being
lightweight small and compact that I can
put it away in storage but also allow me
to versatility just still have weekends
away and go on these benches with our
life
my canoe is easily assembled at any
location in 10 to 15 minutes every piece
in the kit is used in the building just
really simple couple of clicks and it
was all time
it was important to us that my canoe not
sacrifice on quality and durability just
to fit into a box we tested my commute
to exceed the confessional standard
developing our hole from a proprietary
polypropylene with AUB treatment that
has been rated up to 20,000 hold
while ensuring quality it was important
to us to make sure that we kept the
experience true to traditional canoes
once again on the water was exactly like
any other knaub ever paddle my canoe has
already come a long way we just need
your contributions to add finishing
touches and scale our production to get
my canoe into your hands
explore your world with mike moon
weird email and we've made the best
shove 11 other shovels cracks bend and
break vemos beats them all literally
last year we launched our kicker tool
the cell shovel on Kickstarter people
loved it but they all agreed on one
thing they wanted something bigger
badder we made for everyone so we
listened and gathered our team to make
the bestest toughest damn this shovel
ever and we did introducing the Alpha
shovel mother nature meet daddy you
wanted big oh it's big over 20 inches
long and 12 inches deep of glorious
aircraft grade aluminum and you can
shovel away the Ice Age for your
driveway it's got straighter teeth to
cut eyes and shovel gliders to protect
your destiny so when we say is cutting
edge if we mean it salva shovel is
durable and tough rain or shine dirt or
snow we built it to whether through a
lifetime of storms and a storm to
renting whether our collapsible shaft
makes it easy to pack and the built-in
strap holder makes it easy to carry and
we added a saw for good luck easy to cut
anything that might get in the way
choose between a d handle for better
grip or a t-handle for better
compatibility best of all everything in
the Alpha shovel is interchangeable with
the rest of the demo's family allowing
you to build a collection of
multi-purpose tool for life every job
every day for everyone
alpha shovel condition to be damned the
most of the collective of lifelong
innovators and adventurers if we like to
go out and wreck face with nature and
come back to make the best product ever
we're born and raised in Jackson Hole
but our family goes far beyond town and
state commercial this is a collaborative
effort not just between the team but
with pro athletes action enthusiasts and
most importantly our community back our
campaign today and join the demo's
collective we thank you for all of your
support truly deimos defined not by us
but by you our backers let's keep
crushing it
why do you run they used to ask me well
one day I guess it just became part of
my story
the more I did it the more I appreciated
the moment I within the more I could see
me see I used to run the same path the
same time in the same way but something
happened I realized there was more to
discover more about my journey my god my
goal
weather was 12 minutes 12 hours or even
12 months I could set my own time my own
rhythm my old store because we all have
what will yours too
about two years ago we launched a
Kickstarter campaign which is a floating
light bulb now the floating experience
continues story consists of a levitating
sphere that orbits around wooden disk
telling the time what's unique about
story is that it has three different
modes you can customize manually through
the side buttons or through a mobile
device the first mode is journey mode
which allows you to set a future date
for example birthday graduation or
travel plans the levitating sphere will
make one full orbit and arrive at the
twelve o'clock position at the date of
your choice the second mode is clock
mode which works normally just like a
clock would the levitating sphere
represents the hour hand the third mode
is timer mode which allows you to set
shorter intervals like 30 minutes or an
hour they can be really good in an
office meeting for example when
everybody can see the same time another
cool features that story can be
levitated both horizontally on a table
or vertically on a wall it's something
we've worked really hard to achieve
story also has optional backlit display
features that can display time through
patterns of light for example moon faded
to me story represents a metaphor and
that's the planet going around the Sun
it's simple as that
stored a levitating time p flashlight
set time free
