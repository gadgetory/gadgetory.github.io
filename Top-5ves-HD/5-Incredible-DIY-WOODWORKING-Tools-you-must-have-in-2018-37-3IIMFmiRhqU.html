with the boatbuilders bevel gauge built

woodpecker
lay out work on the narrow edge of suck
is awkward with most woodworking rules
the rule must align with the face of
your stock but it's wider than the edge
you're trying to measure preventing you
from marking without breaking alignment
and you can still struggle to keep the
rule parallel to the edge while working
on the face of the workpiece
woodpeckers new woodworkers edge rule
eliminates these issues by wrapping
around the edge of your stock with an
accurate scale on both sides the short
side of the tool is just 3/8 of an inch
wide leaving room to mark stock as thin
as 7/16 while the long side reaches
three-quarters of an inch across the
face of your piece whether you're
working on the edge or the face the
corner of the edge rule always keeps you
properly aligned use the woodworkers
edge rule to measure from inside corners
by keeping your scale Square to your
stock and starting flush at the edge
mark the edge and face at the same
dimension by placing the desired
dimension at the end of your board find
the center of 3/4 and G nominal stock by
scribing a line from both sides

inches in length without requiring a
single drop of gasoline to do good no
fumes minimal noise plus the required to
handle operation to this stage from just
beauties 12,000 pounds a lot back in
fact not only is it useful but it's also
a heck of a good time the when
lumberjack includes a built-in log
cradle for even splits a two horsepower
motor and the wheel kit with rubber grip
handles for maximum mobility so what are
you waiting for
time to close your computers get outside
and start your engines with the wind
