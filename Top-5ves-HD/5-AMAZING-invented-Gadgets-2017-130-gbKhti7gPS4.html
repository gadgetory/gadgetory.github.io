my father's a jade carving master has
been over 30 years crafting trade at
work I was deeply influenced by my
father I spent the last six years with
the things of machine learning expert
and product masters developing a
technology product now my father could
spend hours selecting from thousands of
stones just to find the best day
material
my team and I visited over 20 factories
and optimized algorithms for more than
nine hundred times
just to achieve the most naturally
experience like why is there no member
platte on my macbook
nounce member path in the solution it
enables you to type without looking at
the keyboard multitaskers like me a
third of waiting forever for programs to
load the solution younam's we plumb with
nouns to second program launching speed
you can say goodbye to the loading icon
and there is definitely much more start
free seamless be and multiple use my
father told me
Jade Corey has no blood arrow one
careless move confuse the whole game
for many air bubbles a common name pad
pasty however even a tiny bubble is a
giant enemy to Nam so we carefully pour
into the symbol on the back of the first
Inga and post our manufacturer to
produce a special image for into the
reservoir millimeter things more than 20
times thinner than a human's here
details it breaks apart from good
with seamless integration of the best
software and hardware numbers on the
readout world the Oscar incas I work
when I shared exciting news with my
father because MIT is not about the
award thought back and making things
better
you
this is the whole button the world's
smallest phone grip the whole button is
the simplest way to stop dropping your
phone
it improves grip so much you'll
magically be able to type tap and swipe
with just one hand
selfie better shop better everything
better
you can even hook your phone on your
laptop get three whole buttons and every
pack to share or save so stop dropping
your phone and make your phone easy to
use one-handed get the hold button from
the lovely company
everyone loves traveling we all love to
explore the amazing plays around the
world and most importantly shopping we
all want to pack everything in the air
we're anything we've bought into the
luggage but we all face the same problem
in the past no matter how you organize
the size of there will still be too much
in the end we cannot put everything the
luggage but make ourselves tired oh and
the dirty clothes - kicking off during
the trip we don't even want to mix it
with new clothes or maybe there is no
space for it already
hello Kickstarter I'm Jennifer as a
traveler we are thinking about how to
make more space in a very short time and
after our research we found out clothes
back and other sort of things occupy
more than 50% of the luggage for a
five-day trip so that's what creates
vago a miracle solution of making more
space in a very short time
we only need to do is to put our clothes
in Tobago back think about it put on Bay
go plug in power and push the bottom
bigger will automatically finger close
you can enjoy your time in the hotel or
any other place while Vega is doing
straw don't worry this intelligent Vega
will automatically stop when the process
is finished the only thing you need to
do is proving their strong vacuum back
into your luggage you can also use for
the battery to recharge bagel we will
leave this convenient designed to make
Shopaholic to buy more
remember those thirty close bagel vacuum
bag to prevent smelly smell and urine so
you can keep the log is clean and use
more space efficiently in the same time
to make your overall trip even more
convenient so we use the general micro
USB cable for the recharge design create
extra space for your luggage too like
every place count
in today's world technology is
constantly evolving and new products are
emerging yet most people still listen to
music using traditional headphones or
earphones we wanted to bring you a new
way to listen to music with the most
advanced technology the next step of
listening to music is now here
introducing 0.i a hat with built in bone
conduction technology that is wireless
and ham free the battery PCB on/off
switch and LED light are located in the
Bill of the cap 0.i uses bone conduction
technology that sends vibrations into
the skull and directly into your
eardrums the bone conduction speakers
fit snuggly offering enhanced clarity of
sound 0.i uses bluetooth technology that
allows you to listen to music and answer
phone calls and it's all put together
into the simplicity of a hat it has a
built-in microphone you can answer calls
instantly without the need of an extra
headset or earphone 0.i brings you high
quality sound that is comparable to
listening to music through stereo system
with four bone conduction speakers
compared to the usual two of our
competitors this allows you to listen to
music more clearly when using GOI you'll
have free range to conveniently listen
to the clear and crisp sound without
blockage of your earphones but at the
same time external noise is audible for
safety reasons when you may be cycling
or jogging outside 0.i has a detachable
magnetic connector that can be easily
managed with one hand and the connector
protects your charging port from damage
with a built-in LED light you will know
when your zero I is fully charged what
if your 0.i gets wet well that's not a
problem
the zero eye is covered in a waterproof
oil coating that prevents damage from
rain sweat or accidental spillage here
oh I can be easily worn anywhere at any
time the possibilities are endless
0i comes in to sleek designs a snapback
and a baseball cap and comes in three
different colors black white and blue
take a good look around you you will
easily notice creations that are crafted
with precision and perfection their
design connects intimately with our
feelings and body contour thus catering
for our desire and behavior among these
creations many are technological
innovations to our regret some of these
creations are fading out
one of them is MagSafe after
considerable time and effort in research
and development we resolved to resurrect
MagSafe a genius design by Steve Jobs
but we don't stop there we adapt
magazine to the functionality of modern
gadgets
making it the only design on the market
that encapsulates three technologies
MagSafe USB C and Thunderbolt three
this means with only one connector and
one port
it can provide superfast data transfer
and high resolution video outlets
it recaptures the comfort brought by
magazines
at the same time retaining the benefits
of USBC and Thunderbolt 3 for all your
USBC devices also on the team is a
renowned manufacturer whose expertise
was recognized in many other successful
Kickstarter projects such as pebble time
and Dropcam they help us ensure quality
and feasibility so why do we call
ourselves magazine maxi stands for magic
continues it is our aspiration to bring
back the magic of Steve Jobs and to
continue his dedication and empathetic
and human focused design we hope to take
our next step with you support us and
breathing new life in magazine claim

back this project make your pledge now
and we will see you on the other side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
