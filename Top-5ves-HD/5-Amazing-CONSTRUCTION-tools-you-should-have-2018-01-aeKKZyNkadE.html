the tools were using with the DX nines
were awesome it's seamless because the
tools are so easy to handle and they're
easy to run the project team and it's an
organization it's really important that
we work with our customers to get
real-time feedback take that input and
warp it into the next generation for you
got a really good feel to it but really
sturdy comfortable you come up with a
narrower handle which is better now
instead of operators feeling the impact
in their shoulder now it's gonna be
spread to their elbows so it's more of a
natural abilities in the tool you
compare that tool the puddle welding and
bent over
that's no comparison welding is so hard
on your on your hamstrings and I go hold
my back would be so stiff and then I've
seen this and I was like man I gotta
learn how to do that it's a lot easier
to train a guy on healthy versus balding
you take your shot you take a log use
your card if need be
one beam normally one guy going 10,000
square-foot worldly hit against some
people doing maybe twenty thousand six
thousand that's more production
we wanted to make the tool more robots
so there's about 120 different parts of
either being changed upgraded or
modified they also have a digital
service indicator on top which hopefully
will give our guys more insight of what
the tool is doing it allows us to get
feedback from our guys which guys are
doing what how much they're doing it's
now we're giving the customers real-time
diagnostics and when the Tonys campaign
give the operator motor information at
his fingertips
I really see you know what's happening
with this tools we're taking that the
decking tools digital if you really
value your employees and you care about
your employees and you want to keep
those employees how could you not go to
