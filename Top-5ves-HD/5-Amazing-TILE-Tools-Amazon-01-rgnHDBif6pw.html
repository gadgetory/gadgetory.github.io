and engineered in a joint venture
between Lachman products and Delta it is
capable of performing a diagonal cut on
a 24 inch by 24 inch tile and it can
execute a 34 inch rip cut 39 inch rip
with plunge giving it the largest
cutting capacity in its class the Beast
10 is designed with a heavy-duty rail
system engineered for exceptionally
straight accurate and smooth cuts it is
equipped with a powerful 15 amp motor
which tilts to ensure accurate 22.5
degree and 45-degree bevel cuts and
offers a plunge cut feature making it
easy to execute vcap cuts cutouts for
wall sockets and much more the beast 10
comes with a removable table extension
and an optional drip tray extension
provides additional water containment
when cutting large format tiles an
innovative snake pipe water nozzle
allows for precise water control and
placement while reducing overspray the
durable steel pipe saw frame is
constructed to withstand the toughest
conditions the beast 10 has two optional
choices for stands a lightweight
conventional scissor stand and the
folding gravity stand with large rubber
wheels which allows for easy
transportation and storage which is a
variation in the height of adjoining
tiles which is a greater issue with the
growing popularity of large format tile
where tile warping is more common level
max corrects this with a completely
tooless system for intersection joints
offset joints and straight joints on the
floor or wall first select the level max
parts for the type of tile you are
laying part a the top will be used in
all scenarios and is reusable you'll
also want Part B the flat stem or tiling
next to walls and any other straight
joints then choose Part C for
intersections or Part D for offset tile
the stems are not reusable
step 1 place the stem part C or D
depending on your format on
each corner of the tile you were laying
step 2 after you've laid down all the
joining tile spin the top part a all the
way down until all the tiles are flushed
to each other when you get to a wall
repeat the process with Part B ideally 2
inches from the wall to hold and level
single joint lines allow 24 hours for
the thinset to set before step 3 and
simply kick off the stem saving the top
part a for future jobs because rigid
level max can grab 3 to 4 tiles at once
you'll save time and money over
competing systems by using less and
level max can double as a 1/16 inch
spacer which again can save you more
time and more money
from the brand known for legendary
precision and unparalleled performance
