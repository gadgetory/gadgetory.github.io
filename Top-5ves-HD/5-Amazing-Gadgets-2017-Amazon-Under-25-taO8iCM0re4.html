if you've ever hosted a barbecue you
have this beer running out of propane
nothing kills a party quicker than
uncooked food you can list or tap the
tank but that is not an accurate way to
measure just how much propane is left
that's why we invented the original gas
watch and the gas watch digital we've
sold millions of units of the original
gas watch so we know what we're doing
and now we want to take that technology
and bring it to the mobile market
introducing the smart gas watch which
uses the Bluetooth in your phone to
connect to the gas watch mobile app so
you never run out of propane at a
crucial time ever again the smart gas
watch lets you see how much propane is
left in the tank and shows you exactly
how much grilling time you have left
before empty a low level alarm will
sound when you're getting close to empty
the smart gas watch is incredibly easy
to set up and easy to use no tools are
required at all simply place your tank
on the scale download the app and launch
when you're ready it's that easy you'd
never go on a road trip without knowing
how much gas you have left in the fuel
tank so why would you have a barbecue
without knowing how much propane is left
hi my name is Suman we make products
which brings peace of mind so we saw the
day-to-day problem we've been doing
actual items for a long time but now
with the advancement technology you can
check the tank levels on your phone now
but to bring this product in the market
we need your support so share this story
with your friends and family at Facebook
and Twitter and also check out some
great rewards at our project page thanks
again
