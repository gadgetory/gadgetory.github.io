something comes along that works so damn
well that you don't need to fuss over
appearances it reminds us that above all
else we just want something useful
Jason freed said you need to get the
fundamentals right fun wears off cool
wears off useful never wears off
when we're rolling down the highway of
our lives what is it we want people to
see a rebel a trendsetter a man of
wealth and taste there's a funny old
saying from Mark Twain that goes clothes
make the man naked people have little or
no influence in society
but sometimes designers come along who
are the rebels they remind us that above
all else we just want something that can
be used the our two-year mark 3 is a
brand new multi functional outdoor
communication tool in a dynamic outdoor
scene it is common for you to fumble to
grab your phone and end up dropping it
no doubt it will break your heart the
team at r2 gear mark three big fans and
outdoor activities have been trying to
resolve this issue for the last two
years after the successful development
of the mk1 we have finally launched the
gear mark 3 the most convenient and safe
outdoor communication tool the mark 3 a
smartphone based walkie talkie is
designed to feel like a real
walkie-talkie and it's buttons in the
user grill people can use it with ease
by connecting users smartphones and the
mark 3 via bluetooth you can complete
the setup process with your group
members then your precious smartphone
can be safely stowed in a bag by using
the clip of mark 3

strap you can now freely use your hands
simply push the yellow button on the
mark 3 when you need to talk to them
given that the mark 3 is paired with
your smartphone there are no limits in
numbers or distance you can even talk
with your friends from abroad and that's
not all given the mark 3 is connected
with smartphones users can call just as
if it is a phone
also it has a built-in speaker so that
users can enjoy music
moreover the mark 3 is equipped with six
buttons for the most frequently used
functions while outdoors for example
there is an LED light to help users see
in dark places or at night and there is
an SOS button it shows the most
necessary functions while outdoors are
summed up as one touch button the mark 3
has strong durability to endure the
harsh conditions expected outdoors it
can work in the snow and rain and
survive being dropped into water by
accident the R 2 gear arc 3 aims to help
those who like to share precious moments
outdoors with people
I mean this is like climbing today you
can see the trail for sure it's almost
like you've got daylight around you you
obviously can see better but other
people can see you they they're awesome
you can see everything you don't you can
go off and you are you want like this
gives you more detail to you know you
can see texture with this light hi I'm
Rob co-founder of Xindi over the past 30
years I've brought hundreds of tech
products to market I live in one of the
coolest places on the planet and spent a
lot of time outdoors and I don't always
like to go in just because the Sun Goes
Down there are thousands of flashlights
and headlamps out there but none of them
did what I wanted I decided to create an
entirely new category of outdoor light
so we designed the world's first strap
light the Symphony Rock
we identified three things the light
needed first it had to be super bright
these lights you just see it all they're
awesome they're really bright you're lit
up so you're less likely to get attacked
you can do it right anywhere at night
second it had to light at the area
around you and matches the spot you know
it was great to have these lights so I
could really assess the entire area that
I was looking at and not just small
spots I liked how I can move my head and
the light still stays but these they
branch out they cover so much area that
you can see everything around you she
went through the park on a run at night
people won't get while mister and third
it needed to be hands the best survival
kit is the one you wouldn't think of
entering to the untamed world without
its small compact easy to use and
multifunctional it can be taken anywhere
knowing what this ultra portable tool
kit provides creates peace of mind
remember the MS 5 is the easiest
survival toolkit to carry and one you'll
never want to leave behind
the motion raid ms5 lets you blend in
with nature and take advantage of all
its beauty it comes with a world class
water purifier explore the entire jungle
without losing your sense of direction
with the rugged military-style compass
that efficiently puts you right on track
survival requires the right set of tools
and skills
with its easy-fit blades magnesium fire
starter boring grill and flashlights the
ms5 has you covered
precision and perfection are easily
blended using premium materials we have
forged life-saving tools creating a
strong yet stylish product we go above
and beyond the contemporary to integrate
more usefulness in every product the ms5
has what you need to survive a USB
charger SOS GPS tracker a micro burner
fishing tackle plus many more essentials
hi my name is Kyle Adelman and I'm a
product manager here at thermos so we're
constantly listening to our consumers
and one of the things that they were
telling us is they needed a way to bring
our technology into the backcountry with
a product that is smaller more
lightweight and more compact now this
product works with a camping gas
canister as the fuel source and it is
highly fuel-efficient from this medium
8-ounce canister you can get 180 hours
of runtime and it uses that to create a
small flame inside which use a gentle
heat activation to release the active
ingredient in the repellent which is
held in these mats
now our repellant is a Lutheran that is
a synthetic replica of what the
chrysanthemum flower creates naturally
and once it is vaporized it creates a 15
foot by 15 foot zone of protection such
as at your campsite the way that it
works is you begin by inserting a mat
slide it right in underneath the grill
and then you go ahead and kick out the
old mat and then thread it on to the
camping gas canister and then you're
gonna go ahead and switch it to the on
position which begins flowing the gas
you'll let the gas begin to activate for
about five seconds and then we're going
to go ahead and slide the integrated
piezo lighter give it a couple clicks
and then you can see through the viewing
window that the device is on as there's
a small orange and blue flame that is
totally safe now it is no spray so no
mess and it's no deep which can be
damaging to your gear which is another
thing our consumers asks us for then you
can actually store it in this rugged and
water-resistant pouch
that comes with the product and this way
it'll easily fit into your backpack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
