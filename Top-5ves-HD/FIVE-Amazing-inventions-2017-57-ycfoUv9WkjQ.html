Sophie he wanted to try to turn Sophie

stories continue the internet of
mysterious things is probably one of the
nerdiest children's books I like to say
the children's book with a touch of
technology because you can tap on the
hidden creatures on each page to launch
more information about the story I'm
Lisa Seacat deluca and I'm an inventor
and a software engineer I'm always on my
computer as a parent I feel guilty I am
constantly reminding myself and my
husband to put down our phones to give
our children our full attention
sometimes I feel like we're missing out
on life because we're consumed with our
digital lives Steven Spielberg once said
that technology interrupts our own story
it interrupts our ability to have a
thought or a daydream to imagine
something wonderful because we're too
busy bridging the walk from the
cafeteria back to the office on the cell
phone the idea for my second children's
boss was born the store uses mysterious
creatures to explain common technologies
we use in our everyday lives press an
app to turn on the light it's really a
leprechaun dashing across the wall ask a
question to a personal agent and it's
answered by a tiny fairy inside a
wearable activity tracker count steps
with the help of an alien hovering
nearby coffee is brewed by a colorful
dragon and an invisible man helps to
warm up our homes the story ends by
giving us a glimpse into the future and
encouraging everyone to look up from our
devices so we don't miss out on these
amazing creatures right in front of our
eyes but not all children are satisfied
with this answer to questions like out
of things work for my children's
favorite but why which is why I included
the NFC tags tap the page and more
information about each technology is
pulled up you choose as a parent
you want to dive with your child and
because the content is on the internet
the book becomes a living thing as the
technologies evolve the content well too
I'm so excited to share with you my book
it has helped our family use technology
to bring us closer while satisfying the
curiosity of even the most curious young
readers
