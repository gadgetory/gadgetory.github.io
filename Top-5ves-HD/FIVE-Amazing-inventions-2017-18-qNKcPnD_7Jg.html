Royd a new kind of toaster that brings
family and friends closer together when
was the last time you were this excited
for breakfast probably when you were her
age or probably never look at those
smiles has your breakfast ever been so
enjoyable with toast annoyed she can
design anything she wants on her toast
while you're stuck with the same old
boring piece of block her morning's look
magical while she waits an appointment
for that golden-brown crunch so how do
we do it inside tous droits innovative
and minimal design the smart toasting
system is powered by microfilament
heating technology but it can do so much
more let your toes speak your mind with
a smiley face or a light send a message
to that special someone for a surprise a
superhero toes might be exactly what you
need to power through the day each pop
of toast is a surprise there's
excitement in every cop take a look at
Tom we can toast the latest weather
forecast and other useful information
anywhere in the world whether he's in
London or Tokyo or anywhere in between
toaster Oh at him covered so he's ready
for the day's challenges what is more
exhilarating than a morning message from
your loved one how about a toast itch
secret messages that are only readable
on toast so the secret
stays with you forever it's the perfect
way to stay connected with your loved
ones wherever they may be this is the
beginning of the toast really unique
creative and interactive help us get
start your morning's with toaster ways
we've entered the age of personal
manufacturing but when it comes to
making durable things in your own shop
there's still no easy way to cut hard
materials as makers and engineers we
need to work with all materials so we've
built a machine that could a first
desktop waterjet laser works by
combining abrasive particles with the
high-pressure water stream the mixture
exits the nozzle and cuts through the
workpiece it's great for any workshop it
cuts every material it's compact and
contains and it's digital so you can
make precise cuts that are impossible to
make any other way
as an industrial designer I've used a
variety of desktop application tools but
they tend to be very limited by the
durability of the materials you can use
on those machines with it desktop
waterjet we can go from design to
component to fitting that component than
testing within couple of hours that's an
incredibly powerful tool as a jeweler
and an artist with the work I make I
spend a lot of time hand cutting so
right now I'm selling pieces sort of as
almost limited edition because I can't
physically output them not because I
want to be making in a limited edition
waser would allow me to not only make a
lot more but also to lower the price
point so they'd be available to a
broader audience I think you know people
tend to have their ideas constrained by
their tools and the things are capable
of working with and having a water jet
cutter which has the ability to cut I
broader range of materials hard
materials like steel and glass will be
enabling and make them think in
different ways and have them build
different things they couldn't build
before the future of manufacturing is in
custom local fabrication people will be
able to make things in our own workshop
that they can use every single day and
will last a lifetime as mechanical
electrical and manufacturing engineers
we design products manufactured
components and set-up assembly lines in
the past now we're preparing for
production but we need enough orders to
produce the machines cost effectively
we've created a unique desktop tool and
we're really looking forward to all the
amazing things that people create with
her
I came up with the idea for a translator
when I met a French girl that's really
where the story starts I was on vacation
and i met this girl it was difficult for
us to communicate because she didn't
speak english very well and even when we
tried to find a solution like using some
translation app to communicate it's
horrible look if you're not speaking and
our phones on a face like this forget it
this is Walt we're out of this
real-world interaction but this in your
ear just right back in it Lil D put this
in your ear just missin oh hey i put in
here comes up yeah ok can you get me a
French leave amid all the whole thing
this was a little thing yes I can hear
you talk Spanish of course is this but
this is awesome but how you do it yeah
it's translating translating
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other here is it
in their language developing the pilot
has been an intensive process our team
has been work on it over two years
andrew is our original co-founder and
overseas prior development I'm an
electrical engineer and expert and
manufacturing we also have mechanical
engineer software engineer PhD and
machine translation as well as an
industrial designer our wide breadth of
experts has allowed us to develop a
product for the ground up we wanted to
create something that hugs the curves of
the year without being obtrusive
something snug but fashionable to wear
in the process we just decided to throw
in an extra earpiece for wireless
streaming music that means the full
system includes two earpieces and its
accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the earpiece it's kind of an
end-all solution for the traveler or the
international professional that's what
we're doing here at Waverly louse it's
simply the most advanced communication
wearable
there's IndieGoGo campaign helps us
finish what we started we can get the
ear pieces along with this portable
charger manufactured and delivered
within a year the app works on sone if
you just want to use the app or basic
translation and we'll have the app out
by late summer first for our backers
here in indy gogo but for the full
experience you really want the ear
pieces too it's the dream you know a
life untethered free of language
barriers it's just that it's no longer
dream anymore it's real
bacteria germs allergens no matter how
often we wash our hands they always win
introducing plenty plenty is a handheld
portable LED sterilizer in a matter of
seconds with a stroke of light it makes
your surroundings bacteria free anywhere
