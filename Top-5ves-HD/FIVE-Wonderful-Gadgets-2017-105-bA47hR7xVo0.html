though we occasionally scale mountains
and shred NARM we're more likely to be
heading to the park with friends for
good times to be prepared we found
ourselves bring your hammocks blankets
tarps coolers so many things you name it
which got us thinking how can we
simplify this there's got to be a better
way
introducing the MC hammy it's a shelter
hammock and like it all in one
we call it the MC hammy and it's the
first of its kind how do we do this we
cleverly combine webbing fabric and
carabiners to create something
innovative and new the MC hammy is
useful no matter what you're into we
wanted something that we can take
everywhere and for it to just work
waterproof crazy soft packable and of
course easy to clean what does this mean
we're ditching all the things we call
ourselves Wildish and we are a group of
outdoor loving people who happen to be
designers and engineers with over 15
years of brand and product experience
the MC hammies being finalized now we
have selected a manufacturer with the
know-how to make new and innovative
products and we're about ready to start
production with your support we hope to
raise $15,000 which will cover the cost
of our first production run and help us
build more products in the future we
have great rewards on all levels from
stickers and high-fives to an
all-inclusive Bend Oregon weekend hosted
by me and Rick here at Wildish we love
hearing from you guys your thoughts your
dreams your realities reach out and
participate from ole Rick and me Adam
here Wildish thanks a million we
couldn't do this without you
you
you
you
you
a name is Scott Cochrane founder of mut
DUT and inventor of the Multi cinch
after two years and hundreds of
prototypes were excited to show you a
new tool that's truly more useful than
duct tape a year ago we had a viable
product we didn't stop refining until we
had something that was truly useful we
didn't want to just sell a product we
wanted to build a business that would
last thank you for making that dream a
reality
you
a smartphone that fits in the palm of
your hand
this is jelly the world's smallest 4G
smartphone it's hard to imagine a world
without smartphones but with performance
also the sizes were increasing and
sometimes just wish to have a smaller
phone so we developed jelly bringing you
all the convenience and performance of
other smartphones packed in a case as
small and portable as possible
geli fits into any pot without
compromising on features it is the
perfect phone for travel or outdoor
sports or simply great as a backup phone
with the dual SIM card slots you can
easily manage work and personal calls by
taking advantage of the powerful Android
nougat system you can get the ultimate
user experiences on talking texting
watching videos tracking sport trends
and using your favorite apps
geli has two cameras ready to capture
any moments or even taking perfect
selfies the battery is replaceable and
fully charged lasts up to three days
working time or seven days standby time
our goal was to design a great mini
sized smartphone that is smaller and
lighter than anything on the market but
also supports 4G network we focused on
so many details for a maximum
performance while also going through
many design and testing stages just to
ensure that jelly is reliable and looks
awesome for everyone in order to get
jelly alive we need your support please
join us and let's make jelly become real
here is the lava - camp and this is what
happens when you don't use it
lady what are you doing
what did I do you just backed into me
prove it see this my bi money on here
let me go did anybody get that no one
was recording really good
I saw your on the phone oh oh is it ah I
saw it with my own eyes
okay well uh nice
Oh
what do you mean witnesses know there
there was no witness might my car is all
scratched up a night
I expect my insurance to cover what do
you mean you can't help me is this the
life people really lead to know that car
accident happens every three minutes
every day which is why we built a Volvo
- lady what are you doing you you just
backed up into me fit the Volvo - is
smart with a built in G sensor that
automatically detects when collisions
happen
you'll always have the footage you need
no I wasn't on the phone can you prove
it
whether your cars on or off the Bava -
is there to protect when paired with a
Volvo charger the dash can automatically
record any unexpected activity when you
are away from the car how do you feel
leaving a car alone what if you could
see what's going on in your car while
you're not there the Volvo - knows what
happened and now so will you videos can
be captured on the bah-bah - mobile app
and upload it to Facebook or sent via
email that's amazing
hi my name is why I am I'm the designer
behind a baa-baa - we want to go beyond
the boxiness of traditional dash cams
and design a video camera that is easy
to install has great theater quality and
has features that we thought were
missing we thought it was important to
show the 360 capability of the camera
and which is why it's in a circular form
our culture driven design process
delivers experiences that are simple to
use beautiful to the eye and meaningful
to the user on a daily basis we spent
the past year taking this from an idea
to building our first prototypes now we
need your help to bring it to life if
you care about a safer and better
driving experience back our project on
Kickstarter now thank you for your
support and together we can make safer
and better driving experience for
everyone thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
