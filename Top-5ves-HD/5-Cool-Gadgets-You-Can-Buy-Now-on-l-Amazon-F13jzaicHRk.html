you
the dough the frosting but what's
feather is sharing it with someone else
with the same concept we designed the mo
Jaques powdered donut for you to share
the power with a size so compact and
light that you can slide in your pocket
MAGIX para donut simultaneously Paris of
all 5bc sockets and two USB ports with
fast charge and the best thing is they
won't conflict with each other like they
always do we solve this problem for the
revolutionary wing design that allows
the post if they're perfectly next to
each other

for you to adjust the length of the
integrated quote keeping your charting

charger with a UK EU or an au plug type
last time we hear you that's why we
designed the magics power bagel similar
to the magic Sparrow Dylan for this time
with universal sockets
when you have so many devices that need
charging it makes some sense to buy five
or six travel chapters when there's only
one wall socket what you want is
something that adapts all your devices

solution

spell bagel or donut and this is the
world's first universal power extension

electric socket and USB charging station
at the airport in the hotel the reality
is we need power strips while traveling
but we don't bring them reason is simple
power strips on the market are way too
bulky and none of them can keep the long
messy court under control plus they're
unable to adapt to different socket
types high kicks hard it's been two
years since we launched our first
product the idea of merge experiment and
Baker which is the universal socket
version of donut is to create something
elegant and powerful with a personal
touch and paying attention to all the
small details

that we could incorporate what you want
the nor designs after all logics is a
brand created by you guys as a small
design team we don't have the luxury to
hire PR companies or make fancy the news
our focus has always been on the product
itself every cent you flash to us we use
it to buy components to make the
products that will be shipped to you in
May the shoe
