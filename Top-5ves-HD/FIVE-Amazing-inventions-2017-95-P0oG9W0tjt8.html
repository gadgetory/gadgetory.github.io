my safety I just haven't told you until
now
the largest
safety device using the power to protect
yourself by trusting your gut
with instance
they're right outside
Hey
not much just hanging out oh you want to
meet up with our yeah I can treat your
text all right
chess a game that's quickly shifted from
the elegant looking board attract pads
and touch screens so technology stepped
up not sure if the game has evolved with
it
how about revolutionising the way it's
played though play goes Harry Potter
wizard test like been moving oh it's
just like a maze introducing square off
the most evolved and connected
chessboard ever square offs here to
change the way chess is played it's
something you don't see every day
imagine you can challenge anyone from
any corner of the world doesn't matter
if the opponent has a board or not just
a swipe and the board reflects all the
moves in real times that's awesome
engaging way to play across distance
this intelligent chess board is coated
in such a genius way that the chess
pieces don't collide when they move on
their own really unique experience the
play with the pieces as opposed to on
just a nap or something like that it's
training mode allows you to play with
square off artificial intelligence so
you can brush up on your skills too it's
incredibly smart but the most amazing
thing about this is live streaming of
the professional matches you can watch
every expert move made by the ACE
players right on your square off borders
it's taken years to perfect this
thoughtfully designed board and who
better to tell you about this journey
than the founders themselves initially
the brook life was just against a
comforter for visually impaired people
but then we realized that this can be a
connected board gaming platform the
development of square-off has led us to
innovate in some amazing technology like
sensing the user interaction with the
board and the precise magnetic motions
square-off is the result of three whole
years of tireless efforts several
prototypes are made feedback and
suggestions for gathered at various
exhibitions and finally the beta product
was ready the most important design
aspect for us was to maintain the
traditional feel of the chessboard so we
wanted to take people off the screen
back to the traditional board the future
board games looks like a lot of fun
doesn't it just updating the app and
replacing the surface will enable you to
play any game you like anytime anywhere
we feel this is the future of code
gaming please back us and share our
campaign oh my god it's like the board
is alive it's so weird
square off
it is incredible how much we rely on
weather forecasts and so-called local
temperatures the truth is that those
values available online or through apps
come from weather stations that can
easily be dozens of miles away
nothing beats measuring the values by
yourself right where you are but that's
just not possible and silly so we have
created the world's smallest a weather
station that can easily fit in your palm
simply plug weather point into your
device and start the app simple as that
it consists of four sensors for
temperature humidity atmospheric
pressure and ultraviolet radiation with
this information you can have the most
accurate weather forecast anywhere you
are also by measuring atmospheric
pressure you can know your altitude more
precisely than GPS devices you can also
measure UV radiation and limit your
exposure to these harmful UV rays the
housing is made from aluminium and
titanium and ensures longer life time
when you're not using weather point it
is safely placed on your keychain so you
don't have to worry about losing it
where the point doesn't use a battery
well who likes them anyway it doesn't
even require internet connection but
building hardware is costly we invested
a lot of resources into making weather
point possible and now we need your
support to make it available and
affordable for everyone thank you
