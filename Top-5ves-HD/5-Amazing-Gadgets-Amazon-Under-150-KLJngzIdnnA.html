you
and
hi I'm Matt I'm really excited to try
the Innova precision cooker I haven't
cooked sous-vide before but I can't wait
to give it a shot all right I've got the
wand you got the clamp and we're ready
to go before I get started I had a
couple questions but thankfully have
Bill Clark from Innova here to answer
them for me
so bill what is sous-vide good question
so sous-vide or precision cooking has
been around for decades we use the world
over by top chefs everywhere all you
need to do is with the device put into
your pot you submerge your food into the
pot itself it circulates the water a
very precise temperature and you always
get the desired doneness you want what
would make this better than say grilling
I love that questions from my favorite
grilling is all over the map you have
hot spots you have cold spots and
everything in between
with precision cooking you don't have to
worry about any of that you set your
device to whatever doneness you like
medium rare steak 120 degrees Fahrenheit
you set the device you hit play and when
that comes out it's going to be exactly
120 degrees all the way through you nova
precision cooker is easy to use first
you fill a medium sized pot with water
then clamp the Innova precision cooker
then you sink your cooker to your app
put your food in a plastic bag then
clamp the bag into the water when the
water is at the set temperature
so the cool thing about our device is
that you can start a cook from the
interface or you can use our app the app
itself has time temperature guides to
create that perfect stay we're talking
about or you can use the hundreds of
recipes that we have in the app to
choose the device the app itself all you
need to do is just press Start and you
chosen recipe and the Apple take care of
the rest so the best part is you never
have to worry about over food it's
always give you the exact same results
every single time you don't have to
worry if you have no kids if you have a
life you will still be able to come back
and your food will be ready at the exact
temperature you set it up and then the
other half is that you will never waste
food it's always going to be the exact
same results every single time all right
the moment of truth perfect medium-rare
edge to edge looks delicious let's give
it a go mmm that's really good that's
better than being at a restaurant and I
did it myself this is awesome
the message or tell someone where you
were but for some reason you couldn't
that's because they were probably too
many people around or you were too far
from a tower or maybe the network was
down and you probably saw this or this
or one of these that's all about to
change with go tena lieutenant pears
wirelessly with your smartphone making
it possible to text and share your
location with anyone else who also has
even when you don't have service no need
for cell towers Wi-Fi or satellites with
blue tena you can communicate the better
one find friends even when the rest of
the crowd is struggling to get their
message
Goten is great for travel because it
works anywhere in the world explore and
roam for free and if there's an
emergency you can send a message to all
go tenez within range because here's the
thing cell phones are great but there's
a lot of situations when they're just
not that reliable it's time to start
your own network and make no service no
problem
go Teta every morning and every day we
all need to move around the city public
transportation is a cost-effective way
to commute but your origin or
destination is often far from the bus or
train station and you still have to walk
many blocks rideshare services are
convenient but using them every day can
get prohibitively expensive you can
carry around your bicycle with you to
avoid the walk but it is a big hassle to
do that imagine how wonderful it could
have been if there were shared bicycles
at every corner and block of the city
you could use an application on your
phone to locate these bikes on the map
or find these bikes on the street and
even use your phone to unlock
what if you could ride the bike to your
destination and lock it up on any bike
rack and leave it right there with
bismarck bike share all of this is now
possible all you need to do is install
this lock app on your phone and locate
the nearest bike on the map you can then
reserve the bicycle through the app
simply walk up to it and press a single
button on big lock to unlock this lock
instantly connects to your phone through
bluetooth low energy and verifies your
access permission after getting to your
destination simply lock up the bike to
any public bike rack we will notify
other members of the new bike location
or have a bid lock crew member move the
bank to a more accessible location once
you lock up the bike take a picture of
it inside of the app for further
accountability confirm payment rate your
experience or report any issues with the
bike and you're done with bit lock life
can be simple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
