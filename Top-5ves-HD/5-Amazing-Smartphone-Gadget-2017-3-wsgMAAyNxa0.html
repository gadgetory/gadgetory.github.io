you're careful about eating healthy food
and drinking clean water but what about
the air you breathe do you realize that
you actually ingest 12 times more air
than food and five times more than water
introducing the Primo personal air
monitor a keychain sized air monitor
that plugs into your iPhone and lets you
see what you breathe the app gives you
real-time readings temperature humidity
and air quality based on precision
measurements of volatile organic
compounds a coloring number scale tells
you the quality of the air around you
opt into our community and share your
results and contribute to a worldwide
real-time air quality map we are
constantly surrounded by toxins in the
air around us from common products like
cleaners to smog pollution and pet waste
the most obvious results are the 1 in 12
people who suffer from asthma or the
more than half of Americans who live in
areas with unhealthy air quality but in
reality almost everyone is subjected to
poor air quality at some point during
the day
screamo can monitor your air wherever
you are or confirm your suspicions so
you can do something about it hello my
name is dr. TJ Osborn you know after 23
years in practice one of the things that
I have found out that it separates sick
people from healthy people is that
healthy people know their numbers if you
don't know your blood pressure you're
going to have heart issues if you don't
know if the numbers about what's in the
air that you breathe you're going to
have breathing issues that's why I find
that a personal air monitor is
absolutely required for people to be
healthy supremo keeps you informed
whether you're at work home school
for the airport spree mo was founded by
ray combs and Harold Homs Ray has helped
bring about products like the palm pilot
and Amazon Kindle and is passionate
about improving indoor air quality to
help his son who has asthma Harold has
been studying chemistry for years at New
York University where he got his PhD and
hails from China where air pollution in
many cities makes it impossible to go
outside thus primo air monitor lets you
be fully aware of those deep breaths
you're taking means Spri mo is helping
people breathe easier Wow the air
quality here so great singing okay
