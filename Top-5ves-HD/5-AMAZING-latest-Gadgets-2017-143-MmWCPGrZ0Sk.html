a nice cold drink is so refreshing but
the lack of an effective solution for
the frustrating condensation ring leaves
us with only a few subpar options wrap
it with napkins jacket inside a second
steps or resort to using an old
fashioned stationery coaster so here's
how it all happens
feeling confident as ever ready to make
a lasting impression I was prepared for
everything it seems if only I hadn't
overlooked to condensation downpour that
would leave me sloppy embarrassed we
knew there had to be a better way so we
created barnacle coasters barnacle
coasters mobile coasters that is
convenient reusable actually keeps you
dry
we listed all the things that were wrong
with the current options and weren't
satisfied until we created a product
that solves them all in order to make a
mobile coaster that people would use we
had to prevent drift while at any angle
a patent-pending design captures
condensation allowing it to enter and
preventing its escape
the barnacle coaster accommodates a cup
of your choice a fun and colorful
product that can feature any pattern or
can be used as a marketing Avenue
offering readily visible advertisement
space our dishwasher-safe barnacle
coasters mean that those pesky
condensation drops are a thing of the
past not to mention they can easily go
with you anywhere you go at school in
the office around the house they even
fit inside the cup holder of most cars
think about it where will you use your
barnacle coaster
we use barnacle coasters all the time
and we know you will be
when you're on the move you need power
the moves with you we've made layer for
this purpose it's a Bluetooth enabled
laptop sleeve which can charge your
laptop PC or Mac smartphone and tablet
simultaneously wherever you are so
instead of having to pack chargers
adapters and power banks you just ring
layer with your devices already inside
and charge along with the built-in
battery and if you're traveling it may
be the only thing you need as it has
adaptors for every country Larry isn't
just a battery it's a solution which
allows you to keep momentum throughout
your day and stay in charge I used to
travel a lot for water and I was always
meeting Republic by Claire power banks
are great for quick phone charges but it
wasn't a solution for all of my devices
in the end it was just another thing I
had to worry about so I brought a team
together to find a solution with years
of experience in technology and product
design there was the end result and it's
the first of its kind it was important
opera covered all the functionality our
users would need charging all devices
not just solved it has DC charging for
PCs and Macs along with USB C for newer
laptops and phones for everything else
we've included a USB port with quick
charge anyone can work layer we'll our
easy to use app and you'll never lose it
because it's trackable we also wanted to
create something that would look
beautiful and would stand up from the
average laptops leave the closure system
we design allows us to keep the sleeve
as compact as possible extending only
when you need to the battery can be
changed or replaced we wanted best to
expand the lifespan of the product and
we include international adapters we can
use the product anyway
we're using a composite material
specifically designed for layer which
provides durability cushioning and
protection from scratches we're small
team but we have a great history of
bringing new products to market
we built our prototype and now we need
funding to scale an unofficial product
we're really proud of layer the quality
and the solution are provided and we can
wait to get it in your hand
