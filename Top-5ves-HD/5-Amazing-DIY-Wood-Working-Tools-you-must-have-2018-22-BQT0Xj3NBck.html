fixture buys you extra time during glue
ups by streamlining the process and
positions your clamps to optimize
pressure across panel or puts clamp
pressure just where you want it as in
raised panel door glue ups the CSS 24
comes in two models one nests three
quarters of an inch or smaller pipe
clamps and the other holds one quarter
inch and heavier 3/8 inch parallel jaw
clamp bars the four sides of the CSS 24
are quickly assembled using notches in
each bar that forms a sturdy egg-crate
joint and for longer panel glue ups
simply use two or more to handle your
needs clamping with pipe clamps couldn't
be easier since the CSS 24 elevates the
handle for easy cranking plus the powder
coat paint finish cleans right off the
current custom pocket hole plug cutter
makes it possible to take Craig joinery
projects to the next level by giving you
complete freedom to create your own
custom plugs from any wood species that
means you can cut plugs from your own
project stock to create plugs with color
that matches your project better than
has ever been possible before plus the
custom pocket hole plug cutter allows
you to create face green plugs that
blend in amazingly well the plug cutter
simply slips into a Kreg jig in place of
the normal drill guide block and works
with the Kreg jig k5 k4 or even an older
k3 model that allows you to clamp your
plug material in place and drill in the
same way that is used for creating
pocket holes to create the plugs just
chuck the plug cutting bit and do any
drill this high performance bed features
a specially designed cutting tip that
sheers cleanly for a smooth consistent
plug the bit also has an open design
that presents wood from jamming inside
the bit and fluting that reduces heat
and friction for better plugs and longer
bit life a stop collar ensures perfect
depth every time to produce accurately
sized plugs the custom pocket hole plug
cutter comes with
one bit that creates plugs for
standard-size Craig pocket holes for
even greater versatility two optional
bits are also available one makes
smaller diameter plugs that fit Craig
micro pocket pocket holes
the other bit creates large plugs to
work with the Kreg jig HD a plug size
that's only possible using the custom
pocket hole plug cutter
after cutting the custom-made plugs free
they simply slip into the pocket holes
the plugs are sized to protrude only
slightly above the surrounding surface
that means it's easy to sand or trim the
plugs flush producing a plug that
virtually disappears when you want the
best matching pocket hole plugs possible
and when you want the freedom to create
plugs from any type of wood the Craig
custom pocket hole plug cutter is the
solution you need micro jigs gravity
heel accessory for the gripper is a
significant upgrade of the original
trailing hook that came with the handle
bridge cap the gravity heel rides on top
of the workpiece while you're cutting
then drops into place at the end of the
part to provide a physical heal that
assists in pushing the piece through the
cutter
it is designed and priced to be
sacrificial pushing both the main part
and the off/on piece even when the off
fall is too narrow for the leg of the
gripper keeping parts from flying back
in you
it also provides a major assist at the
joint allowing positive feed through the
end of the past without having to apply
excessive downforce which can interfere
with the proper flattening technique at
the router table
the gravity heal can be used to assist
the push past the cutter or locked in
place and used as a backer preventing
tear out and this backer can be saved
for later use as a setup block the
gravity heal kit comes with two complete
sets of hardware and five heals in two
sizes and assembly could not be easier
the heal spacer slides over the t-bolt
with the cove and ridge facing out then
the heal is added facing it so that the
ridges and coves align with those in the
heal spacer the spring is added next the
nylon bushing sits on top of the spring
and the hand knob holds everything in
place the head of the t-bolt in the
assembled gravity heal is inserted into
the rear slot of the gripper that the
center leg mounts in the blade is
tapered so the clamping knob can be
adjusted in or out to control how far
the heal will drop down you can set it
to drop a little or set it to go deeper
and of course it can be locked in place
when the situation demands
european-style hinges are a great way to
go when you're mounting cabinet doors
they're concealed for a sleek clean look
and they offer easy adjustment for
perfect door alignment with rocklers
exclusive line of jiggets solutions that
are easy to install - and the only power
tool you need is a handheld drill on the
doors the jigi deluxe hinge drilling
system lets you quickly more precise
perfectly aligned holes for the hinge
cups the jig configures to match your
hinge specifications and the clamp bases
slip easily on the edge of your door
elevating the door enough to accommodate
bench cookie + work grippers for no slip
stability positioning is as simple as
lining up the center marks on the jig
with your Center lines on the door and
tightening down the spring-loaded
drilling guide comes with a stop collar
that lets you set the exact drilling
depth the drill guide fits snugly onto
the steel template on the clamp base
then you simply drill and you end up
with precisely positioned perfectly
vertical hinge cup holes of just the
right depth here's another great thing
about the jig it deluxe system if you're
mounting hinges and multiple doors of
the same size you only have to set it up
once when you're done with the doors you
need to drill pilot holes in the cabinet
for the hinge mounting plates Rockler
offers jiggets to make this operation
easy and accurate to the jigs have a
centerline that you line up with your
marks on the cabinet a built in fence
guarantees alignment and proper setback
then you just use the Rockler self
centering bit specified for the jig to
drill the holes all that's left to do is
Mount the hinge arms to the door and the
mounting plates to the cabinet and clip
the hinges together before you know it
installation is done and you look like a
pro blade match arbor shim system from
micro jig this simple one-time setup
system allows you to make safe and
accurate cuts using any blade on your
table saw rely on your riving knife and
once again trust your rippln scale
you see every time you change your blade
you're changing the distance between the
blade in the fence that makes your cut
inaccurate and it can cause the riving
knife to bind up working with a
misaligned riving knife is difficult
removing it entirely dangerous and can
result in kick back the blade match
arbor shims eliminate that problem the
set comes with six are versions using a
combination of these shims you can dial
in your thickness down to the thousandth
of an inch the shims act is a spacer
between the blade in the arbor you can
adjust the blade position from three
thousandths of an inch to forty-five
thousandths of an inch in every one
thousandth of an inch increment set it
up once and your zero cut line remains
the same with every blade every time
when you're serious about woodworking
close enough just doesn't cut it
the blade match our Burton system from
mikrotik different blades same cut</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
