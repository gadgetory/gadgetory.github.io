itself isn't quite to the job that often
can develop into skin malignancies given
that the skin is one of the most exposed
organs it's the biggest organ in our
body each year more people give skin
cancer from the Sun and then get lung
cancer from smoking cigarettes one
American dies every hour from melanoma
and is one of the only cancers the
