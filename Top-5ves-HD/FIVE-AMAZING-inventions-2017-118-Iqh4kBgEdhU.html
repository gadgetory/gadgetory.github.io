using the most advanced German sensors
Zeus monitors both tire pressure and
temperature in real-time and sends this
data to the app Zeus is the first ever
tire monitor to be able to detect slow
leaks with its advanced data mining
technology this proprietary algorithm
called accurate temp analyzes pressure
and temperature data over time and
alerts you to any slow leaks that other
tire monitoring systems would have
missed the app report clearly pinpoints
the exact tire and the rate of leakage
to make it even more versatile we've
designed it as a device that anyone can
self install take it with you on your
