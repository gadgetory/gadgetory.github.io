inflated tire is three times more likely
to cause a crash so let's do some damage
thirty-eight psi a good tire deflating
it to 27 huh
25% lower now it's three times more
dangerous now this one and this one
okay owners come here i way to guess
which front tire is under inflated this
one looks up a little different they
look the same yes they do and this is
the real danger you can't tell by just
looking that's how we developed a device
to help keep you safe
introducing the Zeus smart tire safety
monitor the next-generation technology
that puts you in control of your driving
safety safety has never looked so sexy
using the most advanced German sensors
Zeus monitors both tire pressure and
temperature in real-time and sends this
data to the app Zeus is the first ever
tire monitor to be able to detect slow
leaks with its advanced data mining
technology this proprietary algorithm
called accurate temp analyzes pressure
and temperature data over time and
alerts you to any slow leaks that other
tire monitoring systems would have
missed the app report clearly pinpoints
the exact tire and the rate of leakage
to make it even more versatile we've
designed it as a device that anyone can
self install take it with you on your
next trip and easily install in just
three steps on your rental car
when it comes to protecting your family
everywhere you go to the next generation
and safety technology Zoo smart tire
safety monitor Binondo today's
technology for yesterday's car back us
now on IndieGoGo

motors are cleverly integrated in the
wheels providing casual flexible
maneuverability along the fairway

this project for over three years after
spending hundreds of hours on a drawing
board thousands of miles traveling to
the suppliers 12 prototype revisions

the first hundred units for making sure
we're ready for mass production and
undergoing extensive testing to each and
every component we now need your help to
bring this product to the market please
