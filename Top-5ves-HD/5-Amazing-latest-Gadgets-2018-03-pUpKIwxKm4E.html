our first ravy and heated down puffy was
great for keeping us warm and everyday
use but we kept hearing from our
customers that they wanted something
tougher more rugged so we went back to
the drawing board and created the
arabian rugged jacket it's as rugged and
tough as you are maybe even a little
tougher introducing the rainy and rugged
heated jacket we designed it with multi
zone on-demand heat when and where you
need it using our easy access multi zone
controller you can send the heat to your
core or thumbhole cuffs independently or
both at the same time with three heat
settings per zone you're in control with
the world's first patented heated
thumbhole cuffs we designed it to keep
your hands warm while keeping your
digits free for intricate work they're
also thin enough to work with most
gloves to keep your hands even warmer
arabian rugged jackets are compatible
with batteries from Milwaukee to Walt
Bosch jookiba
and most 12-volt power tool batteries
it's also water resistant to survive the
elements with an inner soft breathable
liner it's tough enough to survive the
jobsite but comfortable enough to
swaddle a newborn baby
we didn't skimp on the zippers either
with the industry standard beefy YKK
zippers there's also two waist cinches
to keep out the cold drafts when
reaching for that tool you need there
are five pockets a large stuffed pocket
and smaller security pocket on the
inside and large chest pocket and two
hand pockets on the outside we've also
given you two battery pocket locations
that allow you to connect to any 12-volt
power tool batteries or you can use
Arabian battery each battery depending
on capacity can power our jackets for up
to eight hours in a single charge or
with our Arabian battery you can charge
your mobile devices up to four times we
made our outer shell with thick stretchy
soft shell from the new Verve
water resistance we also made it machine
washable
how's that for convenience so if you're
that guy who is rugged and tougher than
nails his jacket is we are aqua design
innovations over the past few years
we've become the top innovators of
living decor disrupting the stagnant
industry of dyeing plants and dirty
aquariums we started out with a dream
just like you to create something that
would rock this world in 2015 you blew
us away with your response to the Eco

the Eco cube air and the Eco cube frame

ask anyone who owns an iPhone and they
will tell you there is nothing more
frustrating than drop calls slow data
speeds and constantly running out of
battery did you know that these are all
problems caused by weak signal my name
is Pete Peng creator of Firefly iPhone
cases which utilizes a patented new
antenna technology invented by my father
dr. Chang Peng my father is a pioneer in
the field of advanced antenna
technologies has even created solutions
for the Department of Defense which
includes antenna systems for the Patriot
missile three years ago my father my
team and I set out on a mission to
improve mobile communications so how
does the Firefly iPhone case help
improve your signal we have a poor
connection your smartphone search is
non-stop for cell phone towers near your
physical locations to make sure you have
the strongest signal possible but this
constant searching slows the performance
of your phone and drains your battery by
embedding our patented technology
directly into the Firefly case it
improves upon your phone's built-in tiny
antennas providing improved cellular
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity just
how significant of an improvement are we
talking about
check out this speed test and see for
yourself in fact the Firefly case frame
itself is more than just a sleek home
for the signal enhancing antenna it's
wave gel inner liner absorbs kinetic
energy and is built into a shock
absorbing outer guard for reinforced
protection enough to protect your iPhone
from a 12-foot drop on concrete without
a scratch or a straight-up ninja throw
out
when comparing the Firefly case to
traditional big store brands it is easy
to see that for about the same price the
Firefly not only provides a high level
of protection but also adds a lot more
value by improving your phone's overall
performance I'm asking for your support
so that together we can bring this
game-changing technology to every
cellphone user we will use the funds to
continue to expand our product line help
pay for custom tooling stock raw
materials higher skilled labor and solve
the king you hear me now problem once
and for all we are so confident that we
will deliver your Firefly on time and as
promised that if we do not we will
refund 100% of your initial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
