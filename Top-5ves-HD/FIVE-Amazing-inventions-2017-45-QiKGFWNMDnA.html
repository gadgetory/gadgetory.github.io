sports yeah I really like in liner you
know wind in hair my favorite song the
freedom
well except for those heavy shoes I've
got a hole in my backpack hmm and what
about hiking sure I love liking being
out in nature is where I can unwind and
get new ideas it's just really a drag
lugging around those heavy boots all day
then why don't you use Skinner's water
Skinner's scanners the most
ultraportable foot bear in the world
also I mean they like super cool
Skinner's are light get very durable
they fit into your pocket don't slip and
have a cooling effect and best of all
get seriously yep you can throw them in
the washer
scanners were designed to be worn
anywhere anytime like at our wedding
okay well almost any time if you're
tired of carrying an extra pair of shoes
with you all the time try Skinner's
they're lightweight portable comfort
simply put its foot we're tuned to
perfection I get it so I can have
Skinner's with me all the time like when
we take a trip to Japan again exactly
that's right you can date them pretty
much anywhere hi Kickstarter I'm Peter
and here at skinners we spend the last
18 months developing a better
alternative to your heavy clunky
footwear many of us were willing travel
or exercise well we found an easier way
both for you and your feet our
patent-pending technology says goodbye
to gluten themes that could fall apart
over time scanners are manufactured in
Europe using the finest Swedish
materials with a dual coding of extra
durable anti abrasive polymer and we've
tested them all over the world in all
kinds of conditions to make sure they
can keep up with you wherever you go we
even have guys running marathons in them
long story short very excited with how
Skinner's turn out and the way they feel
and protect your feet and people are
surprised to see how something so simple
can be so durable the next step is to
give more people the chance to
experience Skinner's for themselves and
to do that we need your help simply put
Skinner's are designed to be small to
functional as you are
the jam stick plus is the easiest way to
learn how to play the guitar period it
comes with apps for your iphone or ipad
to help you learn how to play download
Jam tutor on the App Store and learn
without having to guess where to put
your fingers jab stick + never needs
tuning it uses your iPad iPhone or Mac
to generate sound and it already works
with more apps than we can keep track of
you can learn and practice on your terms
with the jab stick plus we've seen users
start playing chords in minutes with the
jab stick and it's portability can turn
just about any environment into a
practice or lesson studio the original
gem stick was well received in 2014 but
we knew there were improvements we
wanted to get into more users hands we
started by adding a magnetic pickup to
give the jam stick plus a more
traditional feel to your picking hand
and thanks to advancements with
Bluetooth 4.0 technology we equip the
jams to class with wireless Bluetooth
connectivity that works seamlessly with
apple's new bluetooth midi software the
jab stick plus is the same real guitar
strings and real frets just like the
original to best match the experience of
putting your fingers on the guitar and
yes the jam stick + handle string band

with your iphone or ipad to get great
musical performance out of apps like
garageband
hundreds of others the chapstick plus is
also a great midi controller for your
mac in yosemite you can play any sound
available in logic ableton live pro
tools and other di WS we believe that
crowdfunding hosts the biggest group of
movers and shakers on the planet it's
also for the jam stick originally found
an audience you represent the future of
emerging technology and art that's the
intersection we live in and that's why
we're here on Kickstarter we want you to
experience the jab stick + first hand
and we're asking you to help support
this campaign slip together we can bring
more people closer to the dream of
playing music you know we've seen magic
in the eyes of people when they play the
first chord or they stir a piano or they
produce the first song with the six
strings of the jam stick and we can't
wait to see what the gem stick +
inspires in your hands thanks for your
support
