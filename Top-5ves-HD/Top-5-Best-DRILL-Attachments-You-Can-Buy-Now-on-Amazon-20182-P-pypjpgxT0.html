nut on the end of your handle take the
nut out and sometimes because this is a
tapered fit they're kind of stiff if you
take your hammer and tap on it from the
backside it'll pop right off and then
set this aside where you're not going to
lose it now you're going to notice that
this taper fits right on to the taper
there and it'll slide into place when
you're using it you want to just keep a
slight amount of pressure forward it
doesn't take all you don't have to
really push on it but you just want
those two surfaces to engage so when you
put that on there and then you can
adjust your mill so whatever you're
grinding it works fantastic these are
available through your local dealer and
does a really nice job for grinding
faster or larger quantities
when you get one of the powerblade
cutters it will come in a nice hard case
for easy storage opening up the case we
see the big kahuna cable cutter and Wow
look at the size of the blade on this
cable cutter again it will cut up to
three and a half inch diameter copper
cable which is absolutely huge I always
love a tool that is simple in design and
works really well
talk about saving time on those job
sides this thing just cuts cable like
it's butter with the power blade
alignment can make one handed cut
leaving the other hand free holding the
cable in improving job safety to attach
the drill to the cable cutter insert the
cable cutters drive shaft into the truck
of the drill and tighten then adjust the
torque arms a little fit around the
drill and then move the handle to the
extended position and tighten this will
securely hold the drill in place when
cutting cables the cable cutters unique
compact design is the perfect tool for
cut it fitting into tight places plus
the handle will fall out of the way for
those extra tight places there are all
kinds of mixers but on job sites the
hive's stir whip is the one that will
handle every kind of compound without
over taxing your drill what makes the
stir whip unique its bendable fingers
flex to fit through pour spouts that
means you can premix paint and pour it
into smaller containers without removing
the lid the stirrer whips nylon fingers
reach into every corner for more
thorough mixing and they create less
drag which puts less demand on your
drill even when you're mixing thick
compounds the stirrer whips 18 inch
shaft makes it perfect for mixing in one
gallon cans or five gallon buckets and
it's durable construction will handle
anything from thin set stained paint and
plaster to drywall mud and concrete oh
and cleanup that's a snap
the hide stir with the perfect mix of
features for pros on the job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
