the rest is technology when we talk
about we our content the first thing you
need is a good with our camera we talk
to we our studios and content creators
all of them are looking for a better be
our camera so we decided to make a
better one our team is very experienced
in camera program and we have
successfully launched she came in one
last year now and very proud to present
she came as one which I believe is the
best of its kind seeing seeing is
believing
seeing is believing based on Z game you
want m resist each one is built with a
foodie indicated for image sensor system
all four sensors are precisely
synchronized to ensure simultaneous
recording each lens is closely mount
with each other resulting in shorter
safety distance between camera and
object
we have chosen is a high resolution and
gennadi degree fish islands which
provides excellent image quality and
outperforms those spots camera
resolutions a full metal housing is used
to improve heat dissipation resulting in
much longer continuous recording there
are two power options an ac/dc power
adapter socket and a detachable battery
unit using 18 650 standard lithium iron
rechargeable battery cells image files
are stored on SD cards in addition to
the four individual HDMI ports there is
an Gigabit Ethernet port which allows
not only easy and fast image file
transfer but also life will possibility
through external solutions and since we
provide full set open a PR expert users
we found this extremely useful because
they can remotely control s1 through the
Ethernet port
we think professional we our cameras
should be more sophisticated than
traditional cameras we have developed a
special algorithm to coordinate auto
white balance and auto exposure of all
four sensors resulting in more
harmonized images
our team is very experienced in image
quality training and optimization we
have continued to improve the overall
image quality will Angeles Lee we've
simply one objective in mind to be the
best
P they're impossible to maintain and
they lack detail talk about detail I
still remember the time I sent my
husband to the store for half-and-half

to the store and forget the list at home
anyway or come home from grocery
shopping only to realize we needed
something that nobody added to the list
this is Jeanie can and it's going to
help you build your shopping list easily

shopping list it's dead Jeanie can adds
barcode scanning and voice recognition

ketchup to your shopping list you're
