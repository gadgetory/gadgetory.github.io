but your bed is awful the raw egg test
let me prove it when it comes to
mattresses you used to only have three
choices looking for some shoulder pain
try a hard mattress oh it may feel like
a rock and put pressure on your hips but
it's the perfect way to tell your
partner hey baby want some arthritis it
just fails the raw egg test then there's
the soft mattress it starts out okay but
collapses over time like some cheap
sneakers or Anakin Skywalker and since
it comes without back support you get to
try cool new hobbies like chronic pain
but it also fails the raw egg test now
let me explain the eggs the raw egg test
States the perfect bed will let you put
weight on raw eggs without breaking them
because if a bed can cradle raw eggs
while supporting all that weight it'll
also cradle your pressure points while
supporting your body from maximum
comfort well if the hard beds bad a
cradling and the soft beds bad at
supporting at least the medium bed is
just terrible it's not firm enough for
back support or soft enough for your
pressure points so in the end it's just
a sad metal ground like limbo or was he
sent our it's average no one wants
average now to get around that some beds
come with five thousand dollar remote so
you can choose between hard bed problems
or soft bed problems they're so high
tech they failed a raw egg test twice
I don't need a bed that's hard soft or
average I need the best of firm and soft
without the drawbacks introducing purple
the only mattress that cradles your
pressure points like a soft bed while
supporting everywhere else like a firm
one need proof let's check double check
triple check all the checks I'm really
heavy for a little girl from a fairy
tale yes these eggs are raw and no we
didn't fake it how lame would that be
you're lame for thinking that how can I
bet be this comfortable maybe because it
has 15 patents was created by an actual
rocket scientist and uses a comfort grid
system to distribute weight across any
body type giving you the best sleep
you've ever had guaranteed thanks
science now there's a catch most
high-end mattresses cost five thousand
dollars but ours is only a thousand
we're sorry about that we're the best
but you can spend that extra money on I
don't know an adorable baby bear don't
let it open the mattress though it will
pee all over it and while you're saving
money you'll save time too cuz we're
shipping purple right to your door for
free thank you now I have to we're so
convinced you'll love purple if it
doesn't change your life in the first
100 nights we'll take it back for a
complete refund that's the purple no
pressure guarantee so if you or someone
you love sleeps click here to buy your
purple at on purple calm and say goodbye
to the rock hard I'll embed the saggy
swamp bed the average bed and the
expensive remote get yourself into a
purple and mom and pop it's not the
1940s share a bed already and make sure
it's a purple so you guys have been
sleeping in garbage click now to start
your 100 nitrile of nocturnal bliss no
pressure it's purple action need proof
look laughs
see those are real eggs not hard-boiled
not plastic not wooden I just burst them
I love video games but more and more
people are moving away from the
television there's a lot of focus today
on the mobile and web platform it's
easier to develop games for those
platforms from the television cost a lot
of money you have to work with
established players in the space and
I've been trying to figure out how do we
get them back to it leah is a new game
console for the television that's built
on android open source technology it's
an inexpensive game console for gamers
all the games are free to try anybody
that want to develop the game for
television we allow them the ability to
do this I've been a part of the game
industry for a really long time in the
early days of gaming you could take your
apple 2e write your own programming and
take your game to market the console
business as it is today is completely
closed to the independent developer a
process overhead for console development
is really just too much for us there's a
lot of hurdles for developers to get
games onto the television developing is
extremely expensive I love the
television and I want those games on the
television we wanted to make a great
product I went out to find the best
people that can do it and that's even a
whore in the fuse project over the years
we've worked on a lot of projects that
take a certain technology and make it
available to too many I mean the
hundred-dollar laptop is one in a jam
box for example we like to use all the
different parts of design you know fuse
them together whether it's industrial
design
user experience the most important part
of this just is the controller we really
focus a lot on what gamers are looking
for precise controls tactility right
sizing what makes it we are different
and gives it the potential of changing
the gaming environment is are you able
to build things right from the start you
don't have to pay outrageous amounts of
money for a dev kit when you don't have
to have a lot of credentials just good
idea the more we have something like
this open console that can can break
that it's going to open it up for a new
business segment for the independent
developers since there's an
android-based we have a great 3d board
of canabalt funny embroid already that
would be really fun to see up on the TV
we have a prototype and it works we'll
have all the game genres you love
shooters platformer sports and RPGs will
have games for major game publishers and
in these two will have a full store
games all free to play minecraft is
gonna be on n twitch TV so you can watch
starcraft in League of Legends this is
the perfect hybrid that something that's
inexpensive it's open and it comes with
a fantastic controller open for hackers
let want to tweak the box and make it
their own this is a big undertaking
effectively we're trying to disrupt an
established industry it takes a lot of
guts and courage when I wasn't female I
say big balls we've raised money from
friends and family but it takes more
Kickstarter is a phenomenal place where
early ideas can get supported by those
people that are going to want to use it
and this product will not happen without
their support when we raise this money
it means that we have arrived that there
is a need for an open game console and
if there is support from gamers and
developers alike you're the signal to
the world that this is wanted
meet olo imagine being able to print 3d
objects directly from your smartphone
for under $100 olo is the first
smartphone powered 3d printer simple and
affordable olo uses the light from the
screen of your smartphone to print 3d

available for iOS Android and Windows
Phone creating 3d objects is as simple
as picking a design from all those easy
to use library or you can use any 3d
mobile app including 3d scanning to make
your own you can also choose designs

the light from the screen of your
