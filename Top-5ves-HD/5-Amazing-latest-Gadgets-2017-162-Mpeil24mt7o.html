I'm Michael from core electronics and
this is the desktop infinity era we were
compelled to create a kit that fuses
various methods of making and can be
assembled in an afternoon this is a
do-it-yourself kit you'll get to
assemble it run the wiring solve the
connections and learn to code at the
center of the kit is the particle photon
a clever little board that features
Wi-Fi connectivity and is easy to code
that means that once you've finished
assembling a desktop infinity mirror
it's really just the beginning we're
going to produce a series of tutorial
articles and videos that show you how to
remix your mirror however you like I'd
like to make something clear we've got
the laser color it's how I made this
prototype that means that all the laser
cutting and kidding is going to happen
right for you in Newcastle Australia we
have been in the maker industry for
years delivering make electronics to
your door and helping people with their
projects now with your support something
special is about to happen
we're going to build our own style of
educational kit that we know you'll love
as always if you have any questions we'd
love to hear from you in the comments
section below and to wrap up whether
you're a seasoned maker tech curious or
just looking for a unique educational
gift consider that illumines campaign
introducing Euclid a more accurate
measuring cup designed with thought and
purpose it is the first and only cup to
measure small amounts just as accurately
as large amounts improving your
measurements and helping your recipes
turn out right four years ago I was
baking in the kitchen and I started
wondering why doesn't seem better to
measure small amounts and small
measuring cups
why not enlarge ones as an engineer I
couldn't resist digging in it turns out
it's about accuracy those measurements
two lines in the bottom of a traditional
measuring cup just aren't going to be
very accurate I realized that the shape
of the cup is the problem and that
there's a math question around what
would be a better shape a math question
I got a little excited it took me about
four months but I finally solved the
math and then another year to develop
the first prototype and two years to
refine it into a manufacturing friendly
design but it's finally ready
the secret to Euclid's shape is that the
ratio of surface area to volume is the
same at every measurement amount it
turns out that ratio is what determines
how hard it is to measure accurately and
hence how accurate you are Euclid helps
every measurement be accurate not just
the ones to the top of the measuring cup
which is exactly what you want since
recipes are about ratios whether you
love cooking or love cool technology
join us and let's make this happen
meet yes the bike light with a big
vision for you and your city crammed
with technology yet surprisingly small
and light East delivers a whopping 125
lumens with a full 10 hours of runtime
our newly designed secure clip system
lets you mind it the way you want but
it's so much more than just a light this
uses patent-pending
C sense AI technology to learn your
unique writing style optimizing its
brightness and flash pattern for
improved visibility for every moment of
your ride reacting to roundabouts road
junctions filtering in traffic
approaching car headlights and more s
gives you space on the road yes has been
designed specifically for daylight
visibility
working with leading interaction
designers we have a brand new smartphone
app with custom flash patterns and smart
battery management you also access
unique stats on your I'd opt into the C
sense community and unlock automatically
loading and bike registration yes also
integrates with cycle computers using
and plus technology whatever way you use
it yes Auto connects to deliver a
hassle-free connected cycling experience
help your city plan space and
infrastructure for cycling by sharing
anonymized insights collected from your
rides connect this to gain free crash
detection alerts helping improve peace
of mind
yes has been shipped by the best of your
ideas and honed by leading design
experts whether you're joining us for
the first time or were welcoming you
