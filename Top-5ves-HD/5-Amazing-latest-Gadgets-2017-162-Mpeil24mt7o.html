I'm Michael from core electronics and
this is the desktop infinity era we were
compelled to create a kit that fuses
various methods of making and can be
assembled in an afternoon this is a
do-it-yourself kit you'll get to
assemble it run the wiring solve the
connections and learn to code at the
center of the kit is the particle photon
a clever little board that features
Wi-Fi connectivity and is easy to code
that means that once you've finished
assembling a desktop infinity mirror
it's really just the beginning we're
going to produce a series of tutorial
articles and videos that show you how to
remix your mirror however you like I'd
like to make something clear we've got
the laser color it's how I made this
prototype that means that all the laser
cutting and kidding is going to happen
right for you in Newcastle Australia we
have been in the maker industry for
years delivering make electronics to
your door and helping people with their
projects now with your support something
special is about to happen
we're going to build our own style of
educational kit that we know you'll love
as always if you have any questions we'd
love to hear from you in the comments
section below and to wrap up whether
you're a seasoned maker tech curious or
just looking for a unique educational
gift consider that illumines campaign
introducing Euclid a more accurate
measuring cup designed with thought and
purpose it is the first and only cup to
measure small amounts just as accurately
as large amounts improving your
measurements and helping your recipes
turn out right four years ago I was
baking in the kitchen and I started
wondering why doesn't seem better to
measure small amounts and small
measuring cups
why not enlarge ones as an engineer I
couldn't resist digging in it turns out
it's about accuracy those measurements
two lines in the bottom of a traditional
measuring cup just aren't going to be
very accurate I realized that the shape
of the cup is the problem and that
there's a math question around what
would be a better shape a math question
I got a little excited it took me about
four months but I finally solved the
math and then another year to develop
the first prototype and two years to
refine it into a manufacturing friendly
design but it's finally ready
the secret to Euclid's shape is that the
ratio of surface area to volume is the
same at every measurement amount it
turns out that ratio is what determines
how hard it is to measure accurately and
hence how accurate you are Euclid helps
every measurement be accurate not just
the ones to the top of the measuring cup
which is exactly what you want since
recipes are about ratios whether you
love cooking or love cool technology
