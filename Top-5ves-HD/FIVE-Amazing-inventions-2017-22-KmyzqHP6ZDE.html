whatever happened to the days in mobile
when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so we're sometimes
even considered wacky we needed to
design a device that was not only an
incredible phone but also an amazing
wearable I used to repair a lot of
phones I had cracked screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brands
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and betting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
and before you knew it before it was
born
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and where we needed to
build a team of incredible people with
the wide range of skill sets who are all
unified to pursue our mission and break
the mold of the mobile market the
problem with the mobile market right now
is that the phones are all the same and
what little differentiation they have is
that some are less user-friendly and
some are less durable things like this
still happen so we're here to change
that with the vibrant palates clean
typography and easy to understand icon
set the portal UI is experience it
cannot be missed why be stuck with the
same old design when you've got a new
refreshing interface to play with an
interface that hurts you interact that
knows what you want and works of you in
the way that you want it to work the
portal not only has all the features you
would expect such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC but also has a waterproof Kevlar
infuse polyurethane body a six inch
flexible display wireless charging and
unlock network and so much more
you
some of the biggest challenges of
starting a smart phone company are all
the licensing and government
certifications involved which you can
probably imagine is enormously expensive
all of us here at a rubix truly believe
that we can change the world with our
innovation even if you can't help back
us please help spread the word so we can
revolutionize the mobile industry sell
me this pencil a rebar cane we have
successfully identified and solved a
number of issues with existing pencils
it's a pleasure to introduce to you
Magna as design engineers is in our
nature to challenge and innovates
products we use every day other products
use a full release or incremental action
which dictates the lead position our
patent-pending magnetic propulsion
technology offers finite controllability
unlike other pencils the secret to our
revolutionary invention is concealed
within the court the pencil the outer
sleeve synchronizes position to the
inner magnet shielded within the premium
grade aluminium body it works like magic
every detail has been considered whilst
it may not be visible to the naked eye
the ends of the pencil are slightly
larger in diameter to prevent the sleeve
from falling off we have sourced our
manufacturers pay for tooling and have
received our final prototypes
so now we need your help to raise the
funds and hit a minimum order quantities
it really is the last piece of the
puzzle we want to make a dream a reality
and start shipping these fantastic new
products to your door we strongly
believe that making profits you've come
second to great design therefore we
price these pencils an extremely
affordable rate to make them accessible
to the wider kick-start community a
product with this level of consideration
really is a tool for life and perfect as
a gift for your family and friends so
now it's up to you to help us bring the
pencil into the 21st century thank you
for watching
you
there are moments in life that you never
want to forget when you take a picture
you know the place the people around you
the landscape and the details a couple
of days later and you will forget most
of it a couple of years later and you
probably can't even remember where the
photo was taken your memory is gone
wouldn't it be great to have a camera
that captures everything you experience
with your friends and family and that
lets you and your friends re experience
those moments later when you spend time
with your mates and loved ones wouldn't
it be great to be able to relive the
atmosphere of that day when someone you
love creates something great wouldn't it
be nice to discover things that you
hadn't even noticed when you took a
photo hi I'm yonas creator of the panono
camera a camera that can do exactly
these things it captures everything in
every direction all at once and it has a
super high resolution of 72 megapixels
it uses 36 tiny but powerful cameras
that fire all at once you just throw
them to the error and at the highest
point when it is barely moving captures
a fully spherical panoramic image
automatically to view the images you
simply point the smartphone or tablet in
the direction of the sea and move it
around it's amazing that's absolutely
you built the original prototype 2 years
ago back then it was called throwable
panoramic ball camera we put a video of
it on YouTube which was viewed nearly
three-and-a-half million times we got a
lot of great press coverage but most
importantly we got thousands of emails
from people wanting to buy the camera at
that time and in that form it was too
expensive for mass production so we sat
down to develop a new camera that is
small affordable and beautiful
you
we worked harder the new design we call
it the panono camera the camera is tough
so you can throw it in the air and even
drop it on occasion there are several
easy ways to use it firstly of course by
throwing it but you can also put it on
the stick and hold it in the air or
simply hold it in your hand and press a
button to make a picture all the
panoramic images in this video was shot
with our prototype
the new design will have the same
functionality but is much smaller and
tougher I was very much impressed by the
360 degree concept you catch the moment
with all the things around you now
everybody can discover the whole
situation I support a team to ensure a
seamless process from the original idea
to the finished serious product we have
a working prototype and a great new
design and with your help we can finish
the development and manufacture of the
camera by September support us and be
one of the first to own a Pernod no
camera download our app and check out
our panoramas and memories
