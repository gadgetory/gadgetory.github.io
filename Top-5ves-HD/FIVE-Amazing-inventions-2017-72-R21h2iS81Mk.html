end of the bar open the cap and adjust
the angle of the mirror to the right so
why do we need a rear view mirror danger
is everywhere whether you are racing or
just riding along the roadside check out
this short video clip

have been often and sometimes result in
fatal accidents so why Corky there are
already other rearview mirrors but some
are too big or ugly and are not even
that effective or easy to use here is
your answer compact functional and
sophisticated rear view mirrors Corky is

me I don't want to get out of the shower
why because I hate my towels these ones
don't really dry me anymore it's more
like spewing water around with moist
sand paper and these ones is fluffier
has fear once seemed to soak up a little
more water at first but then they stay
wet and start to smell musty which means
there's bacteria growing and maybe even
fungus of course you could avoid this by
washing and drying your towels every day
but who has time for that my search for
a better tell i found a staggering
number of options mostly just variations
of the same old tell so to cut through
the confusion i took a different
approach one that redefines what Italo
should be this is the owns in town
purposeful design to its core the waffle
weave is what makes it different
delivering a multi-layer feel it's
luscious and soft with an exfoliating
texture and tri's likes job depended on
it
having maximum surface area exposed
enables the towel to try itself faster
which is important because the trial is
a clean town this towel is great at
least as perceived by me and him and
then her and even him
showertime is a daily ritual for me it's
the first yeah even before coffee why do
I care so much about a towel well
because i'm sick of musty tells that
don't work properly and I know a few
people who share my frustration so this
is my solution and guess what trying off
never felt this good we've been able to
continue innovating and created
something new and exciting introducing
the awarded Naruto smart UV for your
phone the smart UV camera lets you see
into the UV light spectrum and reveals
amazing discoveries people all over the
world are reacting to this incredible
innovation from total shock and
excitement to being in awe or even a
little grossed out the smart EV captures
what lies beneath the skin so you can
see what it really looks like we've all
heard numerous times how important skin
care is but until it becomes real for
each of us we rarely do anything about
it if you could see your own skin and UV
light maybe you'd start making better
decisions for us this is what we call
seeing smart so we can be smart so how
does seeing smart actually work there's
more to life than what the human eye can
see when you look at the light spectrum
you see the visible light measures from
about 400 to 700 nanometers in
wavelength we call this visible light
because this is the only light humans
can see UV light sits next to it in the
spectrum between 200 and 400 nanometers
invisible to humans but interestingly
cats can see from the 300 nanometer band
up which means they have UV vision when
observing your skin visible light
bounces off the outer layer which is
what we see every day but because UV
light has a smaller wavelength it passes
through the outer layer and only bounces
off the second denser layer showing us
what lies beneath
that's what makes a smart UV so great it
not only lets you see in UV but also
lets you take a UV selfie the first of
its kind in the world now we're going to
look at how smart this device really is
it fits in your pocket connects via a
reversible USB connector has a photo and
video camera works by an app is iOS and
Android compatible and has the same lens
technology as professional UV cameras
we've made it really easy to use you
download the app on your smartphone and
attach the device to your phone check
that you have natural light or UV light
source then take a picture or video and
be amazed at what's been right in front
of your eyes this entire time what makes
us different than other UV cameras it
works with your smartphone giving you
access to a bigger screen it's much more
affordable than professional equipment
the camera orientation allows you to see
yourself you don't have to charge it
ever it makes your smartphone even
smarter and it uses your phone sharing
capabilities letting you share in real
time
seeing smart to be smart the smart UV
will help you keep track of your skin
like a skin diary so you can be aware of
your skin's aging process it also helps
you take proactive measures to prevent
further skin damage and it helps you
find uncovered spots when applying
sunscreen while we're talking sunscreen
did you know that high UV a factor
sunscreen and UV coated glasses block UV
light completely the result is that it
looks black when seen with a smart UV
how fascinating is that and now for the
best news we've already made and tested
our prototype and the results have blown
us away in fact all the UV footage in
this video was shot with an actual smart
UV prototype we've gathered people's
reactions from all over the world and
now we want to make it accessible to
everyone that's where you come in we
need your help your pledge will help pay
the manufacturing cost needed to
mass-produce and get the smart UV in the
hands of as many people as possible
we've completed the 3d designs of the
final production version doesn't it look
incredible and we've even added a robust
phone connector to the slick design now
if you're excited about what the smart
UV can show you about your skin just
imagine what it can reveal about the
rest of the world more about that in our
stretch goals pledge now and help the
world see in UV
