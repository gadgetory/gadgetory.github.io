noon but this is not about cheese
in sports you want to leave as little as
possible to chance you want to optimize
the way you train the way you will
regenerate the way you eat the way you
drink and drinking has a massive effect
on your performance so why do we settle
for water that tastes paths contaminated
by a plastic bubble now a metal bottle
or a glass bottle might give you a
better taste but it's too heavy it's too
much of a distraction when you have to
unscrew it it slows you down you want to
keep your pace right keep your focus
also you see it I'm a team player and in
every good team you share your bottle
but then it's very important you can
have contactless drinking for hygienic
reasons so you want to squeeze the
bottle to push the water out Alvarez is
amazing equipment
everything's high-tech but then we bring
from the cheap plastic bottles our water
deserves better we deserve better many
told me it's not possible but I kept
going looking for the right technology
looking for the right people and here we
are the world's first squeezable metal
bottle Kegel poor in Switzerland
designed in Vienna produced in Denmark
and that's where the magic happens
a groundbreaking layering process makes
it possible to create a titanium that's
super light extremely durable and most

process is also renowned for producing
