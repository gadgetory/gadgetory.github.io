little companion he watches me carefully
following my every command he's always
waiting for me to take him outside
he loves to travel with me he's always
curious to see what's around the next
corner and thanks to him my travels make
much more sense meets turtle my
four-wheeled friend
and me TAS we're a team of both
engineers and travelers for some time we
thought about a solution that could help
people just like us develop their
passion of creating and let them easily
share all the adventures with friends
and that's how the idea of turtle was
born turtle is the world's first earth
rover a remote control open-source
platform capable of working in harsh
terrain turtle is the ideal travel
companion
helping you to rediscover this beautiful
planet in real-time allowing you to
reach new and unseen places with the
design inspired by NASA turtle easily
overcomes all terrain obstacles made of
strong aerospace grade materials turtle
drives slowly and steadily making it a
super stable and reliable mobile
platform driving turtle is just like
playing a video game but in real life
the only device you need to control the
rover is your smartphone or tablet if
something strikes your eye snap a
picture or record videos whenever you
like then share them with your friends
one Rover provides infinite
possibilities if you want to upgrade it
add more cameras or sensors no problem
thanks to turtles multiple waterproof
slots and open source software you can
add whatever you want to give you an
example we've included a robotic arm in
the price of the rover kit exclusively
for you our Kickstarter family turtle
can be used in both professional and
personal scenarios inside the case
there's a special watertight compartment
for your own electronics waterproof
connectors in an upper mounting plate
allow you to mount just about any type
of equipment on your rover turtle is
waterproof easy to transport and can be
driven for up to four hours all turtles
features were designed with the greatest
care by us a group of people who like to
create stuff we made turtle to be a
reliable open platform that you can
adapt to your own needs
the only real limit is your imagination
Planet computers we are passionate about
typing writing being productive creating
on-the-go since the introduction of
touchscreen mobile phones and tablets we
feel that it is very difficult to type
on these types of devices we decided to
reinvent the palm sized keyboard mobile
device that will benefit many who miss
using the keyboard on the move from
ryoga's and creatives that need to
constantly write professionals who need
to read and write email create and edit
documents and spreadsheets hi I'm Martin
really fit I'm a founder of the air 4
which is a london-based design
consultancy and we in the past have made
a reputation from designing a lot of
handheld electronic equipments including
scion PDAs in PDAs
our personal digital assistants
bizarrely they've sort of dropped out of
fashion we have always been strong
proponents for this kind of device we
feel it's time to bring it to the market
again because so many people they say
why isn't there a product like this now
planet computers introduces the Gemini a
modern clamshell based mobile device
with a palm-sized keyboard fully
integrated into the device it's sleek
metal clamshell design both protects the
device and beautifully tucks away the
palm-sized QWERTY keyboard and screen
when closed it fits into a pocket
roughly the same as today's mobile phone
when open the innovative clamshell also
acts as a support of the device the
ultra wide 5.7 inch high-res Dutch
screen provides ample space for creating
on the go the full tactile keyboard is
recognized as the world's smallest
keyboard four finger touch typing Gemini
has a powerful 10 core processor a
graphics coprocessor and 64 gigabytes of
storage it is fully equipped with 4G
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabling both data
communications and mobile phone calls it
is designed to run the latest Android OS
and all your favorite apps as well as
Linux with a dual boot option all below
400 grams of weight the double sized
battery provides two week standby and 12
hours talktime
Gemini allows you to work in restricted
spaces comfortably on planes on trains
in coffee bars you can also hold the
device and use it with ease whilst in
the car standing up or on the bus I hope
you're interested in what we're trying
to do we think it's going to be a great
device how many times have you been
outside the waist we could call along
but lucky for you

we serve together in the rings and now
