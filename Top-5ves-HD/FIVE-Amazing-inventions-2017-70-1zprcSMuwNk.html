move me shake me run chills up my back
make me remember the butterflies the
downs and the hives
let me hear and make me feel but do you
really know the feeling of sound we want
you to know to finally feel and that is
why we created flex at once multi my
name is Mary and I'm the CEO of flex on
systems
we've invented a completely new way of
experiencing sound taking you beyond
just hearing alone in feeling it
physically as per our flex sound who
will help you to feel sound a music on
your skin and body like never before
Center we've only been listening to
sound the tools and devices have evolved
and Sounders become unavailable but it
is still just audio but we know there's
so much more to sound see sound is not
just a hearing sensation
it's full of crumbles rolls and
vibrations it's a library or human
nuances that you could actually
physically feel it is why we love those
deep sensations at the movie theater all
the power of the sound of nature or the
feel of someone's voice against your
skin when you are close flex sound homo
is a smart cushion that simultaneously
creates great sound in production and
physical distributed vibration from the
same source this means that as you hear
audio room you'll feel it
with your skin and body unlike loved
speakers that radiate vibration into air
almost element radiates vibration
through fall providing a source near
field listening experience such a
multi-sensory experience
enhances emotions created by the content
I enjoy poor thoughts for human music we
Affleck some want you to enjoy your
favorite entertainment to its fullest
whether you love music movies gaming or
connecting with a loved one far away
homo adds a whole new dimension the
sense of touch and that makes all the
difference or is the second product
reflects our systems and the world's
first ever consumer device with the
fields of Technology
we are from one of the world's leading
design and tech countries Finland we
have poured our years of expertise from
different fields and whom and are very
very proud of it always the fully
finished product ready for immediate
mass production with our trusted
contract manufacturer and all we need
now is your support to be able to start
production when it backups now you will
but first in the world to get the hoop
which will stop shipping already by the
end of February when all your app for
mobile games
us now and finally stop feelings down
from all of us as flex out
this was me every time I went out to the
beach with my family
we can all relate having to carry a
mountain of items across the sand that
was one of the situations that got me
thinking of a multi-purpose carrier to
help make our lives a little bit easier
that is why I invented the ear over the
ear over is a lightweight transformable
adaptable carrier designed to replace
all those job specific carriers that
have saturated the market today
I designed the ear over to consolidate
all your carriers into one package with
just a few simple and intuitive
adjustments the ear over simply and
quickly transforms from one form into
another and another
and another
with a sophisticated design to fit your
lifestyle and thoughtful engineering
that provides strength and durability
the e Rover is built to look good be
versatile and work hard stand it up in
any closet or slide it underneath your
bed light enough to pick up and pack in
the trunk of your car
I created the earth Rover so it can
assist you and I in everyday life
adventure
now you can load your cooler tackle box
and fishing rods all in the ear over
making the walk to the pier easier and
stress-free so you can focus on the
things that really matter
for the weekend warriors you'll likely
find yourselves buying supplies and
materials for your home projects getting
those bulky items from your truck into
your house condo or apartment is always
a burden at least it used to be
and since our family enjoys having
picnics and bike rides
now we can load and go with the ear over
so no time is wasted we make less trips
and have more fun we have been working
for more than two years developing ear
over and getting it ready for production
our engineers have worked tirelessly to
bring this unique and functional product
to life help us take it over to the next
level by contributing to our campaign
and we will do our part in making sure
you have an ear over of your own thank
you for your support
