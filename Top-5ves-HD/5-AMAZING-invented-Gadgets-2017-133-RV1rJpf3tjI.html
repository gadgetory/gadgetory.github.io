used to climb the highest mountains in
search of the freshest air
with wind she doesn't have to anymore
wind is the world's first personal air
quality system that generates fresh and
clean air that's portable and is simple
to use its built-in sensor monitors the
air quality around Lily and adjust its
power to filter more or less wind helps
Lily keep the air around her clean and
fresh even when she's traveling wind
works by creating a bubble of healthy
air around it dirty air is drawn in by
vents pulled through a medical-grade air
filter and clean air is propelled out of
the top wind can filter things like
allergens dust pet dander smoke pretty
much anything except that Lily can
adjust the amount of clean air wind
releases by simply twisting the wind app
allows Lily to check the quality of the
air around her gain insight about the
air she's filtered and check the air
quality of her friends and family Wynne
knows when Lily's filter is used up and
can automatically ship a replacement
filter to her home and the air quality
tracker can even detach to keep Lily
aware of the air she's breathing while
she's on the go wind blends seamlessly
into Lily's life allowing her to breathe
easy no matter where life takes her
