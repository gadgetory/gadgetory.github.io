always want to make it more comfortable
Pleasant and convenient today we are
going to share six amazing ideas that
will make your home a true dreamland so
stay tuned
number six is stainless steel waterfall
place man-made waterfall on the selected
area and mark the four holes for
accurate and strong base construction
use a premade plate and adjust the plate
according to the marked holes now draw a
square following the inner lines make
the four before proceeding further
evolve a PTFE tape around the water
suction pipe then fix the pipe at the
bottom of the waterfall if you find the
tale unnecessary longer cut it down with
a lightweight hacksaw fasten the sink
pipe with a hose clip
now the suction pipe is ready to work so
we can fix the waterfall place it on the
marked surface these four inches long
bolt and tighten it next part is water
suction pump placement take a hose clip
and attach the end of the pipe to the
pump carefully sink it into the pond and
your home waterfall is ready to flow
number five led stairs illumination the
process initiates with profile
installation then solder the power cable
with LED now place LED into the profile
and press gently to protect the LED from
any damages it is better to cover it
here are the staircases ready to light
up your path automated illumination
saves electricity and time
number four trampoline installation
first mark radius of 12 feet remove the
upper part of the land that consists of
grass and wet soil clean the edges of
the radius with the little help of a
shovel deep in the pit equal to the
height of trampoline to allow the air to
let go when bounced on join all pipes
properly to frame the trampoline
structure
once the top and bottom are ready and
fixed cover outer edge so that soil and
dust can't go in now the frame is ready
to be installed if you find empty space
at the outer edge fill it with sand and
pour some water to level the surface
join the jumping mat to the frame with
Springs here it is your trampoline ready
to go number three MC heat the outdoor
shower made of Kampala wood gives you a
cool shower experience with its unique
mechanism just connect the water pipe
turn on the tap and take your place on
the board the nearly invisible water
jets that made of stainless steel clean
the body whenever the top is pressurized
the gentle sprinkles make you feel
fresher and calm the regulator near your
foot let you control the pressure the
easy installation process requires only
one minute number two Sodom AK American
kitchen clean the surface remove dust
and other micro components begin
installation with fixing you profiles
the holes would be in a zigzag form copy
the holes in ground and drill use nail
plugs to fix the u profiles with the
floor
fix the you profile to the ceiling with
an anchor bolt it will hold profiles for
a longer period
the area of the in will be made of four
feet each foot is 82 centimeters long
put to see profiles at the center so
that can be used as well-placed support
use two side-by-side profiles to frame a
closed see
once you're done at the bottom follow
the same structure at the ceiling to
hear the base framing is done we require
15 millimeter cardboard for inner
structure and 10 millimeter for outer
apply primer on cardboard for better
bonding to paint later to fix a wooden
panel screw for angles that will provide
better stability
finally hide the open corner at bottom
and top by applying dust covers and here
it is number one is his skewer do scale
proper length and width for installing
water bubble panels fix 10 to 12 panel
holder at a distance of 1.5 feet take a
black bubble paper and staple to the
wall if the panel holders are fixed
properly placing the bubble panel will
go easy if you find any trouble check
the holders to join the panel screw some
clips where the ends meet now one by one
fill all empty bubble sheets the panels
are interconnected so no need to fill
every panel just fill the middle one to
start the bubble flow turn the tap on
from the bottom finally cover all
outside edges and the joint set your
choice of color from a small remote
control give your office and home
Pleasant and cool look the world is
undergoing enormous changes and there is
an infinite list of fabulous high-tech
constructions we are working on them and
