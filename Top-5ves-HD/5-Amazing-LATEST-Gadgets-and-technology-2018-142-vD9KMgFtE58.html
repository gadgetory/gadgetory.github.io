foo and we are ready on every

project
introducing allow a 24 millimeter probe
lens the weirdest but most creative in
revolutionary macro tool ever
traditional macro lenses in the market
tend to have a long focal length varying
from 60 to 100 millimetres or even
longer the subject filled most of the
frame and is isolated from the
surrounding environment our new lava
probe however allows you to focus really
close showing a great amount of the
details and texture of your subject at
the same time you can enjoy a compelling
wide angle of view so that more of your
background can be included into your
shots for the first time ever you can
easily create a compelling and unique
bug eye perspective style and no other
lenses can compare to the wide-angle
design also means you get much more
depth of field than a telephoto macro
lens when focusing at close distances
you can start including the habitats or
environment of the subject into your
composition since more of your shot will
be in focus your image can instantly
become very informative and appealing as
macro photographers ourselves we usually
face a problem of not being able to
shoot smaller subjects with our allow a
probe you can now take advantage of the
two-two-one maximum magnification to
reveal details that cannot be seen by
the naked eye the focus range covers all
the way from to toe and macro to
infinity which adds extra convenience to
video shooting
thanks to the 40 centimeter long barrel
you can now shoot really close to your
subject but keep yourself and your
camera away this allows you to reach
bugs hidden in bushes or capture lethal
animals with ease
macro photography has never been easier
the tiny two centimeter lens tip unlocks
endless shooting possibilities you can
now get close to areas nobody ever has
before
and show you some epic macro photos and
video footage you think this is cool
enough think again in order to bring you
an even more exciting perspective we've
made the front barrel of the lava probe
waterproof and dustproof this removes
your last shooting barrier and you can
literally put it anywhere to shoot it's
our job to help remove the limitations
of your shooting and now it's your time
to get the creative juices flowing okay
you may wonder how can I get enough
light to focus in a burroughs or in a
cave that's already taken care of an LED
ring light is mounted at the tip of our
probe and you'll find it tremendously
useful and video shooting or for focus
assistance this is not just another lens
with a long tube this is actually a lens
with one of the most complicated optic
designs ever
it houses 27 elements spreading across
the entire barrel to deliver an
exceptional image performance this
flower 24 millimeter f-14 probe lens is
the world's first consumer grade probe
lens that provides both professional
photographers and videographers with a
completely new perspective to unleash
their creativity this lens also
redefines macro photography for wildlife
photographers to capture natural wonders
this lens is for everyone who enjoys
exploring new types of photography it's
for shooting anywhere and for any type
of shooting
it's you who have supported Lauer lenses
this far and it's you who kept pushing
us across the boundaries of optical
design and creating lenses with unique
capabilities are you still measuring in
risky situations do you still need
someone to help you measure lengthy
distances how do you measure objects
that cannot be measured by the ordinary
tape measure here is a new way of
measuring introducing accion para para
is a two laser measure with smartphone
application and Bluetooth connection for
better easier and safer user experience
the angle encoder coupled with the two
laser measures enables Pythagorean
calculations perras bluetooth technology
enables users to keep track of their
measurements you can quickly and easily
measure long distances with just a press
of a button without anyone's help you
can conveniently view measured data on
the display screen para can measure up
to 180 degrees all distances can be
simply measured from one stationary
position para is perfectly designed to
be easily and quickly found in any field
of work para eliminates risky and
dangerous measurement situations it can
be used by anyone in any situation
regardless of age gender or experience
it can also be used with one hand saving
you your precious time and energy by
using Pythagorean functions even the
height of tall buildings can be easily
measured planning on making changes to
your space use para to find out the
dimensions para is a complete system
that can always provide precise and
reliable measurements para can be
attached to a tripod to fully utilize
our smartphone application when you take
a picture with our app it instantly
triggers the measure button and keeps
track of both the picture and the data
on your smartphone simultaneously you
can then draw on the picture to remember
exactly what you have measured by
knowing all the precise measurements you
won't have any trouble redesigning your
space para is versatile it can be used
in various fields it can even be used to
measure you para can be used by experts
as well as people who are unfamiliar
with measuring para is specifically
designed to be dust proof making it
reliable and any work environment you
can measure curves by simply rolling
Park you can also measure all kinds of
irregular shaped objects with just one
hand
para has a built in rechargeable battery
that can run for over 14 hours para has
a targeting feature that alerts when it
reaches the distance you've sent set the
distance and then extend para and the
beep sound will tell you that you've
reached the set distance this can be
useful for tasks that require constant
spacing like setting up picture frame
difficult measurements are now easy with
para
take para with you anywhere you go
