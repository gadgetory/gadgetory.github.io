you
you
you
hi my name is Arthur Wu and I'm the
founder of radix products and I want to
show you something I designed called the
radix one Riddick's one is a slim wallet
that replaces large bulky and cumbersome
Wallace I had always carried a thick
wallet in my back pocket and never
thought it was a problem I've also
always suffer from lower back pain
during a visit to the chiropractor I was
told that having a big fat wallet in my
back pocket was contributing to a tilt
of my pelvis causing me to lean more on
one side than the other this was a
contributor to my back pain moving my
wallet to the front pocket belt but now
had a giant uncomfortable wallet in my
front pocket this led me on my quest for
a slim wallet the design is fairly
simple the silicone van wraps around two
polycarbonate parts sandwich credit
cards and ID's in the middle the band
also acts as a money clip and holds cash
on the outside the wallet is designed to
hold four to ten cards comfortably
having a silicone band means that the
wallet will keep its tension and not
stretch out over time having parts that
are injection molded and compression
molded means I can lower the price to
increase the value for customers there
have been many iterations of design and
I'm confident that we have a great
product on our hands I've gotten the
business off the ground and I'm starting
to invest in tooling but I need support
from the Kickstarter community to help
with the cost of materials and parts I
hope to raise $6,000 so I can get this
product in your hand
if you contribute to this Kickstarter
campaign you can have your choice of
white black or clear radix ones thank
you for watching this video please
consider supporting my project
