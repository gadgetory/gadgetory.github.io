outdoors the wild because it is nature
is not tamed a river does not ask where
to flow
to cope in nature's unpredictable
conditions you need the best gear with
you
this is calm bar the only heavy-duty
multi-tool that combines the core tools
needed for the outdoors in ax a hammer
and a spade along with dedicated room in
the handle for a magazine or comm bars
knife and saw all tools fold into a
rapid activation system that weighs only
3.2 pounds as former officers and the
IDF Special Forces and about outdoorsmen
we know that the only way to execute a
successful operation is by sweating the
details
cutting absolutely no corners and
planning for every possible outcome we
applied the exact same logic when
creating calm our our first goal was to
make a tool with a lifetime warranty the
starting point was to ensure that each
tool was developed according to US
military spec standards but since no
such combined tool exists there are no
standards for it so we created a new
standard we put comm bar under heavy
loads and smashed walks with it we left
it in water for a week in Port stand
into every opening after every torture
test we double check that each tool was
still fully functional and locked
securely in place making sure safety
mechanisms are up to the challenge the
only way to create a life lasting tool
is to use live blasting materials comm
bars main body is made of aircraft-grade
aluminum a hammer is stainless steel the
Spade is made of a single piece of
titanium and the axe combines both
titanium and stainless steel through
naval sharpening the different parts are
meticulously fused together to a single
sturdy unit can outperform any task to
provide a great grip while using these
tools VI ergonomically designed and well
balanced handle completes calm bar into
a tool that feels perfect in your hand
inside the handle there's room for calm
bars knife made of stainless steel and
crafted as a top survival knife next to
it is a place where the saw made of
aircraft aluminum and polymer with a
blade replacement mechanism for full
flexibility to carry combi we created a
holster and a case designed for
durability and rapid activation because
nature doesn't wait for you to find your
gear we've been developing comm bar for
three and a half years to make sure it
comes out perfect light sturdy iconic
wherever you go with it and whatever you
do with it
comm bar is the perfect heavy-duty
outdoor multi-tool whether you're an
off-roader an avid outdoorsman casual
camper or a hardcore survivalist comm
bar will become an inherent part of your
travels get one and be ready for
whatever comes your way
I'm the inventor of smart Bunch
a brand new product that combines my
life passion for design and my love for
technology our first product the smart
bunch light is a mix between a light
bulb and the light fitting combining
both functionality and beauty in one
product it is the ultimate user centered
system changing the size shape and use
according to your very own needs smart
bunch light is the world's first modular
light bulb it is made with either
battery or mains powered beautifully
designed led triangles connected
together magnetically and powered by
pure touch you have a lighting product
that can be used on a desk side or a
pendant from the ceiling and key within
that is different people have different
uses of the product we really are
passionate about this product and we
know that it's going to bring a lot of
creativity to households and there's a
lot of new products coming on the back
of it from a business perspective this
is just the start of things and there's
going to be so much more that we can add
to this over time and that becomes
really attractive what excites me most
about smart lunch is the scalability on
the products and the massive opportunity
to customize it I truly believe that
this is a brand that doesn't exist on
the market and I'm very excited to see
where it involves even further the most
important fact about smart Bunch is that
it's not just a lighting product it is
actually a system for all of your smart
home devices

smartphone speaker and the camera
controlled by a smart lunch app what
we're really excited to be able to come
onto the crowdfunding platform because
actually giving people the opportunity
to really see the product and hold it
and be as excited in the real world as
we are is a great opportunity and we
believe that as soon as people have that
experience seeing smart bunch light in
its first iteration you will understand

to create a product that will empower
you to be in control of design and
technology in your life whilst having
