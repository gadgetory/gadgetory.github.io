founder of plx devices six years ago we
introduced the Kiwi the world's first
obd2 to smartphone interface this
wireless adapter allowed drivers to
easily communicate with their engine and
the world took notice
Kiwi earned Popular Mechanics Editors
Choice Award seamless best new mobile
electronics accessory and customers gave
Kiwi four and a half stars on Amazon
we're now excited to announce Kiwi 3 the
best obd2 - smart device interface yet
the Kiwi 3 allows you to check and reset
engine trouble codes see real time
gauges measure power torque fuel
efficiency have a trip computer GPS
mapping with data overlay data log and
more huge a scintillating and easy to
use it works with any vehicle
manufactured since 1996 when making Kiwi
see this one - simply plug into your
car's obd-ii port and watch your
favorite our Kiwi that very qe3 has been
completely reengineering it's up to four
times faster uses much less power
employs the latest wireless technology
Kiwi 3 is the smallest most discreet
obd2 adapter yet simply set and forget
mobile technologies come a long way
since we first released the Kiwi in 2009
Kiwi 3 will be the first of its kind of
a truly cross-platform compatible device
working seamlessly with both Apple and
Android devices including smartwatches
we designed Kiwi 3 to be very developer
friendly and we are excited to see what
kind of new capabilities are leashed by
this technology my name is Rob fuller
I'm the owner operator of Z car garage
in San Jose California
I think that the Kiwi 3 is great because
it puts knowledge and information into
the hands of the end user it's almost a
go-between between the owner the car and
his
can between myself my wife and my kids I
have four cars that I need to maintain
the qe3 gives me a power information in
my own hands whether I take the car to a
mechanic or do the job myself
least I'll know if it's a $50 job or a
$5,000 job whether you're a professional
using obd in a shop or trying to get
answers in your home's garage key we
three is the best way to communicate
directly with your engine thank you so
much for taking the time today to watch
our video we've loved developing this
technology we've just completed product
development and we're now ready to kick
off production donate today to be the
first to have this innovative product
pay well below retail price and have the
satisfaction of knowing that you've
contributed to bringing the future
hi we're the founders of machina I'm
Earl and this is Josh and we founded
machina for tired because we are tired
when we started out we were buying parts
and both in them on eventually this got
boring because we didn't actually
understand what was going on at least
with mechanical things you can see them
working but as soon as you had
electronics you can't see it you have to
either trust whoever made it or become a
Carter we want you to stop just bolting
things on start understanding and
creating that's why we build Mike here
Makena lets you into the inner workings
of your car it's kind of like routing or
jailbreaking your phone once you're in
the possibilities are endless water cars
are controlled by a system of computers
passing information back and forth
here's what it looks like when your car
is running somewhere in this mass of
data is the engines RPM and gear
selection if we want to create a shift
light all you need to do is isolate
those pieces of information and program
machina to tell us when to ship machina
not only listens to your car but it can
talk to it too
let's say you want to unlock it from a
mile away
why can't I can do that but kena can
also do more complicated things like
retune your entire ECU for a new fuel
type the question really shouldn't be
what can my Akina do it should be what
are you willing to learn how to do
machina works with most minor cards
machina is inexpensive compact easy to
learn flexible to your situation
wirelessly connect a bowl and most
importantly open source at its core
machina is an interface that connects to
your car to the obd2 port or a wired
connection using every common protocol
Martina's interface made easily to our
processor board which is based on
arduino making it easy to work with
whether you're a beginner or a pro
there's something for you to build and
create machina
lets you give back to the original
intention of already make it better make
it fun make it yours you can do this and
you don't have to do it alone in fact
there's an entire community of people
who love cards and understand technology
check out the page below
more information
you
Oh
hello hello again empty fastest route
found - early bird cafe
you and me we're busy people and being
busy means checking your phone even when
you're not supposed to even when you're
on the road but now there's Navi hold on
we gotta get this KC talk to me hey Adam
quick reminder first thing today about
coffee with Connie and Greg got the
early bird early on my way
see what's brilliant about NAB D is this
faster route phone automatically
rerouting to save ten minutes perfect
never been this way before I'm gonna
switch to Navi - see what's so brilliant
about navdy is its display is focused in
the distance so your eyes are never off
the road it's also 40 times brighter
than your smartphone and it dims
automatically so it's easy to see day or
night
in fact sorry gotta take this one - Greg
and I actually want to do Roy's cafe out
on 60 - smiley face Oh awesome
luckily Royce is one of my favorites
navdy uses Google Maps and built-in
offline maps so you'll never get lost
like out here in the desert and it's
connected to your car which means that
gas rerouting - nearest gas station text
Connie be there in 15
