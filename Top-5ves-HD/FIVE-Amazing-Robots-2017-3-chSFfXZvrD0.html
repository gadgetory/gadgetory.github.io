distracted easily parents are always
concerned about how to best communicate
with their kids as education experts say
it is crucial for parents to help kids
form good habits in this stage now we
have honey bot the first educational
family robot designed especially for
young kids distinguishing from other
similar products we have integrated AR
technology into interactive activities
for example kids can draw a picture and
then honey bot will recognize the object
and turn it into animation with
educational explanation and music we
have also prepared many flashcards of
diverse objects with AR technology kids
can show the flashcards - honey bot and
honey bot will display the objects on
the screen in 3d form with explanation
to help kids learn and memorize honey
BOTS habit-forming system was designed
to help parents guide their kids to
develop good habits easily kids can keep
a virtual pet with honey bots like a
real pet you will get hungry dirty and
tired as the pet owners the kids will
need to feed it give it bats and put it
to bed according to different scenes
from such interactions kids will be able
to gradually build good habits
besides it's educating function
honey bot is also designed to help
communication between parents and kids
be more fun and effective parents can
use the voice changing function with
smart phones and send a voice message to
honey pot honey Bob will then play the
message to kids with the funny voice
even when parents are miles away they
can video call their kids and talk to
them face to face
we hope that honey bot becomes the angel
of your home by providing good company
for your kids helping you and your kids
bond and helping kids gain knowledge and
develop good habits considering the
safety issues we only use the safest and
most environmental friendly materials to
make honey buck and we made it into more
of a round shape without sharp angles we
have already finished our MD and small
batch production now we need your help
and support to mass produce honey bot
please support us and make honey bot
into reality in today's hectic world
it's getting increasingly difficult to
remember what truly matters the health
of you and your loved ones but now
someone can help with his artificial
intelligence pillow recognizes each and
every member of your family and starts

healthcare professionals entrepreneurs
and robotics experts with years of
experience in the field and we have what
it takes to make pillow a reality we now
ask you to join us as we enter the next
exciting phase of bringing our prototype
to production
together we can revenge the future of
personal health thank you guys thank you
pillow
hello Internet my name is Kevin King
founder of plumb geek I'm here today to
introduce Ringo Ringo is a palm-sized
robot based on the Arduino Uno he's
perfect for any robotics enthusiast the
wide range of smarts and sensors we've
included will challenge and entertaining
even the most advanced programmers yet
he's still a perfect fit for anyone
taking their first steps into robotics
or programming Ringo ships with 10
interesting behaviors pre-loaded so you
can start having fun as soon as you open
the box you can activate and control the
behaviors with the included remote
control the light chase here ringo uses
the three light sensors to track and
follow the light the pretty blow is
coming from the two lights on his
underside you can make these any colors
you want the line follow here he's using
the edge sensors under his feelers to
see the line his eye flashes green when
the sensor on that side sees the line
the finger nipper here he's using his
accelerometer and determining which
direction he's pushed from then he
attacks in that direction the stair
debug similar example but he runs the
opposite direction when disturbed in
this example the gyroscope is used to
keep Ringo pointed a specific direction
even when disturbs winding up like a
clock and let him go he returns to the
starting position
pretty cool huh after you learn how the
sensors work with the preloaded examples
you can customize them with your own
personal touch by editing are easy to
understand example code this is a great
way to learn the basic structure of how
a program works and to move towards more
advanced skills you can make him come to
life like he has a real personality he
drives around using a pair of pager
motors the tips of the motors make
contact the surface on either side both
motors can run in either direction and
at variable speed
this makes him very maneuverable Ringo
can determine where he is how he's
moving and where he's pointing thanks to
an onboard accelerometer and gyroscope
he can be programmed to use these
sensors to go in straight lines and to
travel specific distances this control
loop can be made a bit sloppy on purpose
which results in a characteristic buggy
swagger no swag a bit of swag
lots of swag it's as easy as changing a
variable in your code you can show you
how he's feeling with six RGB LEDs these
are the same lights used in neopixel
products from Adafruit each can be made
to show any color you can think of and
they can be controlled individually
Ringo can see light from 360 degrees
using three sensors he can determine the
direction of light and shadows there's
sensors under the feelers that can be
used to follow a line sense edges and
avoid jumping off your table thanks to
an on-board TV remote control receiver
you can trigger and control behaviors
with the remote or teach him to respond
to just about any other TV remote
he has three infrared light sources
pointed 120 degrees apart which can be
used to communicate with other Ringo
BOTS appliances like your TV or use
together with the light sensors to sense
objects or movement nearby the
easy-to-use communication features of
Ringo make it possible to create
behaviors where many robots interact
look they're playing tag to give Ringo a
voice we've included a piezo sound
element it can be used to emit any
variety of buggy chirp zips and pings
you can think of it can also be used to
play musical notes the robot is powered
from a single rechargeable lithium
battery because he'll eventually get
tired and need a recharge we've included
a complete automatic charging system
right onboard to get the code between
your computer and the Ringo robot you'll
use our programming adapter this
programming adapter plugs into your
computer's USB on one ends and ring goes
programming port on the other in
addition to programming the adapter
provides power to charge up your Ringo
without removing its battery it also
allows the use of the Arduino serial
print functions to debug your bug about
a year ago I taught my son how to write
an Arduino program to control an RGB LED
I'll never forget the moment when he
realized he could control the blink rate
and the colors just by editing the code
he pushed me off the keyboard then spent
hours writing new blink sequences this
inspired my daughter who asked me how to
program robot
this is where the idea for ringo was
born the kids have been a part of the
design process from the start they would
love to share ringo with the world as
our community grows you'll be able to
visit us online and interact with others
learn tips and tricks to customize your
own box then share your robots
personality with the group we'll create
a library of our favorites which can be
downloaded and further personalized by
others in the group we've already
written software that can be easily used
as building blocks and creating your own
behaviors ringo is just the first of
several robot designs we plan to release
as we grow we pledge to continue in the
spirit of the open source movement to
share and to freely educate
meet I doe your friendly home robot
I don't can do just about anything
I do is an entertainment and learning
hub
an interactive personal assistant
your home manager
he is perfect in every way
