using a paste wax this particular
product says to use small overlapping
strokes to ensure even coverage that's
what you want to start with about a
dollar size nice even application
strokes light firm pressure about three
to five pounds is all you really need
and you can see this goes on
effortlessly you want to do about a two
foot by two foot section sometimes the
hood is a little bit of an exception
because it's larger but I'm just gonna
split it in half like you can see and
just a little bit more to finish this
out here now the three or five minutes
have passed you can see that the wax is
dried to a dull hazy look this is your
signal to take it off
we recommend using high quality
microfiber towels you're just go on and
do light wipes no hard rubbing no hard
buffing again you're gonna want to use
about three to five pounds of pressure
by using the first side you can take off
the excess or the bulk of the material
leaving the fresh side to buff to a high
shine when you start to get a little bit
of a drag on the towel that'll be your
signal that it's starting to get clogged
up with product and it's time to flip it
over now we're going to go back and buff
it to that high shine it feels real nice
and easy
it feels real slick nice and smooth
feels just like a dream
