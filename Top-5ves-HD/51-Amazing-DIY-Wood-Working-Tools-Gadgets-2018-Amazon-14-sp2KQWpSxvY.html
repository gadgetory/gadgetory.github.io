its place for tight tolerance joinery
layout you just can't beat that crisp
cut but let's face it there are times in
the shop when an accurately drawn pencil
mark is even better
introducing the approved woodpeckers
marking gauge and pal marking gauge both
ingeniously designed with an integrated
mechanical pencil so now you can make
either hairline cuts or easily readable
pencil marks with dead-on accuracy
machine from aircraft grade aluminum
these upgraded marking pages are built
to last and enable greater control and
more precise marketing and by using the
optional spacers and second marking
wheel you can lay down dual scribe lines
in sixteenth inch increments from eight
inch to 1/2 inch all-in-one paths
the large neural locking knob features a
built-in hex wrench to tighten or loosen
the wheel cutter and spacers and you can
conveniently keep all of the extra
components inside the tool and now
included with the metric gauges are
metric scribe wheel spacers ideal for
scribing both order shoulders
simultaneously when using a Festool
Domino the anodized aluminum bar has two
precision laser engraved 32nd inch or
metric scales one for the wheel marker
and one for the pencil marker the bar
itself is three quarters of an inch in
diameter giving you a solid grip on the
tool
the new-and-improved marking gauge and
panel marking gauge from woodpeckers
precision built in the USA for fine
woodworkers
whether you're refreshing your existing
cabinets adding hardware to new ones or
you're building a project from scratch
the cabinet hardware jig from Craig
makes adding knobs and pulls incredibly
easy the cabinet hardware jig takes all
of the guesswork out of the process
giving you the confidence to add the
finishing touch to doors and drawers
without worrying about the mistakes that
can come from having to measure and mark
every time or rely on flimsy inaccurate
templates the cabinet hardware jig is
packed with features that ensure your
success like adjustable hardened steel
drill guides a movable edge guide and
built-in measuring scales together they
ensure simple repeatable accuracy that
allows you to get the job done quickly
and correctly with professional quality
results using the cabinet hardware jig
to install cabinet polls is simple just
position the jigs adjustable drill
guides to align with the mounting hole
spacing that matches your pull the drill
guides ensure that the holes are drilled
straight something simple templates
can't do so pulls mount perfectly every
time and those drill guides are made
from hardened steel so they'll maintain
their accuracy no matter how many
mounting holes you drill drilling
straight holes for the mounting screws
is important but positioning those holes
exactly where they're needed is critical
the cabinet hardware jig makes that
incredibly easy thanks to an adjustable
edge guide simply slide the edge guide
into position using the built-in
measuring scales tighten the large wing
knobs and the edge guide is locked in
place then use the measuring scale or
the centering window to finish
positioning the cabinet hardware jig
exactly where the mounting holes are
needed clamp the jig in place and drill
the holes using an ordinary 3/16 inch
drill bit that's all it takes
best of all with the cabinet hardware
jig you can easily repeat the process
again and again with the same accuracy
the same confidence and the same great
results so whether you need to mount a
single knob or pole or you're installing
new knobs and pulls on an entire kitchen
the Kraig cabinet hardware jig gives the
confidence to add that finishing touch
yourself and do it successfully
let me introduce you to the Borah miter
X get you the perfect angle every time
one of the hardest parts of carpentry is
getting precise angles with the Borah
miter X angle duplicator that becomes
the easiest part let me show you how
this works
when installing baseboards it's
important to have the correct angle for
your mitre cut the Borah mitre X allows
you to easily determine the angle and
lock it in place for transfer to your
miter saw once you've established the
correct angle it's easy to take this
apart and use this to transfer over to
the miter saw bring this town double
check now let's make our cut now let's
install the base port make sure that
your angle is nice and tight another
cool feature of the Borah mitre X angle
duplicator is that it finds the outside
angles as well just like you did with
the baseboard you do the same thing for
the chrome now that we've established
our angle let's transfer it to the miter
saw now let's lock it in and make our
cut
so there you have it the Borah miter X
angle duplicator for crown molding base
molding or even casing around your
windows the match fit setup gauge from
microjig is designed to work with your
dado stop and dovetail clamps it is
calibrated using a simple process a
scrap is ripped against the fence the
blade is raised to the height of the
molded in knotch
and the base of the gauge is then
trimmed to accurately represent your saw
and your blade this process accounts for
the actual kerf your blade cuts not just
the blade diameter run-out is
automatically adjusted for allowing you
to set up your dado stop with superior
accuracy mount your Daito stop to the
RIP fence put the setup gauge in place
touching the number one leg and
instantly set the number 2 leg to the
exact kerf that your saw is going to cut
the dado stop can also function as the
square when setting up your number 3 leg
the match fit setup gage helps you set
your NATO stop faster more accurately
and with greater consistency helping you
get the best possible fit every time you
use it you've used clamps a million
times for workholding and their
limitations are clear clamp jaws
severely limit reach you need the edge
of a bench to clamp the work to they
take time to position adjust and tighten
and they can get in the way of your work
introducing our latest one-time tool the
2096 workholding kit designed for
efficient and effortless work holding
with your Festool MFT table this kit
comes with 24 dogs machined from solid
aluminum each with a 20 millimeter stem
with our heads of varying sizes for use
with common stock thicknesses and our
adjustable height trick dogs feature a
threaded stem giving support to stock
with variable thicknesses get a power
grip on your work with the ingenious
phenolic plate system you can hold round
objects firmly you can hold work flat or
on edge fix parts during machining
operations hold work while sawing dedos
chopping mortises our carving you can do
all this and more at a convenient
location on your MFT table or bench
the 2096 workholding kit from
woodpecker's precision made in the USA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
