these days children by smartphones
tablets and handheld devices a much more
attractive to them than watching TV and
addiction to the use of that advises is
not in Hell to prospect by the body or
mind think about this issue we came up
with an idea that there should be a more
positive interactive device for children
introducing the agar AR projector it is
our belief that great idea come from
with carob such as weird media and this
camera should be durable cute inovative
and a nurture a child's imagination this
is our egger it looks like an egg but
your child it could be a monster or
adverse a monster and now a pretty girl
and before it was a pretty girl by in
rarity it's a boy although at first it
may seem like just a toy we have
developed this way to preserve a child's
innocence a girl was built with old
consideration for the whole children
such as knowing that children are
naturally in sensitive to light so we
have scared projection brightness down
to 100 loomis to ensure a child's
comfort and safety ecker also supports a
smart lighting system which
automatically adjusted its brightness
depending on it strongly agar is
tailored for children so it's very easy
to operate with our safe contact
charging system
use a magnetic pole connector tech
knowledge of racing home fast and safe
charging operation even while charging
Edgar remains of cool and cute intuitive
and versatile agar is made for children
to enjoy with just a few case of
operation we just demonstrated in the
design of the actor or more control over
since the hope is that there could be a
screen Taylor designs our children I'm a
hiker and with the little space I have
to carry stuff I want to be able to
remember moments like these forever
that's why the MySite 360 is the perfect
solution
the buy-side 360 can capture everything
in beautiful for cash without needing a
big rig or heavy equipment get stable
toss and if the trail gets bumpy or the
camera isn't in the right position my
site 360 keeps videos level than its
built-in calibration the horizon
optimization ensures level viewing and
to make sure your viewing quality isn't
sacrificed by unexpected camera filters
the stable calibration minimizes motion
in the lake quality without the excess
weight to flip
and it's water-resistant so the MySite
360 can capture the entire experience
rain or shine plus if you need to change
the position it only takes a second
when i get to a place with a great view
i know that the my site 360 is getting
the best quality photos and videos
on my way back I can start posting right
away the mine site 360 app uses
artificial intelligence to create a
feature called light clock which looks
at all the videos from my hike and
stitches the best parts of them together
into one clip that way I don't have to
go through hours of footage hi and
Jeannie under my eyes 360 I want to
create a world first wearable VR camera
designed for all those fanatics and we
need your help to make it a reality

huh listen I gotta go
when you're fishing and you know you you
get a bite and and you hook on a fish
and you're reeling that sucker and you
have all that action throughout that
process but then when you catch the fish
you know you take a picture with it you
smile for the camera and you share that
all your friends saying look at this cat
so we want to make it so that you can
share the actual action go fish cam
incorporated is developed by me and my
brother and then we developed it to be a
technology for what we found to be an
underserved market there are camera
technologies or fish finders in the
market but what we found was there not
capturing where the action was and by
seeing which baits are attracting fish
and how a fish might strike just having
the data and learning about those
aspects of fishing will allow you to
make better decisions in what to use and
why and when that's something that is
very hard to do without an application
like this one of the key features is
that it's it's it's on the line and it
works with your fishing line so it's not
going to obstruct how you fish or your
fishing style and top of that we have
infra red and green lighting around the
camera rim so that you can fish during
nighttime or darker lighting and then we
also have the depth of it so that can go
up to 150 meters underwater as well as
the ability to last for four hours so we
really put in a lot of work into making
sure that when they go fish that they're
good news go fish camp when we started
the project with go fish we broke down
the process into multiple steps we
started initially with a conceptual
design looking at the product from a
both a visual as well as a future
benefit standpoint it was important to
us that we had a premium product that
had feature benefits that just weren't
available on the market currently in
terms of looking forward to production
the three-dimensional CAD and mechanical
drawings are all completed the coating
for the app is completed at this point
we're really just using Kickstarter to
get ourselves into production and get
this product out into the marketplace
this is a new product that a lot of
people are excited about and by their
support and their backing of us it's
going to allow us to get to the next
step so that we can share our vision
with the world as well
awesome technology that allow you to
capture kind of action-packed footage
and share it with your friends and
family and definitely bring a lot of the
excitement to the industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
