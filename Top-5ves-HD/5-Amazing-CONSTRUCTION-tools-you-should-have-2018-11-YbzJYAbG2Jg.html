instruction in general obviously thought
out and well designed the rocket light
is super easy to set up just the push of
a button we have it standing and then
just adjust the lovers or whatever
height you wanted out we override to
delay low
I can bring it anywhere I can put it up
anywhere less than five seconds so
adaptability by far is 10 out of 10
cordless nature of the rock you light it
makes it very quick to get it out start
using it I always have my 18 volt
batteries on me I can put one in and use
it right away I don't have to walk and
get an extension cord and it does charge
batteries I can keep charge of my
batteries as I'm using lights
like the quickness of setup for the
rocket and I like the adjustable heads I
can't say enough about the adjustable
heads the articulating part of it was
nice just because you can focus the

going to break we don't have to go out
and find replacement flights replacement
parts something that's durable is useful
on the jobsite definitely think it lives
up to the maquis standard of heavy-duty
durable tools that are made
1,700 which is the item here and it
comes with four different diameter
attachments and you select the one that
is correct
for the type of profile on the joint you
want and it's for putting concave
weather joints in the mortar in your
brickwork to stop water getting in so as
with all pointing you do your
perpendiculars first which is like this
and then you come along horizontal and
you push the mortar in to give the
weather struck weatherproof joint in
your masonry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
