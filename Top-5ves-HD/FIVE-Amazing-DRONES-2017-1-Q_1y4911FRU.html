this is air block a one-of-a-kind
programmable transformable drone and
hovercraft think you've seen at Rome
like this think again air block is
unlike any drone you've seen before
start with individual magnetic pieces
and 15 seconds later you have a drone
control the drone you jack vehicle and
take to the sky in no time peerblock is
amazing not just because it's
entertainment but also because it's
education it teaches kids and big kids
about coding and aerodynamics use free
program new priests that in the app just
drag and drop into actions air
blockaders to every type of throw-up
want to try your own moves program your
own aerial stunts right in the app have
some cool ideas of chrome air block
allows you to DIY so you can build your
very own creation from scratch for their
block you're not just constrained take
to the land or sea by transforming your
drone to a hug around and hover over
brown or even over water okay killin
your vibe and your drone totally fine
air block is tough so you can fly up an
obstacle without fear the engineered
plastic foam thanks Kara Bloch durable
so in save the fly indoors or out snap
into action and keep flying so who's
behind this awesome product we are and
where we make block we've launched and
shipped for products on kickstarter and
a growth just three people to a team of
200 people today we've got 400,000 still
wealth in the pack
for years being established ourselves as
the company that encourages step based
education through our DIY robotics and
Providence we're passionate about
bringing DIY robotics and stem based
program in education folks like you we
need your help to get here bra off the
ground is back we want a programmable
transformable fractional drone and the
best part it's important because let's
face it everyone should have airpot
support the cause in your own air block
go to floss what do you think it takes
to get high quality drone footage like
this a professional drone operator a
cameraman expensive equipment or simply
this introducing the sci-fi level one
drone a drone that lets absolutely
anyone capture footage like never before
syfy's level up technology is the real
breakthrough by using six rotors the
drone can fly without tilting making it
simple and intuitive enough for anyone
to fly plus you get professional stable
footage without an exposed gimbal
because level up gets rid of the usual
multi-rotor wild tilting the interface
can be simplified to fly just swipe
swiping is a superior interface that
allows you to see what you're capturing
while flying unlike tilting or joystick
only navigation our flying interface can
be downloaded as an app on your
smartphone it's simple accurate and fun
because drone flying is better when it's
shared the level one can post shots and
video real-time to your social network
of choice and with the new geofence
technology you can define the area in
which you want to fly your drone will
stay within your boundaries of choice
allowing everyone from beginners to
experts to practice their piloting
skills with confidence so far sci-fi
works has been building drones for
industrial application but we want to
bring our drone inventions to everyone
at consumer friendly prices plus we just
love robots so really we put our full
technological expertise into designing a
drone for the consumer that gives
professional video quality and stability
but doesn't require professional
knowledge to fly it our John will come
with a 1080p high quality camera and it
will be ready out of the box for
everything from and videos to action
filming to home inspection so why
Kickstarter sci-fi is made up of a small
passionate group of robot enthusiasts
that wants to make this breakthrough
technology available to everyone and to
make the leap from commercial to
consumer drones we need your support to
keep the price low compared to other
available drones
thanks to the sci-fi level one's
capabilities instead of worrying about
the drone itself you can focus on the
experience the sci-fi level one is
simple to fly captures exactly what you
want and shares it in real time this is
the first drone for absolutely everyone
from the drone company side live imagine
a day in your local park and getting a
whole new perspective from the palm of
your hand picture suing to incredible
Heights above the waves and float out of
a hot air balloon sharing breathtaking
medals
this is my padrone when we began on
micro drone our aim was to create a
small size personal drone that was
affordable durable easy to fly that work
straight out of the box a drone for
everyone whether you fly micro drone in
extreme conditions like on a windy beach
or in delicate ones like inside your
home with its precision control
flexibility and durability you can fly
it anywhere no matter your age or flying
experience there's no other drone like
we're doing really innovative stuff we
don't cut corners we're in it for the
long run we launched the first edition
micro drove in 2011 and the feedback was
incredible we redesigned the second
edition around a modular architecture to
support a unique range of plug-and-play
modules it received rave reviews in the
technical journals online blogs and even
TV shows these little drones that are
like okay like they're awesome man have
you seen the micro drone ship or yeah
that's probably my favorite one it's
incredibly nimble perfect if you're
filming extreme sports it is very rugged
and if anything did break its modular
design means it's easy to replace any
parts now after two years we're ready to
make micro drone 3.0 microdrum three
point 0 is designed with drone
enthusiasts and excellent engineers from
around the world
components are easily expandable
upgradable and replaceable it's also the
smallest drone to currently carry a
mechanical gimbal the HD camera streams
live footage to your smartphone the
battery slide in and out for quick hot
swapping and the plug and play smart
modules simply snap on with magnets
since everything either snaps or slides
in the structure is sleek aerodynamic
and beautiful so now it's possible using
a 3d printer technology like the old de
maker to you you can pronounce your own
custom frame similar to the dragon or
the wasp I was super excited when the
when the micro drone team reached out
and wanted to make a first-person view
drone technology using the dodocase vr
viewers very few people could use first
person view drone technology even a year
ago I mean the fact that the
microcurrent team is making this
technology available is really a
revolutionary idea we want to make the
quintessential drone the drone market is
evolving and together we can drive the
technology forward we need your support
so no matter who you are we're making
sure that whoever of the Box finds a
simple reliable affordable durable and
fun drone
thank you and we look forward to making
with you the next one and only micro
drone
we live on a planet that's 71 percent
water yet we've only explored 10% of it
we're about to change that the fathom
one is an easy-to-use underwater drone
that you control your smartphone or
tablet we designed it to be the most
affordable most versatile underwater
drone ever made and after two full years
of prototyping and development we're
finally ready to bring underwater
exploration and education to the masses
I'm John I'm Matt I'm Danny we're a team
of outdoor enthusiasts scuba divers
engineers and travelers that had an idea
for an underwater drone that we could
take anywhere and use in any environment
I grew up spending summers on Lake
Louise in northern Michigan where a lot
of large logging operations took place
in the 1800s jump forward 200 years and
now every cottage has artifacts and
pieces of history on their walls that
washed up on the beach but there are
still legends of horse-drawn sleds that
fell through the ice and got stuck at
the bottom just waiting to be explored I
thought if I could control an aerial
drone from a mobile app to explore from
above why couldn't I do the same thing
from underwater that's when fathom was
born
underwater remotely operated vehicles or
ROV s have been around for a while but
they're mainly large expensive
industrial devices tethered to big ships
and early consumer rvs inspired by their
Big Brother's cost well over a thousand
dollars with no mobile app for piloting
and you need to be a pretty good hacker
to put them together we knew we wanted
an underwater drone that anyone could
drop into any body of water and pilot
easily using an app on their smart
device and it had to be small and light
enough to carry around meaning a
completely new compact design it had to
come fully assembled out of the box
including an onboard 1080p HD camera and
built in high intensity LED headlights
for clear viewing and it had to be as
affordable as lower cost flying drones
with comparable equipment so that every
modern-day explorer could have one we
built the fathom one with all of those
features and thanks to custom components
in a streamlined design now you can have
it for under six hundred dollars that's
less than half the price of the closest
competition
above all we made the fathom one super
easy to use but that doesn't mean it's
limited this thing is fully modular our
patent-pending thruster attachment
system allows you to easily remove all
three thrusters for packing but it also
enables customization and upgrades to
specialized thrusters such as these ones
with larger fins for stabilization and
we're hoping our backyard community will
create and share their own ideas for
customization fathom 1 also features an
integrated rail system that makes adding
accessories like action cameras and
additional lights or other sensors a
breeze just slide it on click it in and
you're ready to go we put everything
that we have into making underwater
exploration and education more
accessible to the masses we built the
prototypes validated our designs and now
ready to go on a full-scale
manufacturing all that's left is for you
the Kickstarter community to show us
that you want an underwater drone that's
affordable portable modular and
completely easy to use right out of the
box fathom is your chance to go deep and
see the world in an entirely new way the
possibilities are truly endless what can
you fathom
I always wanted to play with birds when
I was a kid my family fulfilled his
dream my daddy and my granddaddy they
created the first mechanical world it
was not a plane twas a wing flapping
machine today my dream is to create
bionic bird for the 21st century it will
be connected it's a flying up here is
bionic bird this is the prototype the
egg is a portable charger you can charge
a bird in less than 12 minutes bionic
bird is only 8.5 grabs another electric
motor of 0.8 wat rotation speed of
55,000 fpm an aluminum heatsink and
Elysium polymer batteries it also has a
great design inspired by nature plus you
can fly as high as 100 yard finally I
add my friend
hey
when you're lucky the real bad come to
play with you I'm a dreamer I'm not a
big company and I want to share my dream
with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
