actually happening it was very surprised
it's cause it's like kind of nothing i'm
really hurt before i was aghast and i
haven't been that in a lot of years
really expert on rock the core is the
most advanced wireless speaker system
ever developed five digital signal
processors allow us to render the audio
in a way that is totally revolutionary
you're getting stereo sound from this
one tiny little box the convention right
now is that for true high-end listening
you have to have two speakers the core
changes that you can have one and it
truly sounds like to for a little boss
like this to create although imaging is
very present leveraging a combination of
wave field synthesis and beamforming
allows us to create an acoustic bubble
in the room so that the image stays
stable no matter where you're sitting
you can almost see each person in the
band in the room with you I can move my
head around and the location of the
sound source remained intact as if it
was
now a hologram there's no speaker that
can do anything like this everything is
smart but sound systems aren't and this
is the thing that we're doing at mass
fidelity is creating truly smart sound
systems if you have an NFC enabled phone
just touch the top of the core and
you're automatically connected
high-density battery gives the core a
solid 12 hour battery life the core is
built-in microphone allows you to
remotely answer calls without having to
touch your phone and if that phone is
about to die the corrs USB connector

hey the Osmo design studio from munich
and the creative team behind the cosmos
pan as designers we were looking for the
perfect pen for a very long time but we
never found one we realized pen
manufacturers are not willing to take
the risk to try something new so we
decided to make it on our own vote for
over a year on every detail of the pen
invented a whole new mechanism crafted
different prototypes to now come up with
a product and we believe is perfect the
story behind the design of the cosmos
pen is simple the beauty of nature was
inspiring us through the whole process
it was very interesting to discover all
the similarities in our universe there
is a close connection from small plants
up to giant galaxies a universal pattern
defines their appearance the golden
ratio which can be observed in so many
structures of nature because humans it
appears very beautiful and harmonic we
have put a lot of effort to apply the
golden ratio to every visible part of
the pen the result is amazing it's so
clean and minimalistic the panas calls
us from a solid block of aluminum which
was the most durable alloy which is also
used in aerospace engineering to ensure
a long-lasting product and comfortable
writing experience our newly invented
mechanism is based on magnetic forces a
simple and quick shift gets your pen
ready for writing
also with only one hand the
characteristic gap gives you instant
visual feedback on the state of the pan
and after all it's just fun to play we
need your support to realize our first
production line please help us to bring
cosmos alive thank you
you
do you know that seventy percent of
women are doing their makeup under the
wrong lightning ever put your makeup on
thinking that it looks good but once you
step outside it really doesn't this is
why we created the Juno mirror a mirror
and to solve some of our biggest makeup
problems the Juno mirror app uses your
thumb sensor to detect the lining of the
surrounding environment outside of your
home we designed it with Bluetooth
technology that can auto adjust to your
mirrors light temperature and find the
best light setting to apply your makeup
you can even put your phone on to the
mirror for a professional-looking
hands-free picture you spent the last
six months collecting feedback for
campaign effectiveness and sourcing
materials to bring this concept to life
we sent out prototypes to beauty
bloggers and beauty enthusiasts to get
their feedback I think the type of
makeup here that you use while you're
doing your makeup is going to make all
the difference and I saw this one and I
was so so interested I thought it looked
so cool and had so many cool features
and that has this little stand at the
bottom that you can use for storage for
like earrings jewelry your phone things
that you need to quickly grab on the go
and I am a part of this you know tests
their community and that basically means
they sent me a prototype and I was just
like super super floor with it it's
amazing selfies it's just like doubles
in a ring light it's like the most
amazing mirror ever
by backing us up not only will you bring
the June America life but you'll be
joining the revolution to create more
life-changing makeup products that will
blow your mind we really need your
support please back us and share our
campaign</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
