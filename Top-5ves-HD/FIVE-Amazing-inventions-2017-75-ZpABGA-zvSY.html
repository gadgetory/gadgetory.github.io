once showed my son how the classic photo
camera works through which we've seen
the history of the past 200 years
moments of life freeze on paper become a
picture and stay with us forever I
thought then that the magic of
photography for a long time was only a
brilliant combination of optics and
chemistry and decided to make a simple
camera out of available materials I used
cassettes for instant photos recycled
paper and cardboard shutter aperture
body everything from paper and I created

paper camera always ready for instant
photography the camera is made entirely
of recycled paper and cardboard it has a
tunable diaphragm a manual shutter and

I've been skiing for as long as I can
remember and I know that if you want to
ride with your music on you can either
use your everyday headphones and not
wear a helmet which we're not okay with
or you can wear helmet and install one
of those audio kits that you can fit
inside the liner the problem with these
they're all confined to the helmet so
once you're done riding you're done with
the music too and that is what we want
to change sound shield was born from our
own riding experience we found all the
current solutions lacking so we assemble
the team with talented individuals to
create something better I'm sound shield
is just that I kill a helmet with
awesome headphones that work with or
without each other that means you're
good for the writing part and you're
good for whatever comes after it's a
product every bit as cool as it is
functional it completely redefines the
riding experience be it on slopes the
streets or anything else in between the
product is proven and ready now I need
your help to make it a reality
