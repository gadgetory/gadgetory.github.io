hi i'm ken and i'm the creator of the
tempest cope i released the first
tempest code three years ago as an open
source project when I was looking for
ways to feel the tropical skies in my
daily life and ever since I received
overwhelming interest from people all
over the world I which is why we're
excited to announce our first campaign
actually get the tempest crib into your
hands our team consists of engineer and
design is based in Tokyo and we now have
everything we need other than the actual
fun to get Jen into mass production I
really need your help to get this
exciting new product into reality so
thank you very much for your support
bee pollination is essential for a third
of the food we eat but we lost forty two
percent of bee colonies last year
there's a movement of backyard and urban
beekeepers who want to make a difference
and save the bees we created a
technology to help them here's how it
works we attached a camera to a small
but powerful computer that lets us
visually monitor what goes on at a
beehive all day every day we developed
an algorithm to track B flight activity
and translate hours of video to an easy
visual real-time summary we found that
healthy colonies had a unique heartbeat
activity pattern and we can measure that
heartbeat over time not just flight
activity but the signature of the flight
active view gives you a roi interesting
window into what's going on in that
colony of that in real time just moving
our understanding of nature forward
high tech for very low tech natural
situations which is very cool it also
lets you share the joy and importance
that bee is remotely with arbonne total
isin highest watches your bees for you
all day every day and helps you see when
something is wrong so you can do
something about it in time look its
revolutionary tool because we've never
had a tool like it before but it means
that basically the visa gotta love you
we're excited about what's possible when
eyes on high as measures be health on a
big scale please pledge to help us
support beekeepers and the bees thank
you
we're tag on a family by company for the
last seven years we've been creating
bikes rollers that are loved and enjoyed
all around the globe this is our latest
project we do not hesitate when we say
this is the next step in the evolution
of family bikes see three years ago we
searched for our next project we turn to
a lot of people and ask them what they
would want in a family life some answers
were strange you make it fly somewhere I
opening young babies should be facing
their parents and some were just
adorable I we listen and set out to
create the ultimate family bike for two
years we made sketches prototypes study
materials carried out experiments and
explored every aspect of family vaction
half basically we reinvented the family
bike this is autauga to point all the
most comfortable safe easy to ride
practical and just all around coolest
family like you could possibly imagine
the targa too has everything our
customers wanted and much more safety
first tonga has three wheels so it's
inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super-strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options Tyga can
take one or two kids facing forwards
backwards or replacing each other or a
boatload of laps to keep it versatile in
seconds target two turns from a family
bike into a lockable cargo bike with
extra load space on top we use disc
brakes and a Shimano geared and you can
always easily turn it into an electric
bike for effortless long-distance rides
now for the fun part apart from the wind
in their hair we wanted the kids to have
a truly enjoyable adventure on our bikes
so we added the accessory bar which you
can attach a variety of fun add-ons yes
there's also a water gun and when it
rains or if the kids just want some
privacy there's the royal canopy let's
see what else no it can't fly yet but it
can all be taken apart to fit in your
car truck oh and the seats come in a
variety of colors because you know the
personal touch transforms our own
ultimate bike into your own ultimate
fighter last but certainly not least the
price while creating the toga too we
never forgot the one thing everyone
asked make it affordable make it
affordable you can't hold him so we did
because to turn the family bike trend
into a real revolution we had to make it
accessible for everyone whether you use
it for a weekend trip drop off
for shopping or to carry your loyal
friends autauga too is an ideal solution
our company has a proven track record so
this is one of those projects you can
back safe we need your help to make this
piece of family on a reality so back
Tyga and help us make the ultimate
family line Tyga
