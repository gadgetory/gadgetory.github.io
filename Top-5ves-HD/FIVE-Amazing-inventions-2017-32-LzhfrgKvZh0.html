the sand or spike and I love it this is
like having a motorcycle or there's no
room with the big tires on it makes it
fun just go anywhere like taking it
across the sand down to the shoreline I
have never written since college and it
gave me the freedom to go Father I have
four of them and i would buy more of my
head room in lovely part i love these
fight everybody loves these bike
I got rid of my car I gave it to my mom
I'm just riding my bike that she goes to
work every day every day but I got the
bags on the bike or grocery shopping it
just makes it easier especially with
traffic and using to get around is my
number right it gets me out and gets me
going it gives me exercise I have health
issues so for me to ride around on the
regular bicycles pretty much impractical
and where I can't do it this honors
e-bike has made it so I do have the XS
for mobility get around it has made it
my life I heck of lot easier and more
enjoyable this thinner sand or is later
and I can even pick it up if I had room

earlier
Oh

why you need vent for it the best weapon
to take out stinky odors it works like a
din ventilation to your trashcan and
other closed spaces freshen up the air
so you can actually relax when it turns
into this guy it keeps the smell in this
area a lot more tolerable and they make
sure that you can smell the sweet scent
of this little devil right here rather
than this
you can install vente fresh to your
trash can easily within seconds just
leave it alone high maintenance it's a
high-tech ventilation system combined in
UV lighting and platinum dioxide
technology breakdown odor molecules and
yield fresh air a light sensor starts to
the organization when the trash can is
closed banty fresh adapts to all kinds
of trash cans and you can use any
regular garbage bags there's no
consumables that keep you spending more
and with an additional portable power
bank you can use vent fresh all around
the house such as treats in the fridge
when needed under the kitchen sink and
of course your smelly shoe cabinets so

I call clean job and here we see Peter
who is about to take the picture of a
lifetime
let's be quiet for a moment thank you
don't mention it
oh dear once again we witnessed someone
who has left his camera at home worried
it might get damaged that's why we're
proud to introduce agua the
revolutionary all-weather camera case by
me go agua is an innovative IP x3
stormproof camera carrier designed to
enable quick drying of your camera agua
is lightweight comfortable and designed
from the finest durable materials while
other camera bags come with rain covers
that provide limited protection from
water agua gives your camera excellent
protection even in pouring rain there
are numerous weatherproof camera bags on
the market but drawing a camera from
them is a slow and awkward process in
contrast agua lets you quick dry your
camera in any weather so you'll never
miss a shot agua provides double layer
protection against water and impact
thanks to an outer layer of waterproof
tarpaulin and an inner layer of neoprene
and lycra trying to adjust the length of
the strap on most camera bags is slow
and tricky while agua offers quick and
easy adjustment for the best fit with
only one hand the egg was padded strap
is lightweight yet sturdy and designed
to withstand extreme conditions and we
mean extreme
regular camera straps let you respond
quickly but they also leave the camera
exposed to damage on the other hand agua
is always protective and ready to shoot
and here's another cool thing with agua
you don't need your camera strap at all
the camera is attached to the back with
quick release buckle to protect it from
falling when needed simply disconnect
the buckle and shoot as you please we
designed the front lens protector to be
rigid on the outside but Pat it on the
inside this allows you to leave the lens
cap off and keep your camera ready for
action and if you really need a regular
camera strap you got it simply
disconnect the camera from the carrier
and connect it to the strap now all you
have to do is connect the carrier to
your bag or even your bike agua comes in
three different sizes for mirrorless
cameras midsize DSLRs and pro DSLRs they
are all designed to offer I px3
stormproof standard without compromising
on quick-draw ability you don't need to
be a pro to enjoy the a gwa it's
designed for everyone anywhere for all
of life's special moments worried about
nasty sand and splashes of salty water
relax even when you go to the beach you
can trust a gloss excellent protection
we even designed a special pocket for
the lens cover so you'll never lose it
again agua there's no better way to
carry your camera me go cameras best
