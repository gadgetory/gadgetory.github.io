snorer are you introducing the silent
partner
the world's first smart mask to quiet
snoring noise silent partner is a smart
lightweight and compact device that
elegantly tackles what other products
don't the silent partner creates a
silent zone around the person wearing it
giving you and those around you a better
night's sleep how does it work silent
partner uses patented active noise
cancellation that detects the unwanted
snoring sound then generates a counter
sound which suppresses it the result

creating a symphony of snoring noises
that create frustrating nights for us in

don't fully solve the snoring problem

quality of sleep so instead of tackling
the snoring we decided to simply find a
solution for the noise using vast
experience with ANC technology and
sleeping experts the silent partner was
designed and developed to be effective
from as close as 20 centimeters away
simply where the smart mask the way you
would wear a traditional sleep mask and
enjoy a quiet night be one of the first
to experience silent partner and finally
give you and those around you a real
silent night

live better
breathing is the most natural and
important thing we do and every day
almost 3,000 gallons of beer fill our
lungs air is everywhere where we live
where we work where we sleep but do you
really know what's in the air you
breathe you might think that pollution
is only outside but it's the complete
opposite many studies have proved that
indoor air is up to five times more
polluted than outdoor air this is why we
created theory Cleary is the most
amazing natural Airport father powered
by real things that helps people in
reducing indoor air pollution and it
will be the base design object you will
have ever have on the market right now
there are only traditional electronic
air purifiers many plastic very ugly big
and bulky and it only work thanks to
filters this is why we thought about
something revolutionary and we created
the perfect synergy between nature
technology and design so how does Cleary
work we design a smart flowerpot that
amplifies the natural properties of
plants are idea started from a research
of nether they found out with some
plants of that ability to eliminate
toxic age the problem is that a single
plant isn't that effective so we created
a technology unit that allows more air
flow through the soil and the roots this
is where the filtration happens we use
plants as biofilters roots and soil
generate colonies of microorganism that
trap and filter the toxic agents in year
in a natural way clear in fact filters
93% of toxic agents immediately it's
very silent and has a very low energy
consumption less than fifty percent of
an LED bar you can manage it with your
smartphone and the best thing is that
there are no filters so you don't have
to change them in waste money what
happens inside is not magic but a
scientific fact and we proved it we did
many researchers and prove the
effectiveness of Cleary Hedlund one of
the most important research labs on
plants in Europe and peanut a spin-off
of the University of Florence base in
Italy Larry is also proudly an Italian
design product we work hard for a year
to design
every detail we developed multiple
sketches and prototypes to make the
design perfect we presented it at CES
2016 and had great success we have a
super team with two brilliant industrial
designers and a great adviser team that
houses Italy has a long tradition of
crosman especially in the ceramic field
this Italian culture is an inspiration
for us we use a ceramic first for the
suitable quality but mostly because it's
eco-friendly and it doesn't release any
toxic agents in the year obviously we
also work really hard on the technology
part of our products we came to the
Silicon Valley to make something really
powerful with developed our technology
working close with engineers and
manufactures in the Silicon Valley to
improve the functionalities of player II
thanks to our technology unit in our
smartphone app with health and air
quality sensors clear is able to track
like toxic agents in year and give you
real-time pollution intelligence
analytics of it and also temperature and
humidity monitor Clary lives with you
telling what's wrong maybe allergies
sleep problems productivity as much it
learns about you and cares about you it
works with Wi-Fi so wherever you are
clearly need a healthy tips on how to
feel better and tell you something is
going wrong and what war is that every
single product southern Kickstarter will
be unique and will be strictly limited
edition each will come with its own
number and will be handcrafted by the
base Venetian artists so thank you ki
