what drives people is it money is it
power or is it something that's simpler
take Eve we're a global community is
formed around a small team and it's
passion for great Hardware together
they're creating the first ever crowd
developed computer

family's dream to you from a world away
the community one of the best audio and
we've answered with the most advanced
and powerful audio configuration out
there we thrown ourselves into designing
the most beautifully crafted and
functional computer imagine
big companies are racing for the
slimmest devices possible but when the
Eve community realized that real all-day
battery life would only cost him a
millimeter it was a no-brainer
people want to create objects of beauty
tools that are perfectly balanced they
don't achieve mastery and take pride in
the details that's why they rejected the
both we're keeping this tool sharp and
true today we live in virtual spaces and
in space as we dream together we dream

I every day without being remembered as
they often strike at the least
appropriate place and time like when we
drive hike drink coffee or work on
something and we simply don't have a
chance to use a phone laptop or even a
napkin to capture a thought and our
sudden insights are lost but even if you
have a phone you need to take it out of
your pocket
unlock it find and start application and
do something do it 100 times a day and
two hours of your time are gone forever
and for nothing while many of your
productive tasks are interrupted and had
to be started over not speaking it's
also too distracting dangerous
embarrassing even unsafe this is why we
bring you my a gadget that instantly
captures your spoken thoughts and notes
without a phone or computer
automatically organizes your thoughts
and your tasks with your apps and
software it frees you at least one hour
a day every day my simple solution for
complex problems get my
and our passion for games doesn't stop
when the screen turns off we carry it
with us everywhere we go
now you can - with game banned the first
SmartWatch for gamers gameband atari
edition puts the action right on your
wrist with watch optimized versions of
classic Atari games but game bans
hardware is far from retro inside game
band with an AMOLED display it's crystal
clear we put the Qualcomm Snapdragon
2100 processive Wi-Fi into the
Snapdragon we're 2100 it takes on
everything that you need to have in a
wearables processor it's 30% smaller
than its predecessor it's 25% more power
efficient extending battery life and
bringing advanced functionality
the result is one of the most powerful
smartwatches in the world and we didn't
stop there game Dan supports upgradeable
microSD storage so you can carry your
music photos and files our microSD
solution is really easy to use just plug
into any computer and launch
pixelfurnace and play full PC games
direct through the drive of three high
speed with game band terraria addition
you can adventure on your PC and then
unplug and carry your world with you on
your wrist so you can play from anywhere
our team pioneered this concept back in
2015 when we helped create a hugely
popular minecraft wearable we know what
it takes to build a great SmartWatch
that you'll want to wear every day I've
been designing wearables for over a
decade
wearables is a very difficult space to
design with in it needs to fit on the
person and be comfortable to wear
waterproof shockproof so we designed
this products using the best-in-class
construction approaches from the
watchmaking industry
really
we're trying to do was to create a
physical device something that exists in
the real world that feels like it could
exist in any number of these sort of
magical and mysterious wonder lands that
we see and experience in every kind of
game well I'm really excited about
gameband in part because I'm a gamer and
this is a product made for me of course
it's a it's a full-featured SmartWatch
but it's more than that as a storage
medium that allows people to take their
games to their friend's home or take it
to another PC it's not a generic
SmartWatch it's something that speaks to
a gamer for me it's kind of a no-brainer
from San Francisco to Barcelona our
teams
oh my name is Kirk Kjellberg and I'm
here today to speak to you about the
pistol that I invented called the ideal
conceal we're here not only to address
the functions of the pistol but also to
address some of the negative critiques
we've been receiving so I have the
pistol with me or at least a
representative of it this is a plastic
model to demonstrate the size it is
approximately the size of a galaxy s7
with a protective case and what will
happen when you go to use it there's a
spring-loaded safety you know this again
is a model so it's not going to operate
correctly but we will depress this
safety and this handle spring-loaded
will deploy itself and snap open at that
time you'll be ready to defend yourself
to reload or lower the pistol it's very
simply a derringer it's a two shot
bérenger so there's only two bullets
that can go in here at a time and then
you close that up and to return it to
its safe mode that also disconnects the
safety mechanisms on the inside the
reason for this pistol is because a lot
of folks are finding the need to carry a
gun with them to feel protected in
today's environment for me I have my
permit to carry and only because I do
sell real estate and so I am traveling
in a lot of different remote areas
throughout North Dakota as well as
Minnesota and so I like to be able to
have a pistol with me at all times
sometimes the holsters whether it be in
your lower back or whether it be in your
boot I like the ideal concealed because
I can put it right on my side it looks
like it's a regular cell phone with me
everyone's seen the news incidents where
random violence just breaks out around
you and you can't find the time to wait
for the police for it to be solved and a
lot of people are having to do things
themselves to protect themselves one of
the other comments that we've been
receiving is how this will make things
more difficult for police knowing if
you're holding a cell phone at them or a
pistol and again I think it's our
responsibility to act responsibly and
respectfully towards police if you're
going to interaction with police
officers
you know don't reach it for things make
sure they know where your
hands are act accordingly I mean I've
been pulled over before and when I get
pulled over I roll my window down I put
my hands on my steering wheel and I wait
for the officer to approach and then I
let him know that I'm going to be
reaching into my glovebox and I also let
them know that I have a pistol and a
carry permit so that they know a lot of
law enforcement folks are interested in
having this gun as a backup some folks
has a primary if they're an undercover
work we have a protective agency that
wants them we have some government
agencies that are interested in them
this is a four year of safety and for
your self defense
I highly doubt you'll see it used in any
criminal capacity and I wanted to bring
that up as well one of the things about
this gun and why it is safe is when it
is in its latched position the safeties
are in place so it can't be fired it
can't be fired in its closed position
and even if you drop it the firing pins
can't go off secondly I've had a lot of
concerns that from people about this be
coming in contact with children and
maybe I'm starting to get a little bit
old but in my time it was our
responsibility to keep things away from
children and if you can't keep a gun
away from children
you probably shouldn't have a gun we
firmly believe in personal
responsibility as a mom I have a pistol
at home I don't leave my pistol laying
on my counter on my kitchen table either
I make sure that I always have that in a
safe spot you have to treat this as a
regular gun because that is what it is
you can't just let it lay out in the
public just because it looks like
cellphone I mean I am a mom again and I
don't want something to happen to me
when I'm out showing property a lot of
times I take people with me as a second
person for safety reasons but sometimes
it's just not possible so that I do feel
protected by having that because you
never know exactly when you're going to
need it I also want to make sure folks
understand that this is not
representative of quality that we will
be selling in the end the polymer case
will be very well finished the fit and
finish the lines will be very tight it's
going to be quality manufactured we'll
have a lifetime warranty so you can feel
comfortable buying this gun and know
that it will perform for you we will
shoot it approximately 500 times in the
prototype phase before it goes to
production to make sure that everything
fires without malfunctioning and that
ever
thing is working appropriately we really
believe in safety first family-owned
business
I don't want anybody being hurt by this
