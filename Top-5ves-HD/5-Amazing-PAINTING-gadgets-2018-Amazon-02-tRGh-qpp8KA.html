scuff marks are a part of life with the
new shoreline touch-up painter it's
never been easier to quickly refresh
your walls for that newly painted look
to use the touch-up painter simply
unscrew the top and place the bottle in
the stand fill with paint and securely
replace the top next rotate until the
arrows align to the apply paint position
break in the roller on another surface
such as cardboard or newspaper until
it's fully coated now you're ready to
paint over scuffs or other marks on your
walls the roller will create a
consistent finish without leaving brush
marks if you need more paint simply
squeeze the bottle while you roll this
will allow you to control the release of
paint no hassle no mess when you are
finished touching up your walls return
the top to the ceiling store position
clean or replace the roller so it will
be ready the next time your walls need a
quick touch-up use a sharpie to write
the paint color or room on the product
then place it upside down in the stand
for storage painting can be a messy
frustrating experience hard to open lids
old paint that won't mix messy pouring
inevitable spills hard to seal lids but
it doesn't have to be that way meet the
mixing mate an easy new way to mix pour
and store paint with no mess mixing mate
locks onto any metal gallon paint can
with four strong cam locks the auger
style mixing paddle this pigments from
the bottom of the can doing in seconds
what would take minutes with a messy
wasteful stir stick pouring paint into
your paint tray or sprayer is a breeze
with the pistol grip handle and
precision-engineered spout look not one
drop spilled the seal is so strong
accidents are no problem done for the
day
no problem mixing mate will keep your
paint fresh until the next time you need
it it doesn't have a power cord or a
cutting edge but the versus spin 360
could be more useful than you think
and the two types of triangles that come
with it are
urgently responsible for that
versatility the flag grabber triangles
use the three holes in the back to
secure it to the pins on the deck and
the painters pyramids also use those
pins to locate them wherever you need
for the job and you can buy the grabbers
and pyramid separately if you need more
for your type of work this ring style
base supports the ball bearings that
allow the deck above it to spend so
freely the versus spin 360 comes in 11
and 16 inch diameter models if you need
a larger piece you can drill open the
four screw bosses that are molded in
that upper deck and use screws to attach
a larger wooden deck you can place the
four included grabber pads wherever you
need them to hold your workpiece nice
and steady and secure while you spin it
to work on the painters pyramids can
also be placed wherever you need them to
support your work on tiny points they
let you apply finish to nearly the whole
piece all at one time
I expect that many of us will find lots
of uses for anniversa spin 360 once we
get one in the shop and start turning
our work on it being able to turn the
workpiece so easily while you're working
on it's gotta be ways reducing the
painters assistant from hide a
multi-tool that works with your next
paint job from start to finish use it to
open your paint cans flip it around and
snap it onto a paint container as a
handle keep your hands-free with the
magnetic brush holder and handy belt
hook the painters assistant easily hooks
onto ladders keeping your paint at arm's
reach when the job is done save time
with a built-in brush and roller cleaner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
