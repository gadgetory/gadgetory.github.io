award-winning silicon gluing accessories
bundled together to take the stress and
mess out of your glue ups if you've ever
used the typical acid brushes to spread
glue you know what a mess they can make
they leave glue on the bench have lousy
coverage and after one use you have to
throw them away as a result many
woodworkers have resigned themselves to
using their fingers but that's a sure
way to get glue on your bench which
causes scratches and glue spots in your
finish and holes in your clothes but all
that changes with the 3-piece silicone
gluing kit from Rockler the silicone
tray features a neat notch that holds
the brush and catches excess drops and
even when used without the tray the
bristles never make contact with your
bench best of all when your glue up is
done you can set your gluing tools aside
and forget them once the glue dries it
peels off easily and you're ready for
another project action process is simple
first choose the proper Gravatt number
one two three or four by selecting a
size that is smaller in diameter than
the head of the damaged screw or shank
of the broken bolt place the selected
Gravatt extractor into the drill with
the drilling end out first tighten the
Chuck and set the drill in reverse or
counterclockwise direction
next place the point of the Gravatt in
the center of the damaged screw or bolt
and begin drilling and a moderately slow
speed until the hole is approximately
1/16 of an inch deep and smooth in
circumference be certain to clear away
any metal chips that may be left in the
drilled hole once you have completed
cleaning the screw or bolt loosen the
Chuck and flip the gravit power
extractor over to the opposite threaded
removal end be sure the drill is in
reverse or counterclockwise direction
place the tip of the removal end into
the drilled hole apply firm downward
pressure on the drill and slowly begin
to remove the damaged screw or bolt
it's a very unusual-looking product with
a single tool steel cutter set at about
30 degrees and handled on our super bot
in the master kit Rockler has taken the
original bench cookie to new heights the
heart of the system is the bench cookie
plus which has a threaded insert molded
into the center to accept a range of
removable standoffs the standoffs fit
into simple 3/4 inch dog holes allowing
you to set the cookies where you want
and at the height you need raising your
work helps keep blades and bits from
damaging your bench even at full depths
of cut proper working height also
relieves physical stress by allowing you
to straighten your back as you work shop
belts all horses can accept the master
kit by simply drilling some 3/4 inch
holes to accept the standoffs set your
piece up and get to work wherever you
need the master kit also comes with
bench cookie cones which convert your
cookies to very stable painters pyramids
for finishing tasks they simply snap
into place so you can get back to work
work where you want with the clearance
you need and at a position that is
comfortable
