Victoria some tools never change a
hammer is a hammer a hairbrush is a
hairbrush and for nearly 150 years a
nail clipper has always been just a nail
clipper current nail clippers require
odd uncomfortable movements of your
wrist and can easily rotate or shift
unexpectedly which is an issue when
you're holding a sharp object
it also requires you to be able to have
a strong squeeze between your thumb and
your pointer finger which may not seem
like a big deal but degeneration at the
base of the thumb is very common among
people over the age of 50 causing them
to struggle with this pinching movement
and when you lose strengthen that motion
cutting nails as one of the first tasks
effectively as orthopedic surgeons
ourselves we've become used to precise
surgical instruments built for
ease-of-use and accuracy we thought why
can't we bring this type of quality ease
and precision we find in the operating
room to consumers in their own homes
that's why we invented clipper pro its
unique swivel function allows you to
position your hand wrist arm and
shoulder in the most comfortable
position for you the double action
mechanism makes cutting your nails much
easy requiring very little strength to
operate and our surgical grade stainless
steel blades cut
precisely and effortless we've spent the
last 10 years working diligently to take
an outdated frustrating hygiene tool and
bring it into the modern era by
combining decades of experience as
orthopedic surgeons with innovative
engineering state-of-the-art
manufacturing and cutting-edge design we
have created a revolutionary tool
clipper Pro is so precise it could be
used in the operating room and it is now
available for use in the comfort of your
own home we are passionate about clipper
pro and we are confident you will love
it - all of our tooling has been made
tested and personally inspected by us we
are ready to go into production back us
