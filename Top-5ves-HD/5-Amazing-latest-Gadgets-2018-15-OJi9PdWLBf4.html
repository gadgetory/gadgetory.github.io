is you're watching up until now there
hasn't been an all-in-one solution that
keeps your body free while giving you
the privacy you deserve the theater

it's built from a breathable polyester
material that both blocks off outside
light from entering and provides proper
temperature regulation all inside inside
pop theater a transparent plate is
stitched in near the top providing a
place for your device to rest at the
perfect distance from your eyes
by the way coffee theaters compatible
with nearly any size phone or tablet the
custom Bluetooth enabled remote allow
that you control your video while your
device is out of reach an included dual
driver of a wireless speaker delivers
high-quality sound throughout the feeder

device alone the speaker also functions
as a power bank so you do not have to
worry about running out of battery while
watching your video the theater is held
up by four poles which are also able to
fold for easy storage
we know you're always on the go so we
designed the feeder to collapse down for
easy portability and storage to use pop
feeder first remove the components from
the carrying bag unfold the poles and
slide each one through the sleeves
located on the outside of the theater
and then fasten them in place insert the
flexible plastic board around the inside
walls of the theater for support connect
both the remote and
secret to your device via bluetooth and
open the movie or show your going to
watch on your device make sure your

home or even at the movies and still use
pop peter as long as you have a place to
