the life-threatening allergy and if you
do - you know how important it is to
have an EpiPen after I almost lost my
son to a severe allergic reaction I
promised myself I would always keep an
EpiPen with him wherever he goes no
matter what the problem is that epi pens
have to be stored in about room
temperature and with the skyrocketing
price of epi pens you probably don't
want to have to buy a new one if it
accidentally gets too hot or too cold
have you ever noticed that your EpiPen
packaging says the starter EpiPen is 68
degrees - 77 degrees Fahrenheit the
temperature requirements are on the
EpiPen box in the instructions booklet
and even on the EpiPen itself
these aren't suggestions they're
requirements from the EpiPen
manufacturer how can you go to the beach
go camping or go anywhere outdoors and
keep your EpiPen at about room
temperature
hi I'm Erik when Yuri the co-creator of
Evie shell Abbey shell is a patented
case that protects EpiPens from hot and
cold temperatures
the way it does this is surprisingly
simple inside a chappie shell is a
patented system that releases heat when
it's cold outside and absorbs heat when
it's hot outside it doesn't use any
batteries instead it uses advanced epi
cells that reset to room temperature
when indoors and then release heat or
absorb heat as necessary when outdoors
so now whenever you're running errands
hiking or on a field trip you could
count on the protection of an EpiPen
after my son almost died from severe
allergic reaction and nuts you made it a
point to always have an EpiPen with him
but that meant a lot of our favorite
outdoor activities were out of the
question that's not the kind of life we
wanted for our son which is why we
created episode we've been working on
episode for a few years and fortunately
I have a bit of experience with product
development after earning a master's
degree in engineering at Stanford I
designed medical devices as a principal
engineer at Medtronic then I started a
company making consumer products and
some of my inventions are sold in Apple
stores all around the world now after
building the first step you shell to
help my son the process of bringing it
to market helped hundreds of thousands
of people is nearly complete over the
past few months we brought a functional
prototype on family trips to Yellowstone
and Mount Rainier it worked great here's
the dimensional prototype that
represents what we plan to start mass
producing now we've successfully tested
EBI shell we know it works and we've
chosen manufacturing partners who are
ready and waiting to start mass
production so here's what's next
custom manufacturing equipment is the
last thing we need to start mass
production and we need to collect enough
pre-orders to fund the purchase of the
women bringing Effie Shelton market will
save lives by enabling people to bring
their EpiPen with them wherever they go
even if it's hot or cold outside please
join us on our mission to Mable everyone
to keep their EpiPen safe and close no
matter where they go thanks for your
support

bust up the lead
Oh
for kids learning new words can be a
task which is boring and not fun that
was when we asked ourselves how could we
encourage kids to learn new words in a
more fun and interactive way that led us
to develop wordy an educational toy that
was made to be engaging in fun for kids
who are learning new words
I know mr. da Bahia does not show me
their post no spectators on this photo
by yo-yo ma I even got a void of the
critical moment he found a for the
monocoque I did Scalia although the
cohabitation
there are several features of how you
can use wording with a smartphone device
as one of the features you can use our
app to let wordy print out words this
can be used as a tool for educational
purposes encouraging kids to learn words
with interactive activity the second
feature is using it as a simple drawing
board to print out what you draw with
your smartphone
another feature is inserting your own
words or phrases with such features
wordy would be a great containing to
help your child learn new words in a new
way
one is a little tone provide something
invited you to prevention our thoughts
in the market the contents and the way
to enjoy quality is abilities with your
help we can realize our dream to make a
worthy available for everyone you can
find them all information into space
we started since awake because we're
damn sure happiness lies in simple
things like a great morning or smell we
really love sounds awake is not
factorial on clock that wakes you up
only with your favorite scents to offer
a gradual perfectly fresh awakening
Samsa wake makes the beginning of the
day clear and fresh until your day
really starts it's like in your
childhood you know and you got your go
to your mom's place she cooks it reminds
you some good memories and actually the
scent has this power it wakes you up
clear-headed because it's progressive
and it greets you with a familiar and
inspiring sense in the morning we tested
it on a hundred of people and the sense
really wakes you up my speciality is
fast detection methods to detect and to
analyze wellness of people including
sleep quality indoor air quality forests
and some molecules like a sense of
fragrance like light and sound even if
you are in deep sleep a scent can wake
up you just it's very strong it's not
the placebo it's very strong some so I
came up at University where it was
really difficult for me to wake up and I
really needed to fix it so I stepped it
to my garage and I got walking I did the
difficult to be powerful completely
silent and safe to use so we created a
dry diffusion system that works with
seven free perfumes today Sam's awake is
cab approved which is pretty much the
strictest air quality norm that exists
and it's working perfectly
Shiba though is the leader in the
fragrance industry we have strong local
partners around the world we have all
the resources to be sure that you wake
up the best possible way as a perfumer I
am really happy to be involved on that
project because we can work on so many
effective direction if people who will
smell the sensor work perfume and said
oh I like it and on top of that it wakes
me up
I am in a good mood because of that okay
for me the challenge is that the keys of
sense awake are simple design quality
sense and a perfect tuning so the
viewers and farewells really
unforgettable yes we were invited as big
guests we add our picture in a
googolplex building so what it was
amazing and it became very clear for us
that we had to go all the way through
with the project that got as a credit
contacts an advice to move it through
the track this would interest just about
anybody everywhere why not
it's it's a very present way to wake up
we use a sense that I solvent-free so it
is totally healthy and wheels also
capsules that are completely recyclable
so it makes it eco-friendly we are here
on Kickstarter to make sense are
available to everyone as a backer you
will allow us to start production and be
one of the first to have it so take a
look at the pledges and I guess now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
