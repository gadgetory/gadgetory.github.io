world the dresser is basically the
uniform of successful men you wear to
work when you have a important interview
even at your own wedding left versus
using smart exiles to make your life
easier our research shows that men
basically prefer to have three
properties in a dress sure no stains no
smell and as little ironing as possible
we found a way to offer that in a fabric
that's also soft and breathable we get a
lot of questions about how it's possible
for sure to have such magic properties
and still feel natural well it implies
working on every aspect of the fabric
from the cotton selected to the way the
yarns are spun and then woven our garden
is also tweeted so that the fibers are
transformed that they're very cold this
allows the shirt to block out all fluids
and bacteria before it enters the fabric
which is unlike other existing
technologies where it's only added to
the surface and can be washed off
so together with our designer recreated
a great fit we did it in a minimalistic
design so it will never go out of style
let purchase more about just making life
easier for busy men we also care about
changing irresponsible consumption
patterns true sustainability is when you
wear the same shirt for years instead of
buying new stuff all the time the
biggest hassle of wearing a shirt is not
buying it but keeping it fresh when
napkin when you eat bike slower so you
don't sweat maybe even do laundry on a
Tuesday a left for sure can be worn for
many days in a row and you still don't
have to wonder if your bacon smell how
long a day you have well it took us
quite some time to quit our day jumps
but we're really excited that we're
going to go all in on bringing this
technology to market we believe this is
the next generation of shirts with our
background in sourcing and fashion we
think we are the right founders to
create this unique product that will be
worn for years to come now all we need
is your help please back our campaign
