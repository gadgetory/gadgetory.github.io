adding a few simple angle cuts this
basic table gains a lighter look with
tapered legs while the angled apron and
top create a contemporary feel but
accurate and consistent taper cuts can
be time consuming to create safely until
now the new micro dial tapering jig from
micro jig offers you four ways to safely
and accurately layout and cut tapers and
can be used as a straight line rip guide
as well
you can lay out your taper by the angle
required with microscopes down to 1/8 of
a degree
you
or by the rise and run of your cut line
with micro stops as little as 1/16 of an
inch per foot
you
there are adjustable memory stops which
allows the repeated cutting of multiple
angles such as the table legs or wedges
you
or you may use the more traditional
method of aligning your layout marks to
the miter slot then adjusting the RIP
fence accordingly
you
safe and accurate cutting always starts
with a clean edge so the micro dial
tapering jig is designed to safely guide
along your rib fence while controlling
rough lumber providing a clean edge to
work from let's look at each of these
features in turn and explore how they
work
the drawer slide jig from Craig makes it
easier than you've ever imagined to
build projects with drawers which means
you can create projects you might have
only dreamed of before that's because
the drawer slide jig takes the guesswork
and uncertainty out of installing drawer
slides and makes it easier for anyone to
install drawers that fit right and
glides smoothly every time the drawer
slide jig does this by securely
supporting the slide in the exact
position needed as you install them in
the cabinet plus the jig supports the
drawer boxes as well to ensure that the
slides get installed on them with
perfect alignment - whether you're
installing drawers and a cabinet with
face frames or in a cabinet or piece of
furniture without frames the versatile
drawer slide jig clamps in place easily
and the jig works with ball bearing
epoxy coated and under mount slides
using the drawer slide jig couldn't be
simpler built-in Tam's
register the jigs brackets in place
precisely just align the tabs of the
face frame and then clamp the bracket in
place this positions the bracket exactly
where you needed to place the jig at the
right height and does it without
measuring ensuring foolproof level
positioning of the slide on frameless
cabinets in cases the process is still
simple the brackets register against the
front edge of the cabinet and clamp in
place at the layout line sitting
straight and level every time once
climbed in place the jigs brackets
support the drawer slide completely
providing that third hand you've always
needed to hold the slides in place no
matter how big or heavy the slide the
drawer slide jig holds it in straight
and level so you have both hands-free to
drive in the screws and the drawer slide
jig doesn't stop there after all
the job isn't complete until the drawer
box itself is aligned and installed
that's why the jigs brackets are
reversible so they can be mounted to
protrude out of the cabinet and hold
that drawer box in the exact right
position that allows you to set the
drawer box on the brackets and then pull
the slides into position the sturdy
brackets hold everything in place as you
drive in the mounting screws with the
correct drawer slide jig you'll have the
confidence you need to take your
projects to the next
level and create custom pieces with
drawers because you'll know that you can
create drawers that look great fit
correctly and work right different tools
make different chips or sawdust routers
and planners make larger shaving and
although they may be easier to clean up
than the finer dust of saws or Sanders
those larger chips spread debris over a
larger area in a very short time the
nuisance of dust is one disturbance that
can be greatly minimized through proper
dust extraction in the shop or a home
dust control can't be an afterthought
not if you want to save yourself the
time cost and mess of dealing with it
later dust control is an integral part
of the Festool system and design
philosophy by collecting the dust as
it's made where it's made for us as
painters the Festool system has three
components the Sanders the abrasives and
the extractors the dust extractor is the
heart and soul of the system we don't
have to put up boundaries within a
workspace anymore because we are able to
work that clean nine times out of ten we
will get compliments about how clean the
job was Ct 26 CT 36 and CT 48 are fest
tools most capable and versatile mobile
dust extractors all of these units
feature HEPA filters and carry full unit
HEPA certification good dust extraction
starts at the tool and ends with clean
air being returned to the room for
Festool dust extraction is the primary
consideration of the tools design
weather is our jet stream and multi jet
stream pad designs for our Sanders or
the efficient internal shrouding and
channeling that makes our tools able to
capture the dust as it happens Festool
dust extractors have many features one
features the tool triggered auto start
capability
whenever the tool is cycled on the
vacuum attached to it powers up
automatically as well likewise when the
tool is cycled off the vacuum also
cycles off another quality to consider
includes variable suction force the
ability to control air flow as it's
needed this is particularly critical for
sanding operation the hose connection is
designed to mate with all the different
port types on all our power tools this
detail means you have secure connections
and don't need to waste time with
makeshift solutions the fist doc feature
turns the CT into a mobile transporter
you can easily stack the cure and move
an entire set of tools at one time which
gets you into and out of the job site
faster in the shop that contributes to
workplace organization which enhances
efficiency by keeping the tools where
you work to minimize cleanup improve
finish results and work more efficiently
than ever whether in the shop or on the
job site increase your productivity with
a Festool dust extractor
