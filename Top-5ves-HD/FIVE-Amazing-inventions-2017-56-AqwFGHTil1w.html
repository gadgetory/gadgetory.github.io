super book it's like getting a brand new
laptop every time you upgrade starting
at just $99 the Superbook is a fraction
of the cost of a traditional laptop and
is even more convenient hi I'm Andrew
co-founder of enduro miam makers of the
Superbook I was frustrated with having
such a powerful smartphone but with an
interface designed purely for mobile use
our goal the Superbook is to eliminate
the restrictions that hold smartphones
back the software side of the Superbook
is and Romeo an app that makes Android
function like a familiar desktop
operating system you get a mouse cursor
keyboard shortcuts desktop class
browsing and easy file management
everything is intuitive and optimized
for productivity there's no custom
firmware to install and no technical
knowledge needed simply download the app
from the Play Store and connect to your
Superbook you can use one of our native
apps or any of the millions of Android
apps in the Play Store we're also
introducing an open SDK to enable
developers to added romia optimization
to their apps we've already released a
beta version of and Romeo in the Play
Store where it's received hundreds of
thousands of downloads and extremely
positive reviews we've been developing
the Superbook and and Romy americ cited
to finally release them our prototypes
are complete and we're ready to move
into full production we're looking for
your support to help us make this new
kind of computing a reality the
Superbook is just the beginning and
we're excited for you to be a part of it
thanks for your support
my name is Noah Noah I'm co-founder of
fly I'm really passionate about new
technologies and I naturally fell in
love with drones when I first met them a
few years ago I'm convinced that in the
future we'll have flying robots around
us helping us in our daily lives but
before that we must overcome a few
challenges in particular with respect to
safety and usability so what we didn't
fly is to go back to the drawing board
and invent the flying robot of the
future it had to be safe robust and with
a great user experience we've been
hanging around in my attic for about a
year building product i'm sort of bells
of wood and DIY electronics and after
many many trials fly eventually stayed
in the air and prove to us that it was
all possible so based on this we managed
to convince PLoS twist a famous Belgian
entrepreneur also a talented drone pilot
he became really enthusiastic about the
project and decided to invest consider

what makes flying designs for innovative
it's made of a single shielded popular
and for control vehicle stability it has
the same size and weight of a soccer
ball its back with sensor a powerful
on-board computer the HD camera and a
Wi-Fi connection we want to try to be
smart and autonomous so you don't have
to be always piloting it you can select
a simple mission to the mobile app and
just enjoy the live streaming fly is a
lot of fun to play and interact with but
it's more than a toy it's really a
platform on which you in turn the Future
of flying robots we have two api's and
an SDK which enable developers to create
applications or controlling fly whim of
the oven on the on-board computer it
runs linux and supports the popular
computer vision library opencv you can
make right autonomously dtec and react
to a disease like talking someone
something new movie fly is pretty
amazing because it's in the air but it
doesn't seem mechanical when I start
apply the first time flying I was really
impressed about the simplicity of the
construction it's it's so so amazing
simple and if it comes too close you can
just push it away and it moves again and
you don't hurt your fingers or anything
else we now have a complete
functionality the type of flying and we
are ready to enter the production stage
so when you support us on Kickstarter
you're showing us that you share our
vision and our n to Z as so we invite
you to join the flight crew make a
pledge and let's build the future of
flying robots together
you
life is full of adventures but it's easy
to miss them when you're always looking
in a smartphone compass stone offers a
different way to get around it
encourages you to look up not down
compa stone is a simple navigation
device like a magic stone it close to
show me the way the light flicker as you
get close to your destination and circle
around once you've reached your goal
cooperstown can also show the time
blinking lights represent the hands of a
clock
start by telling compa stone where you
want to go using the smartphone map all
you need to do is set your destination

freedom and exploration back into your
life well as a facial massage of course
you haven't but this toothbrush does
that and more but before we tell you
about our world-class features and the
health benefits of our three deep
toothbrush we'd love to share our story
in the words of our Creator who has 20
years of experience in product design
and manufacturing six years ago my kid
got a tooth problem the dentist asked my
kid to use a better toothbrush so I
searched the electric toothbrush market
after I tried a few high-end new
products I still knew none of them were
good enough for my kid it took five
years of dental research user studies
and product designing finally I invented
more effective technology in oscillating
rotating and sonic for our electric
toothbrush and the users loved it then
my wife had to ask you love our kid
enough to make her a new product how
about me it was a news flash to me I
could add two options for women's facial
care the three deep toothbrush uses
sonic circular vibrations to thoroughly
buff your teeth it's far more effective
than any other tooth brush on the market
at removing plaque and it even forces
toothpaste between your teeth in a world
where the majority of cavities are
caused by poor brushing you need this
kind of precision in a toothbrush and as
a bonus the two additional heads for the
three deep are great for facial
cleansing and massage this multifaceted
tool comes with three toothbrush heads
so it's a perfect gift for the whole
family
and there's no need for batteries you
can recharge it over and over now of
course three deep can't happen without
your support we need you to back our
campaign today so we can better spread
the word and produce the first run of
our product so take control of your oral
and facial health and pre-order your
three deep toothbrush today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
