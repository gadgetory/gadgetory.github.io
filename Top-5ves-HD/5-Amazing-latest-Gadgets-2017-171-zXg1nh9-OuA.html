hours ago we launched the revolutionary
device pyrrha we've condensed it into a
smaller more compact version and along
the way we've added crazy features I'm
happy to introduce you to pyro me
one of the big advantages of pyromania
is actually the size right with this
half the size of the original pyro the
possibilities of this thing are
literally endless you can put it under a
spread of cards from the fire from that
hide it inside a card box hide it behind
your iPhone behind objects in your house
it's so small you can take a credit card
out of your wallet and hide it
underneath your credit card so we've
been jamming out with this thing all
week the TV and the things we've been
coming up with are inspiring to say the
least
USB charging no more batters you don't
have to go to the store and buy triple
A's rip open the packaging none of that
you plug it into your laptop plug it
into your car charge it on the way to a
gig if you want when I charge this thing
I personally get upwards of six hundred
shots before I have to recharge it
detachable wrist strap you now have the
ability to lock in an unlock pyro from
your wrist without having to remove the
strap you're at your gig you've launched
the fireballs you want to get rid of it
for the time being it's never been
faster or easier to remove pyro throw it
in your case carry on with your game
dramatically increase signal range we've
added an antenna that actually plugs
into the remote which gives you upwards
of 30 feet of range
you can be in your bedroom around a
corner and fire it off in the living
room burst fire it allows you to shoot
two fireballs the push of one button at
the very same time the perfect dramatic
punctuation for your favorite routine
more fire more him
[Laughter]
single-use plastic bags are a huge
global problem each year an estimated
500 billion to 1 trillion plastic bags
are consumed worldwide many of them end
up in the oceans and landfills and in
nature I'm really sick of getting a
plastic bag every time I go to the store
but I do need a way to carry the things
I buy and it's not really convenient to
carry a big cloth bag everywhere I tried
to get something more portable but the
bags I found wouldn't easily fit in my
pocket
that's when I decided to create the Nano
bag the ultimate carry everywhere
plastic bag replacement the Nano bag is
made with the strongest lightweight
ultra high performance materials the
Nano bag only weighs half an ounce and
measures only point zero zero two inches
that's only half the width of the human
hair to our knowledge this makes it the
lightest bag of its kind in the world by
a big margin the super-strong rip stop
material is stitched with a heavy-duty
nylon thread so strong that you can
easily load it with 50 pounds the Nano
bag measure is 24 by 15 inches that
provides ample space for your daily
needs the Nano bag is coated with a
waterproofing material so you don't have
to worry when you put it down on the
ground it's designed so you can use it
both of your children or carry it in
your hand the material is incredibly
compact and rolls up into a small stick
that easily fits in its carrying case
it's so small it even fits in the watch
pocket of you jeans we consider the Nano
bag an environmentally conscious product
as it replaces disposable plastic bags
and contains less materials than its
competitors in addition we will plant
mangrove trees with worldview
international to offset the carbon
emissions from the production of the raw
materials stitching and shipping of the
bag while you watch this film around 2
million plastic bags were consumed I
really hope that the convenience of the
carry everywhere nano bag can help you
reduce your plastic bag dependence
did you know your toothbrush misses
almost half your tooth surfaces most of
it is between your teeth so we're told
to floss but who likes flossing anyone
that's what I thought and I don't blame
you it's awkward it's time-consuming and
here's the real kicker it's not even the
most effective way to clean between your
teeth according to a recent Associated
Press report there has to be a better
way until now water flossers have been
one of the only players in the game
their tedious messy and more often than
not end up stuffed under a cabinet
somewhere toothed shower is next level
water flossing and so much more it's a
complete oral hygiene experience from
the comfort of your shower
simply attach it to your shower wall and
hook it up to the water source tooth
shower uses water pressure so no
annoying plugs or batteries are needed
it's got three different attachments for
a triple threat approach to oral care
first there's the dual headed toothbrush
push it to the front back and chewing
sides of your teeth for comprehensive
surface coverage then there's the
irrigating tip it reaches where the
toothbrush is handed it's like a water
flosser only it's in the shower so it's
no mess no fuss because it's in the
shower you'll never run out of water and
you won't have to sacrifice any precious
counterspace and let's not forget about
the revolutionary dumbest offer
irrigating and stimulating blood flow on
your gums this is a huge part of Cub
disease prevention and in less than 10
seconds you can flush out everything
between all your teeth while massaging
here we go
for the first time ever you'll actually
enjoy greeting with each attachment you
can adjust the water pressure and
temperature to your comfort level and
use with your choice of water mouthwash
or tooth whitener when you're ready to
switch attachments just remove the swab
worried about getting water everywhere
well you're in the shower so it doesn't
matter and with multiple attachments the
whole family can use tooth shell which
means better oral hygiene for everyone
that means a lot fewer expensive and
painful dental procedures and fewer
instances of gum disease you probably
won't be surprised to learn it was
created by a dental hygienist Lisa's
been deep in the tooth world for over 25
years and she realized there wasn't a
single easy convenient way for her
patients to effectively clean that to
you so she decided to design one herself
no power source no mess and because it's
in the shower to shower is easy to
integrate into your routine becoming as
second nature as washing your hair face
Lisa and her team have been hard at work
perfecting - showers design and
prototype
now they just need your help getting to
shower to the masses with the funds
raised here they'll be able to place a
bulk first order to get these made and
bring to shower to market for a whole
new approach to rural hike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
