I think I was out of town 200 days last
year I take a lot of short trips I never
want to check bags I never want to wait
that the carousel I try as much as
possible as I know a lot of people do to
travel just with carry on carry on just
wasn't good enough the bag was
impossible you couldn't walk with the
bag over anything other than just a
perfectly flat surface and the world is
not perfectly flat we all travel as
commuters we travel more often on
shorter trips like many others I
realized that something was missing a
new type of traveler was evolving this
new traveler was not being taken care of
by any part of the industry this is
where Jiro comes in
you
for one they put the center of gravity
closer
rotation axes and that makes the bag
fell dramatically later these large
access wheels strengthen the sides of
the bag and they're so slim that they
won't take any additional space from the
interior of the bag and they run over
everything
you
step-by-step we created our dream bag a
bag that's unbelievably maneuverable and
tough without added weight a bag with
all-terrain wheels and features to help
you comfortably get to where you're
going

say hello to be
hi Kickstarter's my name is Joseph and I
knew Hannes and yes we are twins and we
are cooking but there are some parts of
it that we don't like
you
place one day we had a hard day and a
lot to do I have seen that one of my
colleagues took a container placed it
underneath his cutting rod and chopped
the vegetables straight into the
container and that impressed me it was
so fast and clear that I thought I want
the chopping board that works exactly
like this I started searching for one
but I couldn't find anything so
you
enos which takes the whole system even
the separator Kickstarter's we spent the
last three years on this project will be
invested a lot of money on the patterns
and the development now we are ready to
launch and we need your help we need as
many pre-orders as possible to get the
production started and to set up our
company so if you love cooking and if
you like the idea we just say it
straight you should buy one you'll get
the very best chopping board and you
help us getting started and if you don't
like cooking at all and you surely know
someone who does
whether everyday outdoorsman or weekend
warriors we want to stay connected to
our devices we take our phones GPS
camera and electronics with us on our
outdoor adventures so we never miss a
moment and we can eventually navigate
our way home but we realized that our
devices were having a tough time keeping
up with us outside from batteries that
run out halfway through the day to
phones that can't withstand more than a
drop of water we couldn't believe there
wasn't a way for us to keep the devices
we rely on alive so we came up with a
solution Rock pack pioneers use the
world's first solar battery pack dry box
all in one product a rugged waterproof
storage solution with an integrated
battery and a solar panel with easy to
open latches you have instant access to
your devices at home charge two devices
at once keep all your device's charged
no matter where you are
you
I'm for survival if you were stranded on
the side of the road or lost in the
woods did we mention its drop proof mil
standard 810 cuts it means the rock pack
is able to withstand impact keeping
everything inside you rock back see
being someone who loves outdoors and
technology I wanted something waterproof
to keep all my stuff safe from water and
drops but charge my electronics too
that's why we created the rock pad
pioneer series The Rock pad has been
through extensive testing electronically
and physically to meet all specs
including ip67 a mil standard 810g
it's not easy to make a product that
meets these standards and we're tooled
up and ready to go all we need is your
support to help fund the first
production and production starts
immediately following the Kickstarter
thank you for being a part of the rock
pack team</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
