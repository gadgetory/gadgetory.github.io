for a high tech construction that will
make you feel awesome so let's get
started number 5 hollow wall before the
beginning of the construction make sure
the foundation is solid and even at
first spot the area you're going to
build a wall using string and ruler then
dig a deep pit up to 2 feet for a strong
foundation if the wall is going to be a
hundred centimeters the based should be
at least 50 centimeters in width flatten
the bottom of the ditch with gravel and
stones to level up the surface use a
rake and a temper now install wooden
blocks and prepare a frame for the
concrete and spread it out with a shovel
strike the iron rods
when the wet concrete turns into solid
remove the wooden frame and sweep out
now line up the concrete block along
with the rocks align all block and mark
the spot cut out excessive part if need
then apply the mortar and start placing
the block on it use the level to make
sure that the wall is going up straight
follow the staggers pattern and keep
placing the blocks fill the empty blocks
with the concrete and tamp a little to
level up
make a line of tartar using a handgun
around the inner block edge then place a
concrete slab and tamp a little
cover the bottom part of the wall using
concrete or other available material and
finally the wall is ready number four in
ground fire pit
mark the pit layout using marking paint
string and a stake dig the fire pit area
add a drain to keep safe from water pour
about two inches of paver base around
the perimeter of the fire pit circle
tamp it and set the concrete block in a
circle form pour gravel paper up to four
to six inches behind the concrete blocks
wet it tamp it and pour again to make
another layer also fill the blocks
then pour lava rocks in the fire pit so
blocks tighten up from both sides to get
level lay PVC pipes that should be one
inch in diameter horse and over PVC pipe
and also cover paver base use a screed
to flat finish remove the pipes and fill
in with sand before setting the stone
now set the pavers around the fire pit
and cover the concrete blocks to perks
seating part mark the stone and cut it
with a saw blade keep installing paver
and keep some space between all of them
take a level to keep the surface even
join the pavers and block using mortar
now add edging with landscape spikes
once the pavers are done at polymeric
sand to hold them tightly sweep the
sands in the joint and tap to make level
you can also add more sand use a leaf
blower and remove the excess whit the
paver and let them dry finally fill the
perimeter filling the pebbles or soil
place the comfortable furniture and
enjoy the warmth number three molding
assembling precast concrete stairs the
installation begins with connecting the
shock transyl type q mandrel developed
for impact sound insulation the top of
the stair is covered with transol type t
football which is a connection to
staircases once the stair frame is
completed the construction workers fill
it with concrete shock transyl type L
sheet is a damaged proofing system it
helps to combine the joints air tightly
attach a tape between two joints of the
sheet so it becomes dirt protected
the fire protection set is consisting of
a cover and cuff to achieve fire
resistance class our 90 peel off the
cover and simply apply insert the
support into the wall element until it
clicks into place
[Laughter]
the Assemble stare is ready to go
[Laughter]
place it carefully on the spot to
protect Spiral support put a steel plate
below pour concrete at the bottom of the
staircase so can next to the slab
strongly assemble an optimal
connectivity with the safety of the blue
line number two bioclimatic pergola
first locate a site and mark the
placement of four posts mark and fix the
base plate at the bottom of the post
cut out the upper end in order to clip
with another post place the pole on the
installed bolt and fix it using a driver
after placing all posts on the location
join them by connecting the top logs
for the wind panel function we require
five extra logs connect the corners with
wire to ensure the alignment of the
angles
now stretch a string and Mark spot to
fix the window clips after fixing a set
of clips carefully insert the panel's
every clip has a clip holder so it can
be connected to the next clips follow
the same process and your pergola will
be ready to shine
DIY pergola the beauty of your house
number one decorative natural stones for
outdoor flooring prepare the floor level
up the surface of need and sweep out
make sure the surface is clean and dry
start with masking the edges carefully
mask the areas that are not part of the
application process so we can avoid any
kind of damages apply the primer using a
brush or a roller what you find
comfortable with for stronger grip to
hold the stones then let it dry mix the
stones and a concrete mixer or a couple
of minutes then ports the area with
applied premier before
spread the stones around the area using
a trowel then sprinkle the decorative
luminous rocks tamp down the flush and
make sure that the top layer doesn't pop
out apply the top coat so it holds
everything properly you need some forms
to apply the stones vertically cut some
copper support application clips to hold
the forms fix the copper clips using
2-inch screws then put the wooden form
over it also apply some wooden clips to
the upper edge so the form becomes
unmovable pour the mixture of rocks and
stones from the open path after the
stones bond strongly remove the covers
here it is the gleaming outdoor floor
