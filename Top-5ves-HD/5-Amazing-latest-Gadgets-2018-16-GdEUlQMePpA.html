evolution the acquit nurses workmanship
we have tried to control and harness its
power but this was never easy
until today
our light is ready to witness a new
beginning
and now the power of light
finally a gaming mouse that puts full
control in the palm of your hand
LexA is a mouse specifically designed
for gamers of all levels so whether you
play in professional gaming tournaments
or you're just a weekend gamer LexA is
designed to be a versatile Mouse for
gamers everywhere Oh awesome the mouse
is super smooth and this is something a
lot of companies can't get it doesn't
feel like it's sliding on anything
Alexa Mouse easily allows you to perform
complex tasks at multiple dimensions
with increased precision usually you'd
have to stop in order to switch through
your items in your inventory but when
you're using the joystick you can just
simply just scroll through your items so
it does genuinely give you an advantage
when you're playing your game like
Minecraft lexif provides six degrees of
freedom via two joysticks and one laser
glide sensor it works by tilting forward
backward and side-to-side the mouse
moves with your hand it goes with it
that's a very big plus this mouse but
actually here a competitive advantage in
gameplay the laser sensor lets the user
control the mechanical gliding at very
high speeds while maintaining the best
accuracy the tilting allows you to have
more three-dimensional movement all
within the mouse itself so you can
combine multiple movements into your
Mouse seamlessly it has a joystick on
the side so if I'm playing and I want to
zoom in to shoot someone it
automatically goes into the zoom mode I
don't have to like double-click on the
mouse I'm kind of shy are they gonna
give you
that lexif shape is designed in a way
that buttons are very accessible while
still providing a solid feeling the
sides are covered in the finest rubber
enabling a strong grip when needed it's
comfortable it's smooth I wasn't ready
for it
the lexif gaming mouse also provides a
separate model specifically designed for
left-handed gamers what truly sets the
Lexx it mouse apart from its competitors
is its conveniently positioned joystick
on the side of the mouse along with its
internal mechanical to axis joystick
which allows users to operate the mouse
to tilt or to use as a joystick offering
two options in one this mini joystick
features mechanical feedback forces that
only regular-sized joysticks used to
offer making this the first of its kind
the joystick allows me to go through the
entire map which is actually really cool
it's great it's gonna make a massive
difference in big games oh yeah you can
use the joystick much smaller here lexis
control panel allows you to customize
and configure the settings specific to
what you're comfortable with providing
you with various shortcuts and once you
configure the settings you won't need to
configure them again our goal is to
bring the lexa mouse to gamers
everywhere but we need your help please
support our campaign so that you too can
take advantage of the innovative
features our gaming mouse will offer you
elevate your game play with
one of my favorite things about cooking
is chopping and slicing there's
something so satisfying about the
geometry of it all but when you're
cutting tons of cherry tomatoes or
grapes it can get a little bit tedious
that's why I created the slice X now I
look forward to cutting cherry tomatoes
grapes whatever any excuse is a good
excuse to cut small round fruit now
here's how it works
pour in your fruit of choice slice them
perfectly in half in one easy motion
empty and repeat it's that simple
slice X is so easy to use but don't take
my word for it see what other people are
saying about slice X slice X makes it
easy to cut cherry tomatoes and grapes
along the core just like we do it here
I've cut thousands of grapes for my
girls and I'm about to start again
anything that makes food safer for them
and makes life easier for me is a good
thing
the two-part design makes slicing super
compact so it fits just about anywhere
we've tested numerous prototypes and we
finally feel as though we've balanced
form function and manufacturer ability
in a way worthy of your kitchen
countertop and the material that we've
used is the same recyclable material
that's used in professional-grade
cutting boards what's nice about that is
it's easy on your knives will it bring a
smile and a sense of satisfaction to you
and your friends who love to cook I
think it will I want you to experience a
whole new joy preparing delicious food
for your family take advantage of our
earlybird offer an order a slice X today
and consider ordering one for your
friends and family
well I hope you enjoyed that journey cuz
I certainly did
now let's make this one to remember but
as always slim down and stay secure with
slim hi Otto friends my name is Walter
and this is Marcell your to outer
inspired Swiss engineers and the
founders of pole or moon our goal is to
revolutionize the outer sleeping and to
eliminate the conventional sleeping bags
so what are the problems with sleeping
bags and sleeping mats hardly any
freedom of movement for arms and legs
sleeping on side is uncomfortable
abdominal sleep is hardly possible
slipping off the sleeping mat the pillow
is constantly shifting when the outside
temperature rises you start to sweat or
you freeze where the zipper is opened
all these problems lead to poor sleep in
comfort parlament solves all these
problems with its new sleep system the
polar mode tracking sleep system offers
best sleeping comfort from 0 up to 25
degrees Celsius so your benefits are
sleeping comfort just like home
temperature regulation in the sleeping
room spacious warm sleeping and storage
room all this promotes increased
recovery and maximum performance next
day so this is our first prototype the
sleep system is ready in only a few
simple steps
and here the packings of the polar
mooned outer shell
liner and poles this is the mattress
which can be used for the polar mode
system as well as for a conventional
synthetic fiber sleeping bag we use the
capital to finance the development and
the production of the first series the
market lounge is planned for the fourth
quarter of 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
