being a fluffy rabbit it's not an easy
job you don't want to be too soft you
know but all that it's no big deal it's
part of where we are no the hardest part
is when you're not together when I get
stuck into like the sofa the Bermuda
Triangle of toys that that really breaks
my heart and I'm not talking about the
times when I was locked outside left
alone on the street or who knows where I
just want to scream Lisa I'm here I'm
under the sofa Lisa but of course she
can't hear me I'm just a fluffy rabbit
till that faded day at first I thought
what is that what is this thing and then
it dawned on me I got a new partner
Oliva my new voice
I know that if I need to be found Oliva
will start hooting
and if I slip away believe that will
tell team parents to find more than a
hundred feet away of their phone imagine
that I can't get lost anymore not
getting lost and shining in the dark is
great and everything but like I said I
now have a voice and trust me that voice
can do
when Lisa is up believe I can enact
riveting stories to parents pick a story
in the app or record one with their own
voice to keep it real
alia Bhatt works everywhere even without
a phone Lisa can just press leave his
head to start the last save story but
what I like the most is that I have a
long-term partner the smart kind I get
to see Lisa grow with a liebe team
parents can adapt and download new
content to make sure liebe learns enough
to keep Lisa interested since alia Bhatt
joined the team it became super easy for
Lisa to fall asleep we can play so many
songs team parents just chooses one in
the app and plays it with the Libas
nightlight Lisa can always find me in
bed and fend off the nightmares of the
dark all this was made possible thanks
to the Smarty crew smarty crew needs
your help so all the Teddy's and the
fluffy rabbits of the world get verily
bus'
Lisa we're here just goes to show how
easy it is to find us now
ouch not the ears we talked about this
we are now ready to initialize body but
we need your help to gather the minimum
quantity order to start production by
taking our campaign they will be part of
the first community that takes care of
the dreams and of their choice we count
on you Bacchus
that is a time to get up yet
these days children my smartphones
tablets and handheld devices a much more
attractive to them than watching TV an
addiction to the use of the devices is
not a healthy perspective either body or
mind think about this issue we came up
with an idea that there should be a more
positive interactive device for children
introducing the agar AR projector it is
our belief that great idea come from
grid camera such as grid media and this
camera should be adorable cute inovative
and a nurture a child's imagination this
is our agar it looks like an egg but
your child it could be a monster or at
first a monster and now a pretty girl
and before it was a pretty girl by in
rarity it's a boy although at first it
may seem like just a toy we have
developed this way to preserve a child's
innocence agar was built with our
consideration for the whole children
such as knowing that children are
naturally sensitive to light so we have
scared projection brightness down to 100
Loomis to ensure a child's comfort and
safety agar also supports a smart
lighting system which automatically
adjust its brightness to pay
it's Ciroc day agar is tailored for
children so it's very easy to operate
with our safe contact charging system
using magnetic pole connector tech
knowledge offer a simple fast and safe
charging operation even while charging
anchor remains of the KU and cute
intuitive and versatile agar is made for
children to enjoy with just a few case
of operation which is demonstrated in
the design of agar remote controller our
sincere hope is that there could be a
screen tailor designs our children</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
