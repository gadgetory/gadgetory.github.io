I remember as a child I was watching
this for hours okay maybe just four
minutes but still it fascinated me how
cool it looks strange geometrical shapes
and vivid colors and the fact that it
lived inside the same box where Star
Wars and back to the future so he just
didn't made any sense to me but I loved
it my name is Simon and I'm a designer
from Hungary and I've designed a lamp
inspired by the world famous television
test card a lamp that symbolizes a whole
era of analog television history in a
unique way and also cherish so many
sweet childhood memories I've spent over
a year experiment different production
technologies materials and locations and
finally I've got the right balance
between quality cost and scalability the
language you can see here is made in
Italy it comes with a wooden metal stand
an easily replaceable standard light
bulb two years of aren t and it will be
available in classic color and grayscale
versions so for more information please
read the description below and if you
like this lamp help us make it join our
campaign and let's celebrate a whole era
of analog television history together
you
ladies and gentlemen please welcome Todd
Henderson of 109 Baker field

with your support will be able to
fine-tune our designs based on
manufacturing requirements and start
mass production to bring better spot to
you join our campaign and be part of a
safer freer and better internet
experience we are all curious each child
peeking through a gap in the fence every
scientist hunting for an answer and all
the lovers staring up with the sky while
dreaming or while searching we always
turned to the night sky filled with the
wonder of a billion stars and the
infinite space around us all of us look
up but how many of us can capture it
frame it bring it home share it now you
can capture space in the palm of your
hand that's why we meet tiny one the
world's smallest smartest and most
social astronomy camera redesigning one
you can capture the nice guys never
before you no longer have to worry about
expensive equipment or advanced
photography knowledge just point and
shoot we developed proprietary noise
reduction technology that allows you to
effectively improve image quality over
various environmental conditions without
sacrificing on image
this couple with a powerful sensor fits
in this sleek and compact form factor
that means that the tiny one sees better
at night and fits perfectly in your
pocket p program and augmented reality
star map to help you locate planets and
constellations easily the tiny one is
also compatible with all the lenses out
there and even telescopes did we mention
it takes selfies too it connects
seamlessly to your smartphone and allows
direct sharing to your favorite social
media so the tiny one is not just about
the night sky it's about you like Neil
deGrasse Tyson said when I look up at
the night sky I know that we are part of
this universe we are in this universe
but more importantly the universe is
within us
we run you to not only be able to see
the infinite expanse of the universe but
to be able to capture it in a way you
rarely get a chance to we have been
working on a tiny one for the past two
years to make a show that RV easy and
accessible to all now we need your help
to bring tiny one into production and
into the hands of every curious Explorer
the technology to transmit data
wirelessly also called RFID is
everywhere nowadays it offers
contactless data transmission with
rfid-enabled credit and debit cards
passport driving license store cards and
more providing amazing convenience and
time-saving for both consumers and
businesses alike
but there is also a big problem with
RFID technology your data can be stolen
contactless to write from your wallet so
how is this possible fraudsters and
thieves can easily acquire equipment
that can access the data stored on your
cards from up to several meters away so
they can clone your credit card take
money from your bank or use your
identity for a host of criminal
activities and it's getting worse in
2014 alone 31 million US consumers had
their credit cards hacked over three
times the number affected in 2013 so
there has not been an RFID security
system that can truly keep your card
data safe until now hi my name is Thomas
and I would like to present you the most
advanced data protection for your
contactless credit cards and
rfid-enabled documents volt card
combining cutting-edge technology with
massive energy and developed on the same
principles as military jamming systems
vault card is the most advanced RFID
protection solution ever designed it
virtually ensures absolute safety of
your cards other products have tried to
protect your cards by covering them in
metal foil unfortunately it doesn't work
with high-powered scanning devices and
so how does this work hard work just
over 1 millimeter thick you simply place
a single world card in the middle of
your wallet like so now all your
rfid-enabled cards are protected within
one and a half inches on either side
your wallet can be up to 3 inches thick
which as you can see is more than
adequate both cards switch is on
automatically when it senses the
electromagnetic signal emitted by
hackers RFID scanner the stronger the
signal from the fixed scanner the
stronger jamming vault card will
generate so your rfid-enabled cards will
remain protected even against the most
powerful scanning devices and RFID
scheme existence
when you use your cards as usual just
make sure to hold them at least eight
inches away from vault card what's more
volt card harnesses energy extremely
efficiently and doesn't require a
battery for its separation well it does
it mean that wall card actually lasts
and protects forever that's right join
our community so everyone can enjoy a
future of unmatched arif ID security
with a wall card in your wallet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
