reflect those are technical sports socks
that give you visibility in motion in a
large area of high reflective material
around the ankle which makes you very
visible to drivers walking running or
cycling in low light reflect those will
be the best sports safety product
available they have the largest high
reflective area in the most effective
location they don't just make you
visible at night reflect those are also
packed with the best technical features
of leading cycling and running socks
there's heat venting mesh on the top it
is made with moisture wicking yarn that
is lightweight and durable
it has our supporting compression and we
use it a locking technology I'm Ben
O'Brien creator of reflect O's I'm an
engineer that spent five years in
product development working on
reflective trim items for apparel used
for brand logos for companies like Nike
and Adidas using the eyes natural
ability to detect movement I created a
reflective sock which uses the motion of
your legs to draw attention to you and
to make you visible to drivers without
wearing a highway workers uniform or
miner's lamp
your chance being struck and killed as a
pedestrian increased by over 1000% after
dark because drivers just don't see you
according to a 2010 study cyclists who
wore a reflective vest were identified
50% correct with reflective markings and
strips around their ankles it jumped in
90% these results are explained by our
eyes being wired to notice movement even
though reflective vest surface has a
large reflective area it is also
stationary while your legs are in
constant motion helping drivers to
identify the object as a moving cyclists
not just a street sign or male body
typical running gear has a small amount
of reflective that is just for aesthetic
for branding reflective spray solutions
are not permanent and are not using the
mirrored reflective technology high
reflective straps can't be thrown in the
wash of a smaller surface area and are
prone to move around creating pressure
and discomfort it's time for
high-performance sportswear to not just
keep you dry and comfortable to give you
visibility in motion once we're fully
funded there will be about two months to
send out socks the backers please help
