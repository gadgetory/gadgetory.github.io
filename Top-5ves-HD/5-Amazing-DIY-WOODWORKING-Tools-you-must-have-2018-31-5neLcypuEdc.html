rocklers award-winning pro lift is an
upgrade to the upgrade with two
patent-pending innovations that enable
you to change bits faster than ever
the patent-pending snap lock mechanism
lets you pop out the durable aluminum
insert ring with a push of a button
providing quicker access to your routers
collet you don't need any tools to
remove the insert and there are no
screws to keep track of when you are
done changing the bit the insert ring
snaps securely back in place and you're
locked and ready under the table the pro
lifts two-speed gearbox makes adjusting
the bit height quicker without
sacrificing precision the patent-pending
quick gear dial enables you to raise and
lower the bit four times faster than a
typical router lift so it's great for
coarser adjustments or to bring the bit
up to be changed the fine adjustment
dial can be zeroed out and with the
smooth direct drive mechanism and
incremental markings you can sneak up on
the precise setting for perfect cuts and
once you're there the pro lifts patented
threaded bushing holds the setting
without the need for a separate locking
dial so you can get right to work the
pro lift has a 3/8 inch thick machined
aluminum plate and it's available in two
sizes to fit Rockler as well as other
common router table openings the
aluminum housing is sized to fit four
point two inch diameter router bodies
like those of Porter cables three and a
quarter horsepower routers but adapter
collars are available separately to fit
most other common routers if you're
looking for our router lift that's built
to hold up under daily use
check out the award-winning Rockler pro
lift mobile solutions perfect circle is
a specialized tool that attaches to your
router in order to cut precision inside
and outside diameter circles the perfect
circle tool is machined from half-inch
aircraft-grade 6061 billet aluminum in
order to be robust yet light and handle
fabrication tasks for years to come in
order to use the perfect circle we start
with removing the base plate from our
router the perfect circle is designed to
match up with the popular Porter cable
router bolt pattern
but you can also modify it by drilling
your own mounting holes for your
particular router next we drill an
eighth inch hole into the center of our
workpiece in this particular example
we'll be making a subwoofer cutout hole
this eighth inch hole gives us a spot to
position our eighth inch center pin on
the perfect circle next we loosen the
perfect circle adjustment knob and then
adjust our router to position I've drawn
the lines on the workpiece that tell me
the diameter of the hole that I'm trying
to make once adjusted we tighten the
adjustment knob next we turn on the
router and we can plunge it into the
workpiece as we rotate the router around
the center point the router cuts a
perfect circle their great feature of
this tool is how much of a range of
circles they can cut circles as small as
one inch diameter are possible for even
larger circles we can flip around the
centering pin slide this allows us to
cut circles that have a diameter as
large as 30 inches clear cut stop guys
unlike typical feather boards for where
you require one set to hold the stock
down and another set to hold it against
the fence these stock guides control
your stock in both directions with one
tool they just very quickly requiring
only one knob to be loosened to adjust
each guide they have two and three
quarters of an inch of total travel and
they can accommodate stock to 9/16 of an
inch below the mounting T slot to adjust
your clear cut stock guides slide the
stock into position applying the
pressure that you desire against the
stock and then lock the knobs you're
ready to go for long term routing the
clamping knobs can be tightened with a
quarter-inch allen key clear-cut stock
guides are designed to be used on router
tables and shaper tables now we're gonna
raise our router bit for the desired cut
and then lock it in position for
woodworkers you don't have a t slot on
their fence there's an accessory
mounting plate available for shop made
router table fences notice how the
urethane guide rollers pull the stock
into the fence
keep it securely in this position your
stock is continuously pulled towards the
fence the rollers are mounted to one-way
bearings prevent any kickback the Chi
rollers on the clear-cut stock guides
are set at a 5 degree angle this pulls
the stock towards the fence as it also
holds it now machining gangrene on the
short side of a board it can be
difficult even at the best of times and
usually you can't get a set of feather
boards there to help hold it in position
you can machine an grain with confidence
with clear-cut stock guides because they
hold the stock to the fence at the fence
as the stock is held securely in all
directions you could achieve smoother or
precise cuts with clear-cut stock guides
holding a long board to the fence while
you're starting your cut can be
extremely difficult clear-cut stock
guides are like an extra set of hands
pulling the stock towards the fence as
you concentrate on feeding it forward
