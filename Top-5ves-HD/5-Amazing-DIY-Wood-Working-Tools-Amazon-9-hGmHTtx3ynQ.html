makes it easy to hold work pieces of all
shapes and sizes without the clamp
getting in the way the in line clamp
does this with a low-profile design that
applies pressure from the side rather
than from overhead so the clamp stays
out of the way as you work the inline
clamps stays in place with a peg that
fits into any three quarter inch
diameter hole that makes the clamp a
perfect companion to the Craig mobile
project Center and allows you to get
more from any work bench that's equipped
with three quarter inch bench dog holes
or you can drill through quarter inch
holes in any work surface to add the
convenience of Craig inline clamping
using the inline clamp is easy simply
turn the contoured easy-to-grip dial to
move the push rod and press the clamp
shoe against your workpiece that makes
it easy to dial on the clamping pressure
you need up to 250 pounds of clamping
force the low-profile clamp shoe is just
1/2 inch thick so it stays out of the
way while you work the clients chute
design holds tight against work pieces
of all shapes and sizes including
corners and round edges and because you
can rotate the inline clamp
it's easy to direct that clamping
pressure in whatever direction you need
with the Craig inline clamp you get the
helping hand you need when you need it
with the versatility you want for a wide
variety of tasks visit us online at
Craig tool comm to learn more about the
Craig inline clamp as well as our other

install a trim around windows and doors
is as easy as measure mark
in install with a miles craft trim 45 to
use the trim 45 start by holding the
button upwards to adjust the reveal
gauge to your desired reveal around the
door or window
the reveal gauge has a maximum reveal of
1/2 inch and can be adjusted for a
shallower reveal in 1/8 inch increments
once you've determined you reveal push
the button back down to lock in the
desired setting
to install the trim for your project
start by aligning the reveal gauge to
the jam corner and make your horizontal
and vertical marks using the edges of
the reveal gauge scale the front and
back of the trim 45 are used to make all
marks or measurements for your jams and
trim casings then repeat this for all
four corners then to measure for your
projects trim nail the trim 45 in place
using the two small holes just above the
reveal gauge to insert nails then using
the tape measure slots in the body the
trim 45 measure the distance between
your marks to determine the finish trim
length
to help hold the tape measure in place
there's two magnets next to each of the
tape measure slots after you've measured
the links to your trim pieces set your
miter saw for a 45-degree cut and cut
one end of the trim casing then using
that 45-degree end you just cut use the
built-in trim plate to clamp your 45
degree miter cut piece onto the trim
plate with the backside of your trim
piece facing up then clamp the trim 45
to the backside of the trim using the
trim plate to keep the trim 45 in
position then using the indicated tape
measure slot measure the finished trim
length in the market
next reset you reveal gauge to zero flip
the trim 45 over and make a 45-degree
angle mark on the trim at the finish
length using the 45 degree angle head
your mark should start at the corner of
the reveal gauge and follow the 45
degree angle after marking the finished
length cut the trim along the angle mark
repeat the cutting action for the
remaining trim pieces and then install
with the miles craft trim 45 installing
trim around windows and doors is as easy
as measure mark and install welcome to
the thingamajig scribing tool here
thingamajig we promise you that the
scribing tool will be your new best mate
same your time and always getting you an
accurate finish here are some basic
information to help you understand how
the scribing tool can make your life
easier and your workmanship 5 star
when fitting the blades to your tool
simply unscrew the grub screw and place
the blade onto the blade holder when we
tightening the screw ensure you don't
over tighten this can be done by using
the long point of the LMT
provided with the tool the foot pad
cover simply trips on and off use this
when describing to these things it along
prefinished services like painted walls
remaining it blue mark in the surface
due to its thickness the foot pad cover
was the measurement of the ruler on the
shaft of the tool you must compensate
there's written reminder of what to do
via laminated benchtop is blue
we will not be perfections in the new
service of the vegetable
the base stop is placed in the bazaar
and the biggest gap between the base
drop and the world is like beta this is
the amount to
this can be done with a rule about
pricing between religions
Gaby
rotate the tool shop
still the white ship types of the
interventional you'll note with the red
color is hidden
so we'll be sitting for three
millimeters to compensate for the
footpad cover
thickness the locknut is then tighten
the lock the blades at the required
height now simply hold the tool so does
the 90 degrees to the bench drop move
the tool across the wall apply a slight
pressure against the blade to commence
mark
continue this process you're happy you
can see the scribed line now use an
electric planer and trim off the excess
bench top to the scribed line ensuring
you don't go past the line you will
notice one of the benefits of describing
tool is that the laminate does not chip
fastest
due to the striving field blade creating
a break in the surface now the benchtop
is replaced shows a little bit here we
see a toothpick payment
hiccup front displacement McCool and
sent in a level position the guy in the
flights of ascribing fool perfectly
amendments
scribing tillage inhaled
take a front slide the tubing
in three
why does not chip
rather pick up front
describing a sniffling so fast and
accurate poster features describing tool
hunting each one hand to operate
provides the flush join winter feeding
cabinetry skirting boards and more
scribes internal corners with these
groups on laminate painted surfaces soft
metals stone wood and more you know
you'll appreciate the value of having
the thingamajig precision scribing
woodpeckers new knuckle clamp with its

spring feature bring this hold down
clamp to a whole new level
it will help woodworkers save time while
improving safety and precision the
knuckle clamp with its multi lock
endpoints enables you to deal with
different workpiece thicknesses and
shapes this capability is enhanced by a
pair of pivoting flat feet with molded
rubber pads which applies targeted
pressure to lock down the workpiece
without marring its surface molded from
reinforced polycarbonate this clamp is
virtually indestructible the adjustable
spring lifts feature starts with locking
the clamps bolt to your track then
adjusting the spring nut to bring your
clamping pan to about 1/8 of an inch
from the top of your board tighten the
locking knob to lock it in place
loosen the locking knob and the spring
lifts the clapping pad off the board
allowing for movement and the clamp
stays in place now that's cool and with
