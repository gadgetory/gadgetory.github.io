our three designs we believe the timing
and the choice of equipment are two
important ingredients for an amazing
photo and changing lenses is an
important part of the creative process
but as we all know it sucks and we were
sick of dropped lengths of bulky camera
bags and running around with multiple
camera bodies so we created the toilet
you
the trial and lets you carry up to three
different lenses at the same time and
change your glass has never been faster
no matter your lens combination the
center of gravity will automatically
adjust to be as low as possible and the
auto friction mechanism will keep the
trial and stable while walking or
running in order to use the trial else
you still be attached to housing to the
bail clip using the quick-release remove
the lens from the camera attached it to
an empty slot for the trailer find your
desired length and then finally just
drop the lens cap on the Memphis off on
the trailer this protects your lenses
from dust and you'll never misplace your
lens caps again my name is Jana Sena and
I'm a photographer and the inventor of
the trailer together with my brother and
our 1200 amazing backers we made a trial
and a reality just a couple of months
ago we are now in the production process
things are looking great and we've been
on schedule since day one during the
last campaign we were unable to offer
shipping to the US and we promised that
we would make it up to you guys and here
we are happy to announce that we are
finally able to offer the Thailand for
our friends in Spain this new campaign
also carries a unique second chance for
the rest of the world to get the
challenge for this one construction
offer pre-order your Thailand through
the Kickstarter page and thank you for
your support on our mission to make life
easier for photography
