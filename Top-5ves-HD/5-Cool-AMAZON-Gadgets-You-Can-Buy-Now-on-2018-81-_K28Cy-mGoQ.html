No
everyone has it'd be cool to help keep
things cold but you got to keep filling
them up with ice and that gets really oh
they're too heavy to move so your back
ends up wrenched and when all that ice
melts your food and subtract well now
there's a better way introducing the
revolutionary chill chest
the lightweight foldable cooler that
keeps everything ice-cold for up to 10
hours without any ice at all and it
weighs less than 2 pounds so it's easy
to take with you wherever you go
perfect for backyard parties and
barbecues whether you're tailgating or
enjoying a cold one at the game even on
a hot beach ice cream stays ice-cold and
ready to enjoy the secret is our
temperature lock technology within two
oven polypropylene cells that trap that
called inside and keep it there
look we filled these two coolers with
frozen foods then returned hours later
the ice cream and chill chest is still
fresh frozen and ready to enjoy but the
other cooler nothing but a warm soupy
mess strong enough to hold over 100
times its weight yet light enough for
Grandma to lift two of them up over her
head roomy enough to keep all your food
and drinks ice-cold for up to 10 hours
best of all it pulls flat and stores
away in seconds keep one in your car and
you won't need to rush home from
shopping great for cold drinks on the
boat and keeping today's catch nice and
fresh and here's more good news
chill chest also locks in the
temperature on hot foods keeping them
piping hot for hours so it's perfect for
getting hot dishes to parties even after
being run over by a four and a half ton
truck chill just works perfectly with
our friends it's a very simple product
but it's absolutely amazing it's an egg
tray
that goes in your fridge and hold eggs
that'll actually 14 of them and it
actually keeps track of how many eggs
you have at any given time so let's say
you're at the market and you want to
know well do I need eggs or not you just
look at your phone you look at the app
and it says you need eggs but the best
feature the feature I think is most cool
there's little LEDs next to you
and it tells you what the oldest egg is
and you just sort of take it and you see
the next LED pops on tells you that's
the next oldest egg yep and then you go
and then BAM cooking some eggs very
simple the first of a long line of GE
quirky products that are coming out and
a very wonderful one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
