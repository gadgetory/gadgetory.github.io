could connect to any device with a
single cable are you ready for ten times
more speed and a two times more powerful
cable introducing Magneto
crafted with the highest quality
materials including rare earth neodymium
magnets 18 karat gold plated connectors

combining the latest advanced circuitry
technology for smarter and safer
charging on both ends the world's first
groundbreaking patent-pending reversible
cross device USB 3.0 magnetic cable
featuring 10 times faster data transfer
speed and a 2 times more powerful cable
compared to a traditional USB 2.0 cable
I harnessing the force of nature
you can effortlessly insert the magnetic
tip to both ends of the device and the
magneto cable immediately magnetizes and
snaps to the devices the breaks are
concepts of the both end magnetic
connector cable successfully opens the
door to multi device connectivity for
SuperSpeed charging and data sync
meaning you can cross connect almost any
device between USB Lightning Android
type C mini USB and beyond
Magneto was born out of the creators
frustration with our daily lives bounced
by all the different types of devices we
first created a prototype by putting
some existing product components
together and we spent months with
countless hours to complete the design
we knew this was going to be a great
product that we got to share with the
world to reinvent a new standard of USB
cables we have accomplished the most
sophisticated test
combined with the highest quality
materials to design a state-of-the-art
USB cable
our team has chosen the largest
manufacturer that's made over a hundred
million electronic devices for many of
the top brands to build this awesome
design and we're ready to go we need
your support for our campaign to help us
bring this super charging cable to the
market be part of us as contributors you
are welcome to write us with a new
suggestion or new ideas for further
improvement of magneto within the period
of the campaign magneto is the world's
most powerful magnetic USB cable for
everything
introducing Illuma ball the night-light
for your toilet
a Louisville small and clean design
needs no more blinding midnight lights
wandering in the dark or late night
misses and messes easy to install and
fits any toilet motion activated and
offers nine color settings at the touch
of a button door bathroom will never be
the same
visit us at a Louisville comm to learn
more the convenient squeeze tubes we use
for many products at home and at work
has been around forever but as
convenient as they are it's impossible
to completely empty them
until now we all have accepted the
struggle to get everything out of these
tubes
amazingly they can take up to 20% of
their precious contents to the landfill
look around your house how many tubes
can you find you'll be surprised
let's end this nonsense once and for all
and start saving you money squeeze tubes
get ready to feel the big squeeze hello
I'm Steve and I'm Clark
we're mechanical engineers from Denver
Colorado we're pros at designing new
products the idea of wasting anything
really bugs me the squeeze tubes no
matter how hard I try I know I'm not
getting everything I've paid for it
there are a lot of products out there
that come in tubes and many of are
really expensive so a few years ago we
set out to design a product that could
completely empty any - including
medications cosmetics and moisturizers
sunscreens art supplies food items and
of course toothpaste and today we are
excited to announce the world and we
have finally created these simplest and
best way to empty tubes the big squeeze
is a patented hand tool specifically
designed to eliminate waste and save you
money on all your tubes here's how it
works take any partially empty tube open
the jaws if you enter the tube in
between the gears squeeze the handles
and turn the crank the gears do all the
work it's that easy all the contents are
pushed forward ensuring to get every
last bit it took many rounds of
prototypes to arrive at the ultimate
solution but we knew it had to feel
comfortable in your hand be extremely
easy to operate so we spent months
fine-tuning the ergonomics for a great
grip and a quality feel it's also
engineered to last a lifetime with
diecast sink handles and extruded
aluminum gears to handle the toughest of
tubes we are proud to say that the big
squeeze will be backed with a lifetime
warranty and made entirely in the USA
it's a tool just like a can opener it
doesn't stay with the tube you just use
it as needed one big squeeze around your
household or business you have all your
tubes an extended lease on life it's
like squeezing money right back in your
wallet get every single ounce out of all
your tubes help kick-start the big
squeeze today
with your backing the big squeeze can
become a big success thank you for your
support
welcome to hover sitting reinvented my
name is John get away and became a
personal trainer because I wanted to
help people live healthier lives
unfortunately many of them fell short in
terms of weight loss and conditioning I
needed help so I contacted my friend dr.
Ron Mochizuki I told John that
exercising 3 times a week is not enough
to offset the effects of sitting all day
in addition simply standing may not be
the answer research is showing that the
real culprit may be a lack of movement
whether you're sitting or whether you're
standing so Ron my young friend John and
I set out to find a way to bring
movement to sitting in a way that would
not be distracting and that would
increase productivity 36 months of
rigorous prototype testing and
development have finally allowed us to
achieve our goal create cover
after extensive testing conducted at the
Mayo Clinic hover was neat certified by
the Mayo neat stands for non-exercise
activity thermogenesis calorie burning
hover comes in two models and is easy to
set up and use research has found that
low intensity NEET type activities are
more effective for successful and
sustainable weight loss than short
periods of intense exercise and are
important for overall health an optional
activity tracker allows you to measure
your daily activity no matter how you
choose to use hover hover provides
natural unconscious movement for a wide
range of people who spend a long time
sitting whether at a desk or at home it
just feels very normal
like if you're carving there may be in a
like snowboarding as well to get in
better shape the obliques and the legs
and be productive so jagged always been
my personal trainer for seven years and
and I must admit he's a terrific trainer
but I had no idea that he would invent
something as useful and as helpful to my
conditioning as the hover I found hover
to be different in a couple different
ways one was it's something I can easily
jump in and use it required no active
thought I mean been able to use it on an
ongoing basis every day and it's now
habit we're now ready to fund the mold
for our first large ingestion breath so
we're asking for your help to purchase
those phones start together we can bring
however to life thank you for your help
I spent seven years working as a
mechanic so I saw firsthand the kind of
handheld lights and area lights that
were being used they were cheap with dim
underpowered bulbs and flimsy
construction I'd constantly be buying
new ones because they always fell apart
even with newer LED lights the
electronics often broke creating an
unreliable light
I remember thinking then that car shops
deserved a better life and so did
truckers electricians first responders
anyone else who works with their hands
when I started working at Big Ass
solutions I knew this was a project that
I wanted to pursue I came up with a
rough concept a handheld area light that
was bright cordless portable durable a
life that was over engineered to stand
up to years of abuse and harsh
conditions I pitched the idea to our CEO
Carrie Smith and he actually encouraged
me to pursue this project and see where
it led and now after two years and
countless hours of work we have the
big-ass light bar we wanted a light that
was bright as hell with five thousand
lumen at maximum output it's everything
you need up to 48 hours of continuous
light on battery power the light bar
itself is made of a chemically resistant
side tel glass filled nylon that means
that you can spray it off with common
chemicals the shape of the light itself
was actually designed to prevent it from
rolling away if you dropped it or set it
on the hood of a car
with its ip66 rating you can take it
outside and not worry if it gets rained
on we know that you were going to toss
around the light bar so we overmolded it
in key areas with the technology called
versa flex to be shock absorbent
now we're closer than ever to making the
big-ass light bar in reality we need
your help for the final stage though
production if your assistance will be
able to begin manufacturing and start
shipping the light bar to all
contractors first responders soldiers
police officers and anyone else who
demands a product that they can take to
hell in that in return you'll be the
first customers to receive the
revolutionary big-ass light bar this has
been a passionate project for me it's
something that I've worked on for years
and I'm very proud of what we've come up
with it is absolutely the best handheld
area light in the world bar none</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
