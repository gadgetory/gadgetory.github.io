of solar car racing since 1988 our team
consults eleven vehicles and race across
two continents collectively our vehicles
have driven over 50,000 kilometers
powered by the Sun we are a completely
student-run organization proudly
representing over 12 departments of the
university water
for our twelfth generation solar cars
we've fused everything we've learned
from 30 years of solar car racing with a
beautiful user focuses on over the past
year our team has poured over 20,000
hours into design and engineering
striving to create a vehicle that is
safe reliable efficient and
user-friendly our hope is that midnight
sun 12 will blur the lines between
traditional solar cars and everyday
consumer vehicles
we're partway through our manufacturing
phase in our cars starting to take shape
our goal is to drive 2,700 kilometers
for Nebraska to Oregon in the American
Solar Challenge of summer we need your
help to get there the defining
characteristic of any solar car is the
state-of-the-art solar array our solar
panels are custom-made and typically
cost upwards of $20,000 money raised in
this campaign will go directly towards
funding our solar cells join us in
celebrating 30 years of solar car racing
at the University of Waterloo your
funding in this campaign will help make
our dream a reality
I'm a single capture in a single moment
in time a kick stir I'm Kris inventor of
isolate for nearly 20 years I've made a
living as an artisan photographer
there's been a lot of innovation in the
transition from film to digital strobes
batteries LEDs are cheaper more powerful
than they've ever been
yet we use them which the way we did in
the 1950s what if I told you there was a
new way to light your photos for the
first time ever you can adjust real
light after the shutter has snout for
the past two and a half years we've been
developing a technology that does just
that
to show you what isolate is all about I
brought my friend lolly in she's a
photographer and she's gonna use isolate
for the first time so how does it work
well it fits in your light like any
other softbox or beauty dish what makes
isolate unique for these special optical
components that encode the light these
are used generally in scientific and
medical imaging but never before in
conventional photography all the
information is captured in a single raw
file how is that even possible
the isolate Hardware encodes the light
into very specific wavelengths and then
we can easily decode it with our
software essentially splitting them into
editable layers once you've adjusted the
light you edit as you would any other
photo
instead of pushing pixels you're playing
with light that convey to you some penis
so now you've seen what Isolite can do
and how it works and now we need your
help
depending on how much you pledged you
could receive some great extras unique
opportunities and of course be the first
experiment with isolate so please back
our project today share this video with
your friends and don't forget to check
out I select photo where you can play
with this unique technology and try it
out for yourself thanks for watching and
we can't wait to see when you create
what is the difference between connect
and the inductive charger that now Apple
eight support
first of all inductive charging is slow
okay and the second thing is that it is
wired Wireless it is but it's still
wired it still need to be powered
somehow so that really doesn't make that
super portable now does it
so compared to me Ricky connect that if
I'll just put it into the connect case
and do again with one hand so all right
okay now this is portable now your
charging portable and you need no cable
and it does a lot of other beautiful
things but it works with as you can see
with an iPhone and it works with a
galaxy you don't have to carry a cable
this is the difference between the
wireless system the inductive charger
and Mirek you connect charger so those
rings are transferring power data and
audio and usually what I do is actually
sitting like that run wise in my pocket
you know
sits like that in my pocket I mean the
magnet is strong enough by the way I was
joking to show that it's all
it's also strong enough to hold it from
the outside but you know I mean usually
what I do is I put it like this and
snuck it's already going into position
and it's charging and when I want to
take it out I just take it out I go like
this with a little twist and it goes out
and I have it smooth in my hand and I
never have to do I have to have this
load you know extra load on my phone
my name is dr. ken baler I've been in
cybersecurity for the last 21 years and
my last key roles have been chief
security officer at Symantec and head of
compliance worldwide for uber in the
next three years is going to be 60
billion IOT devices in people homes
that's 50 devices per individual home
every one of them will be running a
different version of firmware will be
cameras all sorts of things and most of
them will not have security built in but
they're on your network under capable of
interacting with your private data and
stealing your information so imagine if
you could have one box that you didn't
even have to understand you could just
plug it into your network would monitor
every single one of those devices check
on them make sure they're doing the
right thing and nothing suspicious is
going on
that's akita it's privacy security
simplicity smart home devices have made
our lives more comfortable but comfort

it and it's not just your camera every
IOT device in your smart home can be
hacked your thermostat can tell the
hackers if someone is in the house and
your friendly Smart Home Hub might be
listening even when you're not asking it
to once those devices are hacked well
your computers a hackers playground and
once they're inside your computer they
can see everything you want to keep
private

home network checking that only devices

your lovely devices has been hacked it

extracting at that specific device from
your network it also notifies you
through a notification on the Akita app
