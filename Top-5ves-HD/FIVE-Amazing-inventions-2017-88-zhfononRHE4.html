expensive in the market while the cheap
one has very poor quality so we want to

Oh
when I was seven my father brought me to
the family show factor pretty much the
same way his own people from sixty years
ago and so on regeneration my family
told the modern history of shoemaking
the sports allow the collective memory
and that was my start of the lifelong
obsession defining the fastest drama
shows has the corner sport of explode it
is my arena my wishes to make it
possible to push boundaries and break
records to make people run from or long
or Empire a dream for a tweet can make
all the difference for everyone setting
out to run faster than they ever did
today it's easy to make better show than
a terrible new high-tech materials new
production techniques and new ways to
threaten prototype make way for new
ideas and innovation this is the area
rule the most comfortable and false its
rating that I am a combined four factors
that increase running speed for the wall
lightly we have stripped away all
unnecessary stuff resulting in the show
weighing only 129 grand 4.5 hours factor
too much energy return
a new also material the maximum energy
in turn from every strategy 423 area
biased refined Oliver dropped of the
absurd to guide the foot on the ground
from impacts to the powerful tool
for great comfort we have focused on
every detail to create a seamless and
comfortable show giving it forth and
massive feeling when running and our
test runner have agreed since the area
rule is designed for a pretty exclusive
group of runners it will never find its
way to distortion that's the reason to
be here on Kickstarter thanks for
watching and happy 4th running to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
