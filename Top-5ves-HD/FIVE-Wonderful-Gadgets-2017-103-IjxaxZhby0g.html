taking a shower and eating are part of
our everyday routine but uncontrolled
hand or arm twists bends or movements
that may be related to conditions such
as cerebral palsy spinal cord injury
Huntington's disease Parkinson's disease
or post stroke deficits can make these
activities frustrating and stressful
experiences working with patient
advocates and their families
the liftware team developed a new
technology to make the various tasks of
daily living second nature again we
started with empowering our users to
once again feed themselves with ease the
liftware level is an electronic handle
that recognizes what position your hand
is in at all times and works to
counteract any unwanted movements so
that you can relax and enjoy the company
of those around you instead of worrying
about the task at hand the lift where
level starter kit includes the leveling
handle with a hand strap a soup spoon
attachment and a charging cord charging
the level is easy simply plug the
charging cord into a USB outlet remove
the attachment on the handle and connect
the handle to the cord
when you eat with the lift we're level
you can focus on the best parts of
dining we can't wait to bring lift we're
level to you or your loved ones there is
nothing that excites the senses like
hearing our loved ones the music we
enjoy every day the messages we
communicate to each other the rhythm of
the neighborhood we live in or the
sounds of nature when we seek solitude
unfortunately according to the World
Health Organization over 350 million
people suffer from disabling hearing
loss in the US alone there are over 40
million with hearing loss and the vast
majority can benefit from using a
hearing aid but only one in five
actually use one hearing loss can occur
due to exposure to loud sounds or to
aging as we lose our hearing sounds
become muffled and words need to be
repeated especially in noisy
environments the quality of life
degrades as we continue to lose our
hearings
hearing aids can be outrageously
expensive an average hearing aid cost
$1,700 and most people needed pair
it's simply unaffordable for most you
can pay less than $500 for a laptop
computer so why should you pay much more
for a hearing aid that has far fewer
components and features my name is Adnan
shanab I'm the founder and CEO of I hear
medical I am a biomedical engineer with
passion for applying technology to
hearing solutions I have been inventing
and developing advanced hearing devices
in Silicon Valley for over 20 years
unfortunately the advanced products we
have developed in the past simply never
reach the majority of people who need
them so we started I hear Medical to
remove the barriers preventing people
from getting high quality hearing
devices and here's how we did this we
invented a highly miniaturized hearing
device that discretely inside the ear
canal the modular design allows the user
to customize the fit in less than them
secondly we invented a USB device that
enables you to test your hearing ability
at home and also to electronically
calibrate the hearing device according
to your hearing loss and preferences
thirdly we developed innovative online
tools which empower the consumer to
manage the entire fitting process of a
convenient to their home the unique
online process dramatically cuts down on
the cost of delivering an advanced
hearing device our discreet in-ear
hearing device has been clinically
tested with impressive results in sound
quality and inconspicuous where I hear
the fluorescent lights
I hear the computers I hear your watch I
hear everything best of all the I hear
device cost as little as a hundred and
ninety nine dollars I'm one of those
guys that grew up in a working poor
family and therefore we couldn't afford
hearing aids and so I'm excited the fact
that this is going to be something that
your average consumer can afford our
mission is to create advanced hearing
devices that are affordable and
accessible beyond that we want to
provide the gift of hearing for everyone
this is why we created the hearing for
all initiative to donate a hearing aid
for every I hear device you purchase
help us provide here and for all by
ordering one of our products for
yourself or for a loved one who suffers
from hearing loss or by contributing to
our hearing for all campaign thank you
for your support

turned bizarre for a man in his dog
