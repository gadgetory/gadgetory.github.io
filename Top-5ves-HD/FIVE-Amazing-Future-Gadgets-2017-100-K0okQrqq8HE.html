not us with a doubt to devolve the
smallest lightest most convenient urban
transport we could meet loom a new kind
of electric skateboard our Swiss
engineering team wanted to create a
short boat egg little indistinguishable
from a non power board which thinks near
perfect design for both fun and
transportation it's been like and simple
it exactly does what it's supposed to do
whether crossing the street or in the
park
hey but don't be afraid to skate hard
the robot you spend a truck and 83
million deaths impact observant
polyurethane skate wheel with one
important difference there's two 1.5
kilo watt motor impaired driving them to
user control speed over 35 kilometres
per hour and traveled over and
emotionally we took special care
designing a wireless hammer circle for
acceleration and braking have any
unnecessary decoration yes we are with a
cross title on dragons and company's
origin on functional side and have a
little food great human twist stability
let's face it getting it's more fun than
fighting and lot more community no need
to waste time looking for a local spot
nothing happy to help the reward is
really small it small enough for Aaron
commuted like me to take away train our
University
carbon fiber shell and we're more
durable than any one segment
it keeps the bark to the last or
detected sensitive electronics and both
of the adventurer insight
you
if our manufacturer line up we have
hours nobody can push me o'clock in
place and most importantly and family
you'll never look at Alba travel the
same way again and we are here to raise
$80,000 so we can put liubot on the
street of every city in the world the
lionfish has invaded the Atlantic Ocean
they can devour marine creatures up to
half their own size and they feed
indiscriminately decimating the
biodiversity on coral reefs lionfish are
out reading out competing and out living
native fish if nothing is done the
lionfish will decimate fisheries and
play a role in the destruction of coral
reefs throughout all warm waters in the
Atlantic having no natural predators we
engineered a guardian The Guardian lf1
underwater robot remotely operated the
Guardian lf1 is designed to capture many
lionfish in deep water quickly and
safely when in range of its target the
fish is momentarily stunned and is
sucked into the chamber securing the
fish once full the robot goes back to
the surface where the catch can be
brought to market many thousands of
people have eaten lionfish and hundreds
of restaurants serve lionfish on their
menus in dozens of ways every day robots
in service of the environment is on a
mission
we are in the Han profit organization
focused on deploying low-cost robots to
solve environmental problems controlling
the lionfish invasion is our first
mission it's designed to be deployed at
scale to stun and capture lionfish and
help reduce the population of this
incredibly terrible invasive species
The Guardian lf1 is on the way but in
order for it to span the seas we need to
assemble a greater guardian force by
backing our campaign you will be
contributing to the production and
distribution of the Guardian robot
allowing it to succeed in its mission of
guarding our fragile planet
you
Oh
you
No
hey neighbor just wanted to drop by did
you date sir tonight the Richard on
watch introducing not the world's
adjustable here in control they like
what you hear turn it down
want to hear more turn it where the ball
is not is a solid and patent-pending
design that evolves around the concept
of a revolutionary volume adjustment
system with step one you can hear
everything crystal-clear at full volume
step two is perfect for slightly noisy
environments step three has a
state-of-the-art acoustic music filter
with step four you can totally isolate
yourself from your environment hearing
damage is irreversible not takes care of
your is not just developed by a young
startup college based in Amsterdam two
of them quenon Quinten already have a
successful ear protection company course
Thunder plug which is sold in a whopping
26 countries worldwide the other
creative masterminds are Arjen and
Richard through add cutting-edge
innovation and design into the mix
together they form the creative backbone
of not an analogue adjustable hearing
solution that is adaptable to every
situation from concert to exam from
festivals to construction work Knox will
be available in various colors in terms
to perfectly suit your own style not
control your volume
