are defined by climate maybe you are too
hot on a summer's day and wish you could
take all your clothes off or perhaps you
were too cold during winter and can't
even send a text because your hands are
too shaky from shivery or how about
having this dreaded night sweats and you
can't turn on the air-conditioner or a/c
because your wife has cold feet what is
one to do introducing that aircon watch
the aircon watch is a new revolutionary
product that will allow you to get that
much-needed thermal satisfaction without
disturbing the soul you can warm
yourself up or cool yourself down even
if you are out in the scorching Sun or
in a frigid winter's night doing any
outdoor activity most times depends on
the temperature and the climate on the
other hand being inside all depends and
if your heater or air conditioner is on
in using up electricity the aircon watch
offers the convenience that you need by
freeing you from an energy wasting air
conditioner but never limiting you to
the outside temperature and all within
the form of a small watch the human body
has a natural body temperature of 98.6
degrees fahrenheit but depending on the
weather and external temperature our
body responds by sending a signal to the
nervous system whereby the brain
receives the signal which gives the
sensation that we are feeling at that
exact moment
but what if we could change the signal
that our nervous system sends to the
brain by using the aircon watch to
generate pulses of heat or cold by this
method we can trick our brain into
thinking the beer cooler or warmer than
we really are
the secret is in the straps it contains
a small device that has within an hour
climb akan technology this tiny device
will fit on the inner wrist in an area
where the nerves are closer to the skin
surface so as to allow for maximum
transfer of temperature the watch can be
used during any temperature any season
or any time zone if you suffer from
night sweats you can now finally have a
cozy night if you like climbing or
outdoor photography aircon Watchmen
could be your best friend but one of the
reasons why we developed this product
was to help women during menopause
menopause often has hot flashes which
can be extremely annoying to the extent
where it becomes painful but what if you
could get some relief from small device
that emits a soothing pool temperature
the aircon watch has been tested with
more than a hundred people and using
several prototypes our experienced
design team has worked for more than two
years in research and development to
improve aircon watch and reach the
design and level that we are at today
global warming is gradually destroying
the Earth's entire ecosystem so why not
turn that a/c off and turn on the aircon
watch it most definitely will help keep
your pocket fuller and your body cooler
introducing the last socks you'll ever
need every pair lasts up to a week
before washing so you'll never need to
hunt for matching socks again they're
perfectly designed to slip on in seconds
which will tick off another unnecessary
choice and speed up your morning lending
the finest cotton with pure silver we
crafted the most comfortable
anti-itch socks using specially designed
temperature regulating mesh your feet
won't be seeking a patch of carpet to
close out on featuring cleverly placed
heel grips you will be needing to pull
your socks up every two minutes the
all-around elastic ensures your sweaty
feet don't slip around inside your shoes
and you stay on top performance
featuring pure silver the socks destroy
bacteria on your feet leaving them fresh
for everyone snows
getting ready for the next day could be
easier just whip off your socks and put
the back of the drawer ready for
tomorrow be clothed live life better
hello Kickstarter
I'm Nathan Miller founder of backcountry
Navigator my mission making outdoor
navigation easy and accessible to anyone
with a smartphone even without cell
coverage for the past six years that
country Navigator has been a companion
on countless outdoor adventures through
deserts up mountains and across lakes
from weekend hikes to the Pacific Crest
Trail and beyond today I'm planning a
new adventure a brand new platform with
a mountain of improvements
backcountry Navigator XE is my vision
for the future of mobile outdoor
navigation software and I've come to
Kickstarter to ask for your help in
making that vision a reality
until now the f has only been available
on Android so the biggest change is to
make backcountry navigator XE available
on iOS and the web as well using the
cloud editor planning for your next
great adventure can begin on the web
plotting your points of interest in
routes and previewing available maps on
a larger screen with more improvements a
wide selection of maps and more overlays
than ever before
whatever your adventure we've got you
covered help me bring backcountry
navigator XE to life and create the
world's best multi-platform outdoor
navigation software by backing this
project today thank you for listening
and see you in the outdoors
if sound was raw material
how could it be transformed
could it be prepared conditioned
carved and chiseled into shape all rough
edges smooth textures refined until it's
no longer just sound it's an acoustic
masterpiece introducing 360 ear buds a
brand new mechanical approach to earbud
technology that will change the
landscape of portable sound forever
maybe headphones aren't supposed to be
high-frequency driver right next to your
ear maybe they're supposed to be an
acoustic chamber which imitates a room
and then those high frequencies are not
assaulting your eardrums they're bathed
in early reflections and a natural
balance is established you feel the
space you know you can reach into it the
sound that comes out of these bugs
that's really terrific I thought it
sounded amazing actually I like to hear
at depth when I'm listening to something
this this makes me think it's the
direction of how headphones will be
built in the future the sound is shaped
in a three cavity acoustic chamber
giving three-sixty earbuds an incredible
virtual 5.1 channel surround sound
they're using some of the same
technology that binaural recording uses
and that is the way that we record 360
with just two microphones in stereo the
front Kennedy first of its kind contains
a patented specially constructed
frequency divider shaping and filtering
the sound through five carefully
calibrated channels because of this
they're capable of reproducing sounds in
three dimensions much more accurately
than stereo it's sound that takes you
away
put you there even if you're travelling
somewhere else you're focused you're
deep in 360 degrees all around you an
audio escape from reality the bottom of
human hearing is 20 or 30 Hertz that's
really where the deep Rumble is and
below that you're just moving air
pressure you can't hear it but you can
feel it
low and infrasonic frequencies get
pumped into a resonator back cavity
creating a new type of in ear sub woofer
that's what sub frequencies are all
about they're not only heard but they
felt they can vibrate things they can
move things you can feel it in your body
it's the same premium bass response you
get at the movies I get a lot of bottom
but it's not a large muddy bottom this
clarity in it the end of cavity refines
the sound lined with a viscoelastic
material and engineered to suppress
unwanted reflections and diffraction it
provides astonishing fidelity it's
always interesting to listen to the
stuff that you've worked on that you
know intimately very familiar with every
aspect of it because I've produced it
and I was able to hear certain things of
the way it was mixed that the engineer
did on the snare on a particular track
and I'm looking for something that's
natural that reproduces what I know is
good music from even my own recordings
and if it can produce this and it gives
me that sound I know they're great and
these are it's very exciting because as
a mixer if I knew that people were
wearing headphones like this I would
just mix through the speakers and know
that it's going to sound the same or
better it's an advanced mechanically
engineered approach to earbud technology
never before used in any other earbud
giving you an artfully balanced sound
output and a virtual 5.1 channel
surround sound</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
