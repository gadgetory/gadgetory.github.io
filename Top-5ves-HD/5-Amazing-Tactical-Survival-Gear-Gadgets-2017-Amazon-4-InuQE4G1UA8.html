the first tactical specialist one-day
backpack the most important feature
compression straps on the side of the
backpack the web platform studied and
positioned so that the entire side of
the backpack can be highly used in the
very front of the bag a small amount of
web platform allows you to organize
those small pouches full velcro spots
for those Department patches small
zipper pocket perfect for gloves and
maps velcro name tape up on the pocket
they'll organize your pocket fully opens
small pockets for pins and tools larger

zipper pocket for all those important
documents so you know they're secure one
simple key hook and one deluxe key book
removable the main compartment zippers
up 180 degrees in the back panel for a
percent Velcro easy to line and put your
favorite velcro pouches in the lid to
easy to store vertical pockets and
towards the top a mesh pocket as you
move to the top of the bag the handle
reinforced allows you to carry those
bags that are heavy the same handle is
then used at the top of the shoulder
straps this is a yoke handle system it
keeps those shoulder straps in place
tied against the body so you don't get
those hot spots the shoulder straps
articulated fits the body perfectly a
sternum strap allows you to three places
to adjust and reposition small web
platform for smaller pouches and comms
this is a traditional buckle if this
buckle breaks you can take this piece
reposition it and you're in the field
again the elastic keeps the buckles
quiet in the field thumb loops for the
longer treks
keeps that weight off of your hands but
if you don't like the danglies then go
ahead and roll these up vertical and
horizontal venting arrow spacer mesh
keeps the body cool and on the shoulder
straps dual density closed cell foam
prevents the funk and moisture absorbing
at the very bottom waist belt tunnel
waist belt buckles and a pad in the high
abrasion areas and on the bottom of the
bag for compression loops for those bed
rolls two layers of fabric creates a
pocket so you can throw an extra foam
stash any flat items or perfect place
for that rain
why the zipper pulls on the main
compartment and the organizer pocket are
differentiated so that you can tell and
identify them in the dark as you move to
the back and easy to reach board the
holes allow you to outline it for any
damaged limbs on your body because of
the compression straps they outline
through these holes and the handles now
become an integral part as an avalanche
shovel or a paddle on a river on the
secondary compartment
unzip the two top zippers to reveal the
hook and hang through on the bottom
unzip to reveal the pass through take
the rifle sleeve start it get a firm
grip reposition and pull it all the way
through and the buckle move it up high
to protect the zipper don't forget to
fasten the hooks
hi my name is Glenn clucker this is my
son Nathan I've been a engineer and
designer and inventor for about 14 years
now and I've designed a lot of knives
and multi tools that you might be
familiar with I came up with the idea
for the clacks last year over the last
six months I've been designing
developing prototyping and testing out
the clocks to end up with the floor
versions that we have here today the
clacks is more than an axe the clacks is
a multi-tool built into the head of an
axe it has a lot of useful features
built-in carabiner jimping for your
thumb to hold on to bottle opener gut
hook axe blade which doubles as a Nuala
knife the knife blade lanyard hole
hammer with a built-in ruler five
wrenches and a hex bit dryer the clacks
has a lot of useful features like
wrenches hammer head and knife blade
along with our innovative new clamping
system that allows you to take the axe
to the field and be able to break it
down for easy transport
the clacks is useful for people who are
involved in hiking climbing camping
survival experts people who do bushcraft
all sorts of things including emergency
preparedness I'm Mike peal from Mike
Pihl logging Vernonia Oregon and I'm a
logger the clacks it's a great tool this
morning I used it to wedge over a
Douglas fir tree and it did a good job
this is a clacks lumberjack it's our
most popular model because it includes
all of the features this is the clacks
woodsman the clacks woodsman has the
clamping system carabiner hammer and
knife blade but the more rustic version
that we've created is called the clacks
feller the clacks feller attaches using
the paracord bracelet by pulling the
paracord out and wrapping it around the
handle like you would a tomahawk this is
the tie clacks
the tie clacks is a titanium version of
the clocks lumberjack it is our top of
the line model and it includes all of
the features plus it has blue anodized
highlights and it comes weighing in at
half of the weight of the feller that's
why the tie clacks is our top of the
line model
clacks thanks for watching we appreciate
your support kolaks
