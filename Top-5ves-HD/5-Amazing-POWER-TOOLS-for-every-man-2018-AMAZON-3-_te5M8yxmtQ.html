neck brushes primer pocket cleaners and
chamfer deeper accessories the swivel

Mike al Berger I work for younger
construction I'm Reed carpenter for them
now I have 35 years of experience a lot
of our homes are large in size so we end
up having to travel throughout the home
we use the cordless compressor it's
really nice where you can take it with
you and go upstairs
I'm Ted graves owner of Pleasant Hills
custom builders and I've been in this
business for about 20 years well the one
turn regulator made it easy to precisely
dial up the pressure or dial down
depending on what we're using it's a
real time-saver because we don't have to
go back and set high nails or worry
about nails that have gone all the way
through the material flexible is genius
it's a strong battery and it lasts a
long time and it's making our jobs
easier and actually more fun I've been
using the wall tool since I started and
I've been impressed ever since and every
time the new technology comes out I
follow it we've used that cordless
compressor for framing siding casing
crown the trim wainscoting flooring and
it's it's handled everything we've
thrown at it generally power is pretty
scarce on the jobsite so either you have
to run a long cord or you have to run
along bare hose and it's nice that
cordless compressor it's not taking up a
blood
a lot of times these slots are valuable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
