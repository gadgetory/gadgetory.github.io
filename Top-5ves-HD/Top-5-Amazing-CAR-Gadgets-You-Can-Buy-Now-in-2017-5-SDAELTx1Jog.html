campaign boyo connects your smartphone
to your car in your car to the cloud to
increase driver safety and convenience
all while you save money and help the
environment okay look boy if says we
saved a gallon of gas that's 20 pounds
of co2 as you'll see
voil uses its advanced capabilities to
create new and exciting driving
applications the voya was a small device
that plugs into the diagnostic port of
your car in the US every car since 1996
has this port usually located just
underneath the dashboard you can use the
VoIP mind where to connect boyo to your
car just plug it in and you're ready to
roll in some cars voya Wireless relays
can be used for fuel saving features and
to provide additional security
The Voice app and relays take less than
two minutes to install their
plug-and-play once boyo is connected you
can use the boyo app to lock and unlock
your doors and trunk there's also an
option to use auto key so that you can
automatically lock and unlock the car as
you walk away from or toward your
vehicle auto trunk mode can be used to
automatically pop the trunk the next
time you walk up to the car boyo
monitors a vehicle and sense an event
alert if the car is being driven
unsafely if there's an accident or the
car malfunctions alerts are sent via
email or SMS and include information on
the time location and vehicle condition
sooner or later we all face the dreaded
check engine light wouldn't it be nice
to know your car has a problem before
the warning light came on boyo
constantly scans your car for problems
using advanced diagnostic software if a
problem is detected boyo provides you
with more information and reference
codes on the problem unlike other
systems that only talk to a few of your
car's computers the Boyle app talks to
almost every computer in your car
and can read codes typically only seen
by your car dealer ever wonder where you
parked your car boyo can help just look
at your phone and boyo points the way
boyo adds an additional layer of
security to your car use the
immobilization feature to prevent the
car from starting unless the phone is in
the car or even to prevent the car from
starting between certain hours Eco start
allows the driver to control the engine
using the foot brake bring the car to a
complete stop make a slight press on the
brake and the engine shuts off slightly
release the brake and the engine
restarts and it all happens while I
Drive Boyle is developing the next
generation of mapping systems called
voir aware it automatically detects
hazardous driving conditions and places
an icon on the map for other drivers to
see alerts include anti-lock brakes

Maxo innovations ballpark can help you
park perfectly every time know exactly
where to stop your car to prevent damage
to your car or possessions installing

car somewhere you feel really uneasy
about but you really need to make it to
that meeting with a client

that sign there's a lot of unexpected
things that can happen to you and your
vehicle so don't you wish there was a
way to record 24/7 and be alerted when
the incident occurs Whalen's introduces
the secure 360 a camera that can monitor
and record a full 360 degree field of
view so you know what's happening in and
around your vehicle no matter where you
are when the camera sensors detect
motion impact or even a change in GPS
coordinates secure 360 will immediately
notify you through the mobile app and
simultaneously record video to the cloud
so here's how it works
the camera system actively scans the
perimeter of your vehicle using a suite
of advanced low-power sensors we've
combined radar a three axis
accelerometer as well as three axis gyro
for weeks of non-stop event detection
without draining your car battery the
secure 360 is designed for any vehicle
and every driver from the daily commuter
to rideshare services or families with
young drivers you can locate your car
quickly for the GPS map check in with an
elderly driver protect your driving
record
or catch a thief in the act so even if
this happens you'll have evidence to
provide authorities and your insurance
