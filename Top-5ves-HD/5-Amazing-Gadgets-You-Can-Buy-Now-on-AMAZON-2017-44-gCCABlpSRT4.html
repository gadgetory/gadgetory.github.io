the core is the most advanced wireless
speaker system ever developed five
digital signal processors allow us to
render the audio in a way that is
totally revolutionary you're getting
stereo sound from this one tiny little
box the convention right now is that for
true high-end listening you have to have
two speakers the core changes that you
can have one and it truly sounds like
tuned for a little box like this so
trade although imaging is very present
leveraging a combination of wave field
synthesis and beamforming allows us to
create an acoustic bubble in the room so
that the image stays stable no matter
where you're sitting you can almost see
each person in the band in the room with
you I can move my head around and the
location of the sound source remains
intact as if it was you know a hologram
there's no speaker that can do anything
like this
everything is smart but sound systems
aren't and this is the thing that we're
doing at mass fidelity is creating truly
smart sound systems if you have an NFC
enabled phone just touch the top of the
core and you're automatically connected
a high density battery gives the core a
solid 12 hour battery life the cores
built-in microphone allows you to
remotely answer calls without having to
touch your phone and if that phone is
about to die the cores USB connector
will recharge it for you the cores
control input makes it home automation
compat
in fact the core has all the inputs
you'll ever need any smart device will
work instantly via bluetooth hook up
your Apple TV to a pristine sound
quality to all of your favorite music
and video streaming services you can
even connect your turntable and
regardless of where the music is coming
from you can broadcast it and up to
eight rooms at once for the past 18
months we've been developing the core
with engineers and factories to make
sure that we can deliver it to you a
beautifully designed wireless speaker
that gives you true stereo sound for any
room in your house the core will be the
only wireless speaker you'll ever need
