have partnered to change the way you
think about impact protection at the
molecular level d3o technology activates
on impact to absorb and dissipate energy
upon impact d3o molecules lock on shock
before returning to their flexible state
the greater the impact the more d3o
molecules lock together and reduce peak
force at the speed of a hammer strike
d3o reduces peak force by 86 percent
compared to standard eb a phone and
dampens vibration to reduce hand fatigue
