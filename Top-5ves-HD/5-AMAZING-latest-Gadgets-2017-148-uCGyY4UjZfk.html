introducing the arrow SmartWatch with a
360 rotatable camera
with the camera right on the bezel you
can capture a selfie in one moment
twist then shoot a video in the next and
since you always have a camera on hand
you can snap a quick photo and upload it
without breaking your day and who wants
to carry a phone all the time keep your
hands-free and snap amazing shots on the
go but capturing high quality video and
audio on a small device can be a big
challenge at arrow we've created a high
def camera and microphone that fits
within a tiny footprint making it easy
to capture any moment at any time and in
stunning detail
this is the world's first SmartWatch
with a 360 rotatable camera era
and we should be come on we're here at
our digital analogue letterpress lab
United am bullet and i'm luis rosado i
wrote this book called change is good
and eric designed and dis printing
change is good is a work of passion and
love it's a story about a moment that
changed the world it's a modern story
one that's yet to be told and that needs
to be told in the 90s they were
uniformly young people with fire in
their eyes with big ideas in their heads
and the passion to make change happen
and so change is good is about those
people and their challenges and the
adventures that they have and
specifically it's about six people in
one week of the year 1998 when you came
to San Francisco you were coming into a
new world that just was not clear and
you had big ideas and big dreams in your
heart and you embrace the world of
uncertainty and wonder and out of that
experience came what we know today and
so looking at that moment I think it's
really important and it's really cool
for a lot of people to reconnect to
those people to that time
I asked Eric to help design changes good
and he's created just an incredibly
beautiful piece of art it's got black on
black cover
it's got die cuts it's got color end
paper it's got a bookmark ribbon it's
printed on heavy acid-free paper it's
got the most modern typefaces it's got a
cool colorful slip case in so many ways
it's just the best possible way to read
and one of the best books you can get in
the beginning of the 21st century we
wanted to combine the amazing how
publicly that comes off the computer
these days
using the PostScript description
language Jews and all this fantastic
type visitor people of design over time
that I can refine over the thousands of
a point or millimeter if it is slim I
can make it Etta I can put in my own
characters I can manipulate anything but
at the same time it still has to go on
to some sort of material but the reason
to appreciate what I had imagined it
whatare it's able to do in developing
this new technology is basically married
the advances that have occurred in
typography over the last thirty years to
the clear benefits of a letterpress in
terms of its black type and and sharp
forms impressed into the paper that's
used to carry those letters and the
whole package ends up being something
that is startlingly better
what we're used to seeing in in any kind
of work that we're likely to get we even
have to go and make our own ink because
you can't buy that to present a letter
for people today by ordinary offsetting
or rubber based ink and we need ink
that's a little like it's a little
harder that has more substance in it and
we have to have somebody make it and he
makes us small batches at a time we're
coming up against all these obstacles
only to learn to achieve what as the
core by a creative Wilson saying the the
magic of letterpress is the reflection
of light the well of the impression
meaning the letter goes into the paper
slightly very black and there's a little
edge whether the impression is and that
edge catches the light pockets so you
have a three dimensional field please
