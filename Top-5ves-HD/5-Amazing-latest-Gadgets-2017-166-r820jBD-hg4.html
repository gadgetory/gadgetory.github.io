hi I'm Michael you probably know how
challenging it is to have your
smartphone conveniently and firmly
mounted in your car there are lots of
phone holders available on the market
but they all have certain disadvantages
suction based phone holders often fall
off the windshield causing dangerous
distractions
also the obstruct road view which is why
they are legal in some countries and
more than half of the United States
dashboard based phone holders use the D
subs or screws damaging the dashboard
and their vent foam holders of short air
flow and hold your phone out of sight we
thought that would be a great idea to
develop a phone holder that does not
fall off the windshield does not
obstruct road view does not damage your
dashboard and does not block air vents a
phone holder that allows solid and fully
adjustable mounting of your smart phone
tablet or any other electronic device
allow me to introduce the extra the
ultimate car phone hold extra des is the
only phone holder that uses no suction
cups
no adhesives no clips no screws and take
seconds to install
the extra holds your phone at eye level
arm's length and allows you to position
it any way you like extra strong
magnetic grip only requires a steel
plate to be attached to your phone or
under your phone cover you can easily
attach rotate and detach your phone
using only one hand no need to use
another hand to pull or stretch any
clamps extra does so softly fixed
between the dashboard and the mirror
that it can easily hold the large tablet
or even a laptop which is great for
drivers operating delivery vehicles
taxis police or even military vehicles
you can even attach more than one
fixation on one extra and mount several
devices we have designed a fully
functional prototype of the extra which
is currently patent-pending we need your
support to bring the X rod to every
driver who is looking for the best foam
holder ever please back up the X rod and
please share this video with your family
and friends drive safely and use your
phone legally and hands-free mode while
driving
welcome it's an amazing final ladies and
gentlemen today will be the first day in
the second age of swimming in here two
stars in lane one Rachelle bird Blaine -
Daria - dog
in lane three serebro the Danish Olympic
swimmer and I was swimmers have to
choose their favorite goggle we know
most of the swing of the bat some
problems with their goggles during
Championships we all remember the
scandal with Phelps during the Olympic
final in 2008 for some strange reason
swim goggles are always one size fits
all something that daily causes
irritation and discomfort as for words
