my name is Roy I'm a photographer and I
love my gear I love the scratches
bruises and stories my gear carries I
love knowing how many clicks I need from
each lens for the perfect exposure my
gear is irreplaceable that's why I
created ear I see I had a nightmare
shoot where I didn't take my macro lens
and ended up losing a memory card full
of great pictures I'll never capture
again that's when I realized there had
to be a better way to manage my gear I
partnered up with yuliya she's a super
smart engineer together we created gear
I your gears commander-in-chief gear I
is a small device that stays in your bag
uses RFID to scan your bag from inside
and make sure all your gear is there
your eye tells you if all your gears
with you and if not what's missing okay
something is missing here I helps you
locate it and it's not just about what's
missing it's also about packing light
and only taking what you really need in
the gear I app you can create lists with
equipment you need for different types
of shooting dates and gear I will also
tell you if there's something in your
bag you won't be using today we chose to
use RFID stickers and tags because
there's no need to charge them and they
last for years they're also super
affordable and come in many shapes and
sizes so you can tag all of your gear
all of it gear I comes in two forms
either as a standalone device which you
just leave in your bag or as a phone
cover which doubles as a charger we've
created gear I for photographers but
it's really for anyone who cares about
their equipment from sound engineers to
make up artist and even travelers or
parents gear eyes the solution for any
worried mind pack light keep track of
your gear don't spend money on rhe
buying it and don't worry that's what
gear I is about so if you care for your
gear as much as we do help us fund gira
let's take care of our gear as much as
our gear takes care of us gear I
we're living in exciting times learning
so much more about what our bodies need
full rolling is emerging as a self-care
strategy of choice among active people
everywhere until now the primary feature
of most phone roles has been a flat
surface cylinder the problem is our
bodies aren't flat our bodies have
curves seeing so much room for
improvement I created something
completely new hi everyone I'm dr. K and
this is the Intel all the world's first
form-fitting foam roller in tell-alls
anatomic design contours to your natural
curves to reduce pain and increase
mobility in as little as 30 seconds in a
world increasingly dependent on
technology spinal problems have become
an epidemic because forward postures
cause chronic muscle strain and
accelerate degeneration the intelr
releases muscle tension and improve
spinal alignment in as little as 30
seconds it's also a great tool for post
exercise recovery but don't just take my
word for it here's what others have to
say my name is bas Rutten I'm an ex
mixed martial artist and it was actually
the first UFC heavyweight champion with
that profession a lot of injuries come I
have a bad neck I have bad knees and
tell you all helped me perfect with both
problems my name is dr. Eric blom i love
the intel arrived used it personally i
have my wife use it because it conforms
to my body it makes it easier and more
enjoyable for me to do the exercises and
to get the proper benefits from foam
rolling the vision of the intelligible
came to me one day because I realized
traditional foam rollers would never
reach the area's I needed them to with
the help of my friend dawn and my father
hovik both engineers we began by carving
out the spine zone we then created
concave surfaces we called the body
zones unlike traditional rollers the
spines own targets the muscles
surrounding the spine while protecting
the vertebrae perfect for your neck mid
and low back as our torsos and limbs
around the concave surface of the body's
own wrap around any part of your body
massaging more muscle area at every
moment of use with better control for
faster and more effective results the
story the intelligible needs I've always
been active and in the process of having
a lot of fun I've sustained quite a few
injuries particularly from surfing
during periods of recovery I became so
fascinated with a body that I chose a
career initially as a personal trainer
and then as a doctor of chiropractic
specializing in exercise rehab the
intelligent of the station of my 18
years of clinical experience helping
people just like you move better and
live better we've been taking feedback
for over two years from people just like
you we learned that some like it harder
and some like it softer so we created
the intellects we enhance the spine
track added sensory bumps texture for
better grip and we selected the most
durable foam available to bring you the
highest quality self care tool on the
market today this is where you come in
help us bring the benefits of the Intel
all to you by supporting our campaign as
a reward to our backers we're offering
the Intel role at a significant pre
market value we have a wide range of
perks including early bird specials
combo packages and volume discounts for
resellers you can also help us by
sharing our campaign with your friends
and family I'm passionate about
self-care because it affords us the
freedom to participate in the activities
we love with the people we love join the
Intel roll movement redefining
sustainable self-care to help you move
better and live better
I'm a hiker and with the little space I
have to carry stuff I want to be able to
remember moments like these forever
that's why the MySite 360 is the perfect
solution
the MySite 360 can capture everything in
beautiful for cash without needing a big
rig or heavy equipment to get stable
tots and if the trail gets bumpy or the
camera isn't in the right position the
MySite 360 keeps videos level than its
built-in calibration the horizon
optimization ensures level viewing and
make sure your viewing quality isn't
sacrificed by unexpected camera filters
stable calibration minimizes motion in
the light quality without the excess
weight flip
and it's water-resistant so the MySite
360 can capture the entire experience
rain or shine plus if you need to change
the position it only takes a second
when i get to a place with a great view
i know that the my site 360 is getting
the best quality photos and videos
on my way back I can start posting right
away the mine site 360 app uses
artificial intelligence to create a
feature called life blog which looks at
all the videos from my hike and stitches
the best parts of them together into one
clip that way I don't have to go through
hours of footage 5mg under of my high 60
I want to create a world first wearable
VR camera designed for all those
fanatics and we need your help to make
it a reality please visit our
Kickstarter page to learn more about my
side 360 and the score our campaign
