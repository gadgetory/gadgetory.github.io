control all of life's daily devices
with o6 your sense of touch allows you
to keep your eyes free all you need to
do is listen email one email from David
Wilson it says hi
I attach the design sketches this is
short notice but the meeting location
has changed to 992 harrow Street can you
make it action one reply yes no 15
minutes late
message sent action one reply action to
navigate to 992 harrow Street
use Oh six to browse and listen to apps
while on the go tweet from San Francisco
Giants it says fun fact every starter
has homer this week tweet from headline
news
it says scientists to launch microspace
craft at 20% is oh six can be used at
home or the office with gestures to
control any mobile application
and with an open API available to
developers you'll soon discover entirely
new ways to use oh six
play a podcast
yet oh six and free your eyes fermented
foods are some of the healthiest things
that we can feed our bodies and making
small batches in mason jars is an easy
and inexpensive way to try different
recipes and flavor combinations I'm Phil
Baron founder of Mason Tufts and we want
to make mason jar fermentation as simple
as possible with our collection of tools
that make fermenting your own foods easy
and convenient we're extremely excited
to introduce our newest product the
pickle pipe a one-piece silicone self
sealing and waterless airlock designed
specifically for wide mouth mason jars
allowing carbon dioxide to escape your
jar safely without allowing oxygen to
contaminate your ferment delivering mold
free and consistent fermented foods with
these the lacto fermentation process
produces carbon dioxide as a by-product
that is what you're seeing when your
ferment is bubbling airlocks perform the
all important function of venting that
carbon dioxide without allowing oxygen
to enter the Fermin if carbon dioxide
cannot escape it can build up and
actually call it the jar to explode an
exposure to oxygen is what causes mold
to spoil fermented foods the pickle pipe
is a bpa-free silicon disk with a
specialised one-way valve in the center
it can be placed on top of any wide
mouth mason jar and simply fasten to
place with any standard screw bent the
specialized valve only allows gas to
exit the jar once enough pressure built
up inside and it will never allow oxygen
or anything else to enter the jar
guaranteeing a consistent mold free
ferment every time here's how the pickle
pipe can make your next batch of
sauerkraut a breeze after shredding
salting and pounding your cabbage
packing into any wide mouth mason jar
weighed it down and screw the pickle
pipe into place with any standard screw
bin that's it there's no need to burp
your jars each day no need to fumble
with multi piece plastic airlocks that
are difficult to store clean and still
need to have their water levels
monitored every day there's no
maintenance required whatsoever with the
pickle pipe once you screw it on you can
forget about it for days
even weeks resting easy that you're
super foots inside are being looked
after
the low-profile design makes a snap to
store your jars in tight spaces and when
you're finished simply pop it in the
dishwasher and reuse it over and over
again there's nothing easier or more
convenient don't just take our word for
it here's what some industry experts had
to say about using the pickle pipe I
don't have any suggestions for
improvement as I had a great experience
with this fabulous super functional
fermenting tool the pickle pipe was
great easy to store and best of all
there was no brine bubbling out of the
jar such a simple idea your pickle pipe
is super simple and easy the pickle pipe
is the easiest and most intuitive
fermentation lid I've ever used
so join the experts and let the pickle
type of make your next batch the best
yet London now convinced estimator
it's the wrong boyo that's a pretty good
idea yeah
run bail is a wearable belt designed for
the urban runner politely let other
people know before you pass instead of

ring
by using brass for the Bell the sound is

run bail is made in Tokyo right down the
street from where we live we keep
production local
by using two pairs of soft silicon
inserts and having two sizes of the
rings run bail can fit up to six
different size
